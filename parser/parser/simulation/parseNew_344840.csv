												As someone who loved GSB 1 I just can't get behind this game.  The biggest problem I have with this game is the lack of modules/ships/races.  I had unlocked everything after the first few normal missions, and there just isn't much.  Unlike GSB 1, where there wasn't much in terms of ship class specialization, GSB 2 is all about specializing what a ship can do based on its size.  This means that each ship size only has a few different weapons/modules, and they all basically do the same thing.  Dreadnaughts, for example, have a handful of different laser and missle weapons they can use.  But the range is the same on just about every component, and the damage is very similar.  Ultimately your choice comes down to ""fire slightly faster or hit slightly harder"".  There also isn't really a good point defense option in the game either, but that doesn't really matter because missles are just basically slow beam weapons - they lack the range or damage or GSB 1 missles weapons.Like I said, GSB 2 predicates the game on specializing ships based on size.  Dreadnaughts are *supposed* to have a hard time killing fighters, which are supposed to be good at killing dreadnaughts, for example.  The idea behind this is you need a mix of fighters/destroyers/dreadnaughts to have a viable fleet.  In practice this specialization doesn't work.  Fighters can't damage dreadnaught shields or armor, and dreadnaughts have access to tractor beams which allow them to kill fighters.  Destroyers meanwhile, which are supposed to be the anti-fighter ship, arn't amazing at killing fighters because destroyers are quite fragile and, unlike dreadnaughts, fighters actually can kill destroyers quite quickly.  The AI is kind of stupid and ignores destroyers with its fighters, but that doesn't fix the underlying problem.  Ultimately, I found that a fleet composed of dreadnaughts, each of which had two tractor beams, could easily beat all of the normal and hard missions in the game.  The absolute lack of components makes this a very boring strategy, as just about every ship of a given class is going to look almost identical to any other ship of that class regardless of how you try to build it.I was also dissapointed with the other races.  The game ships with 4, the basic terran race you get at the start and the 3 other races that you have more than enough points to unlock after the tutorial mission (along with just about every component, seriously I know I said this before but I think I had unlocked literally everything by mission 4).  I don't get what the benefit of the other races over the terran race is.  They all appear to be the same - focused very heavily on armor with 1 or 2 exclusive components that arn't really any different from the basic components.  One thing I really liked about GSB 1 was that the races were quite distinct, but GSB 2 is just really lacking in that area.  All in all, the game is dissapointing.  I see what they were going for design wise - trying to force you to make more complicated fleet and ship designs by hyper specializing each ship class.  However, their implementation of that fell flat on its face and, in practice, all it has led to is a very simplified, very boring version of GSB 1.			"

 EDIT As of a few days ago, the dev said ""♥♥♥♥ you"" to us, and gave up on GSB2  http://www.pcgamer.com/gratuitous-space-battles-2-developer-is-moving-on/?ns_campaign=article-feed&amp;ns_mchannel=ref&amp;ns_source=steam&amp;ns_linkname=0&amp;ns_fee=0 This game will no longer be updated, and the huge issues will NOT be fixed because the Dev has victimized himself.Stay far away from this game.Read my old review for just a few of the problems this game has in it's current state. If you feel you can get past all that, and are a huge GSB fan, then go right ahead and buy this. Otherwise, don't fuel this Dev's pity part he's thrown for himself.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I'll start off by saying I loved GSB 1, and it's sister game GTB. The series has such a unique sense of humor. I don't really like strategy games, but I love these games.That being said, I am heavily disappointed by this game. It honestly feels like it should be an early access game, as so many things are unfinished. List of just some of the things I encountered in only 45 minutes of gameplay:-Horrid ship design feature, incredibly flustrating to deal with, and some ships aren't even fully customizable, because they don't fit in the grid properly. -Weird UI, very confusing, especially for those who have never played GSB before. -I could literally see the code for the game through the explosions (which granted, look very nice).These are issues that should have been resolved before the game was even released, and if the developer really wanted to release the game in this state, he should have put it in early access. What makes this review even sadder to write, is that I can tell that there is a great game here, one that I would pour many hours into. If the developer steps up his game, and fixes all these issues, I'll change my review, but until then, I sadly cannot recommend this game.			"

												Do not buy this game. The developer is no longer supporting it and the game is full of major technical issues such as a ~50% chance to crash to desktop when entering a battle.The campaign is a joke and much of the balance of the game is flat out broken. Missiles are amazing OP and plenty of modules are simply bad with no reason to ever use them.People who preordered this game expecting it to be an upgrade to GSB are left screwed while the DEV is busy posting on his blog about how WE are the bad guys for asking that he keep working on this game and at least fix the absurdly common crashes.And I'm now banned from the forum:http://imgur.com/EHeuM6YSteer clear of this bad game from an unethical developer.

												This feels like a DLC.....I really like GSB-1, this update does not seem to include a great deal in the way of game play improvements and is instead a graphics engine update from what I can see.  Don't get me wrong the the graphics are very nice but I was expecting more than eye candy improvements, for example an expanded galaxy events system, more missions, bigger maps, more ship options etc.  I really can't see a great deal of difference at all and I feel really very cheated out of my 27$ :(  I would wait for this to go on sale unless you REALLY want to paint your spaceships and see GSB-1 with extra GRX effects.   Disappointed :(			"

												Am a big fan of the first one, put hundreds of hours in and bought it on multiple platforms. This one sadly feels like even less of a game then the first one without its DLC. The ships are setup to be specified for certain roles which limits your designs out the gate. You'll unlock modules quickly within just a few hours of play, but they all feel very similar to each other to the point that it's not interesting or rewarding. The graphics are an improvement but the environment is so prominent it can be hard to tell what is going on with layers of asteroids, debris and smoke obscuring your view.The parts in the game description about ship design, are all COSMETIC. For the cost, and especially in comparison to GSB1 this is not worth it.			"

												UPDATE 04-07-15 : I wish to redact ""eye-watering"" level of bugs - en lieu: ""massive congestive heart attack""... I do love the ideas in this game, it's one of the few I have on my Mac, I spent hours designing ships, however I can ignore its terminal cancer no longer...This game has so much potential, but it is like the grand ship rusting on the ocean floor for a ha'porth of tar... The developer(s) have been so busy caught up in the far more creatively enjoyable process (for themselves as programmers and/or dreamers) of coming up with ideas for stuff to stick on deck: You know, metaphorical tennis courts, getting excited over the idea of having bubbles in the swimming pool... ...they ignored the icky obligation of rolling their sleeves up, going down into the hold, dutifully confronting that trivial issue of seawater flowing into the hold. Who needs bouyancy when you've got a disco ball in the dining hall...!This most recent update (1.35) has made this game *literally* unplayable, in the literal sense of course, that you cannot play this game because it's insta-crash...In the history of horrific crashes, this game is reminiscent of the Challenger shuttle disaster. I say that of course, only because the ISS has yet to fall out of the sky onto a city full of children and puppies. If it did, I'd say it was more like that... (if it happened over and over...)...I said to people before: It's going to be okay, they'll fix it. Hold off until then.I think now however the: ""It's [you're] going to be okay"" is sounding like Harvey Keitel in that bloody car scene in Reservoir Dogs......You'll not be pleased..Old version:There's a pretty eye-watering number of bugs if you're playing the Mac version of this, can't speak for the PC version. I only had it running for 30 seconds and in that time I discovered some of the graphical options disable the controls interface, the ship design starts producing transparencies when you duplicate items and there are some really odd resolution and framerate issues.Hopefully it'll start getting patched however I think there's been some disregard as far as the Mac port - perhaps it was the rush to get finished. Hold off until it's patched - you can't sign onto stuff that's half-finished. The first game when I got it had the benefit of a number of fixes so hopefully it's just spending some time fixing stuff.			"

A gratuitous sequel or a gratuitously tough act to follow?Gratuitous Space Battles was always going to be a tricky one to follow, it was lightning in a bottle, a game where you sat back and enjoyed a cold or hot drink as fleets you carefully designed smashed into each other for your entertainment. It had the benefit of many years of polish, expansion, and even a full on 4X-lite mode which allowed you to involve yourself and lose yourself in a campaign based around those massive, wonderful battles. It's a game with a very unique premise and therefore making a sequel was always going to be a harsh one to follow up, because whatever was made, it was going to always be held up to not the ""initial release"" of GSB, which barely anyone remembers, but the final, expansion laden version, which has so much more added to it. Extra races, game modes, everything.When the first game was so riveting, how do you go about improving the proverbial bicycle?So we come to the second iteration of Gratuitous Space Battles. It's called GSB 2 but frankly I'm going to look at it from a different angle and call it Gratuitous Space Battles ""Version 2"". What -should- have happened (and Cliffy is going to hate me for posting this) is that existing purchasers should have got an upgrade discount, a significant one, as a way of thanking them for their support and encouraging them to buy in to the new version of GSB. Financially it would not have been perhaps the best option, it's hard to say, but it would have been the most palatable option for the fans and would almost have certainly disarmed most of the initial complaints.It's important to understand that this is functionally GSB but effectively rebuilt from the ground up, it has a new combat engine with additional classes of ship, a much, much more powerful graphics engine which means that the combat in space looks orders of magnitude more pretty (this is something of a double edged sword for some). However, much like the initial release, it only has the basics behind it, the initial set of challenges, the initial races and building blocks for you to get creative with. The blocks are good, the graphics and layout is a major step up though, but it's very, very much GSB1 upgraded, and there's no escaping that fact.More no doubt is planned and will be added (indeed, custom battles are in, and more tools are being added into the ship creator screen), and Cliffy almost certainly will add a full fat singleplayer mode of some description (though it's unlikely to be an open ended 4X this time). But once again, we're back to GSB ""Version 2.0"" as opposed to say ""2.7.x"" with all the expansions and patches and balancing.So there is good news on the horizon, yes?Yes. I expect so, if previous games are anything to go by, this game will see a lot of post-release support, and a lot of extensions which will flesh out the game, solve the balancing, and over time refine a lot of the rough edges. Once the content is in and there's more meat on the bones, and the weapons are more balanced so they have their respective roles (along with the new ship classes), this will without doubt exceed GSB ""Version 1"", even with its' many expansions.But claiming it's a sequel and not an upgrade of the original is probably the mistake that's been made, even if it's a perceptive one, this is very much the new version, and it should have been treated as ""Gratuitous Space Battles 2.0"" and not a sequel. It's not, it's the GSB we all know and love, but it's had the work done to it that makes it worthy of a major revision change, and a major update fee for people who were on the 1.x branch. People who hadn't bought in should still be paying in sum, the full price and deservedly so, GSB remains a brilliant, wonderful gem of a game, one that hasn't aged much (and with GSB2, it has the potential to remain current for an awful lot longer), but perhaps this was one of those occasions where a bit more care for the existing customerbase would have paid off in the long run.A tough place to be for an indie dev.I respect the need for Indie Devs to put food on the plate, but I also know the market, I've spent most of the last decade watching, analysing and monitoring the market as it's shifted, like dunes of sand across the desert. As good as the game is, it's not a sequel, it's the new version of GSB, it's -good- for what it is, but it's still very much in it's infancy, and therefore at least until the rough edges have been sanded off, you may want to wait just a little longer. As much as it pains me to stand against Cliffy, because I've been one of his more positive supporters over time, I feel this time he misjudged the launch and the initial rollout. Nothing unfixable, but for now I'd suggest giving this game more time to mature.Update : Post release, where's the gravy?The game has been out now for quite some time, and this still remains a bitter pill for me to swallow, having been, and remaining a supporter of Positech's work. GSB2 has been a commercial misfire. The campaign as it is, is lackluster, and despite my repeated attempts to get a proper campaign structure put in, there was little interest in my suggestions. So what we have now is something that's barely functional and only adequate. There's STILL no significant post release content, even though there's been plenty of patch work and tweaking of balance (which still remains a bugbear, perhaps owing to the additional complexity of the game now with the additional ship classes and so on).I still believe it should be one to watch, and perhaps purchase at deep discount. But I cannot recommend this at full price as it stands. There's not enough here compared to it's infinitely richer predecessor, and prettier graphics alone don't cut it. Had Cliffy actually implemented a campaign worth a damn, then things might be a bit more promising, but right now? No dice. It seems right now his focus is on Democracy 3, which is probably for the best, as that is far more successful.Verdict : Wishlist it, and wait for a steep discount.Updated 4/10/15 "

It might crash because you alt-tabed.The game itself is great, so if you read this review and the game was patched to fix these issues consider this a thumbs up. But right now... this thing falls apart and half my gaming time has been spent rebuilding meticulously created ships and fleet orders that are lost because of random crashes or lost saves that flutter off into the aether.

												Gratuitous Space Battles 2 is a great concept for a game. I've never played GSB, so I can not compare the two.However, GSB2 is not a finished game (though it seems to have been released as such). Here is a short list of stuff that sort of points towards a beta:  - crashes every 30-60 minutes (version 1.28 which presumably fixed lots of crashes)  - occasionally has missing textures (you see white boxes in place of enemy ships or the battle map)  - UI is a complete mess  - eye candy takes up a lot of screen space while important info is very small)  - takes a lot of clicking and remembering to see which planets I've done on which difficulties for how much honor  - UI elements block stuff you need to manipulate (on planet selection, when setting ship orders, etc)  - it's hard to tell what is relevant information and what is not based on screen layouts  - forgetting to close a dialog box prevents you from doing anything else (could just auto close the dialog)  - balance seems to be off for all kinds of things, including prices, race/ship/module differences, etc.  - online high score tables already have ridiculous top results  - occasionally the AI wants to go huddle in a corner ""attacking""  - there is little reason to try to improve your score other than personal ambition  - only eleven missions (nine of which are available on three difficulty levels)  - battles became a lot more fun to watch once I disabled most of the ""extra fluff"" like asteroids, bloom, etc. from themI've had fun playing it, and I still want to play more, but my motivation is fading fast due to constantly having to fight game issues that should not be there.There is certainly value in there, but at it's current state (version 1.28) I can not recommend it, even though I've found it fun to play. Wait for a sale, wait for 3-5 patches, or just jump recklessly in. :)			"

												Best/only crashing simulator I've ever bought. Wait, what do you mean this is actually meant to be a game?I thought games were supposed to be playable more than half time.What? You want a real review? Ok then.First let me give you a bit of background. I bought the first Gratuitous Space Battles and all of the DLC's, I found it very fun, despite it being pretty simple and I liked the challenge of building and tweaking my fleets ships so that I was able to finish a level. When I heard that Positech were bringing out a sequal, I was pretty excited, I thought ""hey, the developer seems like a nice guy"" (this assumption came from contacting him via E-mail a couple of times due to problems with the game, including the previous downlod link expiring in which he seemed to care for his customers, maybe he did once) ""and the first game is prettty good, it can only get better right?"" (Oh how wrong I was). Two years down the line and GSB2 is no better than when it first launched, and the Developer has abbandoned it.I certainly won't be making the mistake of purchessing a positech game again.GSB 1 was good appart from the fact it spammed DLC's at us, at least you had a large amount of customisabilty and were able to create custom races and missions to suplement those that were already there, as well as this, you also had the galactic conquest and the online content that appeares in GSB 2.GSB 2 is just terrible, lacking a lot of content and polish with game mechanics that are somehow worse than the origional, combine this with limited customisation and the fact that other than the online features, you're pretty much stuck with the very limited and quite frankly poor content, combine this with the fact that it is buggier than the tropics and crashes more often than a glider with half a wing missing and you have a complete disaster of a game which was abandoned by the developer because it was a disaster.In short, GSB2 is yet another sad story of a small developer making a good game which becomes successful, but then the developer becomes greedy due to seeing the success of this first game. If you think you might like this, I would recommend going and getting GSB1 instead, it's better.			"

												I want to recommend this game, but sadly I can't. The gameplay has potential, but it's unbalanced, it favors a stupid strategy, and once you figure out your special fleet, it will beat all 10 levels, of which is basically the whole game. For $25, I spent about $2.50 per hour I paid, and you can find plenty of games where you'll get much more gameplay for your buck.It's got a ton of potential. It's super fun to design ships, use your energy/crew economy and try to figure out the most balanced and effective fleet to crush an opponent. But once you figure out the game, how the parts work, and spend a little time designing a really good ship, you'll beat the whole short game.I had a ton of fun at first. Then I realized that I could just create a fleet of my strongest ship and crush all the levels they have, and there are not many levels at all. You can fight in about 10 different scenarios, with a normal/hard/extreme difficulty, but once you made your special fleet, you can pretty much crush any of them. For me, that was just putting as many of my dreadnought class ships as I could. They had just a few anti-fighter (small ship) weapons, and tons of one type of missile. It destroyed everything on almost every map.And once you figure that one out, you can just rack up ""Honor"" which is used to unlock new parts, but they're not going to change the game too much.I want the game to be more balanced. I want to have to build a balanced fleet with specialized ships that heal my ships, special dog-fighters, destroyers that counter their destroyers, but it doesn't matter. All I need is my one dreadnought with all the missiles and it'll crush anything large or small.So, IMO, this game is a waste of money. It needs some massive changes for it to actually fulfill it's potential, and I don't think they're going to spend their time and change it that drastically. If your dreadnoughts can take care of all the little guys because their armor is too high to take any damage from them, why bother building small guys that won't be able to destroy their dreadnoughts? Just have more dreadnoughts than the enemy and you win.It's really too bad, because I was having a ton of fun until I figured that cheap move out. And either way, there's only about 10 levels to beat, and multiplayer consists of creating a fleet and letting people download it and fight it. It really doesn't add that much replayability.			"

												Gratuitous Space Battles was one of my favorite games a few years ago and the sequel most defninitely does not disappoint. Take the arcady pseudo-RTS fun of the first game and add a myriad of new parts and a vastly improved and detailed artistic style and add in some extra customization as frosting on top. I haven't played for long but this game still retains the style of the old game but with added content, so it seems rather self-evident that it will turn out to be a great title, especially with the potential for steam workshop mod support. For anyone who wants a stylish, fun, and admittedly mindless space RTS look no further.P.S. You can't spam shielded cruisers like in the first game, doesn't work 11/10			"

												There isn't really any other game like this. If you want to meticulously design your own spaceships, from fighters to juggernauts, and then pore over your battle strategy before engaging the enemy in a graphically sumptuous space battle, then this is the game for you!The ship editor is great and there are just so many weapons, armour and other bits and bobs you can apply to your ships. The battle sequences are incredibly detailed, you can zoom right in and see all the little explosions and hear all the sounds as well as clicking on the different ships to see their stats. The ships all have funny names too that remind me of ships in an Ian M Banks novel or something.Apparently it's highly moddable too. I haven't tried out the multiplayer stuff yet.			"

												The first Gratuitous Space Battles was a fun new idea that was executed well, and I generally support good solo or indie developers, but here's why I gave this one a thumbs down.1. GSB2 felt more like an expansion of that game than a brand new game2. This game crashes often - your number of crashes may vary, but one thing is for sure if you finish the campaign and individual battles - you've experienced a number of crashes along the way. In worst cases the game is unplayable, but for most it's a nuisance that should have been addressed by the developer.3. The developer has abandoned this game as ""unprofitable"". I don't begrudge him that, he needs to do what's best for him, but abandoning a game that crashes as often as this one does doesn't feel right. If the game were stable, I probably wouldn't include this comment in my review, but with the crashes it's another thing in the minus column.Overall GSB2 Rating:  4/10 Original GSB Overall Rating (when I played it a few years ago):  8/10 "

												Not fun, barely engaging, very glitchy. I've started a handful of games so far and all of them have ended in computer crashes. I play several high demand games and never have problems. The interface is less than usable for commands and battle setup. Not worth the money. Hoping to get a refund.			"

												Preface: GSB filled a very unique niche for me, and I appreciate the original for what it is.  I have literally grown up with video games, and I am critical of them because they are important to me.  I like this franchise.  Keep that in mind.GSB2 is immediately something of a letdown.  The first --UNQUESTIONABLE FIRST-- thing any sequel should ALWAYS be doing is refining its UI.  GSB suffered from a horribly primitive UI wherein the mouse hand performed 99% of the interaction.  Ten fingers plus only one point of input=a very inelegant interface.  A game with as many sliders, locations, and items to interact with on a constant basis as GSB absolutely DEMANDS a more fluid control scheme.GSB2, above all else, has not remedied the problems of the first game.  Aside from the formation shortcut shift+F (the only one I use on an absolutely constant basis) there are far too many inputs and interactions in dire need of shortcut buttons, hotkeys and less intervening mouse clicks to get things done.  There are so many forced, unneeded clicks to jump around that just moving from one screen to the one you want feels tedious.  The series of actions needed to navigate the menu are unbelievably clunky; I counted having to hit the 'main menu' button FOUR TIMES CONSECUTIVELY to get to the actual main menu from some screens.  Not cool, Positech.  We're about to hit 2016; you can do better than this.I highly recommend, indeed IMPLORE the devs to rethink the menu navigation and interface; there is no logical need for it to be this clunky.  Number crunchy though it may be, it's played by human beings, and needs to be designed for human hands.That said, I do still appreciate this sequel for what it is; more ways to build and blast tons of spaceships.  New weapon types, new support systems, more classes of ships, BIGGER ships, and generally just MORE of everything to like about the original.  If we can just get some efficiency, some human consideration, better conveyance and some elegance in design, GSB could go from cult favorite to mega-hit very, VERY quickly.			"

												This is the first time playing this game. I can see the concept of it but its a rushed game with SO MANY BUGS. WARNING if you can live with your game crashing at almost every turn this game is for you. For everyone else this game isn't ready. Its way to buggy. Little support. Not worth 24.99 - Ask for my money back. This is a good 99 cent game but thats about it. Also content is not there. Very short game.Besides that, I can see this as a good ALPHA! that has a lot of work to go in making it a real game.			"

												Did you really enjoy the original Gratuitous Space Battles? Well if you did, you are going to LOVE Gratuitous Space Battles II.


YouTube™ Video: Gratuitous Space Battles II ► Episode 6 ► *Release 1.23* - First Look at the Release Version! 

			Views: 4,443		

			Gratuitous Space Battles 2 Gameplay - Episode 6 - The day has finally arrived. GSB II has now been released on steam as version 1.23.		

I have been enjoying the Beta over the last few weeks and have finally had the chance to try the full release today (April 16, 2015). Without a doubt, GSB II is pretty much a remake of the original with a variety of new key features and graphical upgrades. It includes what the original base game included; A main campaign, with an assortment of ship variants and weapons immediately available to you. You will then design new ships, place them on the battlefield using a limited number of command points, then push the ""Fight"" button to watch your ships fight for your honor. If you win the fight, you can use any unspent command points to then purchase new weapons, devices, armors, shield systems, hulls, and even a brand new race to fight your future battles. All of this hasn't changed from the original. What has changed is:► The ability to fully customize your ships with the visual editor. I must say that it is pretty darned good. It's not perfect, but it does allow layers, lighting and even moving parts.► New command for your ships and fleets, including formations► New size classes► Amazing visuals► New modules and ship rules like fighter bays for carrier ships► online features like the ability to challenge your friends (I cannot verify this yet as I have not been able to test it yet)► Modding support at launch!Although I have experienced a couple crashes here and there even with the full release version 1.23, the game seems to run pretty well even at the max settings. That being said, it is really quite pretty and the sound track is amazing. This needs to have more content overall in order for it to become as relevant as the original. In particular I would like to see a strategic campaign like the original had added to it back in the day that allowed you manage your whole empires economy in a galactic conquest. Make that multiplayer somehow, and this would blow the roof off the pc. All in all, it’s fun and satisfying to watch your ships crush the enemy for what appears to be, no reason what-so-ever.Disclaimer: I have not been given anything in return for this review. I purchased the Beta from the GBS II website in February 2015.Fly safe!			"

There should be a penalty for when devs do this. Absolute garbage, I'd recommend staying clear of all of his work going forward...editAfter reporting to the dev what the problems were, I get this - You have been permanently banned from all Gratuitous Space Battles 2 discussions.You were banned by a Gratuitous Space Battles 2 developer.Reason: ""beinga♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;Shortly afterwards, the dev abandoned the game completely.. so you be the judge.

												If you have GSB1, dont bother to buy this second part. As simply as that. I am not going to mention the constant crashes of the game. But also what could make this title more interesting than the first part. Modding. There is much less modding support in GSB2 than GSB1. Yes, you read it right. Whats new about GSB2 that GSB didnt have? lets see, the design screen where you can add asthetics components to your ship. And the ability to play the game at bigger resolutions. And, hm yeah the steam mod store (only that 100% of those ""mods"" are not mods, just designs of the players using the in-game design feature... lol). Thats the difference between GSB2 and GSB1. So, dont even bother to buy GSB2, it is an advise. If someday the author decides to add support for full customized mods, then that will be another story, until then, not worthy at all.			"

												Well if you are fan of the original Gratuitous Space Battles you are gonna be dissapointed. It's not awful or anything, it's just not as good. For one thing you create your own ship designs, which sounds great but really it just makes it pointless to play as one race or another. So really despite the fact there is now thousands of different ship designs, none of them are remember. But the worst bit is that there is no galactic conquest campaign like in the first, just fan made online matches. So no despreate struggle fight to protect a planet with a rag-tag fleet  after a massive failed invasion or back and forth struggle for a key resource. Just preatitable battles that have zero consequnce for lossing.  So save your money and stick with first one.			"

												I loved the first game, almost beyond reason and sanity, so I hoped this game at least measured up to the first one. It hasn't, it has surpased it by leaps and bounds. You not only have control over the weapons and gear your ships take to battle, you have the ability to design their apperance. To some this may not be a big deal, but to me it adds a layer of creative fun. The weapons and gear are varied and have an impact on tactics that can be profound when correctly used. The battle commands given prior to launching your fleet are easy to use and familiar to any one who played the first version.One of the major changes is that Dreadnaughts are now part of the standard make up of the game. In the first game you had to download mods and go through the hoops to get them to work right, more about that later. Anyways, dreadnaughts make the game epic in scale that it might otherwise have lacked. There is nothing that says you have to use them, a small scrappy fleet can offer advantages over ponderous ships. There is a great deal of satisfaction though in seeing 3 or 4 heavy dreadnaughts glide through the debries of theri foes.Now, the mods. The first version had a healthy modding community and had tons of fun and crazy stuff. Battlestar Galactica, Star Wars, and Star Trek were mod favorites. There was also a ton of mod races that were fresh fromt the mind of their creators. The game was made for mods and it was part of its brilliance. I haven't tried playing around with modding this version yet, but if it is anything like the first game it is sure to get some amazing mods and great DLC expansions.			"

												i dont recommend this  because i feel like there's not enough in terms of new features or content to warrant the price at all; it feels more like GSB 1.5 than GSB 2. a visual upgrade in most cases.The ship editor is probably the biggest feature of GSB2 compared to GSB1 but that's probably it's only noteable one.There are differences between the two dont misunderstand me, but for the most part it's graphical changes rather than gameplay impacting. it still plays the same, build a bunch of ships, give them orders send them into battle! you've got a couple new toys to play with whiich is nice and its beautiful to look at and it's fun to watch but i didnt pay $25 for some very good looking explosions and laser beams. I was honestly expecting more content wise.In total the content is pretty much a dozen or so missions plus a ship editor. everything else is A LOT of user generated content to be honest, there are already dozens of ships in the workshop and a ton of challenges from other players to try out, but seriously? without the workshop or community there would just be a dozen missions and a ship editor.There's not even galactic conquest in the base game, this was DLC in GSB 1 and to be honest i expected it to be built right into GSB 2 since it added so much to the first game, but nope.TL;DR Overall...wait for it to go on sale, unless you were a die hard fan of the first one, there's just not enough content right now.

												Having been a fan of Gratuitous Space Battles 1, it was my hope that this new version would be a step forward.  Instead, sans a slightly prettier graphical appearance, it is essentially a step backward.  As the developer has abandoned this game, none of the existing issues such as occasional crashing will ever be addressed.  Though I truly enjoy GSB 1, I cannot say the same about GSB 2, which was for all intents and purposes, a large disapppointment.  Had development continued, there might have been a future for this game, but if one has any interest, I recommend purchasing GSB 1 instead.			"

												GSB2 improves upon nearly everything from GSB1.  If you're like me and you like watching some pew-pew and some boom-boom in space, you'll like Gratuitous Space Battles 2.  GSB2 is about the spectacle of watching fleets of spaceships blow each other up.  It is the best part of any sci-fi movie, turned into a game.That being said, I will now qualify my recommendation and address complaints I've seen others make.  While I do think GSB2 improves upon nearly everything from GSB1, it doesn't really CHANGE a whole lot.  Nothing is really new or revolutionary to the design, although almost everything is a step up.  And the complaints others have made about about crashing, or what feels like a lack of content, are legitimate, although it has more content than GSB1.  Like I said, there isn't a lot of NEW stuff, although basically everything has been improved.GSB2 is a much prettier game than 1, with better lighting, better looking explosions, better looking ships, customizable ship appearances, and better looking debris and backgrounds.  I did turn off asteroids because, while they look cool, they were ultimately distracting.  Because there are a lot more layers of things happening (debris, ships, asteroids, clouds, etc.) it can be difficult to understand the action at times, especially when you have the wreckage of dozens of ships slowly floating across your screen.  While everything has more detail, GSB1 looked cleaner, if that makes sense.GSB2 seems more balanced than 1.  I'm writing this review after having played all the way through the missions that come with the game, and I beat them all on normal.  Combined arms are now much more important.  Whereas in GSB1 I basically never used destroyers, they have now become an important part of every fleet, because fighters are now harder to deploy.  Fighters in GSB1 were OP; you could deploy as many of them as you wanted, limited only by pilot availability, and simply use them to overwhelm larger and more powerful fleets.  Now fighters have fuel, which limits their deployment time before they have to refuel, and they have to be assigned to a ""carrier"" (cruiser or dreadnought with appropriate module) and carriers have limited hangar space.  Overall I found fleet composition to be more challenging and thoughtful experience.Even in the few hours I've played, I have experienced a handful of crashes.  While the crashes were annoying, no progress was ever lost, and I was able to get back to where I was within seconds.  The game loads fast.  I think complaints about the crashing are COMPLETELY legitimate, but overall the crashing didn't detract from my experience.  I also experienced a saved fleet not being available to load.  It only effected me one time, because there was only one time I wanted to recycle my fleet composition and disposition, but it is still a problem (albiet one that didn't bother me too much).The one complaint I've seen that I don't quite understand are the complaints about a lack of campaign or strategic layer.  I mean I understand that people would like something like that... but... I mean it IS called GRATUITOUS Space Battles for a reason.  This game is about building fleets and watching them explode.  It delivers.GSB2 isn't a game I'm going to sit down a put 20 hours into all in one sitting, but it is a game I'll come back to from time to time over the next couple of years, just to fiddle around with ship designs, and to watch waves of missles smash their way through formations of spaceships.If you've never played GSB1, then this is a great place to get started as it offers the same joys as the first one, but more interesting challenges.  If you loved GSB1, as I did, I think GSB 2 offers plenty to like.			"

												Wonderful Game!  (the game is wonderful, my spelling however is atrocious but bare with me please)There are several new mechanics that help to freshen the atmosphere inside the hardened bunker that is you flagships war room.   Its a good thing too because after all the time I spent playing the original GSB my war room needs some airing out.  There are just a straight up bonkers amount of ship blueprints for players to work with and customize the loadouts on and now you can modify the appearance of them too (and the best part is you can modify them as mch as you like.  No little bar saying how much modifying your allowed to do leaving you with a half finished work of art.)There are also a number f new weapons systems and effects to keep everyone happy and an all new graphics engine to render said new shooty weapons and to make all the splody bits more appealing.  I will warn anyone reading this right now.  Dispite the light hearted review I am giving do not get this game if you are expecting to control anything other than the behavior of your ships (through orders and targeting orders)  One you make your fleet and give them all their marching papers you get to watch the fireworks.  I will say though in the original there was a ode added that let you control the ships so its not entirely impossible that this could be added later.  This is a strategists dream.I whole heartedly recomend this game to any strategy enthusiast.			"

												This is not a game for measuring your APM. This is for people who like to build stuff and customize stuff. I have spent over an hour on a single ship, swapping different modules in and out, trying to squeeze just the perfect amount of balance between power and speed and defenses and so forth. Then do the same thing for a ton of other ships, lay them out on the board, and watch them go to work.In a way you could think of it as a super flashy tower defense game - lay out all these different guns and boosts and defenses in such a way and then watch the enemy get ripped to shreds by them. Except it beats out TD games all hollow because as a bonus you also get to watch a bunch of awesome starships blasting each other apart. Price is more than fair and the developer has a good rep in the past of supporting with more content. Very recommend. Much wow.			"

												A fun game that lives up to its title - the battles feel big in scale and its fun watching huge lumbering capital ships crawl across the battlefield and unleash hell on smaller ships.

												This game is a mess.The tutorials are a complete broke, within the first five minutes I ran into problems. It expects you to follow their instructions to the letter, one slight deviation and it stops working. Half the time the are covering the thing it's telling you click. You can't move the window and if you close it it NEVER COMES BACK! You literally have to close the game, open some folders and delete a config file to reset the tutorials. Hope you didn't get a few hours in a miss a screen because you're gonna having to do it all over again. Not that it matter since the game does nothing to help explain the staggering amount of option, weapons, ships, etc. It tries to hold your hand when it comes to the UI but says nothing what anything actual does. The tooltips also do not explain anything, perhaps later it will but I'm not risking passing the two hour mark and not being able to get a refund.This is completely unacceptable, don't waste your money on this staggeringly amateurish attempt of a video game.

												The following are facts about this Gratuitous Space Battles 2.1. It crashes, but not so often the game is unplayable.2. The features which are new in GSB2 should have been a $5 - $15 DLC for the original game.3. The game looks like a reskin of the original. In many ways the original looked better.4. At $24 this game is not worth it. At $15 or less.....go crazy.Note as a fan: There is a new ship building feature, which is a bit broken, but awesome. The battles are big from the start and are changed a bit by some new items (weapons, defense, etc) and the new big a** Dreadnuaght class ships. This game is fun, but there just isn't enough new content here to make the game worth $24 fraking bucks!!! This game needs a couple serious updates and some cheap DLC to save it. Buy this game when it's on sale for $15 or less.			"

												I'm going to say that if you liked the first gasme you'll probably like the second. They should have waited another 2-4 months to release it, as there are a lot of UI, graphical and gameplay bugs right now. I'll probably shelve it for a few months and check back when the game gets fumigated for all the bugs. I'm also not convinced that $25 was the right price point, although I did buy it at that price. It does feel like they recycled a lot of content. The last game was DLC heavy, and I hope this doesn't end up being a cash grab. As it is, when the bugs are fixed it will be an enjoyable game.Conclusion: If you're a fan, grab it. If you're new to the game, wait a month or two. Maybe catch it on sale.even a 10-20% discount would make this well worth it and put it right at a more appropriate price point.			"

												**UPDATE** on review:  Up to ver.1.39 as of 8/7/15 and I've not crashed in a long time.  Those folks who had issues, should revisit the game.  The latest tweaks are mostly graphical re: shields.  I am updating this review to let people know the developer has consistently worked to fix bugs and add tweaks and even content, since the release.  If you were on the fence about this game, or you were initially disappointed with glitches, play the updated game with a fresh outlook and I think you be pleasantly pleased.--------This is not just a redo of GSB1.  The game improves the graphics and the game play is similar to the original in that you design each of your ships, select and put together your perfect combination of those ships, give each ship orders for battle contigencies and then watch it unfold!   Formations of ships, placement and orders given, all play a role in what happens in the battles.  That part is the same and even better than the original!!!  GSB 2 adds new ship categories including gunships, destroyers (support ships) and Dreadnaughts (aka: battleships).  The Dreadnaughts can also be outfitted to be carriers as well.  It all depends on your designs.  This is where GSB 2 really shines!  You can modify all defensive and offensive aspects as well as engines, crew cabins, targeting enhancements, etc.  Once you decide on your ship's functional pieces and parts, you can design the asthetic pieces by adding various wings, structures, vents, engines, antennae, and so much more!  Pick the color of your ship and/or each individual part.  You can add spinning, blinking, and glowing parts to your ships.  So MANY choices! --The possibilities are nearly endless.  The battle modes are fun with 3 different levels of difficulty.  If that is not enough action for you, then try my favorite part, the ""CHALLENGES""!  Face other players' fleets in asynchronous battles online.   The extra Steam workshop features push this game over the top.  If you are new to this, then the workshop can help you even more, being able to see what others are doing with their ships, etc.  I have spent many hours on the 1st game, the beta of this one, and will spend MANY more hours (much to the chagrin of my wife)  on this one!  This is NOT an arcade-style ACTION game.   It is not a 4X game.   It is an intellectual, planning and creative game that will provide hours of enjoyment as you try to build a better fleet than the game's or other players on the internet!			"

												First of all, I would like to mention that I have not played GSP1, this 'epilepsy' genre as I like to call it ;)GSP2 offers an experience that seems replayable for a very long time. By providing a fair few missions, each with 3 difficulties each, it seems that it may take a while to get bored of. After playing for a good 2 hours, I have already picked up what the basic concepts, you build and customise ships, deploy and give them orders, then watch the cluster**** after. After taking a look into GSP1, I can already see that there are HUGE graphical improvments, and lots more content. About the optimization, I can run the first three missions on max settings perfectly with a GTX 645  at 1920 x 1080 resolution (8Gb of RAM and an i5 4440 (OC'ed to 3.3GHz), so I can say it's quite good and may not require up to a 670. As for bugs, I haven't noticed any apart from the relatively frequent crashing, which is disapointing. I shall now hop into conclusion:Pros:~ Great 3D-style graphics~ A LOT of customization~ Plenty of community support~ Good looking multiplayer~ Days of replayability~ Blinding effects and visuals (not literally)~ Good mod supportCons:~ Crashing a lot~ Some visuals are low qualityOverall, the game is AMAZING and great for someone new to the GSB series (I see were the repetitive aspect from GSB1 player). The only problems are the ones listed and should be fixable. Rating = 9/10Kind regards - general223 "

												Edit:  In my original review, the only real complaint I had was the lack of the campaign mode that was present in the first game.  The most recent update has added what is being called 'campaign' mode, but this is a far cry from the original's campaign setup.  Linear, clunky, and an absolute disappointment to me; a player that craved/missed GSB1's campaign setup.			"

It's not a consistant crash until I get around 100,000 credit games but it becomes increasingly unstable as I go up. maybe if the developer got back to work on this it would be fine.			"

												I loved the first GSB, and bought GSB2 on day one.I quite enjoy the strategic challenges of building fleets that can counter what the game throws at you. The new challenge mode - where you can fight other player's fleets - means there's an almost unlimited set of challenges you can use.I also love that I can get ships from other players. GSB2 offers an incredibly detailed set of assets for customizing how your ship looks, and frankly I'm a bit too lazy to do much cosmetic fiddling. With the shared-ship option, I can get really pretty ships for my fleet, even if I end up customizing their gear.There are some bugs, but there's been a lot of progress in cleaning them up, and the core gameplay is pretty awesome.The one-man team behind GSB2 has made a gorgeous, intricate game that's well worth your money. Give it a try!			"

												I simply loved GSB 1, but this is not GSB 1. Bought it on sale based on my previous excperience with the company, and now regret my big two bucks. The game in its current state is almost unplayable because, as reported by many, it is chock-full'o'bugs. Nor is there any respite in view: The dev will not make updates and has abandonned all buyers to their chitinous doom. So go buy your favorite caffeinated beverage instead, you will enjoy it more and it will probably last almost as long. I was really looking forward to playing this, and the enraging, frustrating part of it is that it gives you just enough of a glimpse of what could have been to make your world even more frustrating. I'm already married - I didn't need more frustrations in my life.			"

												This game is like a really amazing piece of the ultimate 4x that was never made. On its own, what is here, just isn't fun enough. I think you'd really enjoy this game if you are the kind of person that would love to spend a lot of time making your own space design (or copying your favorite from S.F).  I'm not this person. I was hoping to get a lot of fun from the strategic design of the game. But that's not really there. I could go on and on, but this is just not that fun. And it's not balanced or complex enough to be a fun enough mechanic on its own. If this entire code base was sold to Stardock to put into Gal Civ 3, or incorporated into Free Orion, or even the barrest of meta-games incorporated into, would be worth playing.			"

The sound was definitely a step up though. Hard to recommend in its current state. Maybe somewhere down the line, the game will improve. For now, it's not really that great of a game.

Please note that I recommend this game mostly because I got it on sale for -75% off, at $3.75.TLDR: Well worth what I paid, get it on sale under $5 if you can.+ Graphics are beautiful.+ Battles are fun to watch and sometimes even exciting to see your ships barely pull through.+ Ship visual customization is wonderful, not quite on the level of SPORE but close.+ Online challenge matches (made by players) make for endless possibilities.- Weapons have very little difference, there are obvious bests.- Not enough different anomolies, there needs to be one that prevents use of missiles.- Frigates and fighters are rather useless and that shouldn't be the case.- Not nearly enough uniqueness between the races and different ship hulls of the same class.I enjoyed GSB1 and I also enjoyed this one.  I like the funny random ship named, I like the chatter during combat, I enjoy the minor amount of strategy involved.  I loved the updated graphics, the explosions are pretty.What I don't enjoy are the ship modules.  There's really only a few of them worth using and there are obvious bests and not really any strategy to making a good ship unless you run into a problem where there's an anomoly that prevents you from using one of the components you're using.  Multi warhead missiles is the only weapon you ever need which is ridiculous, a nuke if you feel like it, tons of armor, repairs, no shields are EVER needed and rarely useful.  You never really need engines either which is uh.. a bit unrealistic but whatever.  Engines shouldn't even be a module, they should just come on the ship.  There's one map that doesn't allow repair modules... that's the only one I had to make a new ship for really after my basic dread/cruiser/destroyer setups were made.On the note of ships all you really need to obliterate almost any map is a few dreads with tons of armor and repair systems and a few combat tractor beams to take out fighters.  Now there is one map where the enemy has a TON of fighters and this didn't work too well but other than that..  There's no point in frigates, none.  Fighters and Gunships (bigger fighters) are also completely unnecessary which is ridiculous and you only really need cruisers if you can't use dreads at that system and you build them just the same as you would a dread.I got about 9 hours out of the game before I had defeated every single battle map on normal, replayed a few several times over to see how little I could defeat it with and played through one shot of the ""campaign"" as they call it... which is a joke really because it's just like 6 battles in a row with the ships you set up for the first one. (minus any that die along the way)  A good bit of that time was spent designing ships (visually) as well which was fun, definitely a nice touch to the game.So in closing I'll say this.  It was well worth the money I paid for it, it's a beautiful game visually compared to the first and I did get a good amount of fun out of it for the money I spent.  This said there is some serious room for work here, the game feels unfinished in some ways.  I also had a lot of crashes on loading screens which thankfully only set me back like 10 seconds a piece at most.  If it crashed during combat or fleet setup or ship customization that would really suck but it didn't so I can't say the crashes were that bad.			"

												First off, this is a great game. I love the way things look, the customizability. So here is a list of pros and consPros:-Fancy lasers, and effects in general-Easy to learn.... ish, I didn't pay attention at all to the tutorial and I can get it. Not everyone will though...-Easy to spend a lot of time in-Customizability-Ability to dim out the background WHILE A BATTLE IS GOING!!!!! One of my favorite features-Decent textures-Small size in game filesCons:-Crashes, it crashes a lot.-I want to be able to zoom in more, and the textures seem to be dumbed down as the actual battle starts. Things dont look nearly as good as they did in the editor-The editor needs work, it needs to be able to be bigger, and some zoom  would be nice, and a little bit of fixing things snapping when they shouldnt when the grid is on, or moving away from where you put them.-5:4 ratio isn't supported, or the HUD really needs some fixing up-Did I mention Crashes?-Personally, I would like a little more control over the units and what they do.-Message box in battle is not able to be seen completely.Those are that then. Yes, I know this is a beta, but I have seen better alpha's, with less crashes, (Kerbal, and Space Engineers (you may disagree on the last one)) So if you are getting this game expecting a perfect experience, don't waste your money.  If you want this game because you like seeing, well Gratuitous Space Battles, then yes, you will love it even with the crashes.			"

												GSB2 stays true to the formula and plays almost exactly like the first one: go on missions, earn honor, unlock more stuff, rinse and repeat.  Fans of the first one will be happy to know that yes, you can customize your ships (you still can't build hulls from scratch) both in terms of modules and visuals.  You can also upload your designs to Steam Workshop.  My favorite part of GSB2 has to be the visuals...it's just pure eye candy when you see lasers and torpedoes shooting across the battlefield.  Easy to recommend to fans of the first one, though newcomers may want to try the first one (it's ten bucks cheaper as of 4/17/15) to see if the gameplay mechanics suits their interests.

												Let me get something clear.If you want to support the maker or didn't previously buy GSB 1, then this is a good game to pick up.Unfortunately, from a consumer standpoint this is not a good product.It is riddled with bugs in the form of crashes and audio problems. It's more of the same of GSB just updated.Features are lacking, the amount of missions for a €23 is too little. But, I spent 9 hours in this game.From that standpoint, it's quite good. It is more gratuitous, but the effects are a little underwhelming sometimes.However, for what it's worth, it's a good game if you can see past the problems.They'll be patched with time and hopefully, in time, the game will be more fleshed out as well.I wouldn't recommend it as it is now. I had fun with it, but in the current shape it's not for everyone.			"

												I totaly dig this game. I like to stare at things and think about them, I enjoy looking at small details and figuring out what they meen in the bigger picture. This game gives me the opportunity to do both. You spend time setting up your fleet and then you ""run the simulation"" and watch to see how well you did. While the simulation runs i like to see how each weapon is performing, and how the new power armor is doing vs the heavy armor, or whatever I tweaked last time. If you love the details this game is for you, but it is easy to pick up and play by 1st timers, although ppl often get bored waiting for the battels to end.			"

												So, I am a huge fan of space games. Mainly because they have so much room to expand and build fantastic and bizarre things. The thing about this game though is that the there is simply too much micro management for me. I love ships and space battles and for a little bit it was cool to watch what was happening in each battle. And as far as I am considered this game is not my cup of tea.Everything you need to know about this game is clearly posted in the title. Space? Check. Battles? Check. Gratuitous? Check. All of the depth is in building each ship. This game is comparible to a pool with a diving board sure there is a lot area but the only real depth to be found in one area.			"

												I loved GSB 1. I want to love GSB 2.Unfortunately GSB 2 is not what it should have been or could have been. 1. For a start, the game itself feels less polished than when GSB 1 was first released. It's hard to discern what's going on in battle and it's more of a cluttered mess than the first game. Also, in GSB1, each weapon had unique flavour text upon release and yet in GSB 2 many weapons share the same descriptions etc. The weapons currently in the game aren't even that varied or interesting and there aren't that many anyway, to be honest it's as if a bunch of weaponry has been reserved for future DLC releases. (I truly hope this isn't the case, it's a slap in the face for customers)2. The Crashes. Oh god, the crashes. My computer handles most games reasonably well, Fallout series (3 and Vegas) on Ultra etc. etc. yet even on low settings, GSB 2 keeps dying. I can only play the first two battlefields and even then only if I don't put too many units in. In larger scale engagements, the game will just crash mid-battle. Oh and if I lose (even on the small maps), the game freezes and I can't even use Task manager to shut it down. I have to log off from the Ctrl-Alt-Delete screen.3. Virtually no racial distinction. They feel like slight variations of the same ships. In GSB 1, choosing a race made a significant difference to the way the game was played and yet in GSB 2, all that really matters is your choice of fitting. The hull itself, and by extension the race, makes almost no difference. The only good feature at the moment is the visual customization... and that doesn't redeem the game. In its current state, for me at least, it's completely unplayable. For now I recommend not buying this game; it shouldn't have been released until it was ready.			"

												So far I like what they have added and who doesn't enjoy seeing ships blow up. That being said this game is seriously lacking. There is only a minor amount of ship specialization due to too few modules and weapons. Battle mode is all good and well but it needs something similar to the Campaign Mode for the original GSB. There are only 4 Races which leads to little versitility in combat styles leaving you wanting for something more. For now click the Follow button because this game isn't worth buying yet.			"

												in the first 3 minuets i understood the building and fighting mechanics. after the first hour the ""wow"" factor of the visuals had worn off. ten minuets later i stoped haveing fun as i realised that i had expereinced the whole game.  there is more stratagy in many many games. you have more ship customisation options in just about any space game i can think of.  FTL, Sword of the stars, galactic civ, star drive, endless space  ect. and the options you do have dont seem to do much or make muc diffrence.  the whole game is based around countering the enemies build in a sereies of matches that will take you two hours tops.  but there is no way to look at your opponants build, you cant see them equipped with armour and lazers and counter that with missiles and sheilds. you just have to guess and hope.  as a stratagy game this is crap. as a space ship design game, a dozen 4x's do it better, as a ""make two armies smash eachother and look cool"" game this is ok but any RTS will get you the same effect with a better payoff.  sins of a solar empire looks better, has bigger fights and is a good game.  that is all without talking about the crappy camera and poor controls for it.  the game has pretty fights but the camera is crap, you cant zoom out far enough, or in far enough and ships often move off screen where you simply cannot see them. there is alot of pretty stuff floating around the battle maps but it make the fight hard to see and in the game you need to see becuase the only info you get about the enemy is what you can observe in a battle.the game play loop is this:design som ships--> fight--> watch fight---> lose or win arbitrarily--) design some ships			"

												Ok I have spent many an hour playing the first GSB, I saw this was on Sale and thought why not,It is currently a bit buggy and crashes alot, the game randomly crashes mid battle, during screen transitions and saving.I have also had it delete ship designs after pressing lauch mission, resulting in ships missing from the battle.Ships sometimes bug out and get stuck on debris and cant advance.This game doesnt feel like a true sequel but a re-imagining of the first game, this ships all look to similar, apart from the semingly random bright colours, [ps there not random] you can re-paint them and change there look, but you won't.None of the first games add-on content is here [campain mode is builtin this time though] we get a few new chaissis, it has spangler graphics, which while kind of neat; make it difficult to make out everything that is going on, the neat animated backgrounds are extra bad for this.It has new damage type, Radiation, [good vs Hulls] Sheild Resitance no longer stacks :( Armour is now your best freind, its also a static number based on number of modules not what % of the ship components is armour, which is a welcome change.Also STUPID STEAM WORK SHOP INTERGGRATION,Stop asking me to Share every poxy ship design GAH!Onto the ShipsEach Type of Ship has some semi-unique roles it can fill, which is a blessing and a curse.1. Fighters,These work much the same as in the first game with the additional caveat that, they require a carrier and refuling, No more sending nothing but fighters, this time round, there is an increaced pilot cap, which is nice.Slap on a laser, engine, fuel and off we go to hunt the enemy fighters, just as before.1a, Gunships,New Class of fighter, with 2 weapon slots, [yes only 1 of the Fighters can mount 2 weapons] basicly slower more expensive fighters overall, which means they are nearly worthless. however;Both Fighter chassis get some ""sniper"" lasers which are useful against other fighters and gunships. which can mount 2, they also work on those pesky flak frigates.2. Frigates,Frigates were useable in GSB1 but fragile, here due to some odd behaviour with targeting, [enemy ships see to target correctly, your don't, so it seems] they tend to get focused down quick by fighters and there up-gunned pals, [Gunships]As a bonus the Frigates now have the fighter murdering Flak Cannon, which hits an area, easily capable of driving of entire squads of Fighters, but really, your own fighters do this duty better.They also get access to target painters and point defence [yes crusiers and above can't feild them]But is is unlikley you will feild these because;2a. Destroyers,Destroyers can do everything Frigates can, with the additional bonus of slightly better Armour, Sheilds, Point Defence selection and Smart Bombs [these do and area attack vs incoming missiles]Additional they can equip support beams, which can augment other ships Sheilds/Propultion or targeting, and an ECM beam which acts much like the Crusiers ECM missiles.3. Crusiers,The first big ship, and the first place you can feild fighters, not much to say really, these ships kill frigates, and destroyers easy, have access to tractor beams ECM bombs, sheild disruptor missiles, Cloak, holo-projector, and your first real weapon systems, bigger missile, big lasers. nuclear weapons.3a. Dreadnoughts,The Big bad boy of the group, focused on murdering anything that isnt fighter class, lacks all the support options from the crusier, has better sheilds and armour, and can cost 10,000 if decked out ""right""Also has access to the biggestest Lasers! and can carry fighters.Over all, it plays much like the first game. you will stick with a few designs and weapons you like, making special ships for some anomlies.TLDR:Play the First one instead,			"

Ships do not load in or out of battles, if i change any of the battle settings the game freaks out, and it has a tendency to crash....a lot. Ship creation needs work.All in all, wait a couple months before buying it. If  agame is not finished, don't release it.			"

												Unlike many other reviewers of this game, I have not played the first installment of this series.  That being said, I will present what I like and dislike about this game alone with no comparisons between GSB1 and GSB2, which I believe is more fair and unbiased.Pros:+ Good and easy user interface, which is very easy to use and understand+ Sound quality is surprisingly well done + Ship building mechanism is fun and also easy to use+ Space battles are graphically impressive and fun to watch+ Fun and challenging online community+ Plenty of unlockables and a nice variety of missions to play throughCons:- The game is prone to crashing.  It is the single biggest annoyance I have with this game.- The AI that commands your ships can't be controlled but you can set their target priorities before the battle.  Some people seem to dislike this but I think it works well in this game.- I personally would enjoy more of a serious campaign that has some story, but this game does not have that.- Fighters seem to be a bit overpowered in my opinion, as a few carriers with several wings of fighters can overwhelm almost anything including large capital ships. The game is quite enjoyable if you like watching your creations destroy and get destroyed in large quantities.  While I think that the twenty dollar price tag is a bit steep for most people, this game is very much worth the money if you wait for it to go on sale.  I have certainly got my money's worth out of it.  *IF the development team can fix the crashing issue,  I believe this game is well worth owning for gamers who want a relaxing space battle game.  As I said before, I haven't played the first game in this series, but having said that, this game has loads of features that I enjoy and that I believe are well done.			"

												If you liked the first title, you need to get this one. Many improvements on visuals and gameplay.The research system is very interesting and helps the game longevity/replayability.The ship design screen is also very well done, with many modules/weapons to choose from. You can spend days creating your favorite fleet :)			"

												If you're looking for a game with incredible replay value then GSB 2 is the game for you. Finding a way to beat a scenario with the smallest amount of ships possible is a nice challenge and one very satisfying once you get it right.The online challenges are a nice touch that guarantee way more content than you can ever play.

												If you like GSB1 you will probably like GSB 2.Alot of these nagative have 3 main points:-Its too expensive-There are bugs-Less content than GSB1Let me address them breifly.at time of writing this game cost me 15 euro a fair price this game is worth roughly 20 to 10 euro. (I belive the game cost 29 euro at launch or something?)In the short time I have played I have not encountered any bugs this may just be because I have not played for a huge amount of hours or because they have been patched.I bought this game late because well... I kinda expected things to go like this, people expecting this game to be better then GSB1 in every single way... and thats just unrealistic, GSB1 is a game that has had years worth of expansions added to it.What conviced me to write this review is that this game has a ""mixed"" rating on steam and while it may have deserved it at the start it certainly does not now.I for one actually perfer the balancing in this game over GSB1 in GSB1 you had so many options that alot of them became pointless, in this game you still have alot of options but they dont seem as redundant.To sum up again. worth the 15 euro if you liked the first one, and if you are interested in these kind of design your own fleet type games go for it, its a really solid game with it still being updated and all			"

I have always loved experimenting, and just being creative. The game is fairly easy on the normal setting, but you can increase the difficulty. I love the way of making your own designs, you have full control. If you loose a battle, you know you lost because you were bad, if you win it you were better.Just get this game, you will have fun. And I have not even touched custom battels yet. It is worth it.			"

												Cool game but hella short no story really just place units press start and hope you selected best fleet setup which you probably will I never lost a single battle vs AI not even as a noob so pretty easy really. (i thought it was anyways)Can create ships parts how they look colors weapons  so you could make some unique and wild looking stuff.After about 2 play throughs (not many different missions pretty much same thing over and over) it become repetitive and highly boring fast. So maybe best played casually rather than hardcore.This just for people that don't know nothing about this series nor did I you don't play this game just design ships place them start match and ai vs ai you sit back and watch it reminds me of the commercial in gtav where they talk about games that play themselves hahaIts worth playing but way way to short even for $10 buy it on sale for under $5 you really ain't getting much of a game. Think it was in humble bundle where i got it from or might just been from a sale over there I can't remeber.So i do recommend it but barely and not at full price. Might just be better buy first one like other's have said i read alot of reviews seems the better personally I doubt it much different probably same deal probably longer or something.			"

												I love this game, despite the fact that it crashes literally every 15 minutes (I can forgive this because it doesn't crash during a fight, and it also loads up super fast, meaning you're back in the game very quickly)GSB2 is, depending on how you play it, the successor to Battleships Forever, or a fun freeform puzzle game disguised as a shiny battle simulator.I play it in the first way. The ship designer is far more powerful this time around, with the ability to color and retexture every part (Yes, you can make your ships look like actual♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥using textures. Please don't do that. We're all ""mature"" ""adults"" here) as well as add modules to the game. Rotating bits and bobs, lights that actually flicker and die as the battle goes on, engine glow and contrails, it's a 2D ship designer's dream come true.I can also play it in the second way, which is as a puzzle game masquerading as a spaceship strategy game. Every fight is a puzzle, and many have unique gimmicks in the form of anomalies. In one battle, the enemy may have a lot of fighters and bombers, so destroyers with tractor beams and anti-fighter lasers are key. In the next battle, tractor beams don't work because of a technobablon particle flux wave, or whatever, so you need to plan accordingly. You can make your own puzzles too, with challenges and custom battles (also a little buggy).Buy this game. It's a great game, and knowing Mr. Harris, he's got DLC and expansion packs coming to make it even better. EDIT (No he does not, sadly)			"

												Wow what a disappointment !!The first GSB was incredible; that's the only reason i bought the second. I will no longer purchase anything from this developper. I feel like i've been taken advantage of a la EA style. (think Hardline). This is more of a dlc than an actual game. 28$ CAD? no...no sorry. After playing, this is not justifiable.PROS : NONECONS: -games crashes lots-constantly having to change the visual settings at each battle: bloom, foreground, background-almost no content in terms of battles: you blow through all the battles in a couple hours-unlock everything in a couple hours-NO CAMPAIGN!? Huge sigh. That was one of the best features of GSB 1's dlcs-not much diversity between races in terms of weapons etc.-TOO EXPENSIVE. Free is not even worth your time.- - - - - - -  >  EDIT:  - - - - - - - - - >Well, i've been asked by Cliffski himself if my opinion of this game has changed since i posted this review. In one word, NOPE! I can say a few things:CON:-STILL NO CAMPAIGN. (no, don't charge me for a campaign dlc.)I know it sounds like im ranting, but for CAD $30 you SHOULD get a campaign. Or at least a free dlc pack with a campaign.FINAL: Well we just found out not too long ago from Cliff that he won't be supporting gsb2 anymore. I'm really not surprised actually.Cliffski, you said in your blog that you believe gsb2 is superior to gsb1 in every way. I can't discredit your opinion because maybe it is to you, but how do you account for such a poor rating in steam compared to gsb1? It's a little crazy.And don't blame the large amount of space games out there either. You know better Cliff, don't play people for fools, you lose customers and respect.			"

												The Game is still good, it does still work, its just a little uncomfortable in some aspects (UI and ship customizations and such) but every game is that way and just takes a little work, people have said that you have a 60% chance to get a battle started but i feel they stopped at ""****it.. my game crashed... AGAIN..."" and didnt try to figure out what has caused it, i personally have only had a crash occur before battle when i tried to drag the selection box over the panel on the left side that has the ships available to be placed.. other than that the game works perfectly fine and i think the dev did a great job, however he breaks under criticism too easily, however its not all his fault, i believe his fan base was too hard on him, he made a good game, and then expanded upon its features in a sequel, he did a good job on it but people found it lacking, the blame is as much on the fan base for pointing the finger as the dev for stepping down too easily, the bug is simple and you can avoid it.. its not game breaking, just dont click and drag to select anything while placing ships, only hold control when selecting to select multiple ships, i do hope this helps :) and i hope you all enjoy this wonderful game as much as i do			"

												This is a game to appeal to the the stats tinkerer and min-maxer in you. Leaving aside the visuals (which are fully as gratuitous as advertised and a big step up on GSB1), most of the fun here is in fiddling with ship builds (very customisable) to see if you can build the perfect fleet from the available components. If you've ever spent an entire evening tinkering with a ship fittings in EVE or searching the WoW auction house for something that would give you 0.1 extra DPS then there's likely something in GSB2 that would appeal.You have to like experimenting: the game mechanics are not super-well explained and the game requires a ""that didn't work, maybe I can try this"" rather than an ""I died mysteriously, this sucks"" mindset. Also encouraging is the evolution of the game since it's initial release. There have been a lot of patches and, as of 1.30, the stability and graphics are much improved. Since the developer is a one-man band, I reckon he deserves to be cut some slack here. "

YouTube™ Video: ➜ A Quick Look @ 'Gratuitous Space Battles 2' 

			Views: 51		

			Massive Thanks to the Dev's for the Review Copy! http://store.steampowered.com/app/344840 I take a quick look @ 'Gratuitous Space Battles 2' - Now I have to admit that I never played the 1st game in...		

Gratuitous Space Battles is back! and it's approximately 50,000 times more gratuitous than before. A completely new ground-up rebuilding of the custom 'Gratuitous Engine' gives the game a completely new look, with beam-lasers 10x as 'beamy' as explosions 10x more gratuitous. You now have complete control over the appearance of your ships, and can build them from a base hull and a bunch of adjustable visual components so you have control of both the composition AND the looks of your deadly starships. GSB2 retains the core gameplay of the original. This is NOT a standard RTS game, but a management/simulation game about building space fleets and giving them orders. You aren't the dumb schmuck who actually flies into battle and gets lazered. Leave that to those patriotic and keen young dudes from the outer-colonies. Nope, your job is as supreme commander in chief. Sit back at fleet HQ and watch the fireworks as you reduce the enemy to space-dust. Using it's amazingly asynchronous multiplayer online 'challenge' system, GSB2 lets you put together a whole fleet and upload it, orders, formations and custom ship designs in one, up to a server where fellow GSB2 players can download it and pit their own fleets against it in glorious combat. - Recommended!

												All the fun of epic-scale space battles for those who aren't up for a real-time strategy. You can design your own ships and construct massive fleets to send into battle but not much else. The title really says it all: you get to position your ships and watch them blow other ships up in glorious slow-motion or super speedy motion (or regular speed, if that's your thing). Pros:Nice visuals and sound effects. Lives up to being gratuitous. Lots of customizability as far as aesthetics go. Plenty of replayability in skirmish mode. If you're looking to spend twenty minutes blowing up an entire galaxy's infrastructure, look no further.Cons: You're able to design and position your fleet, but there's not much you can do once the battle begins besides watch. If you're looking for an Empire at War type game, this isn't it. Aside from that, the main drawbacks boil down to how similar all of the battles feel; get all of the ships and smash them into the enemy's face. Fun but repetitive if applied in excess.			"

												This game is severely lacking and disappointing.The graphics are much worse quality than the preview images show. If you put big ships too close together, all you get is a glitchy, flashing, white blob. There is only one type of game play: place ships on the screen, then watch an automated battle with zero interaction. The tutorial is a gigantic wall of text and does nothing to teach you how to play. The story periodically changes between non-existent and incoherent. Oh, and you need to enjoy crashing to enjoy this game.The graphics are 2D only. The ships look like flat, bland, colored rectangles. There is no lighting effects--no, the colored lines and 3 frame explosions don't count The backgrounds are $4 on Turbo squid. The planet is stationary regardless of moving the camera, but the stars move drastically, so the stars appear to be somehow closer than the planet; it doesn't make sense. I didn't last 30 minutes before uninstalling this hideous game.			"

												Short summary: This game is UNPLAYABLY, LAUGHIBLY, HORRIBLY, RUINOUSLY, BUGGY.Long version: First let me say that the original Gratuitous Space Battles is one of my favorite games of all time. GSB2 would be a worthy successor — unfortunately, the overwhelming majority of battles end in a crash and a bug prevents most of the ships from even being visible, so you can't even enjoy the battle before it inevitably crashed. (It's not just me; read the other reviews!)Here are just some of the problems I've encountered:1. The game crahes constantly. It crashes during more than 75% of battles, and I can't advance more than about 80% through the campaign because of crashing.2. Ships randomly disappear and cannot be seen during battles. 3. I cannot save or load fleets. Sub-fleet saves do appear to work.4. Ships disappear from mission selection and and are randomly deleted during editing. Since the last update they reappear when restarting. (It's okay, you'll be restarting soon! See #1.)6. The game does not seem to respect the options configurations. Turning off some FX means nothing is visible.Verdict: DON'T BUY! The game was released in a totally broken state, and the developer hasn't done much since to address game-ruining bugs. I doubt this game will ever be playable.			"

Mainly because this game lacks a lot, it really lacks a tonne. You're better off sticking with GSB1, since this is just... Boring. That's all it is. I snoozed through the first few missions, there's no immersion, there's no atmosphere, there's little gameplay. Maybe this game will be worth getting if they put out the Galactic-Map DLC or better yet, include it as an update. But until then, this game is poo.			"

Most of the gameplay takes place with setting up your ships to battle and then you just watch and hope you picked the right strategy. If you don't like hardcore strategy games you probably won't like this.			"

												I loved the first game, and this is basically a more in-depth version of that. It's not really for everyone, as you don't have any direct control over the ships, but if you liked the first game, this is a lot better. More strategy is required for building, both at the individual ship level, and the fleet level. No more will we see the same Rush/Anti-rush/Static fleets of the first game.There's also a lot more customisation, even allowing you to customise the aesthetic of the ship, in addition to the modules and hardpoints of the first game. I've spent quite a lot of time creating all my differant fighters and bombers.			"

												I have no idea why this game has mixed reviews. Its great. Its more of the same, which apparently is a bad thing to some people? i imagine these people are the same ones that would complain that its too different from the original if it was. Everything is fully customisable, cool new weapons, nice shiny graphics. Just waiting for some more races to play :)			"

												So I came across a bug in GSB2.  I've noticed a few other minor ones before this, small graphics glitches, ship designs which temporarily disappeared, and such; But nothing which actually prevented me from playing.  Until this morning. I was trying to beat one of the latter scenarios using only frigates or lighter ships.  A futile mission perhaps, but that's partly the appeal of the game.  Setting a goal and then trying to beat it with the absolute minimum expenditure of resources.  This lead to me creating a huge formation of frigates, which seems to have exceeded the maximum that the game would allow.  This caused the game to crash whenever I’d try to start the scenario. I’ve been in this situation before. You submit a bug report and then maybe get a canned email response saying that the problem will be looked into, and then nothing further . You wait months and just hope that there will be a fix in the next patch.  Hell, you often just hope that there will BE a next patch. So how long do you think it took Positech to get this resolved?  About 10 minutes. I got a personal response straight from Cliff (the one-man developer of GSB2), got a workaround to the problem and assurance that it’d be fixed in the next patch. That’s a huge indication that this is someone who really cares about their games and will work to make ‘em great.Unfortunately this experience has left me in an existential crisis and has potentially revealed a serious flaw in my psychological makeup. Years of internet immersion has honed my sarcastic wit to razor sharp perfection.  I can be a snarky♥♥♥♥♥hole at the drop of a hat, spewing smarm and vitriol at anybody who dares to not be perfect on the internet, all from the comfort and anonymity of my bedroom.  And I like to think I’m quite a bit better at it than most.  But now I find that I need to praise something. To be positive and supportive. My every instinct recoils at the notion.But why should it.  I really like the game. Judging from his lineup of games, Cliff seems to have very similar tastes to my own. Games that don’t rely on twitch skills, but on planning and strategy.  Games where you can constantly tweak a bunch of individual small aspects to see how they affect the system as a whole. And that’s what GSB2 is. If you think that just completing each of the missions is the goal, you can achieve that fairly quickly and with little planning.  Just throw more ships at the problem and eventually you’ll win.  But the real challenge is trying to do it with as little as possible.  I usually start by making a fleet which can win the engagement fairly decisively, and then start whittling it down and tweaking stuff until I think I’ve got it down to the bare minimum. Eventually I get to where I’m sure it’s just not possible to do it with anything less.  Then I check the high scores and see that not only do I not have the best score ever, I’m about 50,000 points shy of it.  Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ I’ve got to rethink this whole strategy. This is how this game eats up hours of my life.  And it’s time well spent as far as I’m concerned. "

I WISH THERE WAS A WAY TO GET MY MONEY BACK.  Steam trading cards are more worth your $$$ than this game...  So sad.  I loved the first one...  This game is ""unfinished"" at best and the developer has abandonded further development becuase he's poor.  MAKE BETTER GAMES AND YOU'D HAVE MORE MONEY!Okay, that's enough of my rant.  Seriously though, don't buy this crap.			"

												It's not the type of game for people who like a post-release game without bugs. It's not the type of game for people who like real-time multiplayer either. It may not even have the greatest reviews, but for several months GSB 1 had tons of bugs, glitches, and crashes too. A lot of people haven't looked past that fact, fail to remember that fact, or straight up expected too much out a flashy new release promising huge starships beating each other to pieces. Sure it crahes a lot, and is unfairly measured up to GSB 1, which as it stands, features a bunch of DLC and patches, and has no faults. It took years for that to happen. You cannot expect GSB 2, with it's completely redesigned engine, to be fault free. All the patches and refinements that GSB 1 featured were wiped out, the engine's capabilities were expanded, and patches have a lot more ground to cover. Don't judge the game based on it's progress since release, it hasn't had any time yet to mature and expand. Within a year, someone (or Positech themselves) will have DLC out, and everybody will be happy again. It's not a perfect pick-up game, and it won't be until you laden it with so much DLC it looks and plays in a totally different way. Give it time people.			"

												Game play is the same as GSB, as far as I can tell. But, what really makes this game is the visual customization. I love games like KSP, Spore, etc; games that allow you to create and this one takes your ship building to the next level. I've really enjoyed this game and have had very little issues. Only notable one is loading ships in the editor sometimes crashes the game, but the gameplay is fine. Looks better than the first. Great game overall!			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine Gratuitous Space Battles 2 is a game developed by Positech Games, the same people behind the Democracy series and a sequel to Gratuitous Space BattlesIn Gratuitous Space Battles 2 you fight in space trying to survive the onslaught of enemies heading your way. The game's style is that of build and run, which is; you design ships, you go into battle against a fleet of enemy ships, you place your ships in a layout, you program orders, you click 'Start' and you wait. If you wipe out the enemies, you win!There is a set amount of great game mechanics there, and a pretty extensive customization range. The game also offers great visuals too, especially for a 2D game and there is a lot of strategy involved when planning your attackGratuitous Space Battles 2 is a fun game to play in short bursts! RECOMMENDED :)  "

Game-playGratuitous Space Battles is back again, and this sequel is a dream come true to players who enjoyed the first game.Being famous for its vast customization and allowing the players to exert their creativity, this time, even more customization is allowed.Being able to color and re-size the vast amount of parts and modules to mount on different ship hulls sizes and more-specialized-hulls for the construction of your space-crafts, provided great complexity and possibilities for you to spend hours just to construct your own unique ship.With mods being available and sharing of spacecraft design through steam, there is no limit to the content of this game. This game features the standard mission game mode, which the player will need to defeat a group of preset enemy space-crafts. The less total cost of your space-crafts deployed to tackle the mission, the more honor points you will get in-return for you to unlock more modules, equipment and factions. Again, there is no direct control over the ships during the battle. However, you can assign certain tasks and behaviors of your ships during the deployment phase.There is also an online mode of the game, which you can tackle space-craft formations created by other players.However, this sequel still fall short on one major problem inherited from the previous game. That is, the lack of a background story. Without a story-line to hold the game together, this game ultimately feels like a space battle simulator like the one in Ender’s Game.PresentationVisually speaking, the upgrade of graphics was not dramatic, but there are definitely more efforts put into the details of the space-crafts and the battlefield. Lighting and shadow effects were also improved to help create a more realistic 2.5 dimensional environment than its predecessor.Being able to build your dream ship is one thing, but the greatest enjoyment comes from the way it shines in action or…in total destruction.There was also a great improvement on the user interface during the battle and players can now look at each space-craft’s status at the same time. Although some of the icons might be a bit too large which could block the view of the battlefield, this was no doubt a welcoming improvement.SummaryIn summary, if you are interested in the previous game or being a Sci-Fi fan, there is no doubt that you will be spending hours and hours of time in this sequel. For those that are new, it depends on whether you would value the limitless creation provided by this game over the lack of a background story.  "

												since sarcasm is hard i will give a real review.The idea behind this game is customize a fleet of ships, build and deploy them onto a battle and then watch the battle unfold.  This game does not let you control the ships once the battle starts, all the strategy is in creating the best fleet you can and customizing all the orders they will follow when the battle starts.-Highly Customizable ships.let me start by saying, the strongest aspect of this game is how much you can customize each ship you put on the field.there are 18 different Hull types for Humans (and also the other 3 races but i haven't unlocked them yet to confirm if they also get 18), each with advangages and Disadvantages.6 ship types-Fighter-Gunship-Frigate-Destroyer-Cruiser-Dreadnought-Positives-Very customizable-has a lot of Depth to the strategy-and i think its different.-Negatives-looks like a short single player of only 12 missons.  (the first two are tutorial missions)-Mutliplayer doesn't seem to work.  if it does work, i have no idea how it works because it isn't very  intuitive. Edit: i have managed to figure out mutliplayer but i am still leaving this as a negative.-some Ui Elements are broken and can be draged around when they shouldn't be.should I buy this game?if you really enjoy games that are all about the strategy and really let you change all the different aspects of your fleet and ships this game is probably for you.if you don't know if you would like this kind of game but are interested and don't know if spending money on it is worth it.  I would wait until it goes on sale.If you are expecting an action or fast paced game with interesting combat.  This game is not for you.			"

												GSB2 is a ""more of the same"" kind of sequel: where GSB1 had lots of races and three ship types, GSB2 has four races and six ship types.  The differences between each race and hull are more pronounced.I like this change, as I tended to only use one or two races in GSB1 and use the same hull for multiple roles.  The new ships come in three sizes, each with two classes and three hulls for that class.  Large ships, for example are cruisers and dreadnoughts; the former has a wider array of modules available but fewer slots, the latter has many slots but can only use heavy weeponry, so cannot defend itself against smaller ships or missiles.  The four races seem to have a bit more variety between them: hull bonuses have much larger magnitudes, making each one good for certain tasks - you no longer just pick the one with most sockets and ignore the rest.  This all adds more variety to the fleets you can field and allows your fleet to be more versatile.There are many small changes which make GSB2 quite different to play than it's predecessor...If you clump your ships together, they will arrange them selves into different layers (i.e. in 3D).  This prevents all that jostling which ruined your formations in GSB1.Weapons are also now resticted to arcs over which they can fire, according to their socket.  A dreadnough, for example, will have some front facing guns, some side-facing guns, and maybe one to the rear or a full 360° turret.  Cruisers will have more 360° turrets.The player can customise the appearance of their ships, helping to differentiate between roles (I paint all my long range ships blue, front line ships purple, defenders green etc.).Small ships (fighters and gunships) require a carrier bay in order to be deployed.  They have limited fuel and ammo and must return to said carrier to replenish these (if they survive).The campaign mode is different - you deploy a fleet and take it through a series of battles, only being able to re-deploy those ships which survived the last round.  It's rather short and easy, though.  I'd like to see more of these and higher difficulty added.You can now deploy two of your own fleets against each other, allowing you to test ship designs/deployments etc.There are still some improvements to be made, however...The flavour text is copy-pasted between modules of the same type, e.g. all the plasma guns have the same description.  It would be nice if they each got a description of what sets them appart from their neighbours.Shield boosting destroyers tend make front line dreadnoughts invincible.Fighter/Gunships are much too weak - they are deployer one-by-one from their carrier and move in an orderly queue as they fly into the wall of enemy flak.  These ships need to form a nasty swarm to be effective but they just don't carry enough fuel or ammo.I'd like to be able to zoom in on the visual customisation screen so I can place pieces more precisely.A few missions gave me loads of honour points and I gobbled up all the parts.  I then didn't feel like I had to optimise my fleet any more, I could just throw everything agains the single player missions.  I'd like to have some incentive to minimise my fleet, maybe having parts cost more honour; perhapse an expansion can add some very expensive (though not over powered) parts to buy.I'd still like more variation between races.  They all have 90% of the same stuff to use and will field variations on the same ships.  I'd like the races to feel wildly different, so you have to adjust your play style when playing both as and against them.I turned the voice-over off, it felt unncessary.  I don't need to be told I've entered ship design mode or that a ship is taking shield damage.  I can work these bits out for myself, I'm clever like that.I'd like to be able to tell the tutorial to bugger off.Over all, GSB2 still has what made GSB1 great.  There are some pros and cons but it feels like a worthy sequel.  However, I also feel you only get to make one ""more of the same"" sequel.  GSB3 had better be totally different.			"

												I loved the original GSB but the improvements made to GSB 2 are simply wonderful.  I have seen a few bugs but they are very minor and are not preventing me from enjoying the game.  The new in-game ship editor is a big deal and allows me to pick and choose from a good selection of visual components for each race, then resize, recolor and rearrange them to my heart's content.  Very simple to use.  I like the changes made to gameplay.  More ship classes and a little better balance.  The game looks gorgeous and now includes much prettier lighting and semi-3 dimensional layers so that there are shadows and you can see the ships below the ships on top just by scrolling around the screen.  The explosions and destruction are quite satisfying. I do hope the races from the original GSB reappear in GSB 2 because I would love to work with the designs and tweak them.  I found them very appealing.  This game is making me truly happy.  It is my new favorite. :-)			"

												Personally, I found this superior (see footnote) game to be unmistakably flawed in enough areas to make me not want to invest near the time I spent in Gratuitous Space Battles. (time & enjoyment vs cost) Which in the end makes this a title to avoid.Footnote: The developer believes this game is superior in every aspect to the original, but since it didn't make him more money than your average $13 USD per hour worker, he doesn't want to update it anymore. I can't say I blame him, no amount of bugfixes is going to fix the real problem with this one. But seeing as the customers who tend to buy and play games make about that much per hour, I'm left wondering if I'm supporting the right person. I hope his next game returns to the quality I came to expect from his other titles.			"

												Great game. I liked it very much, however it doesnt have a lot of content. The campaign took me about 45-60 to complete. and it ocasionally crashes. 3.5/5 stars cant wait for the dlc			"

												Not at all worth a purchase. Very little content and almost no reasons to play what is even there.			"

												Don't buy this.  GSB1 is better.  GSB2 lacks any depth.			"

												This is overall a decent game, the main reason i am giving it a neg review is the fact that no mater what i try i am only able to play one or two ""matches"" in ANY game mode, then i get some crap error every time that forces the game to close. And now the Dev wil not be working on it or fixing it anymore. So sure if you have 10-20 min to play, go for it, but be prepared for it to decide you are done playing as soon as you start getting into it.			"

												Grartuitous Space Battles 2 does, as stated in other reviews, have more ship types but less parts pr ship which is a bit of a bummer. It is also very buggy. If you do get it, expect it to crash here and there for seemingly inexplicable resons. I'm hopeing that they may release some fixes eventuly. The graphics are very nice, the only bad thing about the graphics are that the shield anamations are not that great. Bacicly buy at your own risk. If you don't are about the above then buy the game.			"

												Not supported, crashes on multiple OS's.  Even on sale, it is still a waste as it won't launch.			"

												Latest versions (that fix some major bugs) are only available for Windows.  Developer has abandoned the game on all platforms,  Don't buy it.  Personally, I won't be buying any of this dev's other games, either.			"

												It's actually a fun little game for what it is, and is only the price of a cheap bottle of vodka.Yes, it frequently crashes on loading the game, but it has no real effect given your deployment is saved so you just relaunch. Crashing DURING the game would be annoying, but it hasn't once done that to me.			"

												Super fun! but also super crashy. game Crashes to desktop pretty much every single battle. Great idea, love the work, to small a team to pull off support for a wide customer base, if its broken and you cant play it, odds are you never will(also its no longer being updated.)To the lucky few able to run this game, good luck and best wishes. tho those looking to buy this game, dont. odds are that it wont work and that you wont find that out untill after the two time limt.(due to the building desgin nature of the game, its easy to get suckered into designing your own Custom Fleet and then discover the games crash during combat, meaning you can use that shiny fleet you just spent the ""Trial"" period of two hours figuring out how the editor/builder works.
