												Before noting that I said I do not recommend this, please understand that it's not bad.With this confusing statement out of the way, let's get started. Bientôt l'été isn't a game. It's an artistic piece, and this needs to be understood. From what I could gather, the goal of it was to demonstrate how people can communicate, even if limited by language, actions, or possible phrases (as seen by the chess board in-game). However, this requires that someone somewhere is playing at the same time you are, unless you want to talk to an AI. It's a beautiful experience when it works well, but this is so rare I can't recommend a purchase at any time other than during a sale. Due to the game's artistic goal and nature, it was heavily slammed upon release, driving away potential players. Without a community waiting for another person to chat with, more people slammed the game for not having a community. This is Bientôt l'été's biggest problem, without players it simply cannot achieve the desired effect.For this reason I suggest buying this when it's on sale. More players are likely to be experimenting with it at the same time as you, and you're more likely to see the beauty of limited conversation with a complete stranger.			"

												Game developers should be encouraged to challenge the status quo with narrative and mechanics, but I feel that there are certain best practices for game design that Tale of Tales often overlooks for no visible reason or benefit to the game. While Bientôt l'été has the most conventional controls and straightforward instructions of their games to date, it still suffers from the same problem: some strange design decisions have little to nothing to do with, and may even hinder the concept.Imagine the PS3 game Journey: two players meet at random in a surreal world to make a connection. Except in Bientôt l'été, both players are chat robots stating phrases at random while smoking cigarettes, drinking wine, and playing chess (with a catch: you have to find the pieces first, but one at a time). The highlight of the game should be the multiplayer, but unfortunately it doesn't seem to be very populated (a symptom of its avant garde concept, I guess), and the interactions are severely limited.What should be a virtual date with a stranger in a surreal world becomes tedius, with no real interaction or connection with said stranger. Unlike Journey, which limits your characters' intractability to serve the purpose of the mechanics and design, Bientôt l'été's design stands at odds with its concept, preventing players from creating any kind of meaningful connections.

												For the record, I have played this game, but for some reason Steam isn't showing my actual time put into it.""A work of art""Yes, I have to admit that Bientôt l'été was indeed a work of art. But that's the exact reason this game is practically unplayable. I gave it a little while, hoping to get somewhere, but instead I just sat there and played chess while rereading the same dialogue over and over. I don't know whether this game gets more interesting or enjoyable later on, but from what I have played, I can tell you that I'm glad I bought this during last year's Summer Sale, because for $9.99, Bientôt l'été shouldn't be payed for until it goes on sale... between 80-100% off.

												Before you, I never knew anguish. I tried to Imagine myself without you.This game is about walking on the beach. And drinking wine. And smoking cigarrettes. And conversations that are incredibly fatalistic.I liked the feeling I had after I played this game, but I cannot recommend it. I feel like it's more like a prototype for a mini-game. Kind of like a dream sequence or something, that keeps you from getting bored with the actual game, except there is no actual game. Just uselessness coupled with self-hate. C'est la vie.			"

												This hits a very niche market... and not very well. I typically really enjoy introspective forlorn romps through artsy settings, but this is a bit of a streatch even for me.Spoilers follow:No seriously, there's nothing to this game, so litterally anything I say past this point will ""ruin"" it for you.Don't read further unless you've either already played it our have no intention to.So the idea is that you go for long walks on the beach reflecting on this relationship you've had. Sometimes there's something on the beach that will drop a chess peice which you can take to the house and use on a chess board to hold something resembling a conversation with an online partner... The dialouge seems to suggest that these two love each other out of necessity and not for any actual romantic reasons... they don't seem to actually like each other but are bound to eachother anyway. It's really sad...These two need to see other people, but it's clear that there are no other fish in the sea, so to speak.Oh, and once you've collected all the chess peices, the next item to drop is a gun... well that escalated quickly. You can use the gun on the chess board like a peice. It does nothing in particular, but I think it's more meant to be a metaphore for putting an end to the relationship more than anything.To sum up the game: Help I'm trapped in a holodeck of angst and regret! I don't know what love is and I want to kill myself because I'm so messed up about it!			"

													This is, by far, the best cigarette smoking simulator on the market. At first, it seemed confusing with the long walks on the beach and random phrases popping up on screen, but only once I entered the café did I realize the actual draw of this title. As I sat at the chess board and waited five minutes for a partner to join, I then realized something else; I was the only person to buy this game. Thank god they included a computer controlled character to interact with or I may have missed the hidden gem in this pile of coal. 	We moved our chess pieces across the board and spoke sweet nothings to each other until only silence hung in the air. And then I saw it. Near the bottom of the screen was a classic lighter and a half full soft pack of smokes. Move over wine glass! The true beauty and meaning of game play was at hand. Once clicked, the screen goes black and you can actually hear your character click the flint, light up, and take a long, smooth drag. You can almost taste the tobacco. A puff of smoke fills the screen upon return to the scene. The cigarette is then seen majestically smoldering in the ashtray on the table. If clicked again, another drag is taken until there is nothing but a snuffed out filter left. 	Oh, but that's just the beginning. It seems there is no limit to the amount of cigarettes you can smoke! My only complaint would be that there aren't enough ways to put out your coffin nail. The choice to put it out on your lover's hand or leave it floating in their wine glass should be included in a future patch for the sole reason that some of the predestined lines are mad creepy. 8 out of 10 because I can't tell if they're menthol or not.

												I really enjoyed Dear Esther. I also enjoy Tale of Tales other games, like The Path. I simply do not understand nor enjoy this game at all. I went into it with low expectations and an open mind, I left questioning exactly what should be considered ""art"" in gaming.Bientôt l'été is the most pretentious of pretentious indie art games. One that is ""too deep for you"" to even understand whatever trivial message it's trying to put across. Let me just say right now that when a developer needs to address their entire userbase in a forum post, revealing what their inspiration for the game was in order for you to understand its purpose, then the developer has completely failed to convey any sort of rational thought with their game. Still, no one slightly understands the purpose of Bientôt l'été and those who do are obviously elitist intellectuals whose thoughts and opinions on the matter are also ""too deep for you"" to understand yet again. It's hard not to call Poe's Law into play.This game has a mechanical crutch which becomes limited by its users. The main attraction of Bientôt l'été is being able to connect with other players in a cafe of sorts, decked out with a chess board, a glass of wine, cigarettes, and the ability to communicate intricately with one another. Except this all falls apart when you realise you're the sole person in existence to be playing this game at this point in time, forcing you to instead substitute a human presence with artificial intelligence. This severely impacts the game as a whole.I never found a partner to play with so I had to resort to A.I., and after collecting all of the chess pieces I managed to find a gun... although my character holds it backwards. Does this gun do anything more than intimidate the opposing player? If not, then there is no point to this game since there aren't enough people playing this game at any one time; you can't really surprise artificial intelligence.The entire process of Bientôt l'été took me little over 80 minutes to achieve. After collecting the gun and positioning all the chess pieces in their correct order, hoping for something to ""unlock"" or tell me I've done something right, only to find out nothing much happens. I decided to go back out and collect more items, coming to a stinging realisation that the cycle has restarted and I'm collecting the very first chess pieces again.This game is insulting.			"

												Looks like I can't review this really, since it's to be played with someone else but goooood luck connecting to anyone :\So what's in there once you start the game? You walk your male or female avatar on a beach. Turn around, there's a house of sorts, which will change in appearance when you enter and come out. Inside, you can sit at a chess table, drink wine and smoke, place chess pieces on the board.. with a partner in front of you (most likely an AI since noone is ever around for real) doing the same.You go back out.. from time to time there will be random things on the beach.. like a huge pile of coal.. a wheat field.. dead seagulls.. which you briefly watch and then 'collect' the memory of (which just means it disappears and your avatar bends down like picking up a pebble, there's no inventory or anything..). Going in each direction for a little while you realize the space is rather limited, but feels bigger since it's sooo empty.And that's pretty much it.What is it trying to say ? No clue.What would be different if someone else was there for real ? No clue.Is there any point to it ? No clue.Is there more to be seen or experienced if you stick to it ? No clue. Was too bored to find out.Does understanding French help at all? Absolutely not - native speaker here.I did like the nighttime sky effects (time goes by when you close your eyes). That was about it.So I really can't recommend it. Unless you're the type to go stare at a single blotch of paint on a white canvas at a museum and go ""ooooooh, that's deep"".			"

Short:+ Relaxing ""walking simulator""+ Eerie, dreamy, surreal, transcendental design, music and ambiance+ Bold multiplayer concept: People are strangers, no direct means of communication- Lack of any significant, forward-driven narration/story/plot- Lack of any significant, long-term gameplay- Odd/Awkward, not exactly comforting (keyboard) controls- Multiplayer barely works for the lack of people playing this game (workaround: joining Steam group and timing online time with other people)Long:Interesting from an art-ish and ambiance-related point of view, lacking gameplay-wise, and with an irritating control scheme. Badmouths may call it a boring walking simulator. It provides less exploration and narration than for example Dear Esther, but a bit more than for example Proteus, and has it's own unique graphical style and ambiance. The graphics, sounds and music give you an eerie feeling, it's dream-like, surreal and transcendental, and for this alone it's interesting to look at and listen to, eventually even admirable.You select a male or female character stored inside tubes. ""It's nearly summer"" you are told. You appear with your character on a simulated/virtual beach shore and walk it. Random phrases will appear drawn onto the ground. You ""collect"" (""remember) some of them by closing your eyes, you also hear them voiced  in French then (they are always subtitled in the language of your choice). You collect some object ""hidden"" beneath some worldly, ""holographic"" thing (a tree, a bush, a crane, ...) that disappears to reveal this object (chess pieces mostly, and one more unique and confusing one which leaves room for interpretation). You enter a house, meet with a virtual partner of the opposite gender in some sort of bar, put your objects in turns on a chessboard (freely, you don't actually play chess - some spots trigger the words/phrases you previously collected to appear on the screen and be voiced), take a smoke, drink some whine or select some pre-set of music tracks to play music-box like in the background. The lines you collect and make appear are circling around the two characters and their relationship, who are or used to be lovers  After that you leave the house, walk along the shore again, collect more phrases and another object and enter the house again. This you repeat as many times as you wish, at some point the simulation starts over again with you collecting about the same pieces again (the game however seems to remember all pieces you once collected - I've just started up the game again and could place all the objects I once picked up many months back when I first played this game).The partner in the house is either A.I.-controlled or an actual human who is playing the game at the same time as you do. You don't see his/her name, he/she is a stranger, there is no text or voice chat to use, you only communicate with the words and through symbolism you can do with the chessboard and the objects, and the only indication whether there is someone else playing/waiting in the house is - from what I've been told and noticed - a window you see from the outside that has lights on. I haven't been able to meet up with a real human yet, because either the mechanics to match you up with one are not working too well or this game was never played by too many people to begin with. There is a Steam group one can join, and sometimes people try to group up through it. However this is a bit of a misleading way of playing this game, since it was obviously intended to meet strangers, an idea Tale of Tales originally came up with in ""The Endless Forest"", but which isn't executed too well in this game. A game that did this better was the PSN game ""Journey"". But I guess one must probably consider that ""Journey"" was a larger success than any of Tale of Tales' games ever were - the more players play these games the higher/better the chances to meet up with them. At some point no one will play these anymore, I guess, not even ""Journey"".The control scheme isn't entirely bad but not exactly too enjoyable. This is a problem I keep seeing in the games made by Tale of Tales. You look around by moving the mouse to either side of the screen, you walk by holding down the left mouse button, you close your eyes with the right mouse button and run with spacebar. It feels odd/awkward and not very comforting. They could adapt to the more classic control schemes that games with a first- and third-person view give you, the usual WASD and mouse-look thing. I don't see any good reason in doing things differently there. Has it to do with being different for the sake of being different? Or are they inept and don't play their own games? I don't know, and I don't like being harsher to them than they deserve. You can play with a gamepad too, maybe I should try that and will feel better then.			"

												Bientot L'Ete can be considered art. But, it's not. Its interface is clumsy, the graphics are passable, the sounds ok, the gameplay non-existant, the controls poor and the story alright. It's an interesting idea that is poorly executed. I had no pleasure playing (experiencing ?) it.If you really want to play a Tale Of Tales game play The Path instead. That one's certainly more enjoyable than this piece of crap. Otherwise just stay away from it and go play something decent.[Rating: 52/100]			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: Tale of Tales Publishers: Tale of Tales Initial release: Feb 2013Genre: Adventure, Experimental #Worth/NotWorth: #WorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationHonestly I'm mixed about this. I think its very cool and experimental for that hipster side of me that wants games to be something more than what they are in appearance, something deeper but I think this is a little too abstract. Its... different.I don't know what this is. I'm not sure its supposed to be.. well, anything. Its just a thing. You can engage with it I suppose. You're just supposed to explore it seems. The game gives you some hints on controls and guides you in a subjectively meaningful way IF you close your eyes. You'll figure it out. This is definetly one of those experimental games or... interactive art? I guess. Sticky subject regarding words these days. I'll leave you with some thoughts I had while playing. Possible interpretations. An elaborate ruse to obfuscate that in life when you close your eyes you can move faster but we are still trapped? My favorite thought I had however was a French sentient robot stuck in their own programming in love with itself as two separate beings.This is definitely one to ponder about. If you're one of those so called “intellectuals” Otherwise, you just walk real slowly on a beach for awhile.Follow my curation for more "

												I never understod this game. I watched and read reviews about this game so maybe I could be able to do so. I played it, and I was really excited about giving it a try, but after some time.. I became hopeless. So here is what I think the porpuse of the game was: *Since it is a walk simulator (and I'm not very familiar with them) I found some kind of peace but the lack of communication/interaction made me feel awkward and very dissapointed since the multiplayer option never worked for me. - you might find peace but in a weird way. *The story... doesn't even have one. - maybe that's what the game wants you to do, to build/imagine your own. (then you better read a book or play Minecraft, or something like that).*Music is okay and it indeed relaxes you but there's always something else that relaxes you.*The controls.. arghh... just terrible.<<Games like Lifeless Planet and Proteus have much more to offer, they lead you where they want to, and they indeed give you different feelings such as fear or excitement, Bientôt l'été gives you freedom, gives you a choice.. but after that, nothing gets to happen>>(If you still want to try it) Buy it on sale, or never buy it at all.

												Once again, Tale of Tales gets a recommendation from me for you to NOT buy this game. Stick to Journey if you want to experience anything that this game does that even approaches interesting, as Journey did that particular aspect more meaningfully, and in a more engaging way. Yet again, they have a clunky, awkward, even painful interface. Yet again, they seem to make the act of discovery as boring and disappointing as possible. Yet again, they seem to approach emotion like some inhuman creature who thinks of our species as idiots. Tale of Tales just tries too hard to be some caricature of artistic in a desperate plea for respect. A plea that has been going on for over a decade without results.			"

												As many players of Bientôt l'été I encountered the artificial intelligence and was unable to best its application of post-structural linguistics. At every turn I found myself subjected to a dialog that was profoundly disturbing, of which if I am to understand Lacanian psychoanalysis properly, came to enjoy as a manner and extension of the game.After this realization I came to wonder, and eventually resolved, why it was that I found this game so unmatched in its presentation -- it is what constitutes the substance ontology of a cosmopolitan bourgeoisie.On an ephemeral beach they engage in this digital discourse, aimlessly embodying the transcendental human experience, exclaiming to themselves ""This is what interaction amounts to; a game theory of chess and the parries of regular 21st century parlance and nomenclature."" Smug and content the player makes a category error in assuming that this is ""beyond"" or too ""meta"" for the proletarian mind.From here we see that indeed, this game is the ontological groundwork of a cosmopolitan bourgeois character.

В Российской действительности это говорит о том что в игре игрок будет о-о-о-о-о-очень одинок. Во вторых игра состоит из бесцельных блужданий по берегу моря, иногда разбавленная неким интерактивом ввиде текста или сбором шахматных фигурок. В игре ничего нет, графика очень минималистична с наложением кучи фильтров и размытий. Проект однозначно не для России, и будет очень плохо продаваться у нас.

												This is an esoteric/walking simulator from France.   Games in this genre are often very hit or miss and the good ones marry a deep experience with high quality graphics and art direction and a solid technical implementation.   Bad ones don't.   Bientôt l'été is unfortunately in the latter category. At face value the game has you walking around on an empty beach (not a new experience for walking simulators).  The twist is that eventually you'll collect a few ""romantic"" thought concepts and share them in a cafe with another avatar played by another player.The gimmick falls very flat and overall it's not very interesting.  Esoteric games are very much a personal experience to discover the game which the developer in their quest for ""Art"" eschews for the 2 player gimmick.   Technical issues also detract from the experience.Graphics:  Thumbs down here because they actually try to charge more for high res textures.   Otherwise okay but few options in fine tuning and shoddy ""film grain"" makes everything look like mud.Gameplay: Practically none - the 2 player gimmick is weird and doesn't make up for the lack of single player story.  You're walking around on a beach.Technical:  The game works okay in 4K but the graphics engine is fairly weak and lacks fine tuning options like getting rid of the film grain.   Worst of all is the game somehow assumes you have a flight sim HOTAS and maps all the buttons that way - and if you do have one, it binds the axes in bizarre and ridiculous ways - and there's no way to disable them, so you end up staggering around the beach like you're drunk.  The shoddy ""film grain"" effect does enhance the drunken experience.Overall this game misses the mark by quite a way.   If developers want to do ""art"" instead of making an actual game, they need to exceed other games technical implementations.   Falling behind on gameplay and delivery is a quick way to get a thumbs down.			"

												First off, this is as much of a game as you'd call something like Dear Esther a game. The ""gameplay"" consists of walking along a beach and finding out of place objects like a pile of coal or a field of wheat placed on the beach. After finding each of these objects, you get a chess piece to use in the cafe that's present across from the water.When you enter the cafe, you sit down at a chessboard and wait for someone to connect (or use their extremely awkward in-game partner connect to actually play with a friend). After waiting at least 10 minutes to connect to an actual player, the view changes to a top-down of the chessboard and you both take turns placing your own chess pieces on the board. Some spaces make your character say a line of conversation (which can be found by walking across the beach).Icy and I played this for an hour and a half and we could not discover any sort of progression. After you collect all your chess pieces you come across some sort of pistol. This pistol can also be placed on the chessboard, but does nothing else once on it.The story seems to be a very weak and very cliche talk of romance between artists gone sour. I'm sure the developers have an idea of what it /actually/ means and expect some users to gain a lot from the shallow symbolism, but in all honesty this would have been better as a 15 minute independant film.I would recommend against buying this. It doesn't belong on Steam.			"

If your the type of gamer that can get lost in a pretty space, or for that matter even played second life, and have the money to spend, i'd say go for it. it's purely art and not a game and with that being said, you'd pay 10 bucks on a painting right? why not this?

												I am fascinated by this game, and yet I fear I will never get to play it to its full potential.   In this game you walk around a strange, silent world and can interact with objects to gain chess pieces.  You can then use the chess pieces to have a virtual conversation with a stranger.  The more chess pieces you have the more options you have as far as things to say.  The interesting thing is that you each play the role of lovers and so the conversation has a strange intimacy even though the participants themselves are strangers. The possibility is that you might share a moment of connection with a stranger over these bits and pieces of dialogue and action.  However, I have played this game three or four times and have never been paired with a living person.  The other choice is to participate in the conversation with a simulation.  And in this case, interaction with a simulation is hollow and completely misses the point because there is no chance for that spark of human connection.   "

												What is love?This game truely shows the greatness in society today and what is to come. A well written satire on the emotions of the common populance of Equador and their problems with their facist government. A battle between the good, the evil, and the ugly. Personally, I had to take frequent breaks in order to wipe my face of tears due to the radiant beauty of this game.If someone was to ask me, ""are video games art?"" I would say yes. Although I wouldnt relate that question to this game as this is too wonderful to be simply defined as ""art."" It would take you a lifetime to completly enjoy all of the features this game can give you, your friends, your family, or other loved ones. This game has the greatest balance between visual and interactivity that makes this game: my person Game of the Year, for every year, ever.Sadly this game is very under-rated and no one seems to play it which disapointingly prevents users from using the cooperative aspects of this game. Other then that, it deffienetly deserves a 9.5/10.			"

												There is something beautifully sad about this game. When I play it, I feel a heaviness. A loneliness. A yearning for something that I wont ever see again, and the closest I can get to it is a computer generated simulation. A place void of speech, I can only speak the words I've collected along the beach, and I can only voice them in french as I drink wine and smoke cigerettes with the holographic version of my lover while we play chess. Memories form and fade in the sand dunes like illusions. You will either connect with this game or miss it entirely. Keep an open mind.			"

												Tale of Tales continues its trend of creating crappy pretentious video games. The developers of this game is akin to Jackson Pollock throwing paint onto a canvas, severely lacking talent.I have played most of the Tale of Tales series, while Bientôt l'été is not nearly as awful as The Graveyard, it comes pretty darn close. The game is apparently suppose to simulate distance dating, but I couldn’t connect to a single human being throughout my game time. I was forced to deal with quite frankly one of the dumbest A.I. on the planet through a series of dialogue controlled by playing some bizarro version of chess. I’m calling it chess, but it isn’t really chess, it’s just chess pieces being plopped onto the board at random. Here is a sampler of the dialogue.Me: “I look at you”A.I: “I think a lot about you since have seen you again”Me: “I would like a glass of wine”A.I: “How odd I have no desire to return”Every other line of dialogue follows the same trend of uninspiring and mundane one liners. Once outside you will immediately notice the artsy fartsy graphic style. The colors are super bright and the film grains a plenty. You can collect items outside which will reward you with a rather lame fly by cutscene of the item. That is it, that is the entire game. You want to play a game like Bientôt l'été? I suggest chatting with cleverbot, I assure you the conversation with the bot would be much more fun and enlightening than playing this game.			"

												When looking to purchase this game, there is a simple test you should perform before hand.Firstly, do you like modern art? Because that's what this game is, a fanciful and supposedly symbolic experience in which you will reflect on whatever you can imagine to be the depth of the 'piece'.Secondly, are you seeking an actually meaningful or deep experience that doesn't require DIY symbolism, perhaps with a strong but non-violent narrative? If you are, then turn away immediately, the game simply isnt worth your time.And thirdly, do you mind performing repetitive actions with very little benefit? If you do, then perhaps you should try something else, like the Stanley Parable or something.My personal opinion of the game is that if I have paid good currency on a piece of content, then there should actually be content and that content should be legible and self constructing. I should not receive a random set of letters and have to conjure up some sentence. The sentence should come at least partially pre-made to give the thought some sort of legitimacy. If I have to make it up without any kind of confidence that that is what the media was saying, then the thought won't only be short lived, it'll probably be too weak to have any kind of effect when it is in my mind. Deus Ex Human Revolution creates a moral dilemma out of a slowly constructed jigsaw that you see pieced together before you, the Stanley Parable hints at the deeper meanings of it's gags but only so much as to force you to complete the meaning yourself. Both games have made me seriously think about the messages they were pushing. This did nothing.			"

												Bientôt l'été is a pretty underrated game. People bought it with the wrong ideas in their mind. This game is really more of an Interective Art than anything, and it should be treated as such. The multiplayer part of the game is just a plus. What you should really do is explore the beach, find the buildings, read the phrases and think about it. It's about two lovers who can't meet, a long-distance relationship if you will. It's mostly a tribute to Marguerite Duras works, and there's really no point in being mad at ToT for ""wasting your money"" if you didn't even read the description or play the game Demo at Bientôt l'été website.

												Just terrible, artsy fartsy crap that only some fedora neckbeard would think is deep and meaningful.You play as one of two people who wander around a boring landscape, thinking random wistful lovey dovey things that don't evoke any emotion whatsoever from the player except groans. Then the game suddenly decides to take you and your ""lover"" inside some building, where you sit and click on items at each other, and each item activates a sentence in a nonsensical conversation that's supposed to be ""deep"", but instead reads like laughable emo poetry. I didn't keep playing much after that.Where is the love story that's supposed to make the player imprint on the characters? I thought the entire premise of this art game was to draw a beautiful allegory for magnetism across distance. Absolutely none of it comes through in the final product and I found myself laughing at the tryhard writing almost every other sentence.The whole thing reeks of a 2deep4me college freshman who just finished a game design degree at Full Sail University and celebrated by taking a nerdy girl into his room to watch Fight Club and not drink alcohol because alcohol is for jocks, and then she friendzoned him, and then he created THIS masterpiece to express his feelings about The One still being out there pining for him. So if that's you I guess this game is perfect.			"

You look around on the beach and view a scene for a chess piece, then move indoors to talk to another player, or to a simulation using the chess pieces which does not include many dialog options. Then when you run out of things to say, you leave the building, find another chess piece and re-enter it. I give the game a 3/10. I give it a 3 for it's visual and audio appeal only.			"

												Aims at artsy and pretentious, lands in excrement.I believe in the artistic potential of gaming, I really do. I listen to experimental music. I love Tarkovsky movies. I read Sartre. I've watch Waiting for Godot more than once. I might sound as though I'm the pretentious one, but that's sort of my point. I'm trying to dress myself up as I feel like exactly the type of person for whom this game would be created. And yet here I am, absent of any feelings for this game that aren't expletives.I suppose if you enjoy wandering around trapped in negative space, desperately hoping that there will be some semblance of experience to be found, this might be for you.Team Fortress 2 makes a thousand more powerful statements than this lazy half-made excuse of a game.

This game's hard-hitting, emotional quotes, serene yet disturbing environment, and finely painted white bench (Intentionally placed facing away from the ocean, and towards the edge of the world) all add up to create an experience unmatched by anything else in the world (Yes, this extends beyond videogames). To not recommend this game would be a crime, a crime I am simply not willing to commit. This game is a must have for anyone looking for an enriching time. Though a little warning; do not expect to understand it so clearly at first, you must emerse yourself before you can catch up to this game.

Elements of the game are supposed to be symbolic? but end up being utter nonsense, such as a translucent pile of coal on the beach that, for some unknown reason, utterly tanks the framerate.This game is art, in the same way that red hot murcury is refreshing.AVOID			"

												i highly recommend Bientôt l'été, the game about escaping the frightening low-FPS land of Outside and holing yourself up in a box-like shack, ""Waiting for a partner"" as the game itself puts it, staring daggers at a wooden chessboard, too apathetic to drink or even smoke. I don't wear a hoodie when I do that IRL tho so i'm giving it a thumbs-down until this immersion-breaking oversight is rectified.			"

												First, move the mouse pointer away from the ""Add to cart"" link.Now, go take a look at the ""game"" community here on Steam.You'll notice how many people truly and deeply hate the ""game"".I hear there's a web browser demo of the game on the creators' website - go check that out.There are no goals in this game - or none explicitly stated. When I played this, I was very sleepy (in my case, that's comparable to being tipsy or drunk). I didn't find another players, but I spent time talking with the simulated partner at the house. I selected lines I had seen rise from the waves, creating a discussion made of platitudes, sweet nothings and such, but affixing it a meaning by myself.When I quit the game, I was very surprised to notice that I had spent 50 minutes in the game. I... existed. I bought this game in a sale. The asking price without a sale is, in my opinion, too high. I don't know how I'll like the game when I play it again when I'm wide awake. I don't know if I'll ever end up playing the game with a real person rather than a computer simulation. But for now, I can't say that I personally truly regret spending 2.5€ on this ""game"" - for a game it is not but something else. But you might still find that to be too high a price.			"

It definatly doesnt make up for the reason you cant beat it. Yeah thats right it never ends. I feel like the game could have a lot of potential which feels that the potential never got used. So whats the story ? You play as a pair of lovers who feel alone without each other. The gameplay is pretty simple all you do is walk around  the beach then you play chess with youre lover. I felt that the game is definatly a good game but it only would apeal to art lovers . Overall Bientôt l'été is a game you should check out on sale i give this game a 6.5/10			"

												As an art enthusiast, this game feel more like a work of art. Like an abstract paining that makes me want to stare at it for hours till i shape my own imagination and interpretation. Its more about feeling the surroundings than looking to me. I believe that logic isn't welcomed here, we have to believe and do not expect or try to figure things out in the game. Even though its a bit difficult to find someone to play with on the chess game its still playable.There is no end to the game or even a direct objective. The game is something to appreciate by like staring with a work of art. Be as you may picture it if its a love story or a nightmare, its a masterpiece of its own doing. "

												this game is really weird to understand at first since its not really a GAME. its more like youre trying to participate in a painting or photograph. the game is about relationships with people, romantic or otherwise, and how your words and actions influence it positive or negative. in all, this is one of the most relaxing games ive played even if the ""story"" takes a turn for the worse. though i can understand some people's feelings about this game i really recommend it if youre a fan of artsy and surrealism since it has elements of surrealism within the game.

												reason why i don't recomend this game is at the end enjoy...no idea why i played thisthis is boringso instead lets look at this wiki entry i like:Computer game designer Chris Crawford, founder of The Journal of Computer Game Design, has attempted to define the term game using a series of dichotomies:1 Creative expression is art if made for its own beauty, and entertainment if made for money.2 A piece of entertainment is a plaything if it is interactive. Movies and books are cited as examples of non-interactive entertainment.3 If no goals are associated with a plaything, it is a toy. (Crawford notes that by his definition, (a) a toy can become a game element if the player makes up rules, and (b) The Sims and SimCity are toys, not games.) If it has goals, a plaything is a challenge.4 If a challenge has no ""active agent against whom you compete,"" it is a puzzle; if there is one, it is a conflict. (Crawford admits that this is a subjective test. Video games with noticeably algorithmic artificial intelligence can be played as puzzles; these include the patterns used to evade ghosts in Pac-Man.)5 Finally, if the player can only outperform the opponent, but not attack them to interfere with their performance, the conflict is a competition. (Competitions include racing and figure skating.) However, if attacks are allowed, then the conflict qualifies as a game.Crawford's definition may thus be rendered as[original research?]: an interactive, goal-oriented activity made for money, with active agents to play against, in which players (including active agents) can interfere with each other.why do i put this here?oh no reasonno goals great so you guys immedatly did not make a ♥♥♥♥ing gameoh don't get me wrong it is good looking piece of software but it doesn't qualify above 3 on this listi'm trying to figure out if it qualifies above 2 even... so basicly this is between a plaything and piece of interactive entertainment...but is it even interactive? i could get someone probly to try this out along side me but tbh this is a book with ability to walk the pages...(bad comparison i agree)...so this is not a game this is a weird artsy plaything(don't get me wrong i liek how it looks i'd like to see similar ideas implemented in actual GAME)i was gona do a video review but tbh... not worth my editing timenow why i don't recoment this game:IT IS NOT A GAME... barrack paper scicors on youtube is a better GAME(and with better love story)			"

												I don't mind this being a walking simulator, the atmosphere is pretty neat after all. However this game just goes the low-effort route and only builds a rather small patch of beach and you quickly run into the walls at the edge. In general the whole movement just feels to restrictive and annoying. Either you are wondering what the hell you are supposed to do or the walking feels to slow or whatever and then there is the whole chess multiplayer thing that nobody is playing.I do believe that such an art-piece can work, but for that it would need more polish and freedom. I don't want to be constantly reminded that I am just playing a low budget video game with all it's typical restrictions. Take Minecraft, it doesn't even try to be a fancy art-game, but Minecraft gets it right. It's a huge procedural world without boundaries. You don't have to wonder where you have to go to trigger the chess minigame, because the game world follows a consistent logic. You can just walk along at the beach and enjoy the sunrise in Minecraft, you don't have to second guess what the author meant to do, you can just get lost in the world. That's something that an art game should aim for, but Bientôt l'été misses the mark. You never can get lost in this world, because there is to much jank to pull you back out.A game doesn't just need to look good on screenshot, it must feel good when you are actually interacting with it and this just doesn't.

I think there were cigarettes and wine to be had, too.While I'm generally down with the whole ""this-is-not-a-game"" concept, I would have enjoyed Bientôt l'été more if it didn't take an age to walk anywhere, and if it adhered to standard norms for controlling your in-game avatar. You have to close your eyes before you can open a door? What is that all about?

Presumably you are holiday-fling soulmate lovers, by the tone of the conversation. If nobody else is present, you get to have this conversation with a ghost, but the ghost just chooses random phrases, which isn't very satisfying.

												Don't get me wrong, I'm all for games that focus on the art, thought, and aesthetic design, but I don't think this is a very well-executed example of that type of game. Lots of overly vague, pseudo-intellectual dialogue in an environment that feels disjointed and far more closed off than it tries to look. On top of that, the controls are not at all conducive to immersion or exploration, so the whole attempt at becoming a part of the experience is nullified. Maybe there are more things to see, but there was nothing going on here that drove me to stick around and find out more.			"

												I was intrigued by this game, and went in blind, not knowing what to expect.  The on-screen instructions tell you to just explore, and experience the game.  After walking aimlessly for about twenty minutes, I'll admit I gave up and came to the game page to figure out what's up.  Now, I understand the meet-up concept of the game's engine and design.  After seeing what the game has to offer, you are theoretically led into a room with an internet stranger, which leads to interaction.  However, Based on what I've experienced with the game, I can't recommend it.  For a concept like this to work, there needs to be an active user base, the writing needs to be top-notch, and there needs to be some sort of substance.  Unfortunately, it looks those things are lacking.			"

												This is a very aesthetic experience. Most people would'nt even call it a game. But because it says to review your game... I am. This game provides the player with a soothing soundtrack and very pleasing visuals that are easy on the eyes. You don't have to worry about your eye balls rotting from your head while playing this because it's a low light beach scenario. This ""game"" is based around either a male or female character (the sex is user option) who is looking for lost love or maybe they have given up on it? and they scower the beach for lines of dialogue to use in a game of chess along with chess board pieces. You can use those chess board pieces to play online with a random opponent (which may take time to find) or a robot wich is still equally fun. Usually the human takes their pieces and flails them around the board and ruins the entire experience. Put on your headphones to get the most out of this ""game"" it trult changes the experience. I reccomend this game because it is a stress reliever. It isn't a demanding game, but still looks beautiful and you can just do it without really thinking. It's very pleasing.			"

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Bientot L'ete is a finely crafted experience, set on exploring loneliness, friendship, distance and love all within the realms of a sci-fi experience. But is it a game? Yes...but a crap one.Boring, repetitive gameplay don't make a game. Although it's a very arsty, enjoyable experience, it's not fun. If you can just lull about a game and enjoy the atmosphere, get engaged in the story, then buy this. It's worth it. But if you want more substance than arty fluff, don't bother.Also, the online is a little iffy. Very little replay value and a multiplayer experience brought about by choosing random phrases and making a conversation. It's a good idea? Just executed in a very tedious, uneventful manner.			"

Either you are wondering what the hell you are supposed to do or the walking feels to slow or whatever and then there is the whole chess multiplayer thing that nobody is playing.I do believe that such an art-piece can work, but for that it would need more polish and freedom. I don't want to be constantly reminded that I am just playing a low budget video game with all it's typical restrictions. Take Minecraft, it doesn't even try to be a fancy art-game, but Minecraft gets it right. It's a huge procedural world without boundaries. You don't have to wonder where you have to go to trigger the chess minigame, because the game world follows a consistent logic. You can just walk along at the beach and enjoy the sunrise in Minecraft, you don't have to second guess what the author meant to do, you can just get lost in the world. That's something that an art game should aim for, but Bientôt l'été misses the mark. You never can get lost in this world, because there is to much jank to pull you back out.A game doesn't just need to look good on screenshot, it must feel good when you are actually interacting with it and this just doesn't.

												This feels more like an artistic experience than a game. Nothing is explained, not even the weird little mini games that comprise the entirety of the gameplay (oh, and walking). Don't go into this expecting any kind of consistent gameplay, story, objectives or characters. There is no narrator speaking sweet words of meaningful poetry like in the trailers. It's just walking, finding incredibly obscure 'clues' to further the castrated fragment of a story, playing chess with AI (since there is no one on multiplayer) and repeating the process again until there's just nothing left to do. I'm pretty sure the aim was for this to be a spiritual or transcendental experience of some depth but it just comes off as dry, pretentious and depressing. This, to me, is the video game equivalent of someone shooting paint out of their bumhole and calling it art.			"

												I was intrigued by this game, and went in blind, not knowing what to expect.  The on-screen instructions tell you to just explore, and experience the game.  After walking aimlessly for about twenty minutes, I'll admit I gave up and came to the game page to figure out what's up.  Now, I understand the meet-up concept of the game's engine and design.  After seeing what the game has to offer, you are theoretically led into a room with an internet stranger, which leads to interaction.  However, Based on what I've experienced with the game, I can't recommend it.  For a concept like this to work, there needs to be an active user base, the writing needs to be top-notch, and there needs to be some sort of substance.  Unfortunately, it looks those things are lacking.			"

												This is a very aesthetic experience. Most people would'nt even call it a game. But because it says to review your game... I am. This game provides the player with a soothing soundtrack and very pleasing visuals that are easy on the eyes. You don't have to worry about your eye balls rotting from your head while playing this because it's a low light beach scenario. This ""game"" is based around either a male or female character (the sex is user option) who is looking for lost love or maybe they have given up on it? and they scower the beach for lines of dialogue to use in a game of chess along with chess board pieces. You can use those chess board pieces to play online with a random opponent (which may take time to find) or a robot wich is still equally fun. Usually the human takes their pieces and flails them around the board and ruins the entire experience. Put on your headphones to get the most out of this ""game"" it trult changes the experience. I reccomend this game because it is a stress reliever. It isn't a demanding game, but still looks beautiful and you can just do it without really thinking. It's very pleasing.			"

												This game is absolutely unique experience, a real piece of modern art. It's incredibly beautiful and stunningly deep, but the thing is, of course, not everyone is able to appreciate something that is definitely there, but what is unseen, like true love.			"

												As you walk across the beach you see a pile of coal. You approach the pile of coal have visions of your loved one. Once the visions have subsided, the coal has disapeared and all that remains is a chess piece. A brown queen. You continue to walk along the beach and as the tide comes in, your mind races with words. Eventually you find an old house. As you enter you see a chess bored, a bottle of wine, 2 glasses, and a pack of cigarettes. You have a seat and wait. You do not know what you are waiting for, but you know in your heart you will know what it is when you see it. As you wait you decide to pour yourself a glass of wine and have a smoke. An aparition appears. You recognize it as your partner that has long since been gone. As the aparition sits down you say,""Have some wine."" It does. The aparitions says,"" Why do we always fight."" You respond,"" Because I don't know if you still love me."" The aparition then stands up and leaves, never to be seen again. You finish your smoke and walk back out to the beach, hoping to find your partner again. 10/10 would cry again			"

												I don't know, maybe the quote in the store page is correct ""Finally, a video game as artistic and hard to understand as French films"" - maybe Bientôt l'été needs to be played by a conncoisseur of french art.It just doesn't make any sense to me. Why is there a cruise ship? Why is there a dead dog? Also there's no actual dialogue to be held.If the game would give me anything else than loosely throwing phrases at me acompanied by items that don't appear to have anything to do with them then i could absolutely dig it, but in that form... i just feel like i wasted that 1 hour.

												Odd title, knew it going in, so no complaints really. I'm going to go ahead and thumps up the game simply based on the fact some may very well enjoy this as I did, but it's short-lived entertainment so consider that before buying.			"
