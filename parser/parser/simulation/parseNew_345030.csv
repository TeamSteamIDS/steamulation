												It's ugly, it's rough, it's obtuse... and I love it. It has a steep learning curve and the controls are very clunky but once you take some time with it, it's surprisingly fun. I was expecting broken phyics but so far failure feels deserved with my own terrible engineering skills. I especially enjoy being able to drive the truck in the full 3d environment instead of simply pushing ""play"" like in other bridge builders.I'm still scratching the surface of it, slowly getting through the 3D Bridges content before tackling the more advanced 3D Engineers stuff but I have to say I'm enjoying it all way more than I thought I would. I put a video up where I go over things in more detail:

			I can't stop playing this ugly, weird game. It's like Tricky Truck molested Bridge Constructor. Oh, nice typo at 4:45, you idiot. Bop that Like button, Share n' Subscribe to fuel my vanity.		

Edit 11/23/16 It's still fun but I'm getting concerned this is abandoned... It's still pretty rough and difficult to understand.			"

												Just got the game because I love games like this. So far I have went through the tutorial in the bridge part. Tutorals are good and once you get through them you have a good grasp of the controls and the game. I played a few missions after the tutorials and they are very good as well. I think this is definetly a buy. Do not listen to the people talking about how bad the graphics are, they have little to no impact on the game and they are not that bad. The controls are a little off but you get use to them quickly.  I love how you actually drive the vehicle.  This game so far is way better than all the other bridge contruction games I have played and I havent even tried the engineer part of it. Great game.			"

												I can see that alot of work has gone into this game. With that said im sorry to say that this game is just not upto par with  more modern games. The graphics are just god awful with only one setting for shadows. the controls are very un-intuitive. dont expect to be blown away by the level details (the levels are small squares). I can see they are still releasing updates for this game, idk why. The develeper (im guessing there is only one) should honestly start from scratch or make some major graphics and UI overhauls. In the end i could probably spend an hour or two learning the controls, but i dont have time for that. If you have the time and money, support the developer by buying this game (good luck finding a torrent for it).			"

												Once you understood the controls and 3d interface this is a greatsandbox engineering experience!A great, very unique pc game.After playing through the 3d Bridges part, you will know a lot moreabout building.			"

												if you are interessted in technics and physics and you are ingenious and creative than i would say this is one of the best choices. You are very free in what you can do, of course sometimes you have to improvise, but you can!There is 3d Bridges included, what is very different to other bridge constructing games. Its no simple click around, you have to be a bit wise.  The levels will keep you for many hours.Even if you are not good in spatial awareness or architecture, you are able to practise here.			"

												The game runs in a tiny window with extremally low resolution and no way to adjust the window size or resolution. Menues and interface is something from a scary past. Interesting idea, but total crap design. Not recommended. Don't waste your money.			"

Early Access Review
								It's a promising game, but right now, I do not recommend it. I am a big fan of bridge builders and designing games. This one even lets you actually drive your vehicle across it, but the resolution is awful. Even if you max it out, it looks like something out of windows 98. Keep an eye on it, but wait for it to progress. The controls are difficult as well but mostly because of the graphics.			"

												Lots of people complaining about this game, and while the controls are a little odd they're still simple enough a monkey could figure it out in five mintues with just the first two tutorial levels. The graphics aren't ultra-real pixar animated but the physics are in fact what count here as you build your way through the scenarios. You learn real quick when thicker beams/ropes are necessary vs when a lighter object will work, and the truck literally couldn't be easier to drive around unless they did it for you (which wouldn't work because some of what you have to do is pretty interesting). The only issue I've encountered is laying down road tiles, sometimes they'll snap to full shape properly and sometimes they'll tell you it's too much. Scrap it and try again. All around a solid 8/10 if you like a bit of challenge while you build stuff, higher if you don't care how good it looks while you do it. Still a better love story than 50 shades.			"

												I'm not sure which corner of hell this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥crawled out of, but it needs to go home and stay there.If we had the capability to manipulate time and space, send this back to the year 1995 where it belongs.I'm lost for words, I cannot describe how awful this game is.10/10 would recommend			"

												I've been playing games since the DOS era, and never have I seen either:- input lag this bad- audio explode into full volume static the instant the game startsIf you want to give someone a migrane, I fully recommend this game.Honestly I muted the volume and gave it a go anyway. I really wanted to love something like a fully 3d pontifex, but I just can't. the truck responds fine, but the builder has half a second input lag and this makes it horrendous to work with, especially when you realise you'd made an error you need to correct but it'll take forever not due to your own competence, but the incredibly slow control reponse of the game.the tiny game window doesn't exactly help either. Great concept totally killed by the implementation.			"
