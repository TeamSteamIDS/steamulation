												Expected Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 but with tractors. Ended up being Car Mechanic Simulator 2014 with tractors. The difference is that there is no ""free play"" in the sense that you are forced one job after an other and that's it while in Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 you can actually stack up jobs, choose the ones you want and ignore the ones you don't want.This makes all the difference for me. Played it 30mins and uninstalled it. That should be listed as a DLC for Car Mechanic Simulator 2014 and not have 2015 in its name which indicates it's the same basic principle as Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 and it most certainly is not.

												It's a fun, decent game that’s built using the CMS 2014 engine. It plays just like it and not like CMS 2015. The graphics are detailed and look great. I continue to be impressed with PlayWays art department and their attention to detail. The gameplay is pretty much standard fare for the mechanic sim genre. I would've liked to have seen more parts to unbolt or disassemble. Some of the parts just click off and require no wrenching. I get the fine line between fun and tedium, but it is labeled as a “simulator” after all. If you're a fan of CMS 2014 and haven't played CMS 2015 yet, you should feel right at home with this one.""Farm"" Mechanic+ Good textures, lighting and models+ Interesting niche idea, and a kudos to the dev's for branching the genre out+ Detailed parts and equipment""Harm"" Mechanic- Some sounds and music can get a little annoying- Would've been better if built on the CMS 2015 engine- Doesn't come with a straw hat, overalls & cowboy boots!

												A lot more enjoyable than I had expected.  Note, this is my first-ever ""3D mechanic"" type game.It's effectively an appealing 3D puzzle, heavy on the theme ""farm equipment.""  No issues to report, the game is (as of Oct 2015) bug free and looks great.Would appreciate even more depth though, such as:- More equipment to repair.  There are 4 tractor types and one combine, but the tractors all share the same parts on the inside.- More part types per machine (for instance, add electrical and hydraulic systems, which are ignored)- More of a challenge to wring every last dollar out of each repair.  You have the choice to replace a part with a new or good-condition new one from a catalog, or repair it.  Repairing it yourself is always, hands down, the best option.  There should be some cases where this isn't so.  I mean, is it truly possible to bring a damaged part to 100% economically?  Not in real life.- More textures.  Why should a new part come with dents and scratches just like a used part?  In reality the difference is often obvious.Great fun, and not that expensive as it is today.  I also look forward to a future version of this game with more depth. "

												It is a fun game to play, but after playing ""Car Mechanic Simulator 2015"" it a little disappointment.I like such games, but i think they used the engine / basics of ""Car Mechanic Simulator 2014"" and that is why i less like the game. Maybe that ""Truck Mechanic Simulator 2015"" is based on the ""Car Mechanic Simulator 2015"", but i must try first.I recommed this game because i like to play casual / edu games.			"

												WARNING - this game is not for everyone (duh)If you enjoy the zen of games like Bus driver or Eurotruck simulator and were always wondering ""how would this beast look under the hood?"" AND love tractors and farm machinery, then you will enjoy Farm mechanic simulator immensely. Leisurly test drives in a mud-caked cabin, the gentle croaking of a socket wrench - for all the wannabe mechanics out there.			"

												Truck Mechanic 2015 meets the farm. Minimal help, poor economic model, tedious 'Where's Waldo' searching for defective parts on very small unprofitable jobs. Very little difference except color in tractors and combines. f you like boring, repetitive, frustrating games, this is for you. There is no reward for good work. You earn money by selling the used parts you take off the boring tractors and combines you repair. With the fun of Car Mechanic 2014 and improvements in Car Mechanic 2015, I expected better from the publisher. This game is not a worthy successor to either game. If it was $5 US it may be worth it. Otherwise, spend your money elsewhere. At job 75 it kicks you out and you're done. No replay value. Sandbox garages just more of the same.  It's your money, spend it wisely.			"

												the game is good but it needs some add ons you can buy or earn in the game. something like faster unbolting and bolting. the game takes too long to unbolt a part and if the part has more then 5 bolts, you will feel like its never going to get done.			"

												Note: I got this as part of a bundle which seems to resurface on BundleStars. I would recommend doing this, keeping what titles you want, and uploading the rest to Steamgifts.There are a fair number of reviews on here that compare it to Car Mechanic Simulator, especially regarding how it SHOULD have been like CMS 2015 instead of being like CMS 2014. This is an accurate assessment, and I would agree with it. However, that doesn't mean that it is bad, if you are into simulators. I think that the game is good for what it is. If you wold like to come home after a long day, shut your brain off, and fix up a tractor (or the occasional combine), then that's precisely what this is. To put it in a little more detail:The Good:- Graphics are pretty sharp for a simulator- Test driving machinery gives a nice change of scenery and puts you behind the wheel- Things do scale upward at two points during the main missions, giving a slight sense of moving up- Parts are FAR more accessible than they are in the CMS games. I know that the chassis of a car tends to keep things enclosed more than a tractor, so this makes sense, but the fact that I can examine swivels and other parts without havng to take the wheel off altogether is huge.- Most parts can be fixed. There seems to be a kind of moon logic for CMS as to what can be fixed and what cannot, but this makes it kind of an exception when there's something that you are unable to fix and must instead buy.- The work orders scale upwards prettty well, in my opinion. You always have the occasional simple task thrown in, but it starts by telling you exactly what needs replacing, then gradually moves you up to a point where the customer has told you the problem, and it's up to you to find the solution. This rewards you for learning the placement and purpose of different parts over time. I actually am not a vehicle enthusiast whatsoever, but I feel like I know just a little bit more about cars and tractors from playing these games. Not that it qualifies me to be a mechanic or a hobbyist, but I might be able to point to parts under the hood of my car now.The Bad:- Repetitive. Very much so. However, if you just want to, as I said, shut your brain off and fix things up, then this could be pretty minor for you.- Money does nothing. It is used for buying or replacing parts, but if you start to rack up a sizeable total, then there is nothing to do with it.- The money for some jobs is pretty tight. This may seem odd coming right after my last critique, but I remember one job where I was asked to replace a battery. I couldn't fix it, so I needed to buy one. The price? $500. The amount I was paid for the job? $500.- Repairing a part is too expensive. I get that it needs to incur a cost for balance issues, but repairing a part from almost 0% to 100% condition costs almost as much as buying it new. And, since none of the vehicles seem to be missing parts altogether, that makes the used parts shop pointless. Why would I buy a part and fix it up for nearly the price of a new part when I could take the broken part out of the tractor and fix it up for the same price?- The ability to purchase and sell tractors like in CMS 2015 would have been nice. You've got a lot of work orders that you fulfill, and that's about it. My favorite thing to do in CMS 2015 is to buy some old junker, gut it of everything inside of it, fix what I can, replace the rest, and sell it in like-new condition. None of that happens here, unfortunately. You don't get paid anything extra if you turn somebody's old heap into a sterling new machine.-I absolutely hate draining oil in these games. You have to be an absolute surgeon with where you place the container underneath the vehicle, since you can't really see the positioning of both at the same time. You get charged a cleanup fee for not catching it in these games. In CMS 2015, where I buy a heap for cheap, fix it up, and make stupid amounts of money, I don't even bother, but the profit margins here are so small that you need to be careful.The Ugly:- There is a blur on distant objects set by default. I'm apparently a very nearsighted mechanic.- Every tractor that they bring in has filthy windows. I know it's a work machine, but they're so dirty that it can be hard to see the test track at night.- The motor oil in ALL of these games looks like Vectorman exploded. Fluids generally don't flow in a series of spheres.Anyway, this may seem like a lot of gripes, but I still recommend the game if you're into these kinds of things. It has a kind of mindless charm to it if you're getting burned out on other things.			"

												Pretty good for the price. 1.) Can get a bit annoying to target belts, as you have to click them once which recenters the camera on the part then u have to click them again to take them off etc(after the camera shift moves where the mouse is). As they are pretty thin it can be kinda hard to do, and theres probably 20 belts on the combine(idk i made that up but theres alot of them).2.) I don't think the test driving is over done, but, the area to do it in seems alittle confined space wise. Like if i was going to check some huge piece of equipment to see if the breaks or the steering works id want a huge wide open space to do it in. This ones got alot of narrow passageways that makes me nervous that im gonna crash into something. Also, part of the combine test drive requires that u back up the combine, but the mirrors dont work. 3.) The money earned from each job can be all over the place. It seems like the budget is based of the new part cost of the parts the job requires.(no money for labor-unless u count the money u get from reselling the used parts)4.) Fixing parts is pretty expensive. Also, I seemed to have lost money by fixing a part then selling it.5.) New part icons look like worn out rusty pieces.6.)It seems to be based around 2 machines, the combine and the tractor. Id like to see some other farming equipment pieces. For example a hay bailer, widrower, plow, tedder, headers, trailers etc etc.Other than those few things that could use some work I like the game and im glad i bought it.			"

												This game is okay and is about the same as car mechanic simulator (2014) but the parts are way more unrealistic. I have many complaints and one is that about every tractor is the same model and even the big john deere 4255 6 cylinder had a 2 cylinder in he game. The test drives are boring and a waste of time. Go play cms 2015. This doesn't even touch cms 2015 That does make this game bad to me.			"
