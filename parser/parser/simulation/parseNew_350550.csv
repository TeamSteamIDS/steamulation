												HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDOne of the best VN I had the pleasure to play. The Story is very well written  and engaging.  Each character and path will make you go through different emotion.( Keep Tissues close by)The excellent music  helps to make you feel what you are reading.Play Time  15 Hrs. ( Using sometimes a walkthrough)\Worth the asking price.  Will Replay again.10/10			"

												I just finished my first play through of this game and I'm telling you right now - this game is worth every penny. It's absoultely stunning; the author and artist should be extremely proud of themselves. Firstly, the art is beautiful. The animated eyes can look a little awkward on some characters, but overall everything is drawn in lovely detail; the characters are distinct and the backgrounds are never lazy. Then there's the music, which is sort of techno in style; it suits the game and the mood. Personally, I'd buy the sound-track if I could.The story is engaging, interesting and well-written. Despite finishing only today, I'm already hungry for more. There's still so much mystery left, so many characters arcs I haven't explored. I felt for the characters. Some of them were very unique - in particular, I appericated Elcia, who isn't the stereotypical, sweet and loving otome protagonist.Edit: I previously wrote here you cannot skip text, but this isn't true! Holding the down arrow allows you to fly through text. Also, you can press Enter to skip whole segments of the game after you've progressed to a certain point.I'll also add that ""romances"" in this game are restricted to male/female couples, so no female love interests. In addition, none of the romances get too, well, ""romancy"", if that's what you're looking for. There's no declarations of eternal love, passionate kissing or desperate hugs - the affectionation between Elcia and the boys can be interpretted as romantic, platonic or queerplatonic, which I particularly liked.Do yourself a favour and buy this game!

												Area-X is the sequel to X-note, it contains most of the gameplay aspects and elements from the previous VN. GraphicsThe graphics in this VN is pretty much the same as the previous VN which I liked a lot. I was glad that the graphics stayed the same as I truly liked it the last time.  Score: 10StorylineThis VN delivered such an amazing mystery story just like X-note. There are some puzzles to complete to progress in the story, but they aren't too hard to do. Score: 10SoundThe soundtrack definitely improved from the last game, which I was pleased about. The soundtracks seemed more appropriate in this VN and the soundtracks did not seem to repeat itself quite as often, but it still isn't top-notch soundtrack and there was no option for any kind of volume control in the ""Options"". Score: 7StructureThe artwork and the storyline make an awesome combination, the soundtrack was certainly improved, but I don't feel like it was enough. The ""Options"" menu barely had anything to change, there was no option to change the volume...it was either ON or OFF and there no other ""text"" options. Also, just like X-note, there is only 15 save slots which I feel isn't enough if someone is going to do all the 9 routes. Score: 8PriceFor £18.99, this VN is over-priced just like the X-note. I would've liked to see the price reduced to at least £10 as it’s too expensive right now...Score: 5 Overall Verdict: The VN has amazing artwork, a great story and a decent soundtrack going for it, but the lack of options in the ""options"" menu, save slots and the price might be the only aspects keeping this VN down.I totally recommend reading this VN if you have the money for it or you could just wait until it goes on sale.

												This game was more than worth the $25 I paid for it and if I could give it full marks in good conscience, I would. It  has officially joined the ranks of the few OELVNs I'd definitely recommend to people if someone asks me to recommend an English otome game. All of the love interests are endearing in their own way and Elcia is a wonderful heroine, I couldn't help but adore this game.			"

												Area-X has a pretty complex storyline with a ton of endings that can be reached. Each major branch of the storyline is quite different from the others, so players aren't repeating so much of the same story as they play through multiple times. Area-X is definitely a game you will want to play through over and over, as more of the story is unlocked and more of the mystery is unravelled with each different completetion. Really, the game doesn't get started until you complete the first four basic endings, and then there is still a lot left to experience. The replay factor for this game is huge, and grinders who love to take a Visual Novel to its full extent will be fully satisfied by this game.Elcia is a really strong female protaganist with a bit of a sadistic streak to her. Still, she is able to make connections with the other characters in the game, and some of the endings are super sweet. The game isn't about hooking up with the various characters or even finding true love. Some of the endings are more about making a special connection with a character, and the endings are really rewarding.The writing for Area-X could be a little better, but as the writers have done a ton of work for this very long game, some players might be willing to accept some of the weaker parts of the story and move on. Overall, if you can get past some cheesy writing at a few points and press the ""I believe"" button at a few story elements, this game can be a lot of fun. Hard core VN players who love to experience every scene and ending will be rewarded with Area-X, and those same players should find that they certainly got their money's worth out of this game.			"

												WORTH EVERY CENT. Pros:-Romanceable characters are not simple card board cut outs, each have depth.-All characters are integral to the overall story. All pursuable characters have a role in the story and thereby cannot be taken out.-Well thought out story that have little to no plot holes.-art is fantastic-If you've played X-note, all your answers can be found here.-Even w/o playing X-note, you can still play the game as a stand alone.Cons-For most, the price will be a hurdle espcially since there are not even voices. However, given the cohesion of the story and amazing writing/story telling, I do not regret paying at full price.-Lack of romance. There is a MUCH greater focus on the plot. +/- not a fluffy otome game. Plot driven with more emotional/ serious undertones. +/- has minigames. I honestly wasn't too fond of them since I found most puzzles to be quite difficult and required a walkthough. Area-X is one of my favorite otome games and (I know I sound like a broken record) a story that is so well developed, carefully planned, and intriguing that the price is worth it. If you've become jaded with otome games (mobile, pc, etc) do give this is a try. You will witness what a visual novel is truly capable of.			"

												I loved this game. The graphics are great, the story and mystery and unfolding myster are incredibly engaging, and the music offers a nice compliment. Definitely one of my favorites, and well worth the money. Looking forward to another play through to find the endings I've missed.			"

												I really liked this game! It's the only otome I've played where I'd say it WOULD be worth it to play for story and not just the dating aspect. The boys are really cute too! I still need to replay to see a couple extra scenes but I've already finished every route. Pros:-Immersive story-Well written plot-Strong female protagonist (crazy rare in VNs!)-Avoids cliches and tropes-Beautiful artwork-Unlockable skip scene option to make replays fasterCons:-No skip read option (I've played another game my this studio and it seems that this might be true for all their games, they have a skip function but not option to only skip read text)-Mediocre music-Short (this game is absolutely worth it on sale though!)

												If someone asked me for visual novel reccomedations, this would be right at the top of my list. Otome or not, don't let the label put you off. The plot and the way it is interwoven with each route and the characters, I really can't say much without spoling things but just, wow 10/10. Incredibly creative and emotionally engaging. Sucks you in with a light and offbeat tone but don't be fooled. Please play this game! If you've never played a visual novel this is a great place to start. If not the best!(I played this in offline mode, hence the lack of hours. I think it's about 15+ hours? And honestly I'll be replaying it again and from the look of other reviewers I am not alone)			"

												I thoroughly enjoyed the game. The female protagonist is strong, intelligent, and has a sense of humor. The description says 5 romance options - I really wouldn't consider them romances. They were more like deep relationships/friendships that developed between characters as a part of the story, which I really enjoyed and thought was well done. Touching story with plenty of laughs. This was one of the better VNs I have played.			"
