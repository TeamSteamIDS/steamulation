												Really disappointing, actually have nothing positive to say about it.Terrible recognition of notes from my acoustic guitar, no room for dynamics at all and no symbols for hammer ons or bends. Essentially, if you always dreamed of being able to attain that oh-so-good robotic midi sound then learn from this game, it'll to teach you how to rock out 'Frére Jacques' like a musical birthday card in no time at all.The most pathetic thing is that for several of the instruments, parts of the songs are too high or low and instead of modifying it to at least have the notes in a different octave, you're just given a cross as if to say 'sorry, couldn't be arsed to do that part'I could go on all day but I'll just say don't buy it and go play Rocksmith.

												As a 4th year Music Composition Major and a vocalist, I can say that this game certainly provides a rather interesting way to improve intonation. Though it advertises as only teaching a few instruments, it will actually pick up anything that you play over a microphone.What I will say is that the editing software is rather basic. If you want to write a decent score, then let me inform you that there are far better programs that are out there for free. However, the editing software will provide a way to upload your own compositions to the game. It's a bit clunky, and it takes a little bit to figure out exactly what the program is doing, but it does work.Overall, I'd say this is absolutely something that an aspiring musician ought to check out, and especially so if you wish to perform on an instrument like Violin, Viola, Cello, Double Bass, Trombone, or Voice!If you wish to see some gameplay footage, then you can watch this video that I have made here:

												I got this program for vocal work and I'm very disappointed. There are no vocal arrangements for any of the songs and there are no lyrics. The only place vocal support is listed is in the scales. Looking at the piano options, I'm only seeing ways to practice with the right or left hand--no option to play together. This was a complete waste money.Edit: The makers have confirmed to me the program does not support lyrics at all and offered me a second copy of the editor to make up for it, which isn't particularly helpful. The piano options have no chords and can only do one hand at a time, so you just learn to pick out one note with each hand and have no option to put it together. The drills are only scales, no interval or diction work, which is limiting despite the important of scales. This may be useful for the other instruments, but not for piano or voice.			"

												I was very interested in the concept of this game. Having owned Rocksmith 2014 I noticed that this game supports the Rocksmith Real Tone cable. So once I had the game running, I noticed that it was not very good at picking up notes on my bass guitar.In conclusion, if you're a bass guitar or electric guitar player looking for a game that will help improve your skills then Rocksmith 2014 is your best option right now.

												So far I've used this software with Alto Sax and guitar. For basic sight reading and learning proper tone generation on the sax, I'm impressed. For the Guitar, however, the software is more limited.  You can certainly use it for learning scales and sight reading, but because there are so many different positions you can play a particular scale at on the neck, and the fact that the software seems to only support one position, it's not as helpful.  Still, if you get your fingerings from a book and simply use the software to reinforce basic sight reading, I think it's probably one of the best tools available.  For learning pop songs by rote, RockSmith is way more effective (and entertaining), but for actual scales and drills, Songs2See leads the way.  Pro: Very simple interface. Con: Very simple interface. There doesn't seem to be any mechanisim for theory instruction beyond drills.			"

												This is a great game for practicing new songs and after some fiddling around, I found an easy way to create new songs with the editor -> midi + audio is the key :)Still I have to say it could be bit more polished and editor isn't that easy to use until you figure out where everything is hidden.

												A misunderstood gem!!The quick version: Good if you have a musical basis, doesn't replace other software but is an outstanding addition, could use a comunity like iRealb (though that might get them in trouble? who knows), if the video description makes no sense to you, keep it in the back of your mind as there might be some ground to cover (but you'll love it when the time comes)Now the longer one:First of all this is by no means competition for Rocksmith, Yousician/Flowkey/Guitartricks/etc, or Synthesia for that matter. It should not be compared with them or games, not because it's lacking in any way, simply because it is really a different category of application.What it is, is a launching pad for learning repertoire and practicing scales (though you may need to use the editor as the list is short and has no copyrighted music). The program asumes you have at least a passing familiarity with sheet music reading, and know more or less what it takes to make a sound out of the instrument but are either having trouble remembering the specifics (for example you may not have memorized the fingering of a particular instrument) or have issues with intonation (singing, violin, upright bass, etc). The application that most resembles it (that I know of) is Canta, however this is much more fleshed out and quite honestly well worth the asking price provided you can orient yourself.  I should add some important tidbits:* Guitar also supporst TAB, which is great* Keyboards work one hand a time. Enough to carry you over the early learning stages (as you are supposed to learn each hand independently, then combine them on your own). * Combining this with the Rocksmith cable is delightful, quite honestly I recomend this or a direct box. * Some instruments can't be plugged into a cable... But often a piezo transducer will do (which you can make or buy cheaply, just look around in YouTube); Other times a simple USB microphone might do the trick (you can use your laptops microphone just don't complain if it doesn't work it won't magically make it a high quality mic)* Havent used the editor, will update if Steam allows when used but the tutorial shows it is complicated, but far from impossible.ConclusionIf you have some grounding on music theory and could use some fingering suggestions, or would like a backing track while reading the score, or someone who has intonation issues you may have found what you need . And yes if you make your own complete custom instrument with a radically unique pitch, it will still work (range will be up to you though)I would say that multi instrumentalists that haven't fully mastered perfect pitch or rythm or would like to have a backing track and are willing to put a little effort could not have found a better tool.  About meI studied a little bit of classical and jazz guitar but am mostly a self taught guitarrist that recently picked-up the bass, keyboards, ukelele, recorder, violin... So yeah for a person like me that wants to be able to make my own ensemble compositions and record them, this is one of my strongest tools.			"

												So far it seems that this can be a great tool for learning an instrument.  Especially if you have no other reference, like a teacher or someone else that can play with you.  The only thing that I would like to mention is that the Flute in the game is actually a Recorder.  Would we perhaps see an actual silver flute in the game anytime soon?  Asking because I'm a flute player.I did buy the editor too, haven't spend enough time with it though.  Would be nice if we could somehow get more songs in the game. But guessing that royalties are always an issue.Great job!  Please continue to develop this game! It has lots of potential!			"

												I wish I had taken the time to read the other reviews before purchasing this.Absolutely god-awful terrible for piano. I'm slamming on the keys as hard as I can, and it's barely registering them at all. When it does pick one up, it's halfway through the note I'm supposed to be holding. Where's the logic in that? Let alone that it only lets you play one note at a time, one hand at a time.I mean, if you want a less-fun DDR with a keyboard, go ahead I guess? But if you actually want to learn something... keep looking.			"

												Using this to learn to play violin. I'm finding it to be extremely helpful - there's a learning mode where until you play the correct pitch, it doesn't go on to the next note. So if you're trying to learn fingering on a guitar or violin or what not, it shows you what note you're playing next to what you are supposed to be playing.As an additional note, having the instrument visualized with dots for where your fingers should be is pretty helpful if you are new to the instrument, as well			"

												Although I recommend this software/game I must say as a piano player I am disapointed. The main reason is ""would you teach a saxophone student to play with separated hands?"", If the answer is ""no"" (because obviously some notes deppend on both hands), why should such thing happen to piano if the instrument has harmony and lots of poliphony? If only it was some teaching approach or something, but no you will always play right or left, never both together, and I'm writting this because I think all the people involved in this project have the skills to change this. Guys, it feels lika a non-piano player approach to the software. Cmon, right and left hand together. I know the english is scrappy but I think you will understand the point here.So, good things about it: Songs rated by difficulty (nailed it) also by instrument part (great). The editor thing is a must have if you plan to use the software more often.I would add that we got some words as ""super"" ""ok"" and stuff, its great but maybe something more could happen. Guitar hero and many other games can show more about this gamefication of the music playing (also the term itself can help a lot). It needs to feel more AWESOME, more BOOM more game. Some other points to think is abou the white in the page (please read this). Some recent studies point that the white paper has a bad influence in our eyes. Old yellowish paper texture if possible would made it fantastic!			"

												The Songs2See game is a great and flexible learning tool for a wide range of instruments typically using a microphone to analyse your playing and rating your performance creating incentive to keep practicing.For guitars the game will also allow you to use a Rocksmith cable as a mic source!The interface is neat and clean and stable - possibly just needs an easy stop/start key (such as the spacebar) instead of having to click the play button with the mouse each time you play a song.Awesome.Which brings me to the editor.The Songs2See editor is the companion editing software to the Songs2See game. It is a decent authoring tool for the game allowing you to transcribe your own (or any other) piece of music for use in game - which then becomes like a lesson.The editor interface is quite buggy and tends to crash regularly - Give your work a filename early on and hit the save button regularly!The editor is also fairly inflexible - you must choose the song length and tempo when you create the file and it seems that it cannot yet be changed after this so that if you wind up with a blank space at the end or not enough room left to add notes you will have to create a new file to the correct length and copy/paste your work back into the new file.When authoring music for the guitar there does not seem to be a way of telling the interface which fret/string you want to play a note on so that in game it will flash up in the incorrect location on the fretboard.A neat feature is that the editor can analyse an mp3 song and auto transcribe it for you working out the tempo and length.I have no hesitation recommending this software despite it's current flaws as it is a wonderful learning tool for many musical instruments.Hopefully the developers will add more useful tools into the interface and work out the bugs in it.

												Song2See is pretty good I suppose. The mic goes a bit wonky when I play really low notes on the guitar, but other than that, it's alright. A fun toy if nothing else.A note for everyone who wants this game: Buy the package witht the editor. You get stuck with about 20 classical pieces and no more if you get the normal version. The editor allows you to add in your own songs.			"

												A very light, easy to use program used to help you learn some songs on several instruments such as the guitar, flute, piano, bass, violin, and a few others. If you have played Guitar Hero or Rock Band, you'll know exactly what to expect. Comes with some default songs built-in to learn, but I would recommend buying the editor as well, as that seems to be the only way to add in songs of your choosing. It even comes with a built-in tuner, which was unexpectedly nice.One of the game modes, ""Learning Mode,"" will stop the song at each note and will not progress the song until you play the note on your accompanied instrument. I imagine this works quite well for instruments such as the piano or the flute. However, as a beginner violin player, I find this gamemode to be very picky. Perhaps it is my technique, or maybe my microphone is not a good quality one, but I find that I have to play a single note a few times for the song to continue, as the program registers my notes as either a flat or a sharp and I have to split the atom to get the correct pitch. I won't hold this against the game, though, as I'm probably just trying to convince myself I'm secretly not terrible.Ending on a high note, Songs2See is a very sound program overall. It measures up to my expectations. Take a minuet to give it a try.Tromboner.			"

												Love what the developers are going for, great idea for an educational and fun music learning game. I play the Tenor Saxophone, now right here I said that I was disappointed in how little songs there were for the saxophone, but, thanks to the Developers commenting on this originally, I now know that you CAN play almost all of the included songs on the Saxophone, and I assume any other instrument, even if the title doesn't say so. If you want to know more just look at their comment below. I was also disappointed to see how little songs and song categories to see in general.Another thing that I said I was ""disappointed"" with was in how little songs there is to play in general, and now I know that it can be very, VERY hard to get popular/trending music, now only because it can be hard to program it into the game (not sure how hard that it is) but mainly very hard to just get the rights for the song in general. Because it can be a huge investment that they might not even get back, so I don't blame them if they don't have a lot of very iconic songs that someone might want. Before I had said that you shouldn't buy the game now because it is still very early in development and to wait until it adds more songs, but now I have an entirely different approach. Buy it now, because I bet that in the future this game will rise in price, and even if it doesn't have a lot of songs, it is still very fun to use. P.S. If the developers are reading this, just an FYI is that the soprano Sax doesn't usually look like the alto and tenor and bari, it looks more like a clarinet, just a little tip in case you didn't know already. :)			"
