												Terraform is a fantastic turn based puzzle game. It is quite challenging while learning the rules, however the University levels are very good at introducing game concepts one at a time, and mistakes aren't punished while you figure out terraforming solutions; indeed there are undo tools built in. Well done, Jonas Holgersson!			"

												The game starts out very easy and work your way through everything you need to know, but quickly get progressively harder. Who would have known that you could make a turn-based puzzle game this fun! It's very easy to spend up to hours trying to figure out how to get the gold star and if you can beat the score on hard maps. Can highly recommend this to anyone who enjoy making or solving challenging puzzles.  It's intuitive and easy to learn, but all the tools and the built-in editor will give you fun for hours, alone or trying to beat your friends on hard puzzles!			"

												It's a new-thinking puzzle-game that starts out easy and get progressively harder as you go on. There are maps that are really challenging and fun!As an awesome bonus you also get the map editor, so when you've finished the main game you can create your own maps to challenge your friends! Why not have a speedrun tournament where you see who can finish the other persons map the fastest? It's really fun!			"

												First:Do not mistake this for another Sim Earth! It is a puzzle game.That being said, Terraform is a very challenging puzzle game with a lot of different elements that interact in plausible ways (shovels dig holes, hot weather dries soil, cold weather freezes water, etc.) The plausibility makes it easy to remember the rules of interaction. It starts of easy and gets pretty tough towards the end. If you like a challenge, this is the game for you. An editor promises unlimited puzzling fun.			"

												A great idea for a puzzle game. You can see what is going on in the videos but just to sum it up: you're trying to get certain geographic hexagons to turn into other geographic hexagons, or stop them from becoming a different hexagon. All in all this game is not particularly hard until you get to year four.The only negative review for this game is actually the most helpful review because it states that the game is jokingly easy until you get to year four (level 47) where the puzzle is just insanely hard and requires you to completely remember everything you've learned from the previous years. That's fine and all because that's how puzzle games usually proceed with upping their difficulty, however if you aren't planning to just play through a large amount of the game in one setting, you will most likely have forgotten a good amount of the ways to do some of the things that you need to.I honestly would not recommend this game if it wasn't for the fact that the price tag is so, so low for the amount of content this game has. Get this game if you love puzzle games but make sure you actually like a reallly hard challenge.			"

												Do you like puzzles? Do you like puzzles that make you think? Do you like puzzles that make you scratch your head?Well Terraform seems to do all the above and more. It has a great learning curve slowing throwing in new elements with each new puzzle and then a puzzle or 2 to reinforce what you have learned so far. It is definately making me think more as it goes. You can start a puzzle and stare at it for a bit to get a logical procession in your head and then find it only half works. Puzzles are supposed to be just that - A PUZZLE. Good job of doing that.For the low price it will give you plenty to think about.Its a simple to learn yet complex game worth taking a look at.			"

												Cute little puzzle game. Starts out simple, but gets more advanced over time. New mechanics are introduced gently.Due to the low price I would recommend this to anyone looking for a casual puzzler. Very suitable for children.			"

												A beautifully challenging set of puzzles. I especially like the graded scoring system. If you just want to spend a few minutes, you can look at the hint and complete the puzzle fairly quickly. More challenging is to get the gold bonus (usually a different method to the hint so you can work it out for yourself). Finally, for the ultimate challenge, try to beat or equal the online rating, which really tests your knowledge of the subtle nuances of the game, especially since the original game has been around for a year on a different platform than the PC version which was my first encounter with Terraform, so people have had time to come up with good ideas for high-scoring solutions. Some planets are so well designed, they have a great number of different solution methods, with some red herrings (like tools you don't need which mislead you and some obvious methods suggested by terrain which end up failing for a subtle reason). Okay, not EVERY planet is a work of art (some of the planets introducing asteroids are a bit perfunctory in comparison to the great depth of most levels) but a pretty large number are. I have not managed (yet!) to equal the online rating on quite a few of the puzzles, but any time I equal or beat it gives a real glow of satisfaction. Lateral thinking is needed for some of the best scores, and you need to keep an open mind and avoid making too many assumptions, so it's a real brain workout. The only quibble I have is that the online ratings don't seem to be completely stable (the game allows me to upload a lower online rating than the original sometimes, which I now try to avoid doing) but hopefully that will be fixed soon.

												I did not expect to enjoy TERRAFORM so much! The play is simple. There is no time limitation, purely ""analyze the situation and come up with the best answer"" type. It is an excellent game when I need a short break.Using speech recognition (Dragon NaturallySpeaking) as my mouse, I found this to be a disability-friendly game.			"

												First 20 levels : Lots of interesting tools and tactics as I walk through how to play.    Nothing is out of reach.Second 20 levels : Getting harder.    I have to replay multiple times and review hints.    It all starts to seem forced, like it's exclusively a puzzle game instead of changing a planet for humanity.Level 47 - first of the 4th year of university.   Full stop.    No matter what I do, I can't solve the level, to say nothing of attaining the ""gold star"" that they introduce.    Next level is no better.    So, I'm stuck, and done.I'd call this more of a hard core puzzle game.   I play very few of these types, and this one lost me before the ""real game"" even began.			"

												Very original. Very fiendish. If you like puzzles you will like this.There are several different kinds of terrain, eg. rock, mountain, desert, basin, half-filled basin, lake, seedlings, trees, parched trees. You are given a starting position and your task is to turn the target hexes into the specified terrain. You can use different tools, eg. seeds, spade, and specify the type of weather e.g. rain, hot, or fair. The puzzle is turn-based and after every turn each hex may change according to the rules, hopefully getting you closer to your goal with each turn. The constraints which pose the challenge are nicely balanced by the good range of strategic options which present themselves at each turn. It's not easy to think of a similar game to compare it with so all I can say is: if you like the sound of an original turn-based puzzler, give it a go. I don't think you will be disappointed.			"

												I've been looking for a game like this for a LONG time: a turn based puzzle game that isn't too abstract (no numbers, black squares, white backgrounds and soothing tunes), with a clear turn limit.It sort reminds me of Settlers of Catan regarding the size of the playfield and how you progress on it. It could actually be an interesting board game title.Terraform feels like a 4X game (you've got to spread settlements on some planets) mixed with a  nature simulation. Deserts grow, water flows, forests get bigger, all based on clear rules. It's the best puzzle game I've played this year so fear.			"

												Fairly simple game, definitely not over price. They introduce you to each new concept and tool slowly so you don't have to worry about getting lost. Unfortunately its simply boring. Each level only appears to have one ""proper"" way to complete. I say proper because levels eventually have bonus objectives but those are basically just for you to try for a ""perfect"" run through. If you're really curious you can pick it up, and not worry since its so cheap.			"

												Arguably not a great looker, nevertheless it's still quite the game.The game challengers the player to look further than the end of their nose.Here's a video critique for those who like a more visual approach:


YouTube™ Video: Terraform Gameplay - First Look ★ Review 

			Views: 264		

			I take a look at the Mechanics, Gameplay, Options and Design of the recent Puzzle game Terraform. Terraform on Steam: Subscribe to my channel: http://tinyurl.com/q97e3gr Follow me on Twitter:...		

The good:- The game entices the player to approach puzzles in different ways.Players need to find the perfect balance between handling tools and weather.The game requires you to focus and plan ahead, stratagise before making your move.- The game is chock-full of puzzles. I played only 2 hours and finished around 30 puzzles. The game has about 138 puzzles with 30 extra puzzles so far. This is without taking into account the fact of puzzles getting bigger and harder which takes you more time to finish.- The game has Steam Workshop integration. Whilst Steam Workshop not being as great as it could be, it's good to see a game integrate it and embrace it. The game is open to custom made puzzles and community input which fits especially puzzle games.The bad:-The game's graphical quality is not great but this is not a big issue. However the quality of music is terrible. There's a single song on loop which is full of static noises.- The UI is not that bad but could use a little bit more rearrangement and clarification, as buttons and options are placed a bit oddly.Overall a decent game for some newly skinned puzzle experience. Don't expect it to be spectacular it's just good for what it is. p.s.The price/content ratio is stunning in my opinion, although this is something you'll have to decide for yourself.			"

												Somewhat interesting puzzle game. As far as I got it wasn't really a challenge, but the learning curve is very flat, so it might get challenging once more concepts are introduced. Unfortunately, it's not available on Linux. On windows (10), it first didn't let me change to full screen or change the resolution, then when I restarted the game wouldn't start. Definitely not recommended.			"
