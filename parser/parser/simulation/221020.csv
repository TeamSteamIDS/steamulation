  TL;DR: DO NOT PURCHASE   The game is broken and unfinished. The game is abandoned by the developers.  They're censoring constructive negative criticism. They essentially took the $2 million dollars and ran. They're not letting new potential buyers know it's abandoned.The GameI played the game for around 300 hours in total. Only around 80 of those were recorded by Steam due to me playing the other hours within Steam Offline mode. In darkness and secrecy, the game was abandoned by the developers during Alpha, the updates stopped rolling out and eventually, many months later a non significant update was released and the game was now considered ""Finished"" according to the their Steam Store page. But in truth, the game was nowhere near being finished, it had and still has a ton of bugs and issues. There's a lot of things missing from the game, and the AI is beyond horrible. The AI is bad enough to give your townsfolk a tendency to end up killing themselves. I wish I could say that events such as that are rare, but they aren't. It's common and in some occasions, it causes your entire village to die.MarketingThere were no/still isn't any announcements or information on the Town's store page letting potential new buyers know that the project has been abandoned.  Eventually articles surfaced stating that the game was indeed abandoned, the developers were interviewed and claimed  ""In fact, the team is currently thinking about instead working on a sequel to Towns through which they want to implement all the features that they could not with the original game.""  and within their community forums, one of the developers claim that Originally posted by Burningpet on www.townsgame.com: Towns is very much alive and kicking.	 Originally posted by Burningpet on www.townsgame.com: So so far Towns has sold more than 200k units and generated a gross revenue of more than 2M usd. and although we are pretty sure we can and will sell a lot more, we still see it as a huge success. Dictatorship / CensorshipAfter reading some reviews of the game, and reading the original posts people made on the Steam and/or townsgame.com forum. (Including deleted ones, thanks to caching) It's quite clear that the developers are silencing anyone and everyone who is posting/discussing negative critizism of their game. And they're doing it forcefully, they're also going the extra mile by deleting the post, banning the user and then responding to it publicly, claiming the player posted harassment among other accusations. Due to them removing the post/thread and banning the user, there's no way for a reader to verify what happened unless the reader has cached versions of the forum. Out of the 50 posts I read through, which all had been deleted for ""Boycotting"" ""Harassment"" and other reasons. Only a mere 6 of them had anything that was even borderline harassment or boycotting.ConclusionEssentially, me and many others came to the conclusion that they took the money and ran. They're still trying to get people to buy it by censoring everything they can. And the reason for abandoning the game? Because they were ""burnt out"" yet they claim they will make a sequel. Do not purchase this game, and I highly advice people not to purchase any future releases or new games from this company/developers ever again based solely on what they're doing with this game and the social media involving it.RefundValve added a refund addition to Steam on June 2nd, 2015 that could potentially allow customers to refund Towns as the development of the game has halted.Originally posted by Valve on http://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds/?l=english:You can request a refund for nearly any purchase on Steam—for any reason. Maybe your PC doesn't meet the hardware requirements; maybe you bought a game by mistake; maybe you played the title for an hour and just didn't like it.

It doesn't matter. Valve will, upon request via help.steampowered.com, issue a refund for any reason, if the request is made within fourteen days of purchase, and the title has been played for less than two hours. There are more details below, but even if you fall outside of the refund rules we’ve described, you can ask for a refund anyway and we’ll take a look.FeedbackDon't hesitate responding with any constructive criticism that I could use to improve my reviews. Also note that posting your own experiences with Towns whether good or bad assists potential newcomers in making their decision in whether to purchase the game or not.			"

												This highlights the worst part of Steam Greenlight.  The developer posted a ton of ideas, some good-looking screenshots, and pitched a solid concept.Before I even get to the review, I'd like to note that THE DEVELOPER HAS ABANDONED THE GAME.  He took the ""Early Access"" money, cranked out an Alpha-at-best version of the game and left.  He got another developer to theoretically try to finish the game, but the hopes of that actually happening are looking pretty dim.So as for the game itself.  You build a town to attract heroes to explore and clear dungeons.  Sounds good.  The execution is NOT.  It's a buggy mess, with villagers having AI and path-finding so bad that they often get stuck and starve.   You control which heroes arrive, can't tell them what to do, and can't even sell them items.  The crafting system is tedious and the building system feels like it's constantly fighting against you.It's a buggy, barely-playable mess with no endgame, few sounds, and almost no animations.  Avoid like the plague.EDIT: The developers responsible for taking your money and running are Xavi Canal and Ben Palgi.  I've been asked a few times to mention them here so if you see any projects from them in the future, you can remember this cash-grab and avoid them.			"

Of course, they got that way AFTER their game was sold... unfinished. Hope they enjoyed the 2 PLUS Million Dollars they made. I will never again buy from ANYONE who was involved in the making of this ""game"" . Rip-off artists, and scammers. They KNOWINGLY sold this game unfinished. This game was NOT an Early Access Game, but ""realeased as done."" They should refund the cash paid for the game, and remove it from Steam. Warning: DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!

												This game has been abandoned by the devs over and over again. During the most recent sale I pointed users to a great review about the history of the game and what has happened with the devs.. It was removed as ""boycott thread"" I then made a post regarding how it wasn’t and it was a review... I was then banned from the forums. I have never seen such shadyness from developers or steam forum moderators.  Stay FAR AWAY!!!Here is why I was supposedly banned...You have been banned from Towns Discussions by a forum moderator for your post in ""Towns General Discussions"": 
YetiChow Moderator 3 hours ago 
Deleted thread ""Don't buy this game"". Reason: spam, calls to boycott, and the fact that the same topic has been done to death already. Also a rather icky necroposting.

A reminder, these kind of boycott threads will NOT be tolerated. There's a reviews page for reviews; if people ask for opinions then that's another place to give them; but these unsolicited boycott threads are just unacceptable.

I highly disagree with this. My original post was notifying potential buyers of a great review that was written about this game. It told the back story of what happened with the devs for this game and how they abandoned it(surprise? it just happened again). How could that be a ""boycott thread""? If I had somehow managed to find a positive review for towns and asked the user base to read it and get educated of the background of the game it would somehow be tolerated. This just again shows how shady you are YetiCHow for removing threads entirely and labelling them as something they are not.

Update:  YetiChow has now updated his original post to again try to make me look bad.  If you are going to police the forums in a dictatorship manner and not allow users to share reviews or their opinions unless it is in a positive way atleast own up to it.

YetiChow Moderator
I was going to avoid naming names in the hope this was an isolated incident; but apparently that's not the case. Also deleted another topic by the same user bizkit_109, written in response to my deleting the original thread. This user has now been warned, and further behaviour in the same manner will not be tolerated.

Apparently they like to silence any honest negativety towards the game and if you display any of that you get the big ban hammer.  What a joke this develpoer is and the staff it lets moderate its steam forums.

UPDATE!!! MAY 28 2015 !!!!!
After a user made a post asking YetiChow to comment about my review he again went after me and spread more lies saying the following:
YetiChow Moderator
For the record, I'm the one who issued that ban, not Supermalparit, not Burningpet, nor Moebius (the ""second dev"" who seems to be the person this post is addressed to?). The reason I issued that ban was because the poster was spamming (and worse, abusing other posters as well as the developers; the spam offence happened to be the straw which finally broke the camel's back).
I didn't want him again to be able to lie to the community and spread more misinformation so I confronted him on this as I never attacked the devs nor another forum poster.  He then banned me permanently from the forums.  Here is the screen shot of his post, my reply, and my new ban.  What a joke this guy is.

												Original Dev took the $2mil Alpha sales and scarpered. Sold it to a second dev who said, after abandoning it:“I hope you are not too disappointed. And if you are: I’m really sorry. I’m quite new to indie game dev and I couldn’t really see that the game sales were declining that rapidly. I guess if I had more experience I would have seen it comming …,”Abandon ware.It's a real shame - what exists is broken but playable. If they delivered what was initially promised it would be a cracking little indy game.Moral of the story? Don't buy Alpha, Beta or Early Access of anything. Ever.			"

												So if Moderators or others push you to the demo, its not the best way to understand how the game is or how well it runs. First off, the demo does not give you the greatest feel for the game, just proves that the basic mechanics are working....I'd also like to point this out, HEAVY MODERATION in the forums, see link below. If YETI does not agree with you or finds a reason to delete ""negative"" posts, he will. If you post in the forums, YETI will justify and ""help"" you make sense of the horrible AI and how the game was built as SH***Y as it is but it was all done like this on purpose. He responds to every comment to mask the amount of players who feel the same way about the game. Discussions that become overwhelming negative he will delete because the discussion is going in ""circles"" Check his own delete blog on the link below. This type of moderation in the forums is one attempt to keep the game alive. He HEAVILY defends the game at every chance even with all of the people arguing with him. The only people who agree are Lvl 0 Steam Users with Blocked Profiles.... Enough said. http://steamcommunity.com/app/221020/discussions/0/35220315866244607/Now for the review:The game is time consuming which is why you may see players with a fair amount of hours, the bugs become more apparent the longer you play. Horrible AI, AI starving itself with plenty of food. Slow productivity of the AI. You have to micromanage every aspect of the game which to me and everyone else in the forums, is horrible AI construction and pathing that they will not fix. If you attempt to build a house all at once in the game, the builders constructing it will not stop working on it until it is finished, that includes dieing in the process from starvation (with plenty of food next to them).... feel free to drop me a comment on here with anything else you would like to know. *I do not respond to Lvl 0 Steam accounts with blocked profiles, your comment will get deleted. Dungeons get even more involved and getting to them is a pain... to say the least. Construction is not polished at all. To sum it up, the game runs, if you work around the poor mechanics of the game, it is playable. Its extremely time consuming which looking at this game, it should be a faster payout of fun since its a bit behind its time. There is no Dev support in the forums, just moderators pushing the game every now and then. Development is next to nothing, look at the update history.			"

												Ok, I have a lot of hours in this game so maybe you could say that I got my money's worth - or maybe I just have a penchant for watching little pixel people go about their business(dying of starvation or eating everything in sight, dry-humping monsters to death or walking straight into a village full of hostiles) .. actually, I also go afk a lot and hang out in the kitchen.. that might be why :pAnyway, I do not recommend buying the game in its current state:- very buggy- rough and unpolished(for example, last time I played the little pixel people had like 2 frames of animation when walking and looked like they were dry-humping monsters upon attacking them). - feels incomplete, as in missing game-play features.- very, very slow updates(if you can even call it an update when one or two little bugs are fixed after several months).- Dishonest developer: this is the biggest reason for me right now as to why you shouldn't waste your money on this game. Let me clarify .. some other reviewers mention Early Access but the fact of the matter is that this game was not released as Early Access, it was being offered as a finished product when I bought it back in 2012.. well no way was it finished then and still isn't now 2 years later! It could be said that Early Access hadn't started back then so we might forgive that transgression - but then this game should either be categorized as Early Access right now or removed from Steam because it isn't the complete product it is being marketed as.*if you want a charming game where little computer people wander round and build a home, eat, sleep, dig up treasure, fight monsters, etc.. then go check out 'Craft the World', this is an Early Access title that already feels like it's polished and finished(except for missing later campaign levels); it certainly feels like a AAA title compared to Towns..

												SEE BELOW FOR AWESONE ALTERNATIVESThis games has a terrible AI. Citizens will walk right into enemy territiory to pick up a random bone. They will refuse to stop working and starve to death. They are worthless at producing food weapons or anything else. Forget the grandoise buildings you see in the screenshots, just building a hut can be a monumental task.The game is otherwise very buggy, terribly balanced and lacks a lot of features. It has been completly abandoned by the developers.I recomend instead;STONEHEARTH; A very similar game that is constantly updated, already has numerous features, great 3D graphics and most importantly a great AI. Has made incredible acess since it first realeased.GNOMORIA; A game that is also very similar to towns, with a similar graphics style and a fourth of the price or less when on sale. ALso has much better AI than townsCOLCKWORK EMPIRES; A game with simialr gameplay to towns but with a steampunk vibe. It is regularly updated and the game has made great progress since its early acess release.In other words all these games will give you very similar gameplay with better AI, and more importantly, a developement team which is on top of updating and talking about their game. Just do not buy towns!DWARF FORTRESS- Probably the orginal game with a town building survival gameplay. It is incredibly deep, and a is practically a cult classic. It is infamous for its difficulty, but you can find it for free at bay12 games.			"

This game had a lot of potential and I had a blast with it a few years back when keeping in mind that it was Early Access.

												If you want a Dwarf Fortress Clone with graphics, please play Gnomoria. This game is a very low quality and not fit for release. It is a bummer that this was one of the first game to be ever Greenlit. Contrary to the public belief, this game is not and never was Early Access, yet we got an Alpha Version of the game sold. The store page also says that it will be continuously updated, but this does not happen. We get a patch all few months, which tends to break even more things. The visuals are okay, but the menus are just downright amateurish, the tutorials useless and the game absolutely explains nothing. Hello Developers, it is 2013, wake up. You don't need to hold my hand, but if you don't explain how your game works, then there is not fun to be had. Crawling through half the internet to understand how the game works is not something you want. Gnomoria is way more intuitive and has a clear progress line, even if you never played this genre. Don't touch it with a 10 ft pole held by someone else on the other side of the street.Update May 7th, 2014:The devs have now officially abandoned the game.

												Held off for so long on writing this.330 hours... Must be a great value right? Nope, nearly all of it was idle in the background while I waited huge amounts of time for the terrible AI to get anything done. This game is a tedious unpolished mess, filled with either insane levels of micro management or giant periods of idle time. The AI is dirt poor and starves to death doing basic tasks. Asking questions about it on the forums will get you told by the moderator how it's not a bug and is really your fault... this is only true because you bought the game.The dev also seems to think it's cool to appoint fanboy's and white knights as moderators. The Steam moderater doesn't moderate, he takes a clear side and bans people who disagree. Do not buy this game, do not support this dev.

												I honestly can't say I'd recommend this game at any price point.  There are quite a few other games out there that fill the same niche and many more currently in development, e.g. Banished and Stonehearth, and sadly actually have active development staff.  Yes that is currently a problem for this game.  If like me you picked up this game back when it was first greenlit only to assume that it would actually get patched and improved over time I feel your pain.  If you're looking at reviews to decide whether it's worth your money you can get a lot more enjoyment out of other games at any price point and a lot less frustration.  You can mod the heck out of the game manually to make it somewhat passible to get past some of the more glaring development omissions but it only gets you so far.  I can't say I've finished a single session with this game feeling happy about spending the time there.  You want fun, look elsewhere.			"

Development of this game has been cancelled, and no refunds are being given. The game went through Steam Greenlight prior to Early Access existing, which is the only reason it doesn't have an EA tag on the store page.

												The first and most infamous game to come out of Steam's ""Greenlight"" program, Towns is an incomplete and buggy mess, released in a beta state (yet conusmers such as myself were not initially informed of the fact it was still in beta) that never was completed, but rather ABANDONED by its programmer in a miserable state.  That's right, the sole developer/programmer took the money and ran.  The game is as complete as it will ever be, and that's very depressing.Towns was billed as a ""Dwarf Fortress""-type game, wherein you build a town atop a ""dungeon"" filled with various baddies.  Your goal is to build a nice enough town to support guards to protect your citizens, and adventurers who will come to your city (given your city has the necessary buildings) and venture into the depths to assault the creatures therein.  The problem is the programming is dreadfully incompetent.  The AI is beyond dumb.  People will stand around and starve to death rather than harvest and eat food.  Citizens will wander off alone and get themselves killed by groups of enemies.  The ""tutorial,"" if you can call it that, teaches you next to nothing about the game.  The still images of the towns initially shown on the game's Steam page were actually impossible to create in the game.  Building (especially roofs) is an exercise in frustration as pieces don't seem to want to fit together like they should.  The programmer's ambitions far exceeded his capabilities and after as few beta updates (which didn't really fix anything), he simply bailed.  What a great guy.Don't buy Towns.  Get something better.  And practically ANYTHING is better than this pile of excrement.			"

A few very minor bugs are present, the AI is a bit dopey, the enemy scaling is absurd (due to the market system, you can get Gold, a top tier material early on and proceed to completely stomp the first 5 or 6 floors of the dungeon, then suddenly it all comes to a halt on the next floor as enemies can one or two shot your heroes regardless of armor because armor only increases evasion, it doesn't make people more capable of taking damage) the game can have massive lag at times when doing mass item hauling (most common when you want to sell several buckets of iron) and the punishment for doing something wrong can be horrible especially when you don't know why said thing is bad (ie you have to make graves for corpses or they spawn strong ghosts, but now there's an event lategame that can rarely spawn even stronger Zombies for your village to fight off if you didn't build your graveyard a mile away, even high level zombies can spawn potentially adding to the death toll unless your village is well equipped O_O However, despite all the bad things, I feel like they're more nitpicks that could be ironed out later (if they ever do) the game is strangely satisfying when you do the smallest of things. I felt glad when I got my first town up and running with a constant food supply and with enough production to allow the town to build walls and decor to make them happier, which brings more people in, and eventually Heroes, whom I also got a nice warm feeling from when they moved in, especially a cameo from the fantastic Sips_ :D. When a dungeon level gets cleared there's also that good feeling when you clean all the loot out and equip the village with better items to withstand the ever increasing sieges that want to ruin all your fun. Overall there's just a great feeling I get from getting things done right, it's oddly satisfying to watch all your little people mine out all the stone before converting it into a storage room for your builders so you can continue to build up the town walls to make it harder for the sieges from completely stomping all over all your work so far, and i got a really good chuckle when the nasty hoard of yeti coming in to storm the place is almost completely wiped out before they reach their victims because you built a bridge that serves as the only way in that's completely lined with traps, and watching them set them all off (sadly there's no real animation, but it's still great to watch a big bad yeti get his foot caught in a bear trap and his friend who walked on ahead set off the bamboo shooter, hitting them both as well as anyone else nearby, then the log traps finish off the already wounded, before the villagers team up to pick off any surviving monsters that are likely bleeding from every possible area of their body. Perhaps next time they'll realize that the decaying goblin heads shoved on the pikes outside are a sign that this town is defended) If you already own a copy go ahead and have a blast directing all your little people to their fates. Grab some mods to fix some of the problems and some of the frustrating elements and you're good to go. If it appears in a bundle with some other things you're interested in, go ahead and give it a go, you might like it. But I would not buy this game through steam now, especially at full price, when there are more options available that either offer more polished development, are cheaper or promise so much more in the future. Gnomoria, Craft the World and Banished are all around the same price but all offer their own quirks and are still being developed regularly or are even finished in the case of Banished.The main reason I am not recommending this is because the devteam, they released a game which was basically in alpha, but not stating as such, they slowly developed said game over about a year, then dropped it. Now I can perfectly understand their situation, as one who actually browsed the forums, they got too deep into something they shouldn't have, their reputation was on the line, their own personal lives were causing them trouble. They hired another developer but their paycheck would have been so low that they too eventually dropped the project. When the game was left in this dropped state, the steam community went wild, with people buying the game just to give it a negative review, the product tags mostly consisting of ""scam"" and ""abandoned"" and the reviews said nothing about the game. The development of the game has since continued, however i would still not buy this game until they can promise to the buyers that they can bring out frequent updates (updates as of late have been very minor and slow, but a v15 is in development to help fix some issues)So until then, if you have it already, have fun, otherwise it's probably best to stay away unless it's on sale for £3 and you're curious or have nothing better to do for a rainy weekend. Then again, if the devs do get off their butts and finish the game, this could possibly be one of the best entry level Dwarf Fortress clones ever...			"

												I liked the game when I first got it. Sure it was buggy but it was in early access and the developers were making progress and updating and making it better. Then they released an unfinished product and gave up all together. I could forgive the game's mistakes when it was early access but now that it's released? No. It's not worth the $15 anymore. Maybe at one point but not now. Go play Dwarf Fortress of Gnomoria if you want to play a game like this.			"

												This is the game that made me lose faith in Greenlight. I have bought numerous early access games ( Prison Architect, Starbound, Space Base DF9 (ugh), Kerbal SPace Program etc.) Some have been solid games that keep building on themselves and are enjoyable even in early alpha (like KSP), some have been rocky but still enjoyable and are continuing to be made and starting to look better (Starbound), and then there are the games that don't really evolve much and kind of just.... stop.I bought this game around the release date thinking that it was a neat fresh look at dungeon crawling with city building and some basic logistics managment. I was totally jazzed at the idea and played the game into the ground for a couple of weeks. I had a bit of trouble with the building system, but I figured that had more to do with me being a n00b at the game. (It was a mess since your villagers could get stuck on air and kinda just... sat there as they got eaten by the critters and such on the surface.),. To be fair though there wasn't a tutorial at all at the time.I also found it impossible to attract addidtional villagers to the town or any heroes, even after fitting all of the criterea that the wiki said was required. The lack of forward movement gameplaywise is what lead me to drop the game until it hit beta.Now many moons later I come back to check out what is up with a game that I wanted so much to love and find out that it has been pretty much dropped by the devs. I liken it to ordering a car from somewhere and stopping by for a test drive of a prototype. You drive it and think it's all cool and can't wait for the consumer model, but after hearing nothing for a while you drop by again to see how the car is coming and the one they let you drive is exactly the same except they added seatbelts. Granted that I didn't drop $20,000 on this game and that this game is not a car, you get pretty much the same feeling, like someone took your money and gave you a shoddy product.If only I knew then what I know now.TL;DRShoddy at best and the devs dropped the game.

												It's difficult to recommend this game at the $15 sale price (4/23/2015), while there are so many other (more finished) games on the market.The game was created by 2 people. Steam added the game in 2012. The original creaters stopped working on the game in early 2014, and struck a deal with a single person to take over development. That person discovered there wasn't any financial incentive to continue developing the game, and let the community know that he was stopping all work.(Reference: http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/05/07/towns-called-malice-development-of-city-builder-ends/  )I like the game's concept of town management and plowed ahead with multiple game instances. However, I had to put the game down due to functionality. Sometimes my townies would starve to death instead of stopping a task to eat. They would wonder too deep even though you're supposed to be able to set the max floor depth. etc.TLDR: I can't recommend buying it. If you're still curious, download the demo.			"

												My children and I play this game. We liked the look and feel of the interface. The game was interesting and fun for a bit but little things kept annoying us. Issues like folk will starve to death instead of dropping the task they are assigned and eating. I guess making that piece of armor was more important that their own survival. The town seems small compared to other games in genre. The depth is limited to about 19 or 20 levels. Some other games in genre go below 100 levels.  For over a year the developer has been releasing rare and tiny updates. The game is not polished, but playable. I gave up on game and went to other games in genre that developers are actively making their product better. I'd recommend game for a few $.			"

												I was with this game from the beginning. From the moment I heard about this game in the Royal Indie Bundle, I fell in love with it. I played tens of hours of it through Desura. I desparately wanted this game to succeed because it was like a beautiful growing flower that would blossom with so much potential. I was an active contributor on the game forums along with others who shared the same passion. Then Steam Greenlight was launched and when this game was one of the first to be on passed through it, I was absolutely thrilled. And then, it all went south. The game was becoming more and more complex (which isnt necessarily a bad thing) but the way the developer did it made it more robust and annoying to get into. On top of that, each update introduced more and more bugs. The developers became less and less responsive. One of them left due to family concerns which is understandable. The gap between updates became longer and longer. Soon enough, the developers just disappeared. The game stayed in its buggy alpha state for months. Then out of nowhere a new dev was hired to fix it up. Except after only one update, he too seemingly has disappeared and the game continues in its buggy alpha state. I wanted to love this game. I wanted to see this game completed and succeed, I really wanted to. I now see that that future will never arrive.Don't get this game. It's dead and abandoned. RIP			"

												So...where to begin. This game I remember seeing back in 2011 on YouTube and I thought it was pretty cool. Found it on Steam when I joined, bought it when it was on sale for like $5. At the time, it was still being worked on, albeit slowly, so I thought ""why the heck not."" Looking back now, this game had potential but was left to rot by the devs and since late 2014 has never received a lick of development. It's unfinished, unpolished, buggy and will probably never, ever see what it was to become. It has good features and has a lot to it despite being in its forever unfinished state. The A.I. has always had a mind of its own and is hard to deal with when trying to set up runners, farmers, builders, and traders at the same time. Not having even just one person assigned to just one tiny task could end up causing your settlement to crash without enemies even attacking, simply because someone wouldn't go and make flour so you can bake bread so your dedicated farmers could eat and go harvest more wheat to repeat the cycle. It's a challenge, but if you're looking for a basic time waster, this game is good for that. I can't recommend it, however, just because of the state it's been left in without further development. If it's on sale for cheap and you like a nice, casual city builder, you might look into it. But for full price, look elsewhere. This game is going nowhere and will forever be that way.			"

												So what is with Towns? I would rather say it's pretty dead. This game came 2012 to steam greenlight and was a interesting project, where you create a world in which yo have to make andventurers happy and not to be the adventurer.But what did go wrong?It's pretty easy. The developer cashed the money in, which was brought by many people, who were exicted (like me), to try it, to play it and to support it. But unfortunately the developement stopped in 2014.What's wrong with that?So the problem with this is, that this game is far from being finished. This game is still in alpha and lacks many features, so many that you could rather say it is not much fun to play this game. I got very disapointed as i have heard that and my money is lost, just because someone did not manage to get their things right and just because he did not have ambitions anymore to work on this project, he stopped! I want to say one thing. I burned myself on this game and on some other. I would recommend for everyone not to buy early acess games or greenlights, just as they appear, but to wait and watch or to look at reviews. We gamers have to put a stop to such methods, we can not allow this to happen to us anymore!I do not recommend this game, don't buy it and don't support someone who disappointed thousands of players, with an unfinished, not even polished, game. He earnend about 2 MILLIONS $ with it and left the game just as it is, UNFINISHED!I would rather recommend you ""DwarfFortress"", it's free, developed by only 2 guys and can offer you much more.

												To my great disappointment, this ""early access alpha""- looks, sounds and plays just about the same as it did over a year ago. Sounds - None of the 4-5 sounds adds any value to the experience, what so ever.Graphics - The graphics are all placeholder at best.Gameplay - Has potential, but the AI will destroy any play beyond the first hour of play.Steam should have pulled this title a long time ago as it feels like the developer made it available only to go on a permanent vaccation right after. If you want a town-building-management experience, pick up Dwarf Fortress and make a donation to Bay12Games instead.			"

												I like this game, but I don't enjoy it as much as I should. It feels incomplete. The tutorials can be done in 5 seconds where it seems pointless to do them and the tutorials don't cover enough. Some pre made towns would be awesome. A news ticker would be great. A lot of this game is tranquil waiting. You send your townies to do something and it starts off being quick, but as the town gets bigger it can take them hours to build a set of small homes. Its a game you can watch TV and come back to while it plays.Oh and to top it off.... I've played one single game around 60 hours and NEVER EVER had any town that looks like the screenshots. NEVER EVER. I might not ever in fact. That's just how the game is. I often have the game playing in the background on another computer virtually unattended.			"

												This game was purchased for me a long time ago as a birthday present. Got a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of good hours out of this game, but it was abandoned by the developers and left in a painfully unfinished state. It basically went straight from Alpha to ""Finished"". They flip-flopped on actually abandoning it for a while - they hired a new guy to work on it, which failed within weeks of happening...twice. Then they talked about releasing a Towns 2, despite this game being unfinished. The last attempt at saying ""yes, we still care about this"" was in early 2015, when a dev's house was supposedly under construction, so he had no room/time/internet to release a new patch. Finally, they stopped talking altogether. Their forums are a ghost town. This was one of the unfortunate early failures of the Greenlight system.Been a while since I've played it, but I just wanted to add my voice to the chorus of ""holy ♥♥♥♥ don't buy this"" that is already out there. The game you're getting is not worth a 15 dollar price tag.			"

												tl;dr: STAY FAR AWAY AND DO NOT BUY___________________________________________________________This game could have been good. But the Dev abandoned the project. The decided to pick it up again. Then abandoned it again (I think). Its pretty infamous for being one of the first games out of Early Access and the first promising Early access game that sold a ton of copies where the dev ""took the money and ran"". This game burned a LOT of people on Early Access, and is still burning people. I cant believe its still for sale. Its a bug ridden incomplete mess taht never got out of Early Access and is being sold as a complete game.Go play Dwarf Fortress instead. "

												This game is unintuitive, poorly done, very buggy, bland, and disappointing. I got the game when it first came out (before you could purchase beta access to games). The game was difficult to figure out and very clearly incomplete. At the time it hadn't claimed to be anything other than complete so I was surprised by the alpha phase feel of the game. The tutorial wasn't clear or useful and I had to take to the internet to learn how to play.The UI is awful and looks largely like it is meant as a placeholder until the game is further along and finished. The game is still not finished. The last update released for the game as of this writing (12/6/2013) was 9/30. That update made some things better, but didn't really affect the problems, such as the weirdness with townies auto-equipping things, the awful UI, the terrible tutorial, the stupid pathing and ai, the cruddy combat system etc.I was really looking forward to this game because it is similar in spirit to games like Dwarf Fortress and Dungeon Keeper, but it fails miserably and doesn't seem to be trying all that much. If you are a fan of DF or DK, I suggest just playing either of them, or try Gnomoria. Gnomoria is regularly updated and communicative with the player base. Don't get this game unless you are the kind of person who gets a kick out of bad games.Update 8/19/2015:Just wanted to add that as far as anyone can tell, the developers have abandoned this project and Steam continues to leave it up where it can still be sold. If you made the easy mistake of purchasing this game thinking it is complete or being worked on, please keep in mind you can refund games now and refund as soon as possible. I know I wish I had that option when I bought this game.			"

												I've come back to this game a number of times and sadly I'm unable to recommend it.While the graphics are generally ok, the font used is rather difficult to read - its simply a very poor and quite small bitmap - I've seen much better bitmapped fonts, from java even a pure opengl application its not too dificult to implement true type fonts...If only the text were the only issue, I could get past that and get on with the gameThe real issue comes when you attemt to create a building, it is almost impossible to be sure (even with their ""2.5d"" cursor) if you are building on top of a lower level blocks, and don't even start on a roof I hear its possible but a blavk art indeed.  A simple ghost block above lower blocks might help, but its just really confusing trying to work out whats going on.			"

												I have to give this a thumbs down.  It is very buggy, a very steep learning curve, and totally random.  I got really lucky in one town, and found a merchant willing to buy dirt, and sell me gold and some magical crap.  I gave 2 townies full stets of gold stuff, and they were slaughtering everying left and right.  I had a good working farm and started to grow my town, getting heros, but building took FOREVER.  I left the game running and the next day my build orders were not done.  I left it a few more hours to find that all my townies were slaughtered by some stupid monster, exccpt the ones with gold sets.  Well, kept trying to rebuild, but could never recover the population, too slow to build, too slow to do anything.  I just don't see this game going anywhere, really cool idea with little execution.Sadily, it has gone so long wtihout an update that I guess it will never be finished.  This game really had a lot of potential.  Buyer Beware!			"

												I really loved this game when I first started playing it. Had a ton of potential and it was very fun. If you wanna see a very good lets play and funny letplay of the older game then watch the sips videos on it. That is when this game was definatly at its most fun. Then gnomoria came out and had its fully 3d block system and the devs then decided they wanted to compleatly rewrite the game to have this feature. I guess many in the comunity wanted it but in my honest opinion this was a bad move. It made the game look too much not like its previous version and dident add anything to the gameplay other then you could build a better looking buildings. The game is a town building game not a building building game they went in the wrong direction however this was not what killed it. What killed it was one of the dev's having a personal crisis that then forced them to not concentrate on the game. This in turn spiraled into more work for the other dev's and them loosing intrest. I would have highly recommended this game a few years ago durning its alpha but it seams soon as it hit steam it was pretty much abandoned. Like the other reviewers I no longer can even recommend buying this game. Maybe if it was 3 bucks but definatly not 15 like what its being asked for.			"

												This game hits a couple sweet spots for me, in that you spend your time designing and issuing instructions to virtual ""villagers"" (or dwarves, employees, etc.) and then watching them go about their virtual lives.  I purchased it rather early on in its existance, and enjoyed running through a few plays of the basics that were in place.  It certainly never felt even remotely finished, and I decided to walk away from it and give the devs time to flesh it out. They never did that.  The original developers lost interest, which is a huge risk for people who are paid in advance for the promise of a product to come, and effectively decided to cut and run.  They farmed the work to a new developer who was working solely for a percentage of future sales, and the small improvements that were being made never generated those. This game is not actively being developed and is not worth a third of the asking price in its current state, which is a damned shame, becuase this genre could use more finished games, and fewer abandoned skeletal concepts.

												Terrible game.  Development is slow to the point of almost being non-existant (6+ months between major patches).  The AI is bad, especially the player's Townies (they border on suicidal at times).  Heroes are nothing more than dungeon-clearing mooches that sometimes bring total death to your Townies by bringing a train of mobs when they run away.  Only one music track that continually plays.  Townies cannot tear down already placed structures and items.It's truly an alpha-stage game that is passed off as a release-ready game.  Look elsewhere for a city-building game.  Dwarf Fortress or Gnomoria are truly better options.EDIT:  Also, do not listen to a word that YetiChow, the mod of the Towns forums on Steam, as he is a self-professed Troll that has no actual interest in the Steam community except to get rid of people who are critical of Towns and Town's developers.  http://www.townsgame.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=88t=8032&start=40&p=47838&view=show#p47838Everyone of the users that he's perma-banned on the Towns forums on Steam (listed here:  http://steamcommunity.com/app/221020/discussions/0/35220315866244607/ ) were speaking only the truth about the history of Towns that included the actions of the Towns' devs and how they falsely advertised this game during the launch on Steam.

HOWEVER, I must say this game is still the same POS as it was then... Hardly different.. Potential and My time WASTED!!?!?40/100Pros-potential (aha there was)-Some decent addons (this will make it just slightly more playable)-Not buggy (not seriously buggy, however it would be more enjoyable if you could think of all the problems as just a mistake)-:( still can't think of anything actualy enjoyable after my money was stolen for an unfinished gameCons-game will not be fixed (game is not gonna change now or ever GG)-AI is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid as hell.. ( they will ♥♥♥♥ you off so bad..)-Very boring and repetitive at times! (basic actions are way to simple and click heavy with very little aesthetic or enjoyment as a reward..)-Not replayable (since you cant really ever do much in the first play or second or third or fourth.. you will achieve very little in this game as everything takes forever)Don't BUY FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR PRIDE AND WALLET!!?!!

												I ended up buying this game twice, once when I first heard about it from various communities speaking favorably of what it could become, and again when the game was eventually greenlit on steam. I justified both purchases, because I was genuinely excited over the prospect of the game, and wanted to support it as much as I could. I was wrong.The game and by extension the original community presented the concept to be a Dwarf Fortress like game with better graphics, but I would argue that it is more closely related to the old Majesty games without a mission scenario. Your objective is to build up a town that will attract adventure's. You are tasked to manage and create food for the town, gather materials for building and forging tools/weapons, and eventually mine beneath the surface and break into dungeons beneath the map. All the while you need to defend your townspeople against invaders, native enemy's and eventually the monsters living within the dungeons.The art is very inconsistent. Between block styles, animals and items within the game, there seems to be a 'mish-mash' of different approaches to how things ought to look, and none of them are particularly good. The animation is non existent. Everything glides across the screen, the combat looks like how a child emulate a 'fight' by smashing two dolls together.  Gameplay wise, you are allowed to create various structures, however you want. Similar to prison architect and DF-9, the game follows a system where you designate the type of room (bakery or carpenters workshop), and then supply those rooms with the necessary components allow those rooms to function (such as an oven, or bakers table). Buildings can be multiple floors up or down, though rooms are restricted to one level. The AI is what ruins the game for me. Peasants will frequently pick fights with monsters unarmed if they are near them. Like the Majesty, you cannot control the hero's that come to your town, however you also cannot curb or influence the hero's with gold or bounties. You simply have to hope the hero's will go where you need them too on their own. The menu's and displays aren't pretty to look at either, and navigating through the various menu's is rather unintuitive.The sounds are pretty terrible to be honest, especially the sound for when peasants eat food or die. If you happen to have your earphones on, and at a high volume, I would imagine it would cause your ears to bleed. Overall, the sound effects are pretty generic, but maybe I'm expecting too much from an Indie game after playing Minecraft.Now at the time, I could just explain such issues away, because the game was still in active development. However the game has since been abandoned by it's developers, and no further updates are planned. Because of that, I can't in good faith recommend this game. There's too much simply missing or unpolished for this to be considered a good purchase.			"

												One of the collective of Greenlight games that has been discontinued in its development.The developers have backed away from it entirely, after having instilled new ones to take their place.Though it has mods to take its replayability and value up a notch, it is not going anywhere beyond the most recent update.The game itself offers an interesting idea, where you are given a group of individuals who've managed to get stranded in the middle of a wilderness where survival is bent upon preparation against attacks from waves native slime blobs, werebears, skeletons, goblin-like creatures, and other manners of mythical beings. Each of said creatures seems to inherently wish to destroy the little ""Townies"" that inhabit the locale.Thus it is up to you to assign duties and crafts in order to farm, harvest, bake, mine, and provide a kind of economy of barter in order to sustain the townspeople from starving, or being slaughtered and eaten by local denizens.After creating a working village, whether it be in a mountainside or under the ground, or whatever the case, townies can venture below, into the earth to unveil treasures from creatures, with or without the help of heroes attained from local taverns.With certain mods, the game can be improved, but what with the care given to it, the modding community has very well moved on; it has been left aside and is a token of proof against the usefullness of buying games before their true completion.Other games similar to this are Gnomoria, and Stonehearth, both of which brandish better Ai development and offer a team who is in love with the product they are creating.I would only recommend trying this game if it were on sale at 80% off if you wish to give a town-simulator a try; but I personally would have preferred buying Gnomoria over this game.

												Edited at version 14d, in which development seemed to have a heartbeat again.The new update brings some cool new features, namely terraforming. This allows for a deeper playstyle in regards to the land, allowing you to flatten out areas quicker etc. While a nice thing to have, the reason this review is now edited is due to the developers finally getting off their ♥♥♥ and providing an update. On time. If this keeps up, I have hopes once again for Towns. The idea is great, and if it is true we're seeing Xavi once again get to work, then Towns could finally become the game it was advertised as. If you like town building games like Gnormia, Dwarf Fortress etc, Towns is a nice twist that basically is you making a town/city for an adventurer. Imagine your the town that the hero in skyrim comes and visits. The hero might bring enemies with them, among other things, and survival is incredibly hard. This is not an easy game. Only if you like this genre of title and want to spice things up would I suggest buying it CURRENTLY; we will need to see if the developers can keep working on it, lest they fall into their bad habits again. Keep an eye on this review; in the future, it will change as updates come along.Man, I wish they could launch in Early Access retroactively.---ORIGINAL---I entered Towns unknowing of it's past or the community reaction. It looked cool enough, and I thought that I could make towns like the screenshots showed.Boy was I wrong.If you want to spend $15 on this you're not fit to be on Steam let alone have the method of purchasing games. I'm glad I only spent $5 on this mess. Where to start? The early game is practically impossible; the tutorials don't cover anything useful and you're villagers will not follow your orders in the right order; you might ask them to build walls to protect themselves then ask them to make a house: The house will be made half way then some random walls will be put in, all the while they run into eachother and get stuck. Lack of food, lack of direction and overall poor controls make this game basically unplayable. You'd have better luck finding a brand new AAA release on %99 discount on Steam than someone who has ever made anything that resembles the screenshots in this awful game. You enter thinking of grand citites: You leave with a tribe of misfits trying to survive in the worst way possible.			"

												This is the infamous game that has gave a bad name to steam's early release program.This was one of the first games to be available to purchase from a new (at the time) steam division which was intended to give funding to games which were partially developed and showed a lot of promise.  Back in 2011ish, this game was seen as having amazing potential. Lots of people bought the game, and we thought the money we gave would be used so that the programmer would work full time on the game.  (There is a big write up on exactly how much money was generated from game sales, I can't remember if it was in the hundreds of thousands of dollars or more). What happenned instead, was that the developer took the money and stopped working on this game.  Disbelief, outrage, and anger from the community ensued.  No refunds were issued. Steam didn't withhold any of the cash.  So many people feel they were burned by this affair, that they swore off purchasing pre-release games ever again. And that's the real loss here.			"

												Broken, buggy, unfinished mess. This game was released on Greenlight, with the devs claiming that they would continue development. I understood this to mean that I was buying into an alpha that was in development still. The game feels about 40% complete. It's playable, but..1. The AI is terrible. Both townie and mob. 2. The way you construct things is really hard to use, reminescent of RCT2 in that the isometric way the roofs tile makes it difficult for you to see if you placed a roof properly or not, but with the added annoyance that you need to have it so that your townies can reach it, so you need to place scaffolds everywhere. It's not fun, it feels like a chore.3. The GUI seriously leaves a lot to be desired. Things with no tooltip, weird buttons that do unclear things, annoying flashing notification buttons every single time you pause/unpause..4. Complete(or near complete) lack of satisfactory tutorials. It's not extremely hard to grasp like DF is, but there are strange things that I still don't understand, like why the entire underground of the map appears to be a giant dungeon and there is no underground stone. 5. Bugs.6. No where near as much customization is possible as DF has, the environment is basically the same generic map each time.All of these things are totally fixable. The problem? The devs have halted development. There hasn't been a patch in several months, no offical posts on the (horrible, echo chamber of a) forum, total silence. They kept complaining about being bogged down by all the work, and being burnt out. Plenty of devs are, but you don't just stop development completely. You take breaks, not quit. Ask people for ideas, don't quit. Open up your code so that others can work on it with you, don't quit. Really disappointed I supported this project and got a broken, unfinished product. It's made me more cynical about buying into alphas, which isn't a good thing to be, either, I guess. Don't buy this broken, unfinished mess. Truly a disappointment.			"

												The concept of this game is neat, but it is lacking a lot. I've played it a while ago, and I dare say it was a bit better back then than it is now. Development seems to be quite stagnant here. At the end of this review you'll read what I really recommend instead.The tutorials are, to say the least, quite braindead. They could've made it more interactive, but as it is now it's quite dull. Some details seems to be badly written as I didn't always get the desired results.The military in the game is kind of a joke. If I see a spider or any other enemy, why oh why can't I just go rightclick it and tell the military to go attack it? Or at least something that enables me to make more use of the military than 'patrol there' and hope that they actually will engage the enemy on their patrol routes.The actual mining is quite non-intuitive. Somehow I wasn't able to mine certain areas until I moved up/down. It's rather hard to see what level you are at currently, and there are no size indicators in the area you're about to mark to be mined. And you can build a roof but somehow I have not managed to build a roof on top of my shacks. I might give that a try again another time, but the game seems so pointless that it isn't really motivating to.You have absolutely no connection with those little guys you're ordering around. You can see some basic stats, but all those little peoples aren't really special. It's lacking a certain something there, and I can't quite place my finger on it. Let's just say that you don't really care who they are, as long as they get the jobs done already. There's no feel of a story attached to it.Assigning jobs and assigning productions/stockpiles is quite a chore. So much a chore that you just leave everything up to the defaults. A quick overview is rather impossible. Sure, they do have a list of civilians, and a stockpile list. But instead of having it present a clear overview, it's rather a messy job. I think they focused way too much on iconized displays with tiny numbers inside. In cases like this, a table-format would probably make more sense. We want to know some nice numbers and some other stats, not how pretty they look in a circle with one tiny number in there.Speaking about iconized displays.. the GUI is very clunky. It is definitely not polished and is just bare bones style. Nothing fancy about it and there are options lacking. The build icons are non-intuitive. If you want to go back a level in the menu, the 'go back' arrow is in a different location every level. So you can't just 'click click click' fast to get to the root level. No, you have to check every time you went back one level in the menu where the back button is at now. Nothing has been streamlined in this game.If you are charmed by this kind of game, I can recommend a different one instead which is still in active development and is rather more promising. Take it from me, you want to try Gnomoria. It might be in Early Access, but I've been playing it for a while (on Desura and now also on Steam), and it is way more finished than this Towns ever will be.			"

												I adore Towns. I know it's not the popular opinion here, but I have spent a happy 300+ hours building and exploring and fighting. It was well worth the $10 or so that I spent on it a few years ago. In Towns, you are in charge of an idiotic band of Townies who you instruct to gather resources, build buidlings, craft luxuries, cook food, and defend the town both as soldiers and civilains. In addition to keeping you populace well-fed and happy, you must defend against raiding bands of villians while delving deep into the dangerous underground to find more stone, iron, and gold. You can entice heroes to come and help you or instead swarm the monsters with well-armed townsfolk. The gameplay is heavy in resource management and building but has a satisfying amount of fighting and exploring. Why are the reviews so negative? This game long been public and under development, and that development stalled and then eventually halted. There are lists of features yet to be implemented and bugs to be fixed. Many believe that Towns is an unfinished game and are very angry about this. My interpretation is that the developers were just too ambitious about what to include and ended up with lots of great features that don't all function perfectly. I think it's finished, just not polished.  So despite my positive review, buyer beware. Play a demo if you can. Think about what bugs get under your skin and what you are happy to ignore while exploring the game mechanics. Think about how many hours or what level of gameplay you need to shell out some cash. But I would buy this game again, even in its current state. But do not buy it expecting additional development - that ship has sailed.			"

												Ok, having reviewed the game again, it still seems to me like this is a very hit or miss game.  On the one hand, it's a game with the interesting premise that you're creating a town to attract heroes to fight in the dungeons that are invariably discovered beneath the town.  On the other hand, it's bogged down by horrible micromanagement through clunky menus.  Before you find yourself running a town worthy of adventurers coming to visit, you have to BUILD the town.  You start with a handful of people standing around with their thumbs up their asses waiting for you to tell them what to do.  You tell them to grab some fruit and put it over there in a patch of ground we'll call a stockpile.  You tell them to chop down trees and put the wood over there in a different stockpile.  You designate certain areas of ground as a room for various purposes and then have to figure out what order you're required to build the furniture for these rooms.So you want beds for your people to sleep in?  You're gonna need a carpentry bench in a carpentry zone.  What about food more filling than apples and pears?  I guess you're gonna need a baking table and a baking oven in a baking zone.  But wait; there's something about this baking oven being made out of stone.  Now you're going to need a masonry room and an appropriate table in an appropriate zone.This kind of crap takes place all the time in this game. Oh and it's also set to some mind numbing repetitive music barely above ""bad midi song"" level. The characters themselves aren't very well animated and most might as well be colored stick figures.  I mean, you tell your guys to chop down a tree...do you see them pull out an axe and swing it at the trunk?  No, you see them stand next to a tree for a few minutes while a chopping sound effect is played and then you're treated to your character hauling a log across the map to a stockpile (if you bothered to make one).This game has a lot of promise and I've actually had this game since it was ""officially released"" waiting for it to live up to that promise.  It hasn't done it yet.  Oh and about that official release:  It basically went from alpha to final release overnight.  Had steam's ""Early Access"" been a thing at the time it would have been a perfect candidate for it.  Instead they released it as if it were done when just a day before it was ""alpha"" quality...but again, that wasn't really an option for them and they were desperate to make sales.  Now, in the time since the game went ""live"" on steam to the writing of this review, they've put up a few updates and it does look like they've fixed a few things here and there, but it hasn't changed to the point where I could wholeheartedly say ""yes, buy this game!""  It's still got a rough and unfinished feel to it, and if they'd take some time to polish up the UI, add some more variety to the music, and redo most of the graphics, it would at least look like they've made some progress.  Instead it's all ""under the hood"" stuff with very little outward change from the earliest version on Steam.If despite all of this you're still willing to buy the game, yes, you can easily sink 10-20 hours into it (I've almost sunk 20 into it when it was in its most broken state) because you get that feeling that somehow you're slowly making progress in the game and building something.  It's not entirely unsatisfying...it's just not entirely satisfying either.  If you buy it, lower your expectations and I'm sure this game will meet those lowered expecations and maybe even surpass them.  If instead you go into it expecting a great and polished game from the start, you'll be let down hard.			"

												As many others have been stating, this game has long since been abandoned. I used to play this quite a while back, and while I did have fun and enjoy it at times, it lacks in quite a few things that could've been improved to be much better. The game has quite a few glitches and issues, and I think it's a shame what happened to it. It could've been a much better game than it is right now. It has some potential, but I'm disappointed that the makers have stopped entirely, and I wish that I hadn't spent the $15 on it that I spent. This game has become one of the only games I regret purchasing.Likely the creators and developers do not have enough support, and things probably got too complicated. While I understand everyone and all developers have their own life and their own needs, I've seen so little effort into updating this game and bringing it back to life that it feels like the entire project is dead to them.It's sad when this happens to games. I've played some wonderful indie games before, but I'm afraid this one is just going to still be dead as it's been for so long. I wouldn't advise purchasing it, and I'm sure there are much better games that could be found of similar gameplay types.			"

												While the game was promising while it was being developed, the developers have stated that they have seized all development and support.

This was probably the last unfinished game I ever purchased because of that.A sad fortune, because the game really did have promise.Edit: It seems someone has been appointed to further develop this game. If this is the case, the outlook should be more positive.			"

												Towns is now the poster child for Early-Access-Gone-Bad. The devs took the money and ran. All I can say about Towns, is that it was the first (as far as I am aware of) game that mixed a usuable interface with Dwarf Fortress. The graphics were fine, and the music is meh. The game was really fun.I really want to give this a positive review because I got well over 20 hours out of this. I think I paid 15$ so I feel like I got my moneys worth out of this title. Would I tell you to buy it now? No. Go for Gnomoria. Trust me on this one.			"

												Towns had the potential to become a good Dwarf fortress clone, however development halted and an official statement on the forums made clear that the current version (with a lot of bugs, and debugging/admin tools availble to users) will be the final version.That being said: i enjoyed the game dispite all the bugs and frustrations, Do i recommend it? NOunless you want to buy an unfinished game and are willing to bite your fingernails off of frustration, dont buy the gameGnomorria is a better DwarfFortress clone, and more complete-update-apparently a new developer has been hired, but at the moment of this review, its still far from being recommended			"

												This game. THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME. I had fun. I had a lot of fun. But this game is like a ♥♥♥♥ING CRASH TO DESKTOP SIMULATOR. Once every hour, this game will CRASH WITH NO INDICATION AS TO WHY. Plus, I have heard that the developers have STOPPED. Early access they said. Now what? $15, and they don't even finish their game. What made me write this review was what happened a little while ago. My citizens dug out some stone, which I told them to. The stone was holding up a ♥♥♥♥ ton of water from the river above. Water is infinite in certain situations, and my miner ended up dying. Tried to remove the water by doing the ""Remove Liquid"" option, ONE DAMN BLOCK AT A TIME. GUESS WHAT? HALF THE TOP OF THE RIVER IS GONE, WHICH IS LIKE A THIRD OF THE ♥♥♥♥ING RIVER, AND THEN THE GAME CRASHES! ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T. YOU GET A NOT RECOMMENDED FROM ME, TOWNS. MADE ME FLIP OUT SO HARD, I CRASHED MY FIST DOWN ON MY TABLE AND ENDED UP DESTROYING MY SOUVENIR RING FROM WASHINGTON DC.			"

												If you like buying a game where the developer announces they are abandoning it before it's finished and in the same post announces the sequal. This is the game! I don't get how you can announce a sequal in the exact same post of you deciding you'll never finish this game. I hope you realize how stupid that was, I'm sure marketing Towns 2 is going to be great. ""Hey remember Towns, the game we never finished, buy Towns 2!""This game needs to be removed as soon as possible. The gameplay is nowhere near polished to be sold on it's own. At first, it's kinda easy to maintain all the citizens and stop them from going deep underground to get useless items. But, the more citizens you have the harder it is to stop them from going on suicide missions and you'll have citizens dying constantly. It's more fustrating then fun trying to build a decent town.

After all, devs were working on it, slowly making it better.....But I wouldn't recommend it at all anymore. It's abandoned, devs have completely stopped working on this, and it's definitely NOT worth 15 bucks for an unfinished, buggy, crude product.

												PENDING FUTURE UPDATES: As of now I can't recommend. This is a game that has a lot of promise but ultimately fails to deliver. The tutorials do not explain a whole lot, and are often buggy. (Random shutdowns.) There hasn't been muchwork done on the game. If you're going to sell a product, make it a playable product. One that delivers. The dungeon mentioned that is below the town? Not there. Character AI? Random, buggy to where it doesn't always respond to yourcommands. Everything else plays like someone put it together with a poor copy of RPG maker. I held off reviewing this for a while, because I liked the initial promise...but it has been months and months with nothing of merit added to the game. I can see why the others felt ripped off.Steer clear until the devs get their act together.			"

												I've got to say I'm glad I got it when it was on sale. It's definitely more of a $5 game, not a $15 one. If you find this game at $5 or less, then think about it, but any more than that and you might want to find something that got finished. This review is based off of my experience and the regular price though, so overall I don't recommend it. There's no way there isn't better games out there than this.Let me start with what I found to be good about the game though, since I did technically like it. I never played this Gnomoria that everyone else is mentioning, and with little function in Minecraft for watching a village come to life even with mods, I found it to be a great idea. Even though it was immediately obvious from opening the game that it was far from finished I found myself enjoying finding different combinations and ways of getting my limited villagers to survive.Secondly, the zoning. By assigning a zone type to an area the area gains a particular function, while losing other functions. This makes building a city kind of cool because the buildings one makes will actually function the way that they've zoned it to. Added to the fact that, if one could figure out the menus easily, one could get the villagers to use and upkeep these zones automatically, without any help from the player. Then there's just the world in general. Although the maps are small, they generate well, and they're fun and easy to shape. If a player shows enough patience, it actually is possible to build the kinds of places they show in the promotional material and screenshots.The last thing I thought was really cool was being able to put writing on tombstones and books and things. I can go through my village and remind myself of the events that passed. Who died, who did the best, or helped the most – it felt like making a civilization, even though it was really just a town at best. Epic legacies in a tiny town.Now, the wonderful negatives that ruined it. Unfortunately there are a lot of these, so I'll put a chunk of them in point form;*Odd menu style. That took a while to get used too, and I feel like things could be implemented better.*Moving items is a hassle, or just plain confusing.*Can't place enough text in books, graves, signs, etc, and can't use characters like “/”, making labels and text look flat and odd, like they were written by some 10 year old that was too lazy to use any punctuation. Breaks immersion. *The use of scaffold isn't clearly stated to be useful, and so it can be difficult to find out about it and how to use it properly to build better buildings. There isn't a lot of direct help on the internet either, so simply building can be a hassle. Also, making second floors is too tricky.*Extremely limited character sprites. Everyone will have too many clones for you to care about them. They also all have weird french-sounding names, even if playing the English version, and though unimportant, feels like it takes away from immersion into the game.*The armour doesn't fit on the sprites properly. Sometimes this is funny, but it just isn't proper for a game that costs $15.*The first floor dungeons, though easy to pass, are too expansive and too full of monsters. There's no easing into it at all, making the game feel less thought-out and more slapped together. Also an immersion breaker.*Next to no updates. These people probably don't care anymore, and it's showing. They don't update anywhere near as much as they should, and some of the bugs in the game could really use some fixes.*The bugs. Seriously, the game is definitely not a finished product. Amusing, but certainly not finished.And lastly, though kind of silly, what I found to be the game-breaker; The weapons you make, buy, and find are cool and all, but it isn't hard for some ""hero"" to waltz by and take all your good stuff, leaving your citizens and soldiers pretty close to defenceless. Some heroes. I worked hard on that stuff. “That hat was for the blacksmith!” and “she needed that spear to save her life!” might become alarmingly common frustrations.So yeah. Ends up under $5?

After playing for a few hours i decided to leave it and come back when it's in a better state.And now this happens: http://kotaku.com/unfinished-steam-game-abandoned-after-thousands-bought-1572931721.

The game did have some potential but the fact that you cant even build a roof on your house without watching extensive youtube videos so that you don't screw it up and break the game is ridiculous.I got scammed and I feel sad about it.

												**** August 2015 Update ****Almost a year after being told the game development was suspended for ""home renovations"", there has been no word from the developers and the forums continue to stay without complaint (due to moderator Yetichow not allowing posts that factually state the game's status or factually state why the game is unfinished/needs improvement/general feedback).So, on that note, please make sure you avoid the game (unless you want to waste your money).  Read the REVIEWS of the game and disregard the forums (since Yetichow had decided to scrub them clean and ban any who disagree).   Congratulations, Towns.  You made it into the Steam group, ""ScamReport"".  You should be proud...(/sarcasm)****March 2015 Update****I wouldn't bother checking the forums for any kind of clarity.  The current moderator bans anyone who criticizes the game, despite there being valid reasons to criticize.  Only the positive forum posts don't get edited or deleted.  Anyone trying to warn potential buyers on the actual status of the game, gets banned.We were told that development had picked up again (for the fourth time of it being active and then subsequently stopped) but after only a month-ish, the current moderator stated the developer was having house renovations done and did not have regular internet access.  That was in September of 2014. Make your own judgement call from that...---------------------------------**** Initial Review ****Voted to Greenlight the game WAY back and upon it's release on Steam, I was excited to buy it.  Imagine my shock when the game I loaded up was nothing more than a poorly coded alpha with a crap tutorial and a laundry list of game-breaking bugs.According to the Devs, the game was fulling finished and wasn't in alpha/beta/whatever.  Fully finished. Fully playable.  With continued updates scheduled!  Please note:  There was no demo released at the time.  NOWHERE on the page did it state that the game was feature incomplete (which is STILL is).  And then customers started voicing their concerns.  They (myself included) were met with insults from the PR/Devs directly (anyone remember TommyKent's abrasion?).  We were called stupid for not ""understanding"" how these type of games are to played.   That ""if we just gave it time"" we'd figure it all out.Screw that.Even over a year later, the game has only had a handful of crappy updates - most not even addressing major issues.  We've been told the entire run of excuses from health problems, to vacations, to quitting programmers (who left to work on other projects! AWESOME!)Avoid this like the plague.  It was a cash grab.  They're millionaires now (not exaggerating) and they're never coming back to save this wreck of a game.  Matter of fact, avoid anything SMP does.  I will be.			"

												Why the heck is this game still for sale Steam??  Boo on you Steam.  Boo.   We should bring you up on charges of human rights abuses.  The cowards gave up on it nearly 2 years ago, and you still leave it up here for them to get more out of the player community?   Need a downvote on Steam as well as this game!So my review of the game.Well it showed promise for the first 6 months.  Had fun with it and was patched pretty often.  You could see it starting to come together.Then these two cowardly, piece of re-heated dead monkey lice they call Devs gave up.  Their names are Xavi Canal and Ben Palgi if you'd like to read more about the story.  So then they give the development over to some poor schmuk named Frankenberger.  He couldn't handle it solo as he was more of a fan than a true dev.  So when he quit in Sept. 2014 that's exactly where this game has been.  Exactly.  18 month ago.So it sold 200K copies for $15-$20.  You do the math.  Someone got paid, and we got the shaft.			"

												The Short of it:This game has been abandoned, wait till a sale brings its price down if you want to try it.The long of it:Unfortunatly I can't recomend this game. I bought it when it was still young and worthwhile, full of proimise and hope, sadly it has been abandoned.Don't get me wrong here, I love the concept, I love the style and I love how the game works, but its unfinished, buggy and in need of some serious love. Perhaps the developers would be willing to part with it and hand it to someone who would be better suited to... finishing it off with all the features that I recall seeing on a roadmap... somewhere a long time ago....If theres anything I can say about the game its that its gotten buggier since I stopped playing it, perhaps thats just the age of my computer finally showing, but I don't think so.Its still quite challanging in and of itself, but like most of my towns end up, it is very unfinished, ""Hero"" mode and one other mode not implimented, and a lot of things requiring some much needed... laquer.If you are looking for a game that will play similarly to this one but has a more finished feel try Gnomoria or Banished. Hell even the currently WIP Hearthstone has a more finished and complete feel!Keep an open mind that games are always subject to change, and that, if this game is lucky, it will be worked on again.

												I wanted to like this game when I got it. I really did. I was intimidated by Dwarf Fortress and thought that this would be an equally fun little world builder game.No, it really is not.This is Dwarf Fortress's half cousin he really wishes wasn't kinda in the family. The menus are much less deep that DF, but at the cost of having what feels like very few options. The UI is terrible in general, and I found that after playing this game for 27.6 hours, I still felt lost and slow doing everything. This isn't helped by a TERRIBLE camera angle, and the entire game just feels in general like a poorly made and thought through Dwarf Fortress.If you want this game's experience, just get Dwarf Fortress and find some youtube tutorials. You'll thank me later, I promise.			"

Towns is sadly full of wasted potential.  On paper, it had everything going for it: resource gathering, micro management, needs of villagers, crafting, construction and combat. Instead, everything is implemented in a basic way that for some reason just doesn't work, and ends up being a cluster♥♥♥♥, to put bluntly. The screenshots showcasing busy townfolk running around a bustling city look amazing, but don't be fooled: whilst it's true a picture says a thousand words, gameplay says a thousand words + 1. The graphics, well, it looks like it was made in the early 90s,    there were a few games using similar painted-art style, but I can't remember their names. The interface is ugly and obstructive, thankfully though the buttons can be minimised. The entire game looks like a free game you play on those Flash sites. Not necessarily bad I must add, but surely if they took a backseat towards the visual department, then they could have pumped more beans into the gameplay side of things? Apparently not. Main game problem: Artificial Intelligence. The villagers lack any kind of soul and brain, that makes the NPCs in Doom and Quake more likeable.   They'll randomly dart across the landscape for no apparent reason, and the way they slide across the place looks freaky. They have no goals and just stand there doing nothing, permanently frozen in an upright stance for eternity (except when they die they rotate 90 degrees). Order them to chop down a forest, and they'll just fly towards the area en mass, stand completely motionless in front of the tree and it magically dissapears, through use of sound effects. Couldn't they at least have the sprite of an axe in their hand?  About their intelligence, they just come across as mindless drones.   Granted, they actually do a very good job of following orders: ask them to hack down some trees, mine some rock and what not, and they'll literally drop everything, rush towards the area like a bunch of gophers and gleefully carry out said task until it's done. If only public service workers in real life were as committed as these folk are.   On the other hand, the villagers lack any sense of self preservation.   They'll often, for no reason at all, decide to wonder to the complete opposite end of the map and get killed (or ♥♥♥♥♥ rather, due to the bad animations) by some high level monsters. Then again for some unknown reason, another villager will decide it's their turn to dash to the other end of the map and repeat this morbid process. It's extremely frustrating as there is no explanation nor solution to this phenomenon, I've actually lost an entire village due to this sick process. If it's not a bug and actually some invisible monster using mind control on my villagers to turn them into suicidal lemmings, than I do apologise. Remember when I said before about game features being basic, yet for some reason not actually working?   Well here's an example. I tell a villager to go bake some bread, he does so without delay. Next to the bakery is a designated area for storing bread. Said villager then bakes the bread, and takes the finish products to the store room. Simple right? What actually happens is SOME bread gets put in the store room, whilst the rest is just littering the floor of the bakery, for no explained reason. And now the villagers are eating the bread off the dirty floor INSTEAD of the stockpile, despite the stockpile being closer to them. And again for some unknown reason, some of the villagers decide to find food in the dangerous jungles be yonder, rather than pluck it from the safety of their own town. Maybe they suffer from wheat and gluten allergy? OK, good things. City building is decent enough, as the villagers will happily carry out construction, even when they are dying of starvation:   a problem with other city building games is that sometimes buildings weren't been built because the villagers were too busy with other trivial tasks or ""idleing"", so props to Towns for fixing this common issue (even if it's due to bad AI). You can custom build your houses block by block, choosing a variety of different colours, furniture, etc, and decorate the surrounding area with plants and other decorations. So in essence, Towns does actually deliver what the name implies, assuming you can get past the bugs and terrible AI, and the fact is you need the AI to get the most out of Towns. Finally, there is only one, ONE single 2 or so minute long music loop that plays throughout the entire game.   Do yourself a favour, switch that damn thing off and play something in the background of Youtube, as this single endless loop will drive you absolutely insane. Towns is a massive disappointment, considering the hype and broken promises the developers blew around.   It actually got abandoned after it was pushed out of beta and into its final, albeit broken release state. I guess they jumped onto the city building craze every other indie game was doing, but didn't have the know-how on how to actually make a game properly. It's a colossus shame as Towns could have very well become a massive hit and a new standard for village building games. If the original developers were to release the game engine/source code for open modification, that could potentially completely turn this game into a success as I bet there's many talented people out there just hoping to get their hands on this and fix all the problems.There's tons of other similar games that does everything way better. And for the record, to end the Towns vs Gnomoria debate, Gnomoria wins tenfold. At the time of writing, I've only spent 3 hours in Towns, as opposed to 65 hours in Gnomoria. Don't need to say more.

												Don't get me wrong, this game is wonderful. I love pretty much everything about it, even if it is a buggy mess of incompletion. Like most people seem to agree, the one huge flaw is the fact that the developer abandoned it just because sales were declining. A truly passionate game dev wouldn't do that, and it's not excusable (especially considering his funds were quite sustainable, since this game really took off). If the dev didn't abandon it, I'd reccommend this for sure. As of now? Don't buy it.			"

												It was fun for a while, but ultimately it's nothing more than a good concept made into a hideous wreck packed full with frustrating glitches and false promises. This game was abandoned by the developers years ago before the game even hit beta, and people have barely heard of them since.A lack of content, development, and no goals to achieve all add up to make this game nothing more than a frustrating experience. Banished or Gnomoria are far better and will be far more worth your wallet than this.			"

And they even have the balls to talk about a sequel...to an unfinished game. What a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥s.Do yourself a favor, go buy Gnomoria instead.

I wish I had a screenshot of the original 'About the Game', as the difference in length alone is staggering.

												I don't recommend this, simply for the reason that the developer of this game doesn't deserve a cent of anybody'd hard earned money.Sure, the developer must have put some extensive work to get this game up and running, but the game got put through on Steam Greenlight, it was released as ""alpha"" and then the developer abandoned the project, using the excuse that he's ""burnt out"". Yet, the developer is working on other projects, AFTER he took everybody's money. Everybody gets burnt out and frustrated at times, but why just abandon the project altogether? Especially when so many people paid for it, expecting patches, fixes, new content, etc. The game is fun, and it's good for what it is... but it will unfortunately most likely never be finished.			"

												Towns appears to have been inspired by the likes of Dwarf Fortress.  Like Dwarf Fortress, the graphics are rubbish and the interface is very user-unfriendly, though unlike Dwarf Fortress it's not much fun to play, particularly when you watch your villagers launch yet another kamikaze attack against a heavily-armed frogman knowing you can't do a damn thing about it. Oh, and the female villager death scream will probably haunt me for the rest of my life. One to avoid.			"

The dev posted a ton of things that never got implemented and jumped the ship with all that early access cash; leaving the game in an alpha state, full of bugs, and with mediocre gameplay.  If this were stable and had half the features and functions promised, I'd give it a solid recommendation; however, being in it's current state don't waste your time or money.			"

Not saying anything.The premise of the game is solid just it still lacks so much that would make it a good game, is it playable sure and you could probably have more then a few fun hours but the fact remains we shouldn't be rewarding devs who just dash off with our money like that.

												I wanted to like this game. I really, really did. I played this for days, almost obsessively. It almost seemed like it was starting to get better, after many hours of having it constantly crash on me, I got into the habit of saving compulsively. After losing progress, hours upon hours of progress I'd start anew, stronger, faster, better prepared. But I don't think it was ever as fun as it seemed at the time. It was horribly tedious. I often had another game going on another system at the same time, as I waited for things to happen in the background. That's not a game. That's a simulation. And if I wanted to play a simulation, I'd run one with more polish and more things that were interesting to watch. This has neither. I'm certain there's something similar, better, out there. Find it. Play that instead. Don't waste your time like I did.			"

FREEZE! Before you even think about buying this game, let me ask you a few questions. Do you like unfinished games that try to pass themselves off as ""finished""? Hopefully not.Do you like extremely buggy and unplayable games that make vanilla Bethesda games pale in comparison? You really shouldn't!And finally, do you like wasting money on a game that promised continual updates? Of course not!""Towns"" is the epitome of unrealized potential. Lazy developers took what would have been a decent time-wasting game and somehow managed to turn it into a mess. This pile of slop caused a backlash worthy of a Penny Arcade article.http://www.penny-arcade.com/report/article/the-perils-of-greenlight-how-towns-enraged-a-community-by-selling-a-game-th It was published in 2012 and still rings true over a year later.In short, please DO NOT buy this game ever.

Do not support ""cash grabs"" like Towns. Do not support SMP. This game could have been great. Instead, it ended up half-finished and abandoned like so many other early access titles.

												I played this game back when it was in alpha, back when there was still active development and a very active community. A friend of mine did a Let's Play of it and I enjoyed what I saw and played. Sadly, the last developer has finally called it quits, and I personally doubt this game will ever leave its alpha/beta state. It is fun micromanaging your town, trying to get immigrants to come to it and attract heroes to it as well, but the food system seriously needs to be reworked. My villagers can go all the way down to the bottom of my mine before needing to come back up again to eat, and since your town can experience hunger lock (Where you don't have any food at all and all villagers can't do anything due to starvation), expect a massive kill off if your food supply ever dwindles to an incredibly low number.There was a lot of potential behind this game, enough potential that I threw my money behind it back in 2011.

As a fan of the dungeon crawler genre, I kinda always asked myself how cities at these brinks of hell (diablo, sacred, baldurs gate) could even exist and this game was meant to really allow me to experience it first hand - mixed with my true favorite genre which is city building and management.Unluckily the game has been abandoned or its developed has slowed down to the point where it is basically dead, which is a very sad thing as the game is one of the most unique twists and experiences I had in a long time and I would have loved to see it getting finished or at least polished to the point where you don't get frustated with no end due to bugs ...

The AI is this game is more brainless than the original AI in Master of Orion 3.Run away, don't read about the game, if you see what it was supposed to be you will just be sad that it never made it to that point.

												In a nut shell, Towns didn't make any sense. The game was extremely boring and quite dull. There are many better town builder games out there which are very similar, but better, then Towns. At first glance the game seemed interesting and new, but it turned out to be buggy and unpleasant. It being the one of the first few games to get Greenlighted, Town had a lot of potential. Some of the blame for the flop of Towns goes to the developers. I feel like these Devs almost completely ignore there game and get out around 2 patches per year. For a game that is still this buggy the devs should be working harder.

												Disappointing.This game is a clear example of why one should be cautious when buying into a beta, alpha, or early access title. When I bought into this, Towns was in early alpha, and looked like a promising graphic upgrade to dwarf fortress. However the game is not a completed product, missing many of the features that were promised by the devs, and full of bugs. The devs left the game in a beta state.That being said I did get some enjoyment out of the game. The base idea for the game is a good one, and what is there is fun to play. However it gets old quick. I come back to the game every now and then, play an hour or two, and get bored again. All in all it was fun while it lasted. It is an unfinished game, and a good reason to be wary of early access games.  "

												The idea behind the game has merit, but in actually play I found it very boring and repetative with few moments that felt like something had been achieved or completed. There are better games for town building and better games for dungeon adventures. While this game mixes them both, it does so it a very lack luster way. If later on down the road there are some sort of objectives, quests, goals, or really anything to help give the game some momentum it may be worth revisting. For now however, I cannot reccomend this game. 4/10			"

												Excitedly coaxed into buying Towns by a friend I was incredbily dissapointed. Towns is nothing but a reskin of Dwarf Fortress (A FREE game with graphics mod already available and better also for free) with no intresting mechanics, a poor tutorial that will frustrate those not familiar with Dwarf Fortress, among techinical issues I experienced (frame drops galore on Mac). Towns is also infamous for being one of the first projects taken off of Steam Early Access. That basically means the dev, knowing it was unfinished, decided to take his project off leaving the current version available with no future updates. An unfinished project that sets a terrible, unfortunate precident for furture projects in the Early Access program.			"

Was handed off to a single third party guy after it came out for updates that the original two devs had promised an obscenely low amount of money to, he made one pretty good update before realizing it would be impossible to live on the money he was promised, and now the games developement is just over in this super pre-alpha broken state.Sad too, as it is a great idea for a game.

												Definitely not a fast paced game.  Be ready for a tutorial that waves in your general direction and then says ""you'll figure it out"".  I seriously recommend looking at the demo before trying this, as the game needs a lot of work. If you mod it heavily you can get some enjoyment out of it but most of the time you just leave it running in the background while it takes a few hours to catch up with your build orders.			"

												Unfinished game that somehow jumped from ""alpha"" to a finished game in the span of a week. At launch day, the game had such devastating bugs that made it mostly unplayable, and only some of those fatal bugs have been fixed in the year after the launch. There isn't really much actual gameplay involved, that portion of the game is out of balance and broken. Most of the things in-game don't actually do anything, they're just decoration and ""make believe"". Once you get food production running (and half of that is broken due to new patches implementing flawed animal feeding system etc), there's no longer anything interesting to see. Unless you like wasting your time building pointless things. I suppose some people do like that, but I don't. I would've actually liked to see some of that ""city management"" in the game instead.

												In a word, Unfinished.In many -- Towns is a promising, but rough experience. Nothing seems to work quite as intended, the UI is a little finicky, mouse clicks don't always register in the right place (if at all), and digging is a nightmare. The further down you dig, the more erratic the mouse behavior becomes.At 15$, I'd say the price is steep -- comparing to Minecraft, which released at a similar price, the level of functionality is far less. Though then again, the requisite functionality is far greater in the case of Towns. However, this game is flawed for a far simpler reason, it was released onto steam with no notice that it was an unfinished, alpha game -- I'm an alpha-player, I love to play and watch as a game evolves, and I am _more likely_ to purchase an alpha game than many non-alpha games. I know many of my friends feel the same way, but  this game released to steam (via Greenlight) purporting to be a fully-ready 1.0 release, and that's just not what it is.I say wait. Maybe get it if the price drops to the 2-5$ range. It has potential to be quite good, if the development continues, but everything about the more general practice smells of a smash and grab on my wallet, and I don't much care for it.Weak accept on potential, Strong Reject on Honesty.

												I'll keep this short, This game has a learning curve thats quite steep, and it will be about 3 games before you figure out the basics. By the time you have a thriving town that can sustain itself you'll feel very acomplished. Soon though, things stop being so rewarding. Your townies are irritating at best, they can die from starvation because they straded themself 2 blocks high wile building, or drown because their path took them into water. Your buildings will very quickly trade estetics for fuctionality, possibaly a gribe for someone only as perfectionist as myself. There is nothing really to do after you figured everything out, because besides for a stray orge or something random like that the challenge is gone.I'm not saying not to buy this game, if its on sale by all means buy it, the learning curve wile give you enough entirtainment at least. But, this game is buggy and unpolished, and updates are nearly non existant, so it is a risk.			"

												I bought Towns on sale just over a year ago...in that time it has received a few updates and undergone some changes.  However, this does not change the fact that this game left an utterly appalling impression upon me not only with the game but with the people working on it.  The tutorials were shamefully unhelpful, the gameplay was unintuitive, and the art style was unique but lead to an overall crude feel due to the games clunky play.As time has passed I'd expected this game to get refined some and updated to assauge some of the issues I had...but to this date the progress has been glacially slow and it remains the same lump of an overcomplicated mess that it always was.  Perhaps I'm being overly spiteful given my own impressions, but I can't for the life of me find any redeeming features about this game after it has remained the same awful product for so long.It's possible that you might enjoy this game, but I would heartily advise in-depth research about it, if not choosing a different product outright.

												When I first bought Towns from their website I thought I was getting into an early production of a great game. Even though promised updates kept me optimistic I have since fallen from that high for this game. Now it is full of bugs, new stuff that causes more bugs, and absolutely no community updates on how or where the game is going next. If developers are going to give up on a game because it isnt worth it anymore, then drop it and stop ""earning"" profit from broken software.*shorter review*This game is a great example of lazy developers			"

												There were no refunds.There was no time.Only fire.And then nothing.These two devs had a chance to make something really truly cool and wasted it with petty nonsense, if you cruise the forums for even a minute you can see what I mean. No matter what they do at this point it will be too little too late, the worst of the ideas they have is to start working on a sequel because it would be easier to cut and run then actually fix things.

												The game is fun for a while but eventually it get down to do the same thing over and over again. I have run into a few bugs but not nearly to the degree that others have. For 10$ or less it might be worth the price if you are into this type of game but there are games that do this much better.			"

												Use to be really good till they gave up on it, I'd say if you want this game take a look at Gnomoria. It's cheaper, the UI is easier to use, there's more too it and its still being worked on. You can even name your Gnomes the only downside is that it doesnt have the Hero's that towns does. But on the plus side your Gnomes can crush Goblins lungs with their bare hands.			"

												In the beginning the devs were really into developing and making this game, they promised these grand ideas, and even started to make some money from it, time went on, the game was released on steam on the back of the support they had, but they quickly realised that they were starting to make obscene amounts of money despite not providing any updates  because of the exposure steam got them... and are now pursuing their hobbies as working as cashiers at the local mall.The game is under developed, buggy, and abandoned.

												Died in infancy, a failed product of Early Access.  What killed it?  Literally Steam Early Access.  This game sold pretty solidly for a bit before that, but when it was dubbed as being ""garbage"" by a majority of steam, it seems the devs lost interst in further developing it, and moved on.Sad, but true.  Other games seem to be following in it's foot-steps however, though less in the ""Failed and Abandoned"" way.  Stonehearth looks promising, as does Timber and Stone.			"

												I originally bought this with the thought of ""Woah cool, a town simulator!"" in my mind.  After all, the screenshots showed some very epic looking towns, and the game wasn't in the Early Access category. (meaning it wasn't an alpha/beta, but rather a full release)Boy was I in for a surprise.. and not the good kind.I can sum up this game in one single word - Awful.  There was barely a tutorial involved, so I had no idea what I was doing.  I started up a game and within minutes my villagers with their fantastic AI decided to disregard all common sense and took it in turns to throw themselves at a monster, resulting in most of my population dying right away.  Those who survived died of starvation a few in-game days later because I had no idea how I was meant to feed them, despite throwing food down right infront of them.The game is filled with bugs, and there's been very little care and attention given to the game from the devs.  They've tried to pass off this game as being a full release, yet it's clearly still in alpha stage.  There's been many players complaining and demanding answers from the devs, but their cries seem to fall upon deaf ears.  Now that the devs have made a cool $2mil from this game, they couldn't care less, and it clearly shows.Don't buy this game, not even for a laugh/joke.  These developers don't deserve any of your money.			"

But later it turns into more of a settlement sim. Building ok but i wish they woulden't of done the layer thing like DF it gets very tedious. UI is pretty hard to control too. AI is bad as well. this game needs a lot of updating but the team seams to be dead and not working on this any more. So yeah thats pretty much why i thumbed this one down.. :/ Had potential too.

												The bottom line:  This game has an interesting premise.  Rather than casting you as the hero who goes into the dungeons in search of fame and glory, you are in charge of building and organizing the town above the dungeon where the hero rents his hotel room and buys his weapons.  That said, this game really isn't as much fun as it sounds.  It is an extensive exercise in MICRO-MANAGEMENT.  If you can get it for REALLY REALLY CHEAP, then it's worth playing if you enjoy games like the original Warcraft (the original, not WoW!!) or Sim City.  I have to say though, I am not a fan of any game where the townsfolk will starve to death if you just leave them alone for a while.You start out with a handful of citizens and absolutely no town.  Your first 4 hours of play will be dedicated to gathering food and setting up a farm so your citizens don't starve to death (which they will do QUITE OFTEN if you are not paying attention!!).  Your next 6 hours of play will be dedicated to mining a few piles of rock and mud, chopping down a few trees, and building some basic workshops for your citizens to work in.  Then you'll spend another 3 hours setting up a kitchen and a bakery, as well as some animal farms so your people can eat something besides apples.  Only after that will you worry about building a tavern for traveling heroes to stay and eat at.  And only after THAT will you start digging down into the dungeon.  Digging into the dungeon and having a tavern with at least one open tavern bedroom are the requirements for heroes to start coming to your town.  Different types of heroes will come based on how deep into the dungeon you are, how many people live in your town, and what type of furniture you have in the tavern bedroom.  Once you do get into the dungeons, there are a ton of monsters which will probably kill everyone who finds their way down the  tunnel.  But there are more resources in the dungeon that you can't find on the surface, like iron, copper, silver, and gold... and you need a ton of those to build better weapons and armor for your city guards.  Meanwhile, you might randomly have a Werepig go berserk on your town and KILL EVERYONE, or you might have a sudden invasion by monsters from the forest and THEY ALL DIE.  But NEVER FORGET... the number one priority AT ALL TIMES has to be food production or else your entire city will starve because the citizens are as stupid as rocks.One good thing about this game is that it is VERY EASY to create mods for it.  You can mess with the amount and placement of various resources, enemies, even mountains and plants.  If you want to get deeper into the config files, you can even change the number of citizens you start with, alter citizen and hero attributes, and even alter enemies to make them easier or harder.

												The game is broken.  Bottem line.Its hard to describe because the game WAS (the devs gave up once they got the $) getting patched so broken things were removed... and then new broken things were added in but here is a list of what I found the most broken.1. Building is not fun.  There is no easy copy and paste for buildings.  And if there is, then it is hidden under the games terrible interface.  It can take a lot of effort of placing certain building blocks in certain orders to build a house with the clunky building controls.  But then if you have to do it at least 20 more times if you want to get townies.  It can take a while.2.  The interface is horrible.  The labels are off.  It just felt clunky.  First you have to click one menu button, then you have to click a sub menu button and find what you want.  Then if its something like wheat and you want it to be bread you have to go into more menus and submenus to find what you want.  The bread making tools and blocks should all be on the same page not scattered around.3.  Your villagers are idiots.  They have no clue how to do anything without dieing.  Horrible monsters attacking?  Don't worry, your villagers will just stand there and die instead of running.  Sometimes they run indoors but most of the time go around doing what they normally do.  Their are even some maps with randomly wandering enemys, I dont have a problem with that but they do it so poorly in Towns.  In the snow maps one stray yeti can just wander on over and kill EVERYONE.  Also they will run though hell and back...to get stone.  I have seen them go on some brave runs just to get a basic resource.  You got to give them credit.  They will stop are nothing to drag that junk back to the stockpile... even if they all die in the process.4.  The monsters that attack your village come out of THIN AIR.  You would think they would come from any dungeon entrances you have but they seem to pop out of midair at times.  5.  Monsters are either really OP or really easy.  I watched a guard kill five slimes once.  Then I watched three guards with iron gear just get massacred by ONE wearpig. (Which is actually a common enemy.  Any normal pig could be a wearpig.)  6.  Hero's are broken.  I must have done EVERYTHING I could think of to attract a hero.  They never come.  They are broken.  That or the system is terrible.  Either way the game dosen't explain things and after browsering the web for a while I still can't get damn Heros.  Worst part is.  You need heros to clear dungeons, but you can never get them it seems.7  The way you make your townies happy is stupid.  They mainly get happy from eating.  Problem is, if you have food that fills them up a lot and dosen't make them eat as often.  YOU GET PUNISHED.  I actally tested this at one point by making bread fill 1500%.  Sure enouth happyness dropped to zero because they were not eating.   You can do a few other things like have badger fights (which seem broken) and put decorations but it seems food is what they want the most.  So remember, just spam cakes.  Anything that actually fills their stomachs is bad.  They don't want to be full.  THey want to be hungry.  Makes zero sense.    8.  Last thing I am going to mention is the dungeons...THEY ARE EVERYWHERE.  It seems I can't dig down at all without hititng a dungeon on most map.s  I just wan't some stone but the game shoves the dungeons everywhere.  They cover the whole map when they should be deep underground and have SMALL entrances.    Now things may have changed since I wrote this but this is what I encountered when I played the game.  And maybe some of the issues I mentioned have easy fixes but there is a problem...THE GAME SHOULD EXPLAIN IT THEN.  There is no tutorial.  Well there claims to be one but it just starts you off on fixed map without telling you much.  You have to find the message log and it tells you to do basic stuff.  Nice they have one at all but it never explains the fine details of the game.  Just the basic crude that I could probably figure out just by expermenting.			"

												Not quite as riddled with bugs as some of the reviews would have you believe. Nevertheless, later on in the game as your population really grows and you start wanting to build real structures it gets... frustrating. I'm a really patient guy, but this game nearly had me swearing at the screen a few times.And as a previous reviewer stated, the game doesn't really explain anything... at all. I had to do some mad googling just to figure out some of the less obvious key mechanics.			"

												This game is abandoned by the developers so no more updates to fix this buggy pile of ♥♥♥♥. I played this game before it came out on steam (so my hours played is wrong), i was in an area with no internet and had a new computer so i only had towns installed because it looked like a promising game; with awesome stuff to build, nice customization (many blocks and armours) and a cool endgame with adventurers helping your town, but after some hours of playing i'd rather just look at a plain wall for three days. The stuff you see in the screenshots are quite ""end game"", even the most simple structures, your ""townies"" will most often sleep eat and work outside because you won't be bothered building houses because the building system is VERRY frustrating because:1. Your townies do not indicate whether or not they can build something unlike Dwarf-Fortress and Gnomoria and your townies can't reach ♥♥♥♥.2. Most building-blocks require some weird-♥♥♥♥ items like slime ""stuff"" (can't remember name and this game is to horible to back and look) to make some stone bricks. Why? I don't know but it hampers creativity.3. You can't build floors unlike DF or Gnomoria so every story you add you need an extra layer just for floors (this may have canged, it was a long time since i played)There is a solution for the reatching problem and that is ""scafolding"" a block that can be stood upon, walked troug and climbed up. it's completley free so it feels like cheating using it. In other games that adds a scafolding sort of thing they usually cost resorces because scafolding tends to be realy good for moving around. The scafolding tool has been dubed a ""god tool"" by the comunity because it is realy OP. Other god tools are things like the ability to drop lava anywhere on the map.At least you can get a lot of hours out of this game, but i would definetly NOT recomend it. Go play Gnomoria (that is 2 euros cheaper), DF (that is free) or any other city builder but definatly DO NOT play Towns.			"

												Game was disappointing and unfinished when I bought it, but there was a promise of ""will be further updated later"". Apparently the developer has now abandoned the game, leaving it half finished. Complete rip-off; there is no way this should be on sale without an ""Early Access"" tag, and seeing as it will now likely never be finished it is difficult to see how even that would be fair advertising. Buggy, unbalanced, and with many obvious missing features; it compares badly with many games currently available in the same genre, many cheaper and some free.Current price is £9.99, which is insane- almost twice the current price of Gnomoria. Might be worth 10% of that as a brief diversion, but frankly anything more than ""free"" is probably a waste.			"

												This game had so much potential. I put a lot of hours into building several towns. While I would not necessarily call this 'abandonware' just yet as there have been updates, the feeling is that it's been put so far on the backburner that we will never see a completed product or, by the time we do, what will be the point? Something better or newer will come out to take it's place.The developer insisted that the product is playable upon time of release, after Early Access was terminated. While the game was playable, the words were decieiving. A playable game should not be released if there are still countless bugs to be fixed and several key features that have not been added to the game.It's such a shame, because the game had great potential and an idea for a somewhat unique mechanic. But I can't recommend this game to anyone, unless you are looking for examples of how a good concept can go bad, learn the idea, and take time to figure out how to improve upon it with your own game. Even if the developer would fix the bugs and implement all originally discussed and intended features as described, I just have no faith in the developer and this game anymore.R.I.P. Towns.			"

												Seems fun, was kinda fun for the first 10 hours then you hit a point where you see all that is wrong with this game. It's unfinished, not supported anymore, hardly fixed with mods, redundant and to top it all you can lose all your progress if you arent careful and something goes wrong with AI (which WILL happen at one point or another). To try and make it possible to have a lasting town, you better read the wiki and follow every single tidbit of info. so basically you read a flowchart, apply it and you can see what it has to offer, which by the way once you read the wiki loses most of it's appeal. Another one of those could have, should have, would have games that had a lot of hype that failed to deliver. get gnomara instead if you absolutely want a game of this kind on steam (or even better, just stick to dwarf fortress)			"

												I really wanted to be able to recommend this game.  I really did.  Unfortunately, a game that many customers paid money for has been abandoned, leaving only the bare-bones alpha build for review or recommendation.  As things stand, this game had a lot of potential, but it was abandoned by the original designers.  The game's future is uncertain, but as things stand, the product is as good as abandoned.   This is a huge letdown to anyone who put up the money to support this project.  I don't know what I expected from the finished product, but I did expect a finished product.			"

												The game is broken.  Bottem line.Its hard to describe because the game WAS (the devs gave up once they got the $) getting patched so broken things were removed... and then new broken things were added in but here is a list of what I found the most broken.1. Building is not fun.  There is no easy copy and paste for buildings.  And if there is, then it is hidden under the games terrible interface.  It can take a lot of effort of placing certain building blocks in certain orders to build a house with the clunky building controls.  But then if you have to do it at least 20 more times if you want to get townies.  It can take a while.2.  The interface is horrible.  The labels are off.  It just felt clunky.  First you have to click one menu button, then you have to click a sub menu button and find what you want.  Then if its something like wheat and you want it to be bread you have to go into more menus and submenus to find what you want.  The bread making tools and blocks should all be on the same page not scattered around.3.  Your villagers are idiots.  They have no clue how to do anything without dieing.  Horrible monsters attacking?  Don't worry, your villagers will just stand there and die instead of running.  Sometimes they run indoors but most of the time go around doing what they normally do.  Their are even some maps with randomly wandering enemys, I dont have a problem with that but they do it so poorly in Towns.  In the snow maps one stray yeti can just wander on over and kill EVERYONE.  Also they will run though hell and back...to get stone.  I have seen them go on some brave runs just to get a basic resource.  You got to give them credit.  They will stop are nothing to drag that junk back to the stockpile... even if they all die in the process.4.  The monsters that attack your village come out of THIN AIR.  You would think they would come from any dungeon entrances you have but they seem to pop out of midair at times.  5.  Monsters are either really OP or really easy.  I watched a guard kill five slimes once.  Then I watched three guards with iron gear just get massacred by ONE wearpig. (Which is actually a common enemy.  Any normal pig could be a wearpig.)  6.  Hero's are broken.  I must have done EVERYTHING I could think of to attract a hero.  They never come.  They are broken.  That or the system is terrible.  Either way the game dosen't explain things and after browsering the web for a while I still can't get damn Heros.  Worst part is.  You need heros to clear dungeons, but you can never get them it seems.7  The way you make your townies happy is stupid.  They mainly get happy from eating.  Problem is, if you have food that fills them up a lot and dosen't make them eat as often.  YOU GET PUNISHED.  I actally tested this at one point by making bread fill 1500%.  Sure enouth happyness dropped to zero because they were not eating.   You can do a few other things like have badger fights (which seem broken) and put decorations but it seems food is what they want the most.  So remember, just spam cakes.  Anything that actually fills their stomachs is bad.  They don't want to be full.  THey want to be hungry.  Makes zero sense.    8.  Last thing I am going to mention is the dungeons...THEY ARE EVERYWHERE.  It seems I can't dig down at all without hititng a dungeon on most map.s  I just wan't some stone but the game shoves the dungeons everywhere.  They cover the whole map when they should be deep underground and have SMALL entrances.    Now things may have changed since I wrote this but this is what I encountered when I played the game.  And maybe some of the issues I mentioned have easy fixes but there is a problem...THE GAME SHOULD EXPLAIN IT THEN.  There is no tutorial.  Well there claims to be one but it just starts you off on fixed map without telling you much.  You have to find the message log and it tells you to do basic stuff.  Nice they have one at all but it never explains the fine details of the game.  Just the basic crude that I could probably figure out just by expermenting.			"

Check the Official Forums, keep an eye out for developments or any news pertaining to this and if you see nothing new in the coming months (development with the new programmer starts in March, and this guy seems to really want to take the game forward), then I'd turn away and never look back.Then again, there is a good possibility that should things not go according to plan with this new programmer, that this game will go Open Source anyway, at which point you'll be paying £10 for some DRM and an older version of the game :P			"

												Legitimately one of the biggest disappointments on Steam early access. Let's not kid ourselves- Greenlit games are often half-built engines that never see the light of further development. But this takes the cake. Left sitting here alone since 2013, this game had promise, but was only ever a simple town simulator- and not even a good one. I'm personally so tired of paying for games to be developed in hopes my money will be put to use creating something amazing, and while this had some direction and potential, in the end it was abandoned and we were all quite honestly ♥♥♥♥ed for supporting it.

												I don't have much to say about the gameplay of this game since I gave up on it a couple of months earlier, for it's buggy, controls are tedious, often gives you literally instant death starts, and the graphics are just outright horrendous, reminiscent of cheap point-and-click adventure games. And most importantly - the developers gave up too. It has been at least five full months since the latest update. When you flood the market with thousands of greenlit indie, early access games, there're bound to be duds. I understand that this game was still early in development when I got it and things indeed might turn sour since life is so unpredictable, but it's still so frustrating that what you bought at a real game's price suddenly went silent with updates without giving any real explanation beforehand.For all intents and purposes we could say that this game is effectively dead now. Consider getting Gnomoria if you liked this game's concept, it's currently in active development and even though the dev ""team"" seems to be just one man, he (or she?) at least gives consistent weekly updates with real content and interacts with players regularly.

												The idea of this game is kind of cool.  Unfortunatly that is all this game really is, an idea.  There are a lot of unfinished game-play mechancis. you know, interesting ideas, that just do not go anywhere.For the most part, you start a town, get your food production going and then you need to attract heros to clear out the gaint dungeon undernearth your town.  So what do you end up doing with most of your time once you get past the startup phase?You just watch the heroes bumble around and try and clear out one level of the dungeon.  And when they are done with that?  You just get to watch them do the same thing on the next level.  Thats all you do. Oh sure, you can build stuff for the sake of building stuff, like a garden or place decortave statues, but something really useful?  No.My reccomendation is to NOT buy this game.  Maybe in a few years the game-play will be fleshed out more, but right now, there isn't much, if any, of a game here.			"

												I really loved this game and got it way back before it was on steam or even greenlight. I was excited by all the updates and look forward to them fixing the AI with the towny's (cuz they could be just dumb sometimes).  I haven't played in a long time and came back hoping for new development only to find out it was abandoned b/c of burnout in May2014. What a shame, I paid my money to support the project and  it's sad that it will not even get to beta. The main Towns website and forums are down now. I would have given this a hearty thumbs up but must vote no. Tired of getting taken from developers promising something great, showing the potential but never coming through aka Cubeworld and many others.			"

												0/10Do not buy Towns.  It has ripped off too many people.Towns is a game about building a village for simulated RPG adventurers. Reading about all the features it had and all the downloads, I figured I would throw in my $5 and play. This is 2013 by the way. Unfortunately, the game was unplayable. With a glitchy interface and the inability to even pass the tutorial or even build one room.A few months passed from August 2013 and Steam decides to release Green Light, I service indicating which games are incomplete but still up for purchase. To my surprise, Towns was lumped into the newly founded category. Basically, I bought a game I did not know was incomplete. The optimistic side of me thought that Towns would be complete some time in the future.Fast forward a year to 2014 and I see news that Towns developers gave up on ever finishing the game. Meaning they simply took off with my money.http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/217154/Alphafunded_Steam_game_Towns_abandoned_by_devs.phpUpon hearing the news, I was again disappointed. The following year, Steam released a refund policy. I was excited to read that they would allow refunds that were within 14 days with less than one hour of play time. Given that I have clocked a whopping, miserable 19 minutes on Towns, I figured I could do one last attempt.... DENIED.So here I am, writing about how much I have been ripped off from buying the game Towns. It was $5 sure, but I didn't know it was incomplete at the time and Steam fails to acknowledge their mistake.I hope this is the right forum to post to because quite frankly, I feel people should know the darker side that is Steam.Moral of the story.DO NOT BUY TOWNS			"

												I so wanted to see this game finished. As it stands, there are far too many bugs in it and the AI periodically commits suicide doing dumb stuff forcing you to repetitively micro manage everything. Imagine the old sims games where you had to tell your sims to go to the bathroom or they ♥♥♥♥ their pants, now imagine the old sims games where you had to micro manage 50 sims spreadout in a ridiculously huge area trying to click on them to each tell them to go take a ♥♥♥♥ before they ♥♥♥♥ their pants.I dunno where I am going with this, all I know is that the devs have abandoned the game and are treating all the paying customers like absolutely garbage. The game's AI is god awful and lots of seemingly simple things have repetitive and/or unnecessarily time-consuming or drawn-out ways of doing things and you will spend majority of your time making sure your AI don't kill themselves by being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.The micro management doesn't only involve the AI, just controlling your resources is a massive headache. As a person who has programmed several Unity games, one of them ended up with 2 million plays, I have absolutely no idea what possessed the developer to take this game in such a sensely complex direction. I can understand that not all game programmers are 'game designers' and are incapable of seeing the flaws in their design, but ♥♥♥♥ at least run it by a friend who can give you honest feedback. This game went horribly wrong at the beginning and the dev likely abandoned it due to needing to spend too much work redoing 90% of the game to make it actually make sense.			"

												If Gabe were as awesome as we'd like to believe, he'd give us a $15 voucher for another game. The best analogy I can come up with:Gaben is a wealthy pharmacist. He knows his job is to acquire new prescriptions for his large community. Now, there are so many new drugs coming out every day, that Gaben has to ask his community, ""What new drugs should we offer at the pharmacy?""The community heard some neat things about this Townsicol, a do-everything drug. Gaben can only assume that his community knows what they want, even though they don't often know how to get the information about the pharmaceutical companies that made the drug, at least not as profieciently as Gaben. The people assure Gaben that yes, we want Townsicol in the pharmacy!So Gaben orders Townsicol, even though it hasn't gone through proper FDA qualifications.The people buy up their prescriptions of their new drug and GOSH! IT TASTES AWFUL! OH GOD! IT'S GIVEN ME DYSENTERY! WHY GA-BGLALARBGB-BEN WHY-ARHGBLARBL?!But Gaben, watching his customers launch projectile vomit at one another, is distressed. He feels bad for his customers, but THEY ASKED FOR THIS. He brought it in as a special order and the man that sold it to him has completely disappeared like some peddler pushing snake oil! Worse, there are those, like yours truly, that watched everyone throw up, walked through that lake of vomit, waded to the counter in all the puke they had expelled, and bought a bottle of Townsicol for themselves.TL;DR game's bad; developers ran with the money; don't buy it, ♥♥♥♥♥.

												The idea of this game was something i couldn't ignore. Sadly, i should have. Bugs, and lack of any sort of walk through, or starting help. Just to start off with. AI that is more likely to kill itself off at first chance than not, can be very frustrating to say the very least. Beyond that, lets look at a very important aspect of the game.The Dev team. They have dropped the game, and decided to come back, more often than i can believe. The very fact that they decided to drop it even once says a lot. The fact that the hired help, decided to jump ship, because he found out.. there wasn't going to be much of a pay check, says a lot. This is very much a ""buyer beware"". The game isn't finished. The game according to some news feeds is never going to be finished, and yet the games forums (not steam) says they've decided to work on it... ""again""Just save your money, and look towards a different game. I know, i will personally be avoiding any game made by this group in the future.			"

Infact, since there is no ingame help of any kind, you will be going to the internet to figure out some mechanics of this game.Villager path finding is always shortest route, regardless of danger. Hostile NPC's do have random and specific spawns, but more often then not I feel they are hunting me down.Building is somewhat confusing till you get the hang of it. The only drawback is, if you don't build in small sections the game seems to hang on larger designs. The same goes for most the resource managment.

Every once in a while, I fire it back up to see if I can approach it from a different angle; maybe I missed something the first 30-40 times I tried playing it. It always ends the same; villagers follow no discernable path, nor can they be directed to follow a reasonable path, villagers will get stuck and eventually die of starvation, basic mobs that roam the surface will overwhelm even 3 or 4 villagers at once, villagers will not retreat if they are wounded, issuing building commands is fruitless, at best, etc.Don't give SMP or the devs the benefit of thinking they've made a good game.

Alpha?... Kind/try of Beta?... version of the game.That said, the actual devs are still trying to fix the MESS of the game´s code, what is taking an entire human age. Specially because they are getting negative profits and this is more a charge than a work for them (and I could say they are doing this only because they are mad, or they truely love the game).Don´t expect an update soon...

												I have lost all hope for this game.  I won’t argue anything about the initial release.  This game, overall, feels like a never ending chore of keeping villagers alive without the meaningful ability to micromanage functions of the game.  If it were not for modding, I would declare this game as being unworthy of disk space.  If you are unsure about purchasing this game simply look at some objective reviews on this game, and its forums.In short, ""Would not recommend"". "

												The game is fun and simple. With a Minecraft feel town, you mine resources to build, feed, and dig. The thing that really hurts this game is the lack of udates from the devs. The base game will hold you for awhile, but then the frustration due to the lack of variety will settle in, and the game will get dull.

												Oh how I wish I didn't have to give this game a negative review. I can tell, that this game, if it were to be finished, would be a game I'd cherish. The aspect of this game, the functionality, the rpg/sandbox/strategy elements of this game are all my cup of tea when it comes to PC games. Unfortunately, I cannot give this ""would be"" game the approval for others to invest their time and money into. Every feature this game has to offer is unfinished and unpolished. Perhaps because there was a lot of tweaking and additional content planned for this game that have yet to be implemented. I really hope this game isn't dead for good, but it has dug itself into a rut with its massive amounts of negative reviews. I cannot disagree with them. It is wrong for the current developer to sell it as a complete game. Unless this game gets any further development, my negative review shall remain.			"

Every once in a while, I fire it back up to see if I can approach it from a different angle; maybe I missed something the first 30-40 times I tried playing it. It always ends the same; villagers follow no discernable path, nor can they be directed to follow a reasonable path, villagers will get stuck and eventually die of starvation, basic mobs that roam the surface will overwhelm even 3 or 4 villagers at once, villagers will not retreat if they are wounded, issuing building commands is fruitless, at best, etc.Don't give SMP or the devs the benefit of thinking they've made a good game. They stopped supporting it over 1 year ago and have no intention of ever proceeding with its development and improvement.			"

However, this game always felt like it was designed for a tablet or phone and was horribly unpolished and glitchy with poor AI. I can't recommend it because development has stopped. Progress through different coloured ores and baddy drops didn't appeal to me so I never bothered digging past the first few levels of dungeon.A nice distraction and would be good if finished. Unfinished it doesn't cut the mustard. Perhaps play Rimworld instead or I hear there is a similar dwarf game.			"

												The major problem with this game is the large gap between early game and late game and just hoping you ger a map with access to flint and coal early. WIthout it th game slows down to an less enjoyable pace that oten feels like there is no progression at all.  Problems where towns people will eat raw meat over cooked still excist as well. I was hopefull when this first showed up on desura but it just stopped advancing at some point and does not feel complete.			"

												The interface and controls feel clunky, and the tutorial is terrible at explaining stuff. I lost the will to continue playing after 10 minutes. Despite the amount of content this game feels like a beta or perhaps even an alpha. I wish I had played the demo first, could've saved the money.EDIT: Steam turned down my refund request because it had been more than 2 weeks since I bought the game, even though back when I got this game the refund policy wasn't in place yet. What good is even letting you request refunds on games that you bought more than 2 weeks ago if they won't refund you for abandonware?			"

												Was interested about this game because a Yogscast Sips was payed to play it by devolpers and he made  it look fun. Once i bought the game it was obvious how unfinished it was. I tried comming back to the game a year later and litteraly nothing had  changed. The devolopers of this game are crooks and never finished. I have tried to get a refund but Steam won't let me. Dont buy this game, it will never get finished and was a huge scam. The only good this game has done is make me more cautius of buying ""beta"" or ""alpha"" games. I just don't buy games anymore if they look partialy unfinished.			"

												Pros: Building your town one block at a time is good fun, and exploring the random environments is enjoyable,Cons: It contains a ""happiness"" mechanic that rewards you for not playing and -- annoyingly -- forces you to leave the game running on its own for long periods in order to advance well.Certainly worth a look, but lacks the long-term appeal of Terraria.

												I´ve voted ""No, i do not recommend this game"" but i really would like to say: ""Yes!""Why? This game really gave me some good time, cause i like the freedom in which you're able to build up a town, the retroish graphics and the possibility to alter the game due editing some xml files. Unfortunately the problems start right there: Since the engine limits the world to a 64*64 cube, you have to choose between dungeon roaming and building high up in the air, when altering the world generation (only a change in values). Last one is my favorite playstyle... or: would be, if the engine would not getting annoyingly laggy with more than 12 surface leves. There seem to be too many transparent blocks which affects the game as soon as you are giving more than two orders to your Townies. So, i am just not able to build high buildings without having a second lag, a second none, a second lag, a sec.. you get it. And that ""really grinds my gears"".Also, the menu is crap and the tutorial basically only explains how to move your mouse from left to right and bottom to top. Furthermore, there are some serious bugs, which are a total pain in the a**. Check out the Community Hub's discussion to get an idea of them, it is a long list.And yes, the devs spoofed those who bought this game, cause updates came in irregularily, were minor and the communication to us customers is worth mentioning.At the moment rumors say the devs are looking for someone new to heritage this project. We´ll see.After all Towns is a perfect example for everything which could go wrong with Steam's Greenlight/Early Access policy (or which mechanism else failed).I recommend to keep this game in mind, check for updates and buy it when the ♥♥♥♥♥torm moves on.

												Bought this game with the hopes of a decent more visual version of a Dwarf Fortress style game. Instead it's a fairly unplayable, boring mess. The main focus, settlement building, controls horribly and is far from enjoyable. This game is a chore rather than a joy. Now that development has stopped and it will forever remain an unfinished mess I feel cheated out of my money, although since it wasn't sold as officially being early access I suppose I share the blame there.

												(Game has been abandoned by the developers at what feels like late alpha / early beta)I haven't really read any of the other reviews, except a quick glance at some of the positives, as I don't want mine to be influenced by them in any way. I will note that many of the positive reviews seem to be accidental recommendations, and Steam needs to remove that as the default option :PSo.. Towns. Well it's a decent base for a game, and I generally enjoyed the parts of it which worked properly, but that's really where it ends. If you try, you can perhaps push 20 hours or so out of the game, but ultimately the bugs and complete lack of content and polish will leave you despairing at the developers, who have abandoned this game.The screenshots paint a pretty picture of flourishing towns and wonderful defenses, but it doesn't really apply to a real game, and you'll find yourself becoming frustrated at how fiddly everything is and how face-palmingly unintelligent the AI is, being almost unable to self regulate their most basic requirements. They almost seem suicidal.. but given the state of the game, I won't hold it against them.Ultimately what you see in the screenshots is pretty much everything, and at it's unlikely best (visually). I strongly resent paying full price for games being brought to market which are late alpha/early beta, especially when the developers dump them and run off with the money because they don't really feel like doing it anymore. That's theft where I come from. I don't think the game was officially an 'Early Access' game? Just Greenlight perhaps, but either way I won't be buying a game until it's fully released from now on, and I wish Steam would pull this game off the store and stop putting it on sale. It's a skeleton of a game and will never be more than that.			"

												The developer of Towns doesn't answer questions or communicate at all.The game is abandoned.They made literally millions of dollars & ran!!Recent updates include things which we already modded in ourselves.You cannot fill a hole with dirt, after removing the dirt.Some of the photos on the Store Page are not accurate!!It is an unfinished piece of crap which was sold as a 'finished' game.Even now, Steam & this inbred designer are selling it under a misleading description!!Look around & see what everyone else thinks too.!!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!

												I would not recommend this game to the ones who burned my village and ♥♥♥♥♥ my family. The tale of this game tells of crimes bigger than those committed during the genocide of Rwanda. YetiChow, the moderator on the forum deletes all forms of critique against the game (For that matter he also mods the steam forum).The devs are quiet, they have spoken more of the game on other forums during the last years. A lot of news regarding the game has come in the form of posts dropped on these other forums. the list goes on. They even tried to trick a poor dev into quitting his job and working full time on the game (which I think he actually did), but as the hut was already burning, he got in big financial problems and had to quit.I give it a NO			"

												First off, this game is the embodiment of early access games gone wrong. It's terrible when developers don't deliver on every promise, because this game had a lot of potential.That said, the game you see now is complete and wont see any future updates. It is very difficult and takes a long time to progress, which is good. There is definitely replay value as well. The one thing I hate most about this game is how the levels work when you're trying to build everything.Tl;dr- It's good as-is,  but the developer is terrible, so buy it at a discount when you can.

												I'm in a minority, but I really did enjoy this game. It may be unfinished, and abandoned, but in current state of affairs, it still gives me tons of fun. Best part of it, it is very moddable, and still gives you a challenge - definitely not on Dwarf Fortress level (which it took idea from), so casual players can still enjoy it.			"

I still enjoy going back to it every once in a while and getting 10+ hours of game play each time. I would recommend getting this game on sale for somewhere around $5.00. 6/10			"

												Towns is one of my favorite settlement building games, and I  have played over 200 hrs.  It's in depth and challenging but sadly ragged around the edges. The developer abandoned the game a couple of years ago so it will never get finished, but it is still playable, as long as you don't mind not having an end game. It's hard to pick up, difficult to master, but still very satisfying to build a working, living settlement.			"

												Only steam game I've regretted buying, even the one's I've played little of. Mostly because if I'd taken a minute to google it first I wouldn't have wasted that money. Been kicking myself ever since.As everyone else says, if you like the idea of this game, just get Dwarf Fortress for the modest price of free.			"
