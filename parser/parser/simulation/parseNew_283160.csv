												Re-reviewing now that it's out of Early Access.Nothing has changed other than adding an endless Challenge Mode.  The entire game takes an hour to beat, then there are two more difficulty levels per mission, so three hours total if you want to re-experience everything you already did but with tougher enemies.The physics, sound effects, music and space combat are all GREAT and it really feels like flying a fighter from Battlestar Galactica.It's fun, but sure as hell not $20 USD worth of fun.  There's just not enough here.  If the story was longer and there was more meat to the combat - you're limited to fighters - I'd say go for it.  It feels more like a demo than a game.			"

								I followed the development of this game for years. I've never done that before. But it looked like Mike, the developer, was doing something different than all the other space games coming out these days in a good way. He delivered.This type of space game has been sorely needed. Elite Dangerous and Star Citizen are fine, but if I could put all the problems I have with those games into one word, it would be ""realism"". We need more games that focus on the *feel* of the experience and House of the Dying Sun does just that. It feels great. I was able to easily rework the controls to my preference. The sound design and the entire aesthetic are fantastic. I love the ""low poly"" look of it. The fighter feels nice and responsive, and that drift button. Oh man. That drift button...It feels like a solid spiritual successor to the excellent space fighter games of old - X-Wing and Tie Fighter.Didn't have too much time to play, but I'm anxious to get back into it. For the Emperor!			"

								The atmosphere is amazing. Ship designs are fantastic. The sound design and music are great. Watching capital ships slug it out is super cool. There's a lot to love and there's no doubt in my mind it IS a good game.However, the amount of content is lacking.You'll have a maximum of three ship types in your fleet.You remain in the same fighter throughout which can begin to feel stale.Although it technically has 42 missions (14 missions with 3 difficulties), only the hardest missions last anything over a couple of minutes.There's little to no strategic component. For the most part, you just order your capital ships at a target and they'll wipe it out. Loosing ships is of little consequence. You can have your entire fleet get wiped out and jump into the next mission with all 7 ships. I couldn't find a use for any upgrade other than the jump drive (your mileage may vary)Overall, unless you REALLY enjoy replaying the same missions, I can't imagine you'll get more than a couple hours of gametime from the whole thing in it's current state. That's not to say you won't enjoy those hours. Most of these issues would be fixed with some sort of procedural campaign with a persistent fleet and a couple fighter variants. Short version, good game but could do with more content :)			"

								Honestly, I came away from this game disappointed.I'll start off with nice things. The actual second-to-second gameplay mechanics work well. The flying is probably the nicest combination of arcade-y feel and realistic movement I've ever played. The muted sounds and reduced speed during drift mode makes the game feel like you're piloting a submarine at times, which fits with the very busy environment of Homeworld-esque space. The shooting is well-done, rewarding skill while not asking too much of you and for the most part, everything is smoothed over with the calculating hand of a well-versed developer. The missions are pretty functional, the graphics are good and show an artistic flair you don't see often in sci-fi these days.Unfortunately, the game is also one of the shallowest I've ever played. You've pretty much completed the game by the time you've played the first mission and theres no expansion of what you do at all from there. You have bubble shields to get under which adds gameplay, but then you get a weapon that renders them almost meaningless. The tactical decisions you make are barely relevent and the strategic choices of what ships you have and what weapons to equip them are even worse. The bonus system is nice, but theres no reward for it. Killing escape pods is basically an annoyance that you have to do, lining up a tiny target in a submarine for no reason other then to waste a few seconds. The missions last no more then a few minutes by their very design and outright punish you for taking your time. You can beat the game in an hour, two if you screw around alot like I did. For fifteen bucks, thats a hard sell.But what bothers me, honestly, is how much potential this game squanders. I've been following this for years, and the game I was following was a quasi-roguelike space shooter with tactical elements. The promise of an open battlefield and a quick transfer, watching a powerful but slow force desperately try to deal with your precision strikes as you move about, striking weak positions and garnering the resources to build a more domineering fleet. The possibilities were endless and the theme of playing the bad guy against a greater force. Taiidani fighters against a Kharak empire.But what I got was a shell of what I expected. Instead of a castle, I got a rock so smoothed of all sharp edges that you can see your own reflection in it. I got a shallow, snack-shaped bite of a game. A Ground Zeroes from where a Phantom Pain should be. I'm a victim of my own heightened expectation, I guess. But I've never played a game so bitterly disappointing.			"

Early Access Review
								First off I have to note for those reading this  was an impulse buy. Saw a youtube video in my sub box and by the end of the video I was reaching for my wallet. I also do not own any VR gear so I don't have a clue of that side of things.This game does two things extremely well.Immersion:This game has immersion in ample supply, the sound design is the biggest hitter in this department. Coming out of warp, pushing thrusters to full with that muffled thrum coming from behind to the muffled sound of your auto-cannon, maneuvering thrusters  softly hissing in the background, and the snap of the torpedo launching from your fighter. They are all as you would expect being in a vacuum. To top it all off you get wardrums as your OST something akin to BattleStar Galactica. The HUD is of something from modern era fighter jets with near flat color and many geometric shapes. Watching as your shell casings whip by as you unload your auto-cannon adds to the feeling that it is real, or at least believable.Mechanics:(I highly suggest playing with a mouse and keyboard as the gamepad was not precise enough.)The interceptor controls tightly, after an hour of play maneuvering became much than just drifting past other ships. Pitching and yawing while drifting to quickly change targets became reactionary. Even though you are stuck in one type of ship it didn't get old and I can see myself spending more time flying around without getting bored. The addition of the tactical mode/command mode is extremely useful, micro managing individual ships to targets or around an asteroid to flank a ship. It gives me Homeworld feelings all over again.The stuff that needs work.The Tactical mode:While it is useful there are some functions that I find need to be there. Being able to target multiple ships with just creating a selection box, giving multiple ships the same move command, creating control groups, and special orders. I expect these things because it invokes such a Homeworld vibe and find myself asking why something isn't there to have to remind myself it isn't Homeworld.Content:This is the single biggest issue I've had while 14 missions was long enough for me to get almost five hours out of it and I'll get about three more for replay value. There are people who blew through it in just a hour. The lack of more missions is the biggest hindrance to the game. In general I just want more, more ships, more weapons, more upgrades, more abilities, just more everything. It's not hard to fix the mission part, give the community a mission and map editor then hook the game up to the workshop and bam endless missions to be had. Would I still buy it again?Oh, hell yes I would. Those few hours of content had me so focused and immersed in the game I was almost late for work today. The game is just plain fun, enough there to make you think but not too much so that there is a massive learning curve. The game strikes the proper balance. Do you want 14 missions flying around and blowing crap up with hints of a RTS? THEN BUY IT.P.S. This is my first review and I'm sorry if this is kinda a mess.			"

												At the moment there isn't enough of a game to warrent the £14.99 price tag. The combat is fun, and has echos of freespace 2 about it. Physics and controlls are excellent, as is the sound effects and radio chatter in the background which reminds me of homeworld.The problem is there is no story. At the start of the game it prints on screen that the emperor is dead, and he's final orders to you are kill the people who betrayed him. Then there are 14 missions of turn up at random point in space and kill someone, and warp away. Each of which takes around 2-5 minutes.So there is an hour of gameplay here, and a story that could've been written in a pub in less than the time it would take to drink half a pint of a mild session ipa.What most dissapointing is how great this could have been had they bothered to make a game rather than just an engine.

Early Access Review
								Great game. The audio/visual treatment is cohesive with the writing and story, and it sets a mood that's hard to describe and sets it apart from other space sims. All of it is really impressive. The controls feel fantastic, and I've tried both a gamepad and a HOTAS. The latter works great, but the default gamepad controls are so fun that I ended up just going that for convenience. I play in VR, so it's cool that I can just sit anywhere and face anywhere. Speaking of VR, it's also implemented well. There's a subtle touch when you first boot the game where you activate the menu by pressing the button that resets the view to your current position, and points out that you can hit that button again at any time. That small attention to detail shows the consideration the dev put into VR. Other flight sims don't mention that functionality at all and bury it in the button assignments, but it's a critical part of VR. Anyway, the rest of the VR presentation really nails it. Like all things VR, it's hard to describe, but I'll say that the sense of presence is some real next level stuff. I found myself looking backwards to track incoming missile barrages, to time my jukes behind an asteroid. Give that a try, you'll see how neat it is.Looking forward to more additions to the game, this one is a winner.			"

Early Access Review
								Ever wondered what would happen, if someone made a spiritual successor to Tie Fighter? Well this game may not be it, but so far it's the closest thing we got and it's good.The controls are great, yet simple, dogfighting in space is challenging and requires manouvering, knowing when to use missiles and when guns, all the best elements from games like Freespace 2, X-Wing and Starlancer are here.The story is also very  interesting. The original title was Enemy Starfighter, and that is what the game is about, you are the bad guy. Some lords assassinated the Emperor and you and the remnants of the Royal Guard are out for vengence, no matter what it takes. You start off in a fighter but will gradually upgrade and expand your fleet. The game rewards completing missions on higher difficulties with upgrade points, but make no mistake, you will not have enough ships on your side to complete the game on Harbinger level on the first attempt. Once you have some heavy iron, it's time to revisit those missions and complete those bonus objectives. And here lies the problem - there is a lot of replayability, but with 14 missions in total, that is all you will get.The game also has a tactival element to it as you are able to command your fighters and your capital ships, but the tactical view and it's controls are a bit hard to get used to, so you will be commanding from your fighter most of the time, though this is simpliefied.The game's story and lore is minimal, but very atmospheric with Battlestar Galctica style music, and some nods to Dune and Tie Fighter.The biggest problem with the game becomes obvious after completing the campaign - you want more and there is potential for more here. More missions, more story and lore, some cutscenes maybe - these are things that scream to be in the game. Unfortunatelly this a title made by one person, so hopes for more content are small.However, out of all the combat space sims out there, this one is probably the most fun and not disappointing at all.

												Man, it's good to be evil sometimes.In an era where the space-sim is coming back to life by way of gigantic open worlds, exploration, and trading, it is refreshing to see a space game that embraces small scope and emphasizes tight combat over content sprawl.House of The Dying Sun feels like a spiritual successor to Star Wars: TIE Fighter in all of the best ways. In terms of tone, it takes the idea of being the bad-guys and runs with it. You play as the royal guard of a dead emperor. Your mission is simple: hunt down the lords who betrayed the emperor, and execute them. This simple premise is backed up by killer music, sound design, and a mission structure which will at once make you feel like an unstoppable force of interstellar destruction, while also leave you biting your nails and praying for your ship's hyperdrive to warm up juuuuuust a little faster.In terms of structure, the missions all have relatively the same idea: jump into a new system, hit your target, and bug out before reinforcements arrive. But behind that simple structure, each mission is its own puzzle that forces you to consider upgrades, target priorities, and your own role in order to accomplish the mission.The gameplay is simple to understand yet provides a shocking amount of depth. For the first few missions you'll be focused soley on your own dog-fighting. As you grow your fleet you'll find yourself frequently flipping between your cockpit and your tactical overview. You might order a group of destroyers to hit a high value you target, send your wingman to distract the enemy fighter screen, then flip back to your cockpit to bomb a target, then flip back to tactical and take control of your wingman's ship, letting the AI take control of the fighter you wer using. With all of that said, HotDS may not be everyone's cup of tea. If you are going in looking for X or Elite, you may be disappointed. But if you are looking for a solid space combat game with replayability and rock-solid design look no further!			"

Early Access Review
								This game drips with style, it flows like liquid, and most of all it's incredibly fun.  The gameplay is tight and evokes your warmest memories of TIE Fighter, Wing Commander and Freelancer 2.  Plays great on a gamepad, joystick or mouse and keyboard.  In VR it is really something to behold.  It feels so natural and immersive.  The cockpit details are incredibly well done, and you will find yourself moving your head to keep an eye on enemy targets through the large canopy while your hands intuitively fly toward them.  Every friend who comes over to check out your VR headset will need to be pried out of the cockpit.  While this game is easy and intuitive to grasp, the depth of the flight mechanics and upcoming wave mode will give this game lots of longevity.  The drifting mechanic evokes the proper feeling of 0 G dogfighting and calls back to the way we all imagine Starfuries and Vipers behave.  The game's visual style is very distinct while clearly aiming for the stable and high framerate you need for VR.  It plays flawlessly on my modest i5 2500k and Radeon 290.  It features a beautifully balanced colour palette, and lots of little nuances like very bright stars and beautiful dust clouds.  The slightly muted audio and engine rumble provide an excellent base soundscape, punctuated by the chirps and alarms of your instruments.  The radio chatter sounds authentic and amps up the tension.  The music has a heart pounding Battlestar influenced drum based feel that fits every other style note just perfectly.  I highly recommend House of the Dying Sun!			"

								NOTE: I'm not one of the people who has followed this game forever - I just learned about it a week or two ago, and picked it up yesterday on a whim because it looked awesome.So I played this WITHOUT VR. I don't have a VR headset *cries*. I'm sure this would only be more amazing with one.I played with both an Xbox 360 controller and a Thrustmaster T-Flight X HOTAS. The controls are extremely remappable. I played the first few levels with the Xbox 360 controller first, since there is a built in tutorial for that, and it allowed me to understand the mechanics of the game well enough to know how to map my T-Flight X. If you have both, I highly recommend playing with the Xbox controller first for 10-15 minutes to understand the game, and then remap to your HOTAS for maximum awesomeness.This game handles beautifully with a HOTAS. Love it.Pros:+ Priced correctly + Doesn't feel like most Early Access games - this is a complete product. + Excellent controls/handling+ Gives that TIE Fighter/X-Wing/Wing Commander vibe+ Has good replayability - I've played through some of the early missions 3 or 4 times already just because they're fun+ Good customization mechanics - there are lots of mods/options you can unlock for your ships, which changes the feeling. You can swap out armor for speed, or vice versa, or lots of other things. Various weapons that can be equipped, and each feels unique+ Each difficulty feels truly unique. There's none of that ""enemies just have more health and do more damage"" garbage on the higher difficulties. Each increase in difficulty adds new enemy groups that require new strategies to beat the level.+ Dat spaceship shotgun weapon tho+ Has a drift button to incorporate Newtonian physics, so you can continue flying one direction, but turn your ship around and fire the opposite direction of the way you're moving+ Dat drift button tho+ Great control customizability+ Works with HOTAS (used Thrustmaster T-Flight X)+ The developer is great+ The graphics look great, even though they aren't Elite: Dangerous quality or anythingCons:- Short (I have a couple missions left, but I imagine you could probably play through all the missions on easy in about 2.5  to 3 hours. Probably 1.5 to 2 hours if you completely ignored all the bonus objectives and tried to speedrun it)- Lack of objective variety (most of the missions are ""kill this target"", with a few ""defend this target"" missions mixed in.- The tactical part of the game feels lacking - its mechanics were definitely secondary to getting the dogfighting right.- Once you've built up a fleet, you start to feel pretty overpowered on the earlier missions, since you have a bunch more ships than you did when you originally flew the mission. There is no way not to bring your whole fleet with you.-  The missions feel more like a collection of training scenario simulations rather than a cohesive storyRating: 8.5/10Overall, this is a great game, created by a great developer (I think it's just one guy). This is the type of guy that I wish had AAA resources and funding, because considering how stellar this game turned out with him working on it alone, I can only imagine what he could accomplish given the resources. I recommend you buy this game not only because it's great, but because the developer deserves to be supported.Also, in the extremely unlikely event that the developer actually reads this review - I would DEFINITELY buy a ""Mission Pack"" DLC with additional missions, especially if you added new types of objectives to them, or longer missions with chains of objectives.

There's enough in the way of a campaign and single player challenges to keep you occupied for a while, and when you're ready to move on, there's Challenge Mode, and that gives you a new scenario every day.Furthermore, aside from the music (which is great in its own right, and I'm totally buying the soundtrack when it comes out), all the aspects of the game have been designed, developed, and finely tuned over a long period of time by one person.House of the Dying Sun is a labor of love.

								This is a really hard review for me to write, because I have followed this game so long, and it comes so close to what I wanted. House of the Dying Sun is an incredibly atmospheric space shooter with great handling, perfect sound, and satisfying combat, but it is crippled by a stagnant campaign that is over in 3-5 hours, with limited replayability.I believe the problem is one of perfection. Everything in House of the Dying Sun is honed to razor edged perfection. Anything that wasn't perfect was left behind. And in the end, this relentless polish has left the game hollow.While a living universe may not have always been thrilling, it would have been much more engaging; sometimes you need the quiet moments to punctuate the chaos. A randomized universe requires on the fly thinking. The on rails campaign pushes one or two ""correct"" strategies.I wanted the promised campaign of marauder tactics behind enemy lines, of probing defenses and running before the enemy can retaliate. Of making horrible decisions and living with the consequences. Of lurking in the dark and determining my time to strike. Instead we got an arcade shooter.			"

												House of the Dying Sun is a space dogfighting game where you, and sometimes your AI squadmates, hunt the enemies of the dead Emperor.First thing first, the game is short. You can complete all missions in more or less 2 hrs, but the space fights are very fun and the game is meant to be played several times. The story is almost non-existant, hunt the enemies of the Empire and bring ruin to their people. That's it. Then it's just a string of missions, where you have to destroy something or protect something. Missions are short and usually last 2-3mins. Each mission has 4 difficulty levels, additionally there is a challenge mode where you take on waves of enemies.I'd say the game is short but sweet, because the flying in space shooting stuff feels very well done. The graphics are not super top notch, but the game is quite nice to look at. All in all if you like shooting in space thisHouse of the Dying Sun is definitely worth a try.I liked:* shooting in space* graphicsI disliked:* lack of full fledged campaignBuy it if:* you want to shoot things in spaceDon't buy it if:* you don't like to replay levels* you expect elite-like space gameHouse of the Dying Sun does one thing only, dogfights in space, but it does that rather well.

								A lot of games have claimed to be successors to golden age space sims, but none of them have lived up to their hype.  Strike Suit Zero wound up being an unpolished mess, Elite Dangerous is Space Trucking Sim with combat as an afterthought, and who knows what will happen with Star Citizen.  HOTDS feels like a mashup between Freespace and Colony Wars.  Gameplay is tight and simple enough to be bound to a gamepad or HOTAS, but still has depth in its physics model and tactical command.  The physics feel right and include a full Newtonian mode for breaking Luftbury Circles.  The music, voice acting, and sound effects all fit together seamlessly.  Ship classes are easy to tell apart and aesthetically pleasing.  My only real criticism is that there's not enough of it; the campaign is disappointingly short (~2-3 hours), but the challenge mode is fun and single missions should be patched in eventually.  If you liked classic space sims, HOTDS will scratch that itch better than anything else on the market, even though its scale might not warrant a $20 price tag.			"

								I waffled for quite a bit on whether to buy this or not, but I finally caved and tried it out. I have fond memories of the Wing Commander series from when I was younger, but otherwise I've never really been able to get into space sims, although I always want to like them. I recently got some decent flight joysticks from a second-hand shop, so I downloaded a few space sims to test them out, and remembered seeing early development on Enemy Starfighter (now House of the Dying Sun). I didn't really enjoy the ""big"" space sims like the X Rebirth demo, so I figured I'd splurge and try out HotDS.HotDS is the first space sim since Wing Commander that I've really enjoyed, and I found myself laughing out loud with glee as I hunted down the Traitor Lords. It is short, but for me that's actually a bonus, as it's long enough to enjoy without having to dedicate my life to it to finish the game. For a bit more than the price of a 3D movie you're going to have an unforgettable experience. I can see how people that are used to the classic space sim games where you can be a trader, play for 200 hours and not reach the end, etc. would find this disappointing, but I am a fan of short, sweet experiences that are memorable. I highly recommend it, especially if you loved the vibe of Homeworld's setting.			"

												Short version - It's like Freespace 2 and Homeworld had a cute little baby.I was very excited about this game since it was called Enemy Starfighter, and I'm just so pleased that for once this is a game I've been excited about that I haven't felt slightly let down by.It's a tight, focused, dogfighting space sim with some nice light tactical elements. There isn't a huge amount here in terms of ships, loadouts, weapons but what is here has been clearly carefully considered and honed.I completed the main ""campaign"" in a couple of hours, going back over the missions to get the achievements, but I'm hooked on the Challenge mode. The campaign is fairly light, but the story does its job and as a result the campaign doesn't outstay it's welcome.Some might not like the slightly ""chunky"" graphics, but as a massive fan of Homeworld it hits all the right notes and I think it looks amazing. I would love to try it with VR, especially in the tactical mode.I can't even remember if there was music (sorry to the composer), but the sound design is perfect. It rounds off a neat package that feels complete.Only negative comment I can think of is I didn't find the default control bindings for the gamepad intuitive, but thankfully the game let's you change that (I went for the same control scheme as Ace Combat, that worked fine)			"

												If you fondly remember games like TIE Fighter, or Wing Commander you need this game.Also just plain great in VR, whether space combat is your cup of tea or not.Appended:  I should say that I agree with some other reviews that the story content is kinda short.  It's about movie-length in terms of how long it'll take you to complete it the first time though.I disagree that once you've finished the story the game has nothing left to offer, or that it's not worth the asking price of a mere $20.  If you're a completionist there's a lot of stuff to go back in for, and the endless mode is just pure starfighter bliss.If this game had no story mode at all and was just the endless mode I would still think it was $20 well spent, but I'm also admittedly a huge space combat buff so I may be a bit biased.

												This is not a space sim. This is not a long sandbox game. This is not a wealth/fleet building simulation. This is not a complex space game.This is a fast arcade shooter with strategic elements. And it does it darn right.			"

								This is by far my favorite game for VR right now. It took me 3.5 hours to beat, but I will be going back through and replaying. It is a tight space fighting sim with the option to run everything from a ""commanders"" position and strategically watch it play out while watching from above. Or you can take action by jumping in one of your combat ships. The only downside I have on this game is I wish i could pilot the larger ships in your fleet. All in all, I recommend greatly.			"

												This game is short, but that doesn't mean it's not good.I didn't know about this game when it went under the name ""Enemy starfighter"" so I don't know how much it changed from its original design, but I still enjoy it.If I could make one complaint I wish it had a coop mode for the endurance mode, a 3 person team of fighters would be very fun and would mean the difficulty could be ramped up.

								What can I say?Single player mission-based spacesims (as opposed to the open world trade 'em ups like Elite or Privateer) are what made me a PC gamer in the first place, I think I've played every game in the genre except Starlancer and it's nice to finally see a new one released.Nostalgia aside, while I can see the inspiration from Freespace 2 and Tie Fighter this game does its own thing and does it well.You have only one fighter but there are plenty of upgrades and weapons to unlock as well as ships for your own fleet which have their own upgrades and weapons, weapons and ships are unlocked after completing certain missions while the upgrades must be purchased with favour points awarded after accomplishing bonus objectives during the missions.The missions rather than Tie Fighter or Freespace 2 reminded me a lot of the first X-wing, most of them are hit & run missions in which you come out of hyperspace, hit your target(s) and then hyper out before the incoming enemy flagship warps in and starts pelting you with torpedoes.The missions have three difficulty levels, each difficulty level has a slightly different design rather than ""changing the rules"" (like for example changing the AI or the damage rate of the weapons), either by changing the number and strength of the enemy (like having a frigate instead of a destroyer for example) or by making the objectives a bit more challenging like having two transports to kill instead of one. Also replaying each mission and completing the bonus objectives on each difficulty level is essential to obtain enough favour points to purchase the aforementioned upgrades.While there is no energy management, there are plenty of tactical options once you get other fighters and some capital ships for your fleet, both from your fighter's cockpit and by using a tactical view and your maneuverability is influenced by your speed: you will have to slow down if you want to keep that pesky enemy interceptors in your sights.There is also a glide function that allows you to rotate your ship while going on a fixed direction like in Tachyon: The Fringe and some Wing Commander games, or the reimagined Battlestar Galactica. However the flight model remains stylized like in the best games of the genre, many would say it's ""arcade"" and while it may be compared to Elite with flight assist off it's the typical way old school spacesims worked: enough complexity to be deep but not too much as to require a flying license like some fighter jet simulators.The game is made to work primarily with a gamepad or keyboard and mouse but after a bit of fiddling in the options it works very well with a HOTAS as well, though at the moment the CH Pro Throttle acts a bit weird (the throttle axis is detected as centered for some reason). The gamepad-centric nature of the controls actually works very well with a HOTAS as the orders and some targeting and weapon functions are accessed through radial menus instead of the incredibly numerous keys of older titles in the genre, though there are optional hotkeys for targeting and weapons. To cut it short: no matter if you have a gamepad or the latest super expensive Thrustmaster army-approved metal replica of a fighter jet stick and throttle, you won't have to reach for the keyboard EVER.The art style of the game is minimalistic yet striking, the music and other aspects are inspired by the Battlestar Galactica reimagining, with the sound of drums intensifying during battles and the muffled explosions, and I liked the minimalistic narrative choices as well and I won't say anything else because it's better to go in blind as I did.The campaign is short but intense, while a veteran of the genere it took me something like 7 to 8 hours to complete the game, while some people said it's possible to beat it in two hours I guess they didn't unlock all the upgrades or played only one difficulty level for each mission, if you want to unlock everything you might need a good five hours if you are very good.Now the tech-y stuff: the games runs very well on my Radeon HD 7770 1gb card on a i5-3470 with 8Gb of RAM (windows 7) with frame rate problems only in the last two missions at 1280x1024 (yes, my LCD monitor is old) with full bells and whistles as well as 4x anti aliasing but nothing gamebreaking.The game feels very polished, rather different than the sort of things you hear about early access titles, no game breaking bugs, the achievements work and the meat of the single player is all there, there will be a ""wave clearing mode"" that will be added later if you want to just scratch that space dogfighting itch.In conclusion: what are you waiting for? Buy it!			"

												This is by far the best space sim of the decade.  Lot of complaints about how little content there is - and I guess that a concern if you value quantity over quality.  If you want a game that has 200 hours of dull, grinding gameplay, go play some Elite Dangerous.  Have fun carting around cargo from star system to star system, if that's what does it for you.  Maybe after 300 hours you can even afford a decent ship.This game is not overprised.  They've focused on stellar gameplay instead of sprawling content.  It's not a game that tries to annoy you into DLC purchases, like EVERY OTHER SPACE SIM out there right now.  No, you can't pay an extra fifty dollars for the spiffy boa-constrictor ship so you can easily annihilate all your friends online.  The game is what it is, and it was made to be as fun as possible.  No fluff, no load times (seriously, none at all), no monotonous jumping from cookie cutter system to cookie cutter system.  It's 100% action.HotDS takes all the best gameplay elements of Freespace, Xwing, and Wing Commander and squeezes it into a few heart-pounding missions.  The controls are amazing - imagine drifting past a carrier as you drop a salvo of dumbfire torpedoes, then blink-driving across the battlefield just before you get slammed by a volley of missiles.  Each mission is short by design, if you haven't taken out your target in five minutes, you're in for a world of hurt as reinforcements come in.  Replaying a difficult mission 10 times doesn't feel like suffering - there's no load times, so when all your interceptors die, you go right back into the action.  If you like space sims from the golden era of space sims, this one is a must buy.  It took me 5 hours to three star all the missions, but I think it's going to take that much time again to beat all the missions on the bonus difficulty.  I'm going to enjoy every minute. If you don't like dogfighting but would rather play space trader, then go buy elite dangerous.  If you're into exploring, consider No Man's Sky.			"

								Beat it in about 7 hours on hardest difficulty and all bonus objectives pretty much 100% completion.Left me only wanting more. Unlike most early access games it felt like a polished game, it hardly feels early access until you get to the length of it. It is forgivable since it feels like more time was spent polishing than trying to stretch the game out. It's refreshing to have played an actual game for once rather than some kind of sandbox open world multiplayer resource crafting etc etc. The enjoyment lies entirely within playing the game.Theres reasons why these types are a dying breed of games but I like them.

												A very short game unfortunately (4 hours or so/maybe even less depending on how much you want to focus on challenges), but very polished. The art/graphics feels epic especially for an indie title. The gameplay is satisfying. The game allows for some replayability of different styles, and challenges. Fighting individualy is tense and exciting, but pulling out to oversee the whole battle is a fun and needed respite to organize your fleet amidst the heat of dogfighting. The aspect that pleased me the most was the sound design. It is extremely immersive in its authenticity, or what I would imagine to be authentic for space battles. From every shot and explosion, the thrusters at your tail, to the wonderful beeps and boops of your ships; it's all just fantastic.The only negative side to it is the short length and perhaps lack of variety in the missions. Though each mission has great maps/arenas for you to approach in different ways; the objectives themselves are all pretty much the same.I highly recommend this game (especially for space sim fans) even with the price tag.Final thought: I wish I had a VR headset to experience this with.

												I really enjoyed this game, it's all the good things about the dead space shooter genre, but packed into a few minutes at a time. As I have gotten older and had kids, I don't have the time to sit down for hours to play games anymore, this is the perfect game to pick up and play in a short burst. The gameplay itself is fun, you unlock a number of upgrades that I haven't had a ton of time to play around with yet, and an ever growing fleet lets you avenge the Emperor in increasingly violent ways. My only regret was that it's a pretty short game, I wish there was a bit more, but I'd rather have a short, focused game where the creator obviously put a lot of time and thought into each setpiece then a game that has hours of filler just for the sake of saying it's x number of hours.

												House of the dying sun is truly a hidden gem in PC gaming. It may very well be the most well executed and entertaining indie game that has recently released. General Analysis House of the Dying Sun (HoDS) is a space simulation game akin to some older titles like Star Wars: TIE Fighter, with a tactical aspect that reminds me of the Homeworld franchise.The game doesn´t give you a detailed explanation in terms of Storytelling, it's main focus is gameplay, where this game excels. In terms of gameplay HoDS mixes up a few different mechanics that are carried out in a perfect manner, It uses a real time strategy overview, simple yet effective fleet commands, a first person perspective of the fighters, Newtonian physics, etc. This combination of mechanics creates a relatively steep learning curve, but makes every combat intense and enjoyable.HoDS´s campaign is not that long but it has varying levels of difficulty and an  extremely high replay value . Each level has the main mission objective, a secondary objective and a time limit which ironically is not really a time limit, it´s actually an enemy reinforcement countdown which shows you how much time you have left before a hostile flagship appears in-system, and lets just say you won´t last very long without your own fleet. In terms of graphics the game doesn´t suffer from the model style the developer used, keep in mind HoDS was built for VR compatibility and yet it looks great on a normal screen.The fact that this game was made by a single developer (A studio of one (but working with many) as he says) makes the limited content understandable and yet mindblowing!Overall I give HoDS a 10/10, it truly is worth buying. For a more in-depth review I highly recommend watching ACG´s video:

TL;DR - If you are a fan of classic space fighter games, I recommend picking this up when it's on sale. Great combat fun. Solid short missions. Too few for full price.Bite-size Freespace/Wing Commander missions. With a bit of Homeworld tactics thrown in. And some Battlestar Galactica mood sprinkled on top. Yes please!The action is a lot of fun. Classic space fighter combat. On top of that, you have a tactical command map similar to space RTS games like Homeworld. Issue orders directly to friendly ships. Great feature, and necessary to succeed at higher difficulties.The missions are very short. Like somebody took a full mission and cropped it to just the best fight. No build-up fights, no filler. Some may be disappointed, but I like it. Great for nights where I don't have a lot of time to play. Or I need to kill some time waiting for something else.It is a bit sad there are so few missions, given their length. I am glad changing the difficulty changes the ships you face, thus changing the battle (for example, I went from dogfighting a corvette to bombing a missile-throwing frigate for the same mission). And there is an optional boss-like ship at the end of each. But still, there is no getting around that this title could use more missions.The story is minimalist. There's no lengthy exposition or even dialogue really. But it does what it needs to and sets the mood. The Emperor is dead. Hunt the Traitor Lords. Bring Ruin to Their People. What else do you need to know?Overall I really like this game. I got it at full price and I think I am getting my money's worth; it fits my tastes and my schedule nicely. But recommending it to friends, I have to suggest waiting for a sale. We expect more content for $20, especially when there are no plans for future stuff.			"

Early Access Review
								Aye, so it’s a bit short but it is so very, very sweet.A bell tolls. The emperor’s dead. And you’ve to avenge him.That’s the slick and stripped down premise for this space combat game, casting you in the role of the galaxy’s deadliest assassin, piloting an imposing starship seemingly made of pointed blades. There are echoes of Star Wars TIE Fighter but House of the Dying Sun really doubles down on making you feel the like the ultimate villain.You’re alone at the start of your vengeful quest but you’re armed with the most deadly vessel in existence, so naturally it’s time to put it to use, hunting down the “traitorous lords” who killed your emperor. After a brief but helpful tutorial you’re set loose on your targets, a galaxy map giving you a few missions to choose and later the option to replay those completed, perhaps on harder difficulties or to complete bonus objectives. Each mission is hand crafted but most follow the routine of giving you a target to assassinate, albeit with varying obstacles between you and your enemy. Not just a variety of enemy vessels but also asteroids and the blinding light of a nearby sun. Each one is a short but intense hit and run, as you have to try and take out your target before the imminent arrival of the massive enemy flagship, prompting the helpful message on your display “Traitor Flagship Arrived: You are Out-gunned”. If you’ve taken out your target, that message means its time to high tail it out of there and get to the extraction point before you’re turned into space dust.You will end up replaying missions. Not only are they tough and it’ll take a few attempts to tidy up those bonus objectives, to upgrade your ships you need the currency provided in greater amounts by higher difficulties. There’s also a handful of weapons and load-outs on offer, that really change your targets and can be swapped out before each mission, allowing you to tailor your tactics appropriately. Hell, you’ll replay them because they’re immensely enjoyable.As you progress, your fleet expands with different vessels, of varying sizes. First, small interceptors like yourself and soon Frigates, imposing as they warp into each mission, a dark silhouette against the fiery nebula.More than just accompanying you into each fight, they can be given orders. Simple ones are available in a radial menu whilst you fly your ship but a tactical view lets you issue movement orders. It’s not that complex but just enough to make each mission a more challenging and thoughtful affair, encouraging you to actually think about what the task will require. Initially I didn’t really touch these options but as my fleet grew and the missions grew bigger in scale, dozens of vessels clashing, co-ordinating your allies to support your attacks became vital. Certainly it adds to the Homeworld like look and feel of the game, giving you some minor RTS elements whilst fulfilling the fantasy of Battlestar Gallactica-esque dog fights.And oh boy does it deliver on this fantasy. There’s been a resurgence in space sims and such in the past few years, with a variety of approaches but in terms of sheer excitement and feel, House of the Dying Sun is the best I’ve played.It looks the business first and foremost; a sharp minimalist style, distinct, colourful ships and weaponry against a dazzling universe that’s tremendous scale lends to the stakes of the story. Homeworld has been an obvious influence here but the unique perspective of House of the Dying Sun really makes it its own. The sound is a real treat too, whether it’s the muted gunfire rattling your cockpit, the fuzzy warning transmissions from your allies or the beeps of your targeting system, it’s all extremely functional and informative whilst designed to keep you alert, invested in each twist of the fight.But it is the feel of it that keeps me wanting to play. The sheer sense of speed and momentum goes beyond anything else I’ve played in the genre. There’s no strafing, you can only move forward but are permitted to aim in a different direction from the one you’re moving by “drifting”, switching off your engines and letting your velocity carry your ship past a target whilst you twist round to land a perfect shot.And the weapons are great, all distinct and useful in different ways. My favourite ended up being the sniper-like cannon, giving you only a few rounds before requiring to reload but letting you line up targets from a considerable distance as you moved in. The surgical like precision of it really played into the sense of being the most dangerous star-fighter in the whole galaxy. Yes, it really is that nerdy a delight.You’ve only a few systems and weapons to worry about at any moment (much simpler than Elite Dangerous whose ships are endlessly configurable) but the simplicity allows it to focus on making each beat in a fight matter, making your options always clear and allowing you to just get swept up in the intensity of it all.So again, yes, the game is short but it’s so intense I’ve no idea how the game (developed by just one clearly talented fellow) could sustain itself over a longer campaign without a considerably larger budget. The way it perpetually escalates, your fleet slowly growing, your challenges becoming near suicide runs. How it teases you throughout, having you flee upon the arrival of the Flagship, building up to a fateful stand-off with the massive starship. All for one terrific final mission that plays the fantasy of being this wrathful assassin out to its most extreme and ending on a surprisingly somber note for an otherwise bombastic adventure.It lacks in content compared with some of its peers in the genre but House of the Dying Sun excels precisely because of its sharp focus on a handful of small but important things, offering an experience that’s near breathless in its pace. If you haven’t heard of it and fancy living out those Battlestar or Star Wars fantasies of the perfect space dogfight then I suggest checking it out if you can.Though it’s still only in Early Access, it’s as polished as any finished title I’ve played and it’s another perfect title in a year packed with focused, razor sharp games.

												This is a solid space fighter game. Good visuals, but not to heavy on the detail. Reminds me of Homeworld 2 before it got remastered. Pros-Good challenge, but not a choreGood length, not to short and not to longThe, instantly try again when you fail, is very nice. No menu shuffling.The challenge mode actually gets challenging.Cons-Stuck in a fighter, wish I could fight in one of the capital ships.Limited selection of weapons and upgrades. I spent the entire game using the starting gun, the starting heavy missile, and the lock on missiles for shields. I also never took shield upgrade off my ships, and once i got a flak drone it never went off the ships.Room for improvement-More variety of weapons ships and fighters would be nice.Less accurate ""big"" guns. Getting sniped at long range by destroyer's anti-capital guns is kinda lame.Traitor flagships can be completely defanged while enemy carriers and frigates can't.			"

								As of writing this review, I have fully finished every mission on every difficulty to come an accurate conclusion on this game. It's definitly a game to check out if something like Elite: Dangerous wasn't as exciting as you thought it would be. It's practically a finished game. It is wonderfully optimised, it looks gorgeous and plays about the same. Tried playing with keyboard and mouse but would recommend a pad. All in all, it is a remarkable space combat sim that I was not really expecting anything out of but it turns out that is one of the most fun games for its asking price that I've played in a long while.

								One of the best VR games I have played yet on the Rift! The VR support is done extremely well. The graphics, menu, and hud are all very well suited to VR. The game starts with a helpful tutorial and then throws you straight into the action. The game plays great with an Xbox one controller and the gameplay reminds me of an updated Tie-Fighter and Freespace game. The sound design should also get a special mention. The muted sounds of combat and ambient radio chatter really add to the atmosphere. The graphics, music, and sound overall are fantastic and give the game a very distinct and unique look and feel. The missions consist of a branching campaign which allows you some choice in which missions you play next. Each mission unlocks various new abilities and ship upgrades. You get to choose your difficulty before each mission as well. I'm playing on the hardest difficulty and it's been challenging but still a lot of fun. The missions are not super long so if you die it quickly restarts and sends you right back in. Highly recommened for any space sim fans! Also supports the Vive, regular monitors, and TrackIR!			"

												Formerly known as Enemy Starfighter I've been waiting for this game for years. It's the perfect mix of a modern take on raw TIE Fighter gameplay, Homeworld-ish art, Dune-ish story and Battlestar-ish music. The hit and run combat is engaging and super fun! The art style looks amazing and the muted soundscape is immersive. It's the space fighter game that we don't deserve but all sorely needed. I highly reccomend it. If you pick it up do yourself a favorite and play on 'Harbinger' as the difficulty will bring out the best in your skills and tatics.			"

								Played in Vive100/10 Would be Starbuck again.Wish I could use my joystick, but also understand that it would cripple the tactical gameplay.Would be fun if Vive users could do 2 player, one person on computer in tactical view, one in Vive in one fighter. Person on computer should be required to wear an eye patch, drink a bunch, and complain about gaius frakkin baltar until a vein pops out of their forehead.			"

It is obvious this game was made with love for the genre.Great little space game mixing the best parts of old school space-sim with some tactical depth. The design decision to remove strafing means the game is perfectly built to suit a gamepad without feeling gimped. The feel of the flight model is great, the action is explosive and frenetic, especially when your fleet carves its way through to a target.The game and its missions are short but sweet. At times I wish there were some longer missions so you could savour the design and atmosphere. Here is hoping the developer can use what they have learned in this game to achieve their original vision of a Mount and Blade type open world and procedural campaign.The lore is limited but good in that kind of Dark Souls way. I'm a little peeved on how short the campaign is, but it has left me wanting more--I will probably replay quite a bit.This game is great for more mature gamers with less time, you can jump in and smash a few missions out when you get the time and feel pretty satisfied.Not once did I notice that this game was Early Access, no problems, bugs or glitches.

								I'm still getting to know House of the Dying Sun but the time I've spent in the cockpit so far has been immersive, engaging, and fun. I highly recommend you remap controls and make adjustments as you go. Getting the inputs to feel just right is important to feeling like you are flying and dog-fighting fluidly.I'm four missions into the campaign and love how atmospheric the game is. The radio chatter, the muted buzz of the auto cannon, the color full gaseous star fields in the background, even the warp-in sequence at beginning of each mission just looks and feels epic.If you are a fan of space dog-fighting games you can't go wrong with this early access title.

								This game is great. Very fun and dynamic action-focused space-shooter. Beautiful and atmospheric with very responsive controls (both gamepad and mouse-keyboard).Although, this isn't first impressions review. Those ~8 hours that I got on a clock is a complete experience. Full campaign couple of times, all unlockables, all achievements and a little revisiting of some missions. There is a wave-mode planned, but I doubt it'll bring much in term of replayability.If shortness of this game doesn't scare you, than you about to receive an extremely fun space game, that doesn't broad itself to open-worlds, economics and other worldbuilding stuff any other space-sim is buried itself under.Start a mission, kill a target, kill bonus targets, warp away, unlock some upgrades, repeat. You'll unlock some new weapons, increase you fleet size, pick some upgrades for it and rush in to the fray again. Flying is awesome, controls responsive, enemies are challenging and diverse enough, missions are fun and interesting, sound design is on-point, and I wanted to play again and again.Which I did and probably will do some more.

								A space combat game in the same vein of classics like Starlancer, Tie Fighter and so on. You take on missions of increasing difficulty, unlocking new weapons and perks for your ship and fleet as the campaign goes on. Combat is fast and unrelentingly brutal.Are you a bad enough pilot to bring ruin to the traitor lords?			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this game on a whim after seeing a few minutes of gameplay footage on YouTube and haven't been disappointed so far. I've been playing on a laptop with an Xbox One controller.Pros:- Beautiful art style. Not too simplistic and not too detailed, just the right balance to make it distinctive without being too minimalist- Runs very smoothly for an early access game. I'm playing on an Aorus X7V2 and get >40fps at all times on 'high' settings- Flight controls are smooth. The ship goes exactly where you want it and the imput just feels, well, good, once you figure out the control scheme (more on that in the cons)- Audio is very satisfying. Though some of the voiceovers seem to be a bit lacking in quality the sound effects and music are wonderful and really pull you into the game.- Clean, simple UI is very easy to navigate with either controller or mouse and has very few issues that I've found.- the pseudo-RTS aspect of the game is really cool. It's easy to control but not so easy that you feel like commanding your fleet makes no difference in the battles. I've restarted encounters several times because I've botched fleet instructions. Which leads into...- Difficulty. Holy **** is this game challenging. Even on the lowest difficulty it took me several tries to finish missions. You can very easily get into situations that will end your mission nearly immediately if you don't pay attention. That said, the game rewards learning strategies and good fleet management.Cons:- Controls can feel a little awkward at first. The default gamepad controls are, by and large, not at all like a traditional 6-axis space game. I still find myself flubbing buttons because of the unorthodox layout and some things really can't be changed enough to fix this.- Minor UI issues can be frustrating. Switching between ships in the tactical view almost feels like guessing sometimes and you find yourself bouncing around different targets a bit before getting the one you want. Some menus can be unintuitive to get between. It's also very easy to accidentally send your ships to a different target in the radial menu if you aren't careful.- I find navigating can be difficult without zooming to the tactical view. The radar and HUD pips just don't seem to be where I expect them sometimes, coming from someone who's used to a system like Elite's.Overall this game was money well spent for $20. With more refinement and content added it's a no-brainer for fans of casual and hardcore space combat games.			"

Early Access Review
								I have only played this game in VR (HTC Vive) with an Xbox controller so far, so everything in this review is given from that perspective.House of the Dying Sun's combat seems to take heavy inspiration from sources like Battlestar Galactica, with the abillity to blow past an enemy fighter at high speed, and drift/rotate as you go to bring your autocannon to bear. Pretty fast paced and quite good fun. Completing missions grants you unlocks such as new weapons, or additional fighters, destroyers, and frigates for your fleet, who you are able to assign orders to during missions.The game has you flying for/commanding what is essentially a small pirate faction. This plays into mission design; where you warp in, hit the enemy hard and fast where they're most vulnerable and get the hell out of Dodge before the enemy fleet's flagship arrives and blasts you (and your little fleet) to itty bitty pieces. Ultimately this means that most missions so far have been no longer than a few hectic minutes before I've either escaped triumphant, with a field of wreckage in my wake, or I've died most ignobly on the battlefield, one last ugly footnote in the history of a ruined empire.Graphically, the game is very stylized, but pleasing overall. Ships do seem to keep to a fairly low polygon count, which allows for quite a lot of action to be on screen, even when playing in VR, without any significant performance issues (albeit on a rather beefy system). The perspective from the cockpit feels spot on, and the HUD is both fairly intuitive and unintrusive for anyone familiar with space combat sims.Sounds are somewhat muted in a way.. It's hard for me to explain. But, since you can hear what the game sounds like quite clearly in the trailer, look there to determine if the audio is pleasing for your own tastes.Overall, the game seems to run in VR with no significant bugs or performance problems, and it has a very impressive level of polish for Early Access. I might have liked if they'd done more with the story, or included some longer missions but this is mostly me nitpicking.			"

								If you like dogfighting in space and have a VR headset, this game is for you!The action is fast, it's easy to get into (comparable with the action in the old X-Wing/TIE-Fighter games) and it has a developer with dedication to his project and its community (he has some experience since he has worked for Bungie before, and it shows).The art direction is also great and reminds of Homeworld. There's even some tactical component where you can command the friendly units in a Homeworld-like view but it's not too deep.The only downside is that it has no multiplayer mode, but it is worth the money.

Stylized minimal graphics, smooth intuitive controls (using a Steam controller with default setup) and excellent immersion on the Vive. Only a limited number of missions so far, but enough to keep you busy for this price, and with the promise of further development, this game should be a frontrunner in the new media landscape of VR gaming.

BAD: The Main menu has 15 FPS while the whole Game has 72 and more (on my PC).  WTF?Sound:Awesome! no pewpewpews, only Battlestar Galactica similar sounds, i mean that silent, Bass massive Sounds. I like!Gameplay:Easy to play. You can just let the KI play but on some Points it goes faster or its better to drive by yourself. If you play without the shields you re busted, so you have this slot permanently equipped. Sometimes you really need tactics. But why do my ships suvive, when thy get destroyed? Isnt it harder to play like this? In tacticmode you can not marc more ships using the shift button, you only can mark a square with the mouse.Game:Poorly its not a really big game, so you are quickly done with it. I hope this game gets some updates with more maps, moreships, more updates for the ships. The game crashed 2 times, in 9 hours.All in all:AWESOME :)			"

								This is a great game. I love the art style, the sound effects, and the combat. My only complaint is that I played through the game in its entirety in less than 3 hours. (Including all difficulties and achievements.) I experienced 0 crashes and I didn't notice any major bugs either. That being said, if you are looking for something with a similar feel but want a longer game, Void Destroyer is fairly similar but much longer. (It doesn't have vive/rift support, which I have to commend this game for despite me not being able to take advantage of it.)All in all, don't buy this game if $20 isn't expendable enough to you for ~2 hours of gameplay. I'm a big space nerd, so this was really a no brainer, and I rather enjoyed it.Looking forward to any future updates for this game, or titles from this developer.			"

												House of the Dying Sun is surpisingly fun, but is just a tad short in length.The music with sound effects and muted gun fire combined the flight mechanics actually remind me of battlestar galatica. It doesn't have AAA graphics, but it's not necessary.It has single player campaign with 10-15 or so missions, each can be completed in 4-10 minutes each. With each completed mission you unlock customizations to your fighter configuration and your accompanying frigates/destroyers. There is also a time trial mode.You can play in cockpit view of a single fighter or control the whole battle from an eagle eye tactical view and switch between the two seemlessly. Wish there was multiplayer and more persistance.			"

												This game is very short, but it's excellent. There's maybe six hours of content before you've exhausted everything, and there aren't really any large engagements (your fleet is limited to 7 ships) but the upside is that the small fighters are never useless and you get to spend the whole game drifting around like Starbuck.If you liked the X-wing or TIE fighter games from the 90s, give this a shot.

												Playing in VR with a flight stick is pretty amazing. Love the quick missions with optional bonus objectives to test yourself. Im not a huge fan of the low poly look but it probably was neceassry for the game to run well in VR, so its a small price to pay for some otherwise pretty graphics. The music (loud tribal drum banging) adds alot of intesity and really adds to the feeling of being an uncomprimising tool for the destruction of the Empire's enemies. Definately recommend especially if you have a flight stick and a Vive.PS: at this time it says flight stick support is hit and miss. Im using a Thrustmaster T.16000M on Windows 10 and its working great!			"

								Enemy Starfighter, now named House of the Dying Sun, has finally be released on Steam Early Access!It’s a bit overwhelming at first because there’s a lot of little controls and things to keep track of, but after a few missions you start to get the hang of it.The core combat feels awesome, and the visual and sound design is very strong. Everything has a muted and bass heavy sound because that’s obviously what space really sounds like and it feels great. The combat is a lot faster than I was expecting, so you need to stay on top of it. It's a very colorful game with a colorful depiction of space.The map mode is essential as it gives you a paused overview of the map and allows you to order ships around in a simplified Homeworld-style interface. At the start of each mission the game begins paused in this mode, which allows you to plot out a simple plan of attack for your fleet. It’s really satisfying when a mission goes exactly as planned and you take minimal losses while completing both your primary and secondary objective.While the core mechanics and gameplay loop are all there and feel great, the game is very light on content. There’s only 14 missions, with each taking about 5 minutes to complete, often less if you’re quick and don’t go for the bonus objectives. The game heavily encourages replaying the missions with its multiple difficulty systems and unlock system, but it’s hard to get around the fact that there’s so few missions.Speaking of the unlocks, each class of ship (interceptor, destroyer, frigate) has its own set of unlocks and weapons. However, you can only equip 2 upgrades at a time, so you’re encouraged to swap out upgrades depending on the mission you’re playing and the play style you prefer. It’s pretty fun to try weird combinations and trying to make them work, and when you get something that works well (such as flak drones in a mission with a torpedo flinging carrier), it feels great. As the game continues through early access, there are supposed to be more weapons and upgrades added.It’s worth mentioning that before the game gets released in full, “a custom wave-clear mode” is planned to be added. Similar to how Strike Suit Infinity capitalized on Strike Suit Zero’s excellent gameplay and then made a spin-off around that, I think HODS will benefit greatly from a similar wave-attack mode.I’m hoping that more game modes get added over time, because the core gameplay and the style of the game are both fantastic. It’s an action packed space sim with a fantastic foundation and very satisfying moment to moment gameplay, but potentially lacking in content in the long run.			"

 NOTE: I am playing this in VR on the HTC Vive, which probably accounts for why I think this game is so great.  OH. MY. GOD.  Ya know what?  Ignore these negative reviews you see smearing the front of the page.  This feels like it might be one of my new favorite games.This game is the  epitome  of what I've always wanted from my sci-fi fantasy of piloting an intergalactic fighter ship.  This is hands down THE space-flight-combat game I've always wanted.  What makes it so good? Atmosphere The atmosphere and game design align with predicted realism perfectly.  What you see here looks- and FEELS- like how you would hope and expect a starship to function in real life.  There are tons of little details carefully put on your ship's dashboard.  The weapons systems are designed in a very detailed manner that look like they are physical guns protruding from your ship.  The game feels so atmospheric that going into warp drive made me lean back in my chair almost by instinct, as if I was actually being pushed back in the chair.  It's an absolutely visceral experience. The natural maps are designed in a way that almost feels like an acceptably-realistic cosmic nebula.  Contributing to the atmosphere is the AI. Many ships seem to coordinate with fleets and attack in a way that feels natural and epic. Gameplay It's actually fairly simple.  This is why I'm not sure if I'd reccommend the game if it isn't in VR, since VR enhances the experience and catalyzes the gameplay so well that it makes the game awesome.  Most of the time, you start the game by warping into a zone where it shows your fleet as if it were a real-time-strategy game.  To be honest, though, it really is not an RTS.  From that screen, you assume the perspective of a ship.  You then must follow objectives that usually follow the lines of ""blow up this, kill them, protect these guys, then escape.""  To be honest, yeah it's a bit generic.  However, I'd say that this is the standard generic formula done almost perfectly.There are a few weapons, and you can switch between three at any given moment (one standard, one short-range weapon, and one heavy).  When you're trying to escape the scene, an enemy flagship will come.  Although I don't know if you can actually kill them yet, they are boss-battle status difficult, and are meant to signal that you need to leave.  However, their approach feels intense and panic-inducing; warping out just in the nick of time leaves you panting, and having the flapship launch dozens of heat-seeking missles (only for your avoiding them to be unlikely) makes you feel like that epic martyr in any sci-fi movie that dies in this exact cliche cinematic sequence. Sound Design  Given the VR presence, this might be one of the best things about the game.  All the sounds coming from outside the ship feels realistically muted, as if you were hearing it in space or at least hearing it from within a sealed cockpit.  The sounds are all extremely bass heavy and just sound incredibly cool.  Reloading your gun makes a nice and satisfying ""whirring"" sound, switching weapons makes a loud clunk, explosions sound deep and thump-ey.  When warping out of the scene, there is a certain sense of beeping sounds that are ""just right.""  Everything about the sound is amazing.   VR Implementation This is the first VR game I've played that realistically makes you feel like you're sitting in a cockpit.  Unlike games like EVE: Valkyrie or Gunjack, you do not aim with your head.  You play with either a controller (which I actually strongly reccommend) or mouse and keyboard.  Rather, you can actually look around using your head.  Your windshield is huge, so you can effectively gander throughout a huge field of view.  As you're chasing down enemies, you can spot them out of the corner of your eye through the side window.  It's so cool!! The game also runs very, very well, especially considering my use of VR.  It takes a little while to launch, but the performance is generally pretty good.  Overall, if you're thinking about this game for VR, get it right away.  This game is THE virtual reality space dogfighting game you've always wanted.			"

Early Access Review
								""House of the Dying Sun"" is a really nice game. The space-fights feel good, and the graphic and design is very fancy. The storyline is alright, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but one should know what to expect. There is also a VR-Mode, which I didn't use, because of missing hardware. As I said before, ""House of the Dying Sun"" is a fun game to play, but is a very short game. It took me only three hours to beat the game in medium difficulty. The missions aren't really hard (there was only one mission a little harder than the others, and that wasn't even the final one..). Still, I rate this game positive, but one should be aware, that it only takes up 3-4 hours to beat the game, and if you are willing to pay 20€ for this game (especially without the VR hardware) is a decision you have to make on your own. The game is still in ""Early Access"", so it is likely that there will be more modes  or Mod-Support in the future.

								This game is really fun. It can be played as an RTS which feels similar to Homeworld, or you can take control of a single fighter in first person, which is how I preferred to play it.Flying the fighter feels great, I love how you can ""drift"", allowing your ship to turn around quickly without changing your direction of movement, allowing you to perform some cool maneuvers like in Battlestar Galactica. The campaign is pretty short, I beat it in about 4 hours and I played on the hardest difficulty. But it's still in early access so hopefully more content gets added. But even with what's in the game right now I would say it's worth the $20 if you're really into space sims.			"

												I got this game a week ago and just kinda stored it for a bit - the description of the game wasn't that great, in that it didn't really explain that you will end up controlling a fleet in strategic battles from a command overlay.  (Really, if you don't give them commands, you are going to lose - you can't just stay in your cockpit the whole time).  At the time I was simply buying up a bunch of VR games to build my library.I finally sat down and gave it a try, expecting to be ""cool."" and move on to one of my other games.  Hours later I almost forgot to pick up my kids from school...This game has it all.  Get fully into the action with cockpit view dogfighting (here's where the Vive really makes this game great), or be master of the battlefield and direct your troops to perform a variety of tasks.  Switch back and forth as much as you need.Couple minor improvements I'd like to see:The vessel selection in overview mode is a bit janky.  Would be great if there was a simple ""focus on the ship I'm looking at"" button.AI ships are pretty dumb when it comes to friendly fire - the will fire heavy weapons with a friendly in the path, or fly into a heavy weapon.  They also collide a lot....  way too much actually.  I've lost countless fighters because they simply ran into each other.			"

												I *LOVE* this game.  Love love love.  I played X-Wing vs TIE Fighter, the original Wing Commander series... lots of space sims.  Loved them, particularly XvT.  This is the first modern game I've played that brought me back to those glory days.Just like XWing, the game is built around tightly scripted and laid out battles.  Skill matters.  Tactics and priortizing targets matters hugely.  You play a battle, barely scrape a win at easy, then go back after getting a new gun or unlocking new allies, and try it again.  You learn how to assign teammates to targets, which weapons load-outs work best against which targets...  it's RICH.Love the flavor text, love the UI.  Game is gorgeous.  It's just flawless.  Don't sweat the game length, it's a perfectly formed gem of a game.  Well worth the price of a movie ticket or a pair of lattes.  I'm 3 hours in, and about half-way done with the main campaign.  I'm just starting to have the weapons, tactics and allies needed to go back and win on medium and hard difficulties.  So fun.			"

								House of the Dying Sun was a fantastic game! Its only downfall was that it was rather short. Although it has some replayability in the form of skills that you can acquire by gaining currency by playing missions on harder difficulties.The game is chalked full of style and makes you feel like you are an unstoppable force with only one goal ""Defeat the false Emperor"". It kind of reminds of Homeworld in certain ways. The theme and style of the game as well as the soundtrack, which is absolutely fabulous by the way, give off a very ""Homeworldy"" feel. I would really like to see more from this developer/universe.			"

												House of the Dying Sun is a rhytmn dancing game: You dance your fighter through enemy flak screens, through enemy fighters, and through the shields of enemy capships. You rock on, dancing to the explosions of enemy craft, pausing only to reload your weapons. It is beautifull.The game itself is light on narrative: The emperor is dead, and your goal is to take down all who usurped him. There are no motivations, there is only murder, slaughter, and inferno. For me, that works: This game is not to be played for the story, but to beat the challenges as offered to you by the missions. You do this by exploiting your various tools, you do this by exploiting the lives of your wingmen, you do this by exploiting the BSG-style physics your craft operates in. I can't recommend it enough.			"

								Dying Sun is a really polished and fun game. Considering that it is still in Early Access, I was impressed. It's like the space combat child of Elite:Dangerous and Project StarBlade from my arcade days. Just perfect for a quick fix of space combat when I am not in the mood for the long haul and complexity of Elite or hardcore sims. And it looks absolutely gorgeous in VR!			"

								If you're a fan of space dogfighting games or any of the homeworld games.  This is for you.Great musicGreat atmosphereGreat sound designI love how everything is just muffled and the only voice you hear are the radio chatter that occurs in the background.  Graphics are pretty.  Love the art style, it will definitely remind you of Homeworld (if you've played it).Biggest downside.  Not a whole lot of content, just finished the game in 2 hours.  Each missions are too short.  Fleet build up is small (three destroyers, three fighters, and one frigate).  There's no sense of ""loss"" when you lose a ship, because it just refills in the next mission.  I was hoping for something like xcom or battlefleet gothic armada where between missions you can build ships, upgrade, or recruit.  The flying in this game is done very well.   Love the drift feature.  The cockpit design looks great too.  However, with very little content it has right now.  I do not recommend it.  I was planning on refunding this game actually, but decided to keep it since I might be surprised in the future with some new mode, I was also following development of this when it was still called, Enemy Starfighter.  Remember its in early access.  But even then other Early Access games had more features when you play them. for now.  I do not recommend it.  In the future I might change this review and see what happens.			"

								All right...I've been watching this game in developement since 2012. It's been hyped to hell for me, but despite that, the game meets even my highest expectations.  Alot of the developer's original ideas for the main campain were scrapped in favor of a much more straight-forward, stream-lined experience.  Despite not getting the exact same game I had hoped for such a long time ago, I got something equally as spectacular.  The missions are quite short, but that doesn't take away from how much fun the space combat is.  You pilot a quick-striking TIE intercepter-like space fighter.  You don't have a lot of armor or any doomsday devices on your craft, so a lot of the engagements you get into wind up being short, albeit thrilling. You have to get in, strike hard, and jump back out before the enemy calls for reinforcements.  As you play through the campain, you start unlocking weapons and ship mods while also building up a small fleet, providing you with more firepower that you can take back to previous missions, allowing you to unlock more rewards on higher difficulties.  The ship mods actually give the game a lot of depth while the fleet-building mechanics give the game a suprising amount of replay value.  On top of solid gameplay, the visuals are simple but delightful while the audio is completely sublime.  Friendly units chatter over the coms, giving them a suprising amount of life. Weapon sounds are muted and muffled by the vacuum of space, similar to what you might hear in the new Battlestar Galactica TV series.  Speaking of Battlestar Galactica, the TV show's music composer Bear Mccreary even lends a hand to the music production, offering his trademark heavy percussion tunes which triumphantly punctuate each space battle.It's a good game.  If you want to play some super intense, fast-paced space battles, look no further and give it a go.Also, since this game is in early access, expect to encounter a bug or two. If you notice one, take the opening screen's advice and report them to the email displayed on screen.  Mike Tipul is really good at responding to those.  I found a problem with remapping controller inputs, reported it to the email, and got an email response within the day saying to download the update, he just fixed it.  He's a dediacted developer, and I'm glad for that.  I hope to see more games from him sometime in the near future.			"

								I've only played the first mission and I've already decided this is the best VR game I've ever played.  The immersion is there.  The difficulty levels were really helpful to figure out what I was doing.  I just kept tackling the first one over and over until I cleared it on hard with the default loadout.  That's what desperation feels like -- cap ship coming in 8 seconds to nuke your sorry butt and your windshield is cracked from enemy fire.  You're desperately trying to find that escape pod before that happens.  10/10, would buy again.			"

								Beat in a few hours, started going back over at the higher difficulties to unlock different loadouts. Gameplay is solid for combat, and the tactical view has great potential. Interesting story if you're willing to do some reading as well, read through the CODEX after beating the campain. It also runs well when in combat, save for a moment I won't spoil, and that is amazing for my POS computer to do. But the menus lag considerably for my part. No idea why, YMMV. In short: get it if you want something to keep you busy awhile, it just needs MORE. Replayability is limited to your willingness to try missions with different playstyles.			"

												Playing this game in my Vive using a Steam controller and loving it.I'm not too familiar with space sims or shooters, so was recommended this as something more on the action side of things, rather than the sim side.Super fun being the bad guy: jumping in and out of systems for targeted assassinations. The graphics are gorgeous: the ships look real and solid without getting into too much detail or overdoiing the poly count. The blooming and particle effects adding enough eye candy to keep things looking good and make the combat satisfying.I think I'm about 1/2 way through the missions (having done only a few bonus challanges) and the game is getting difficult, I'm having to think and plan my attacks now, as well as kit out my small force properly for the mission. The learning curve has been working well and it all feels right.			"

								House of The Dying Sun is a short, sweet space sim in the style of a quicker, simpler Tie Fighter. There's little downtime, missions can be restarted quickly, controls are very simple and have no special keys involved, and you never get bogged down in any complicaitons.The controls are very simple, and don't require any special commands or fiddling with the function keys. Keyboard hand is throttle, orders, and switching weapons, mouse hand is firing, flying and targeting. You eventually unlock other fighters and capships, but you never leave your interceptor.  You can edit the loadouts of all of your ships, including the capitals, which usually makes or breaks your attempts to succeed.The weapons selection is rather sparse. 2 main weapons, 3 secondaries, 1 special for fighters, just the mains and secondaries for cap ships. That said, changing weapons makes a huge difference in your effectiveness and needs to be considered based on the mission. Some weapons are hopeless against shields, others don't penetrate hull or capship armor well. You can also select 2 perks for each class, from simple armor and shield upgrades to sentry robot hacking and mini-warp jumps. These have to be unlocked, though, and aren't immediately available.The missions are short, sweet, and replayable at several difficulty levels. They don't have the downtime of older games where you had to accelerate time for long stretches at a time- missions rarely last more than 5-10 minutes win or lose, and can be quickly restarted if you're unhappy with something. I know we all hate comparisons, but think more Hotline Miami rather than IL-2. Short, quick, easily replayable and easy to change your loadout and strategy if you're struggling. You can choose to replay any mission at any time, and you usually have a choice of missions you can pick. The briefings are short text explaining your main and bonus objectives. The main objective is the bare minimum you need to unlock more missions. The Bonus objective unlocks Favor, the game's currency, which unlocks more perks for your ship. Currently I would say the game is a bit too easy, especially once you unlock all your escorts and weapons. That said, Hard  mode with no shields is quite a rush.Overall, a simple, but excellently crafted game that doesn't get bogged down with unnecessary complications. No downtime, just action.			"

								An absolutely wonderful little game with its flaws.Some of the most satisfying space dog fighting action and the tactical overview adds just enough to mix things up.I had no problem setting up my HOTAS (thrustmaster t.flight x). Controlling fighter feels fantastic and the upgrades you can get to mix up the outfitting of your fleet are a really neat thing to play with and you can find some hilarious combinations (like suicide bomber ships).The big downside is that the game is short, like super short. If you just want to play through the missions once you'll probably finish in under 3 hours. However if you really wanna milk it and 100% the game you can probalby spend closer to 10 hours, the daily challenge mode is always there and each day it generates a slightly different surivial mode (really the only difference i noticed was that one day the second wave was horrifying and felt impossible and the next day i was able to clear through wave 9 no problem).Difficulty is a little bit weird, it either feels like you're either breezing through things or getting plucked out of the sky in an instant. Only one mission outside of the challenge mode really gave me trouble and that was only when I was trying to do the bonus objective on harbinger.The other flaw is that despite having all these unique load out options you're not really able to find much in the way combos that feel useful without feeling gimmicky, since you can't mix and match primary and secondary weapons.All things considered though the visuals, gameplay and the sound design are some of the best i've encountered and it made for an absolutely wonderful gameplay experience.Highly recommendable to anyone who is interested in the genre.

It controls very well and is probably my favorite space sim game in VR. My only complaint is the length. The ""campaign"" is very short and lacks a meaningful story. There is some replayability with misson difficulties and the endless mode. In the end, I believe it's a must have if you are interested in space sims. On the other hand, if you are looking for a long story-driven campaign look elsewhere.			"

								Wow. I could not be happier with this product. Not only does it have space combat nailed down pretty darn tight, it is an absolute blast with the HTC VIVE. The missions and the game itself aren't overly long, most of the missions simulate guerilla tactics of moving in, taking out a target, and warping out before reinforcements arrive. It does lend itself very well to replayability since you can repeat each mission on three difficulty levels, and it changes enough about the mission to make it fun to play again. This game is a total bargain and I sincerely hope that the developer(s) make a sequel that elaborates on the lore and deepens the gameplay.			"

												Short but sweet, a great deal of replay value if you fancy trying the higher difficulties of missions.The setting and atmosphere of the game easily stands out as the foremost aspect. From the simplistic but vivid color schemes, rudimentary but striking ship models, and jarringly good sound design, it hits just about every single note that a proper space combat game should. The mix of pseudo-RTS elements atop the base flight model offers a great deal of minutiae in how one carries out the missions, and certain side-objectives will only be made possible by utilizing the correct equipment set on top of flying almost perfectly to accomplish it. This said, the Executor Interceptors that the player pilots are exceedingly capable of handling themselves and accompanying capital ships eventually obtained serve only to augment the primary fighter wing under the player's governance. This title handles exceedingly well on a mouse and keyboard arrangement, and at no point was I left wanting for better or more accessible controls.10/10			"

												For the price, a good bargain.  It is straight to the action, no grinding, intuitive controls, graphics that work beautifully even on my almost decade-old machine (with a 4 year old card) at 1920x1200, allows you to progress and increase your forces, and has high replayability.  I think a lot of the criticism comes from folks that wanted more out of this, like maybe an Elite competitor.  It's not as deep as Elite, but also isn't nearly as long-winded, complicated, or grind-ey as elite is.  It doesn't take hours to get to combat, the combat is deep enough to be satisfying, and the weapons are easily used but still fun to master.  This should be viewed essentially as a puzzle game with first person space sim combat being the way you solve the puzzle.  It has all of the fun action of a game like X-Wing (if you are old enough to remember that), but the missions are really not that deep and admittedly pretty cookie-cutter, and I would say not as frustrating either.   Be prepared to die often in the beginning, and embrace it, because the wins will come fast.  It works with Track IR, which is a great bonus and a good reason to buy if you already made that investment.  This is one of the few games I found myself going back to old missions to see if I could do better vs. chasing newer missions to level up.I would ding it on not having a map editor or Steam Workshop access, but my guess is that games like Elite sap a lot of the audience and the developer just wanted to deliver on the dream he promised, and he did.  If someday this engine/concept does make it to a more complex game, it would be welcomed, but for now, it's about the level of content you would expect for under $20.			"

Hopefully this is expanded more moving forward.Last but not least, 21:9 support!!!  **thank you**The Bad:No real Joystick / HOTAS support - designed for kb/m or game pad.  In this day/age of space sims coming out, you've got a LOT of players with Joysticks and full HOTAS who are taking a look at this game.  Lack of proper support here is a BIG no no in my book.Missions are SHORT - Like, 2-4 minutes short.  Some of these missions are awesome.  They'd have a lot more potential if they were longer and involved more units.  Think of TIE Fighter missions.  Give me something that's 15+ minutes!Title change - ""Enemy Starfighter"" was SUCH a cool name for this title.I've been following this game since I stumbled into his YouTube trailer back in late 2012.  Agonizing at times as to when I'd finally get my hands on it.  Well it's here, I like it - I even recommend it.  I just hope he polishes this up while it's in EA and gets that proper Joystick support in, adds more missions or even provides us with a mission editor.  I would love to be able to play someone's campaign in the future :)			"

												Dunno why all these people are claiming the game is short.If you play on anything but the hardest the game is pretty much a cakewalk, but if you play on the hardest you will get more than your moneys worth.Shying away from simulating every rock in an asteroid belt, trying to entice me into space stock exchanges, forcing me on long tedious journies to make tedious cash, the game throws you right into the wetwork of an galactic uprising. Combat feels fantastic and the little details truly make it wonderful. From the tiny plinks of your machine guns shells tapping your glass, to the dull thud of a torpedo hitting a critical component on the enemy frigate you will immersed full well into your tiny fighter. Did I mention the atmosphere? Its absolutely fantastic. From the tone of the mission briefings to the introductions before the fight begins and the war drums blasting as the enemy flagship warps in everything meshes beautifully to really make the world come alive. Gameplay is fun as well and avoided frustrating me on most of the missions. If you want a real space shooter, not a space-truck sim, then this is the game for you.			"

								Firstly, I must say it broke my heart to give it a negative review.I followed this game for more than a year, but mostly on the premise of open-ended randomly generated space skirmish.Lately the developer decided to change that into 14 hand crafted mission. And I fully respect this decision, especially after playing all of them in the 3 difficulty settings.It took me 5 hours to complete the game, do mind that I spend the last 3 months playing the hell out of Freespace 2 mods on hard difficulty wich mean that I was more than ready to handle the challenge.5 hours of a very good experience, with fast pacing combat, subsystem destruction and multiple configuration option.But knowing that there will almost nothing else added upon release, I feel empty and disapointed. HOTDS Is a excellent, well polished and precisely designed 20€ demo. Done by one man alone.Would mods and user made campaign be in the pipeline, it would have been a positive review.TL;DR : Awesome game, awfully short.			"

Some fairly poor balancing with the upgrades, a cumbersome RTS(lite) UI, a less-than intuitive default control scheme (PS4 Dual Shock being used)But at the end of the day, it never gets old drift-strafing enemy carriers using your Purifier Bombs or diving into a furball of enemy fighters holding that trigger until all that's left is shards of metal and broken families.Is around eight hours of gameplay, and a daily ""endless"" challenge map worth the $20 asking price?

								I've only been playing this game in VR, even though it isn't specifically a VR game.The experience has been fantastic. Inventive use of the Xbox controller and tight physics make dogfighting feel extremely visceral. The premise is great and the game is structured interestingly around it. The soundtrack perfectly suits the action and has me tapping taiko drum beats at my desk during the day. Every decision in this game feels inspired and focused. If I sound like I'm gushing it's because I am. I love this game.The only thing I would like to change is to have the ability to turn down the space flight sound a bit.			"

								A short, compact, efficient, fantastically gorgeous and beautifully playing space shooter. Missions are short, quick, and throw you right into the action--great for folks who only have a few minutes to exterminate the Emperor's enemies. The worldbuilding is top notch and pitch-perfect in tone. It's only a few hours long, but that it leaves you desperately wanting more is a compliment of the highest order.I am very impressed and extremely interested in what the developer does next. Whether it's DLC, an expansion, a sequel, or something entirely new, I'll be buying it day one.			"

								Bottom Line Up Front: Reminiscent of TIE Fighter and Homeworld, this is a great game. The missions are really short, but the atmosphere is great and really makes you feel like you're fighting a guerilla war of revenge against remnants of a successful (?) coup d'etat. I have about 3 hours into the game now and am halfway through on easy, but I fully plan on playing through again on the more difficult settings. It feels a bit light on content for $20, so I hope more is added later. Overall, it scratches the space combat itch I had after being severely disappointed by No Man's Sky. Pros:- Great artstyle, beautiful graphics- Extremely smooth performance and seamless video settings changes- Steam Link friendly- Drift mode is fun and useful (hard to master though)- Sound design is greatCons:- Missions are very short and somewhat repetitive- Giving orders to your fleet should include more options and isn't consitent between the D-Pad options and the tactical viewNeutral:- No fine tuning for speed controls (with a controller at least) by default (would be nice to have a match-speed option)- Would be nice to have power allocation controls to increase shield recharge, engine speed, or weapon damage and balance between them			"

								This game might be short (if you blast through the quick, intense missions just to complete) but it's utterly engrossing, and leaves you wanting more. From the visuals to the sound design, the game cleverly wraps you up in a zealot starfighter working for the bad guys and launches you into the fray. My only criticism (if you call it that) is that I can see so much potential in expanding the game, from small 1v1 or 2v2 multiplayer modes to co-op, more ships and unlocks, and plenty more missions. I want more of this game, or at least the promise of more down the line.			"

I own Elite Dangerous with X52, but this game is soo much fun with a 360 controller that I keep coming back to this one, because it is so easy just to pick up and play.

												If you want ""Top Gun"" in space then this is your game. It's a straight forward space combat sim. Growing up with games like Starlancer, Wing Commander, Freespace and Descent this game definitely scratches that itch. It does one thing incredibly well. Battles can get really intense but it's super fun. If you have a flight stick the game is even better. Super fun, super fast and super worth your time. It's been awhile since I played a game in this genre with such a great pick-up-and-play aspect and it's lovely to see. If you grew up with combat sims this one is definitely one to check out.			"

												So im going to start by stating i am probably going to counter several other reviews,  Do i care?  not really,  and yes i did read several before getting the game.This game is a game thats ment to be completed 100% There is alot there as the game is ment to be replayed atleast 6 times,  (thats right multiple endings) I personally found plenty of story their for this short game that explained several mechanics that out right confused me as to why they existed i would love to spell it out for every one but to do that would spoil the very last ending which is well worth getting your self.The game is very FreeSpace like but instead of managing every ship that you will fly with you give them an overall lay out,  this allows you to jump from one ship to another with out having to stop and check your weapons to see which style you will be playing.EVERY THING CAN DIE! Thats right,  if you are good enough at the game you can kill literally every thing,  including your own ships or that big bad boss that shows up at the end of every level.  It honistly shocked me to look at the global stats of the game to see that very few people managed to do such a thing when its so easy once you have the right formula.Pilot or tactical view?  I played both,  there are some instances like a bombing run that its better for the player to do it instead of the AI as unguided bombs are certaintly not a robots strength.  There are also time were keeping your eyes on every thing will help you catch those kamakazi fighters that are about to slam into your capital class ships.  Sure there are perks to doing it one way or the other and i certaintly did not use the tatical as much as i could.  But based off of others i have seen play this game,  i used it more to keep a check on my surroundings so i knew what was happening.  Fighters only?  Yes!  Why?  its explained in the story,  for me to tell you would simply ruin it.  I personally believe the game would of been ruined had they permitted you to fly the capitals.  The AI is not overly dumb,  some time it screws up but look at it this way your human.  you screw up just as bad or worse some times.You can be a kamakazi fighter.  3 words.  THIS IS GLORIOUS!  I have not had alot of fun with deaths,  even in games where death will push you on,  i hate it.   But i have never felt so satisfied when i died,   simply removing a road block with that one options makes it great,  i dont need to live to win the game.  Oh,  and escape pods wont kill you if you decide to cleave through them in your ship,  it was pretty funny.All in all this is a great game to me;Would i recomend it for the impatient?  No.Would i recomend it for the easily angered?  No.Would i recomend it for those who do not posses higher thought?  No.How ever if you dont meet those three no's then by all means get it!  (when its on sale or something :P)I personally got it on sale for 12 USD  My rule of thumb is if i spend an hour per a USD and meet or exceed that the game is potentially good and considering i have almost exceeded that end completed every achivement i find it well worth the buy.Now for some of the negitives comments/tips to be aware of that i have read,  This game is unbeatable - This game is a bit of a puzzle game.  The wrong upgrades WILL GET YOU KILLED.  There is no way around it,  you have to be flexible to play the game correctly.Some weapons will one - two shot kill you -  Learn to dodge.  there is nothing more to it.You can not be every where at once - This is a lie,  use tatical.  every fighter is you,  you can be in all of them at any point in time.There is nothing more then three difficulty levels - actually there are four.  and each one changes how the game plays almost entirely.  cant go guns blazing when every thing is designed to kill you at certaint ranges.Last note from me, 10/10 would complete again.Thanks!

								WOW!! I loved this!!! Absolutely loved this!!! I have played a great many space combat sims! And this one will definitely be one of my favorites!! I have been following this game when it was still known as Enemy Starfighter, and to be honest when the dev decided to shift gears to a more linear game with short intense fights, I have to say I was skeptical and I felt slightly disappointed, well I was wrong to think that!  The ability to seamlessly jump between an RTS and Space sim is absolutely refreshing, the missions were amazingly crafted, and the art style used to capture the environs of space perfect!! This definitely evoked memories of Freespace, yet felt evolved at the same time and it is a feeling I haven't felt in a long time! I must also note that I also appreciate HOTAS support is well done, I had no issues whatsoever despite the fact that the game was designed with the intention of a Dual Analog gamepad as the lead input device. And above all else this game imho is very fairly priced! Now, I will also note that the campaign/story mode is WAY too short, this game imho needs a co-op mode AND a mission editor at the bare minimum, there are those I have encountered in forums that would also want a VS mode, and while I wouldn't mind that as well, I wouldn't freak out if one never materialised, I am ok with well crafted linear missions. Besides I have the Challenges to tide me over!All in All to Marauder Interactive: Thank YOU!!!			"

The gameplay is indeed short and I finished the story in 2.5 hours. I wish there were more levels and upgrades becuase it definately seems very easy to ""game"" the upgrades and never need to change your loadout after a certain point.That being said, it's still gorgeous and I play it over and over becuase it simply is fantastic!!!

												Most of the space game revival has been sprawling everything-boxes like the X-series, E:D, and Star Citizen. This game carves out its niche with pure dogfighting action -- emphasis on the pure. There's a very light tactical aspect where you can order capital ships around (which is helpful on certain missions, since your capships can mount flak weapons to shoot down enemy missiles), but most of the time you'll be flying your own Interceptor blasting enemies to bits. And it's fun! Everything just feels, looks, and sounds right. Highly recommended.			"

The fact that I can gain credits for upgrades and work to unlock extremely difficult gameplay experiences is why this game gets 2 thumbs up. Also, don't expect the most realistic space enviroment but be prepared to not care and be sucked into the epic dogfights while protecting and strategically directing a fleet of ships.			"

								THE GAME IS VERY BUGGY WITH LOTS OF CLEAR ISSUES, AS IS EXPECTED WITH EARLY ACCESS TITLESBlurry UI elements, low quality sounds, unusable M+KB controls, buggy menu controls, and some much needed balancing here and there.I played with an x52 and enjoy the few minutes I played, though I intend on not playing that much and focusing on providing feedback (saving the game for when it's more complete), I can easily say that it's a very promising title that I'm enjoying as of now and that's why I'm giving it a recommended title. Fantastic art design, fantastic ship design, fantastic sounds, fantastic gameplay element design, and best of all: A lot of potential and room for improvement on what's already pretty decent.If you're expecting a full on, complete and polished experience: I advise you to stay away and you should know better than to expect full experiences from an early access game. If you've enjoy dogfighting in Elite, Star Citizen, or other titles and just want an emphasis on that **BUT** very clearly understand that the title is not polished at all as of now and know what you could be getting into, this game shows that it excecutes a lot of things well with a clearly passionate and clever studio behind the wheel, if you want to buy the game just to support the devs, idea, and the space sim genre as a whole, then this title is definitely one that warrants your money, just remind yourself that you're OBJECTIVELY better off waiting and there's still some much needed polish.

												This was the first game I played on the Rift and let me tell you, I've had no gaming experience in general quite like it. I was totally blown away.  As a young kid, I would always daydream about piloting a starfighter like Ender or Luke. Every day my imagination would expand on that crazy dream of flying a nimble little ship all around my enemies, blasting away, calling out shots to my wingmen, you know the drill. Well, I'm a little older now and my imagination isn't quite as active as it used to be, but piloting a beefed up Executor and gapping in close for the kill brought back all those happy memories. I've now played quite a few other VR titles and I just wanted to lend my two cents regarding House of the Dying Sun. Buy this game. I don't care how short it is, for $20 you can't get a better VR experience IMO.			"

								I'm certainly on a fence in space here.It does look like a nicely crafted space sim with basic arcade controls but also a tacical view much like you would see in the homeworld games. But after a short play you will note it is rather shallow from a gameplay perspective currently. I hope this is just a taste of things to come and more gets added to this as I like the style of it.My video below is a light hearted look at the first few levels to give you an idea before you spend your cash

Early Access Review
								Ever since I first heard about this game under its old name Enemy Starfighter, I have been eagerly anticipating its release. After years of waiting, it's finally out under the name House of the Dying Sun, and I can say with full confidence that it's just about as good as I thought it'd be. House of the Dying Sun is an *exceptionally* polished space fighter sim. The art style, simplistic as it is, is absolutely gorgeous when combined with the phenomenal lighting and post-processing effects, and it allows the game to run smoothly on lower-end systems. Don't worry about wrestling with the controls; they're easy to follow and very tight. I've never been a big fan of complicated control schemes that span a large portion of the keyboard in space sims, unless they're meant to be hardcore. It just ends up disrupting the gameplay and causes frustration for the player, a fact that Dying Sun understands implicitly. The tactical layer is also well-designed, allowing you to easily distribute orders to your allied ships as you progress through the mission.The gameplay is thrilling. Missions rarely last more than a few minutes, but there is absolutely no filler to push through as they progress. As soon as you leave hyperspace and enter the mission area, you are beset by hostile forces and you'll have to adapt to the situation. Combat is very fast and lethal, and the presence of actual terrain in the form of astroids, stations and what not, along with the ability to cut your engines and drift in accordance to Newtonian physics ensures that dogfights don't devolve into boring circle-chases.However, if I had to make a complaint about the gameplay, it's that it feels a little easy, even on the higher difficulties. Enemies seem a bit too squishy to me. That being said, I think I'm only a quarter of the way through the game and I haven't played all of my completed missions on Harbinger difficulty yet, so that could change. Also, the developer has stated that he plans on boosting the difficulty in a future update. The game also seems a bit short, with fourteen missions available for you to undertake. However, each of the three difficulty levels change the missions significantly, adding new and tougher enemies to fight and modifying the objectives, so there's a good amount of variety here. The ship upgrades (of which there are many) allow you to use a wide variety of playstyles depending on the ones you use, and the developer intends to add a wave clear mode at the end of the early access period a few months from now. With the combat being as tight as it is, I look forward to challenging myself through the wave clear mode.Next up is sound design, and this is probably my favorite aspect of the game. The sound design is *masterfully* done. There are no artificially clear sound effects from outside your ship like in most other space sims. Instead, most of the sound you hear comes from within your fighter's cockpit itself; the rumbling and the roaring of the engine reverberating through the cockpit, the muffled mechanical whining of the weapons as they reload, the deep breathing of the pilot through his respirator as you pull tight turns that would undoubtedly flatten a pilot were they in atmosphere, and the laconic reports from your allied vessels as the combat situation evolves... it all sounds phenomenal and makes for an incredibly immersive experience. The game also has a killer soundtrack that seamlessly augments the intensity of the combat. The pounding, tribal-esque percussion reminds me very much of Battlestar Galactica, and it fits perfectly.The lore is minimal and unobtrusive, but what's there is quite interesting. You can view information snippets and quotes from prominent individuals in the codex, and they give you a good idea of what life was like in the empire. It all has a very mythical tone to it, and it feels very reminiscent of series like Homeworld and Dune. If there ever is a Dying Sun 2, I'd love to explore the setting further.Overall, House of the Dying Sun is a real diamond in the rough. Most of the space sims that have been recently released or are in development are open-world experiences, and we've seen very few that hearken back to the older, more linear experiences like Freespace 2 or X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter. Sure, they may not allow you to experience the thrill of discovery, but the polish in the core dogfighting gameplay is undeniable, and I think that's enough. I am glad to say that House of the Dying Sun stands proudly among the classics for me, and I'm definitely looking forward to seeing more from Marauder Interactive.			"

												I don't really know what to say about this game, it almost feels like something good. I never understood what was going on; and everything always felt so rushed. Similar to XCOM2, the player always seems to show up at the last possible minute and has to rush to finish everything, except here its always the same scenario: kill some dudes before a capital ship blows up your dudes.None of the weapons felt like they carried any power to them and the controls for switching between them feel a bit awkward. There also doesn't seem to be much of a choice on how to outfit your ships, and you only ever get to fly the figher class of ship, there are others that join your fleet that you cannot control directly.It feels like it tried to borrow some theme from Battlestar Galatica with the focus on fighters and the muted sound effects, I think I'm willing to game in a pretend universe where space carries sound though, it makes everything feel that much stronger when it connects.I find the 3d minimap very confusing; near the end of every mission I always had a hard time figuring out where to point myself to activate the warp.At first I thought losing my ships would have a large penalty, especially with how they slowly get added to your fleet over time. There does not seem to be any penalty to losing a ship, they even seem to be able to come back in the middle of the battles. Turning feels really strange, if you brake and turn you can get a sharper turn, which seems a bit odd when you a spaceship in a fictionless environment. Some of the sound effects, mainly the one it makes when you are in range and aiming at an enemy can get very obnoxious very quickly.Don't expect anything deep from this game. The mechanics are shallow. The story is non-existent. Other than some shield bubbles showing up partway through the mission tree nothign seems to change.There is a challenge mode as well, but it seems to just be some randomly generated mission that felt no different from the standard missions.I wanted to like this game, I've been craving some nice space sims, but after only playing for about an hour I think I'm pretty much near the end. I'll probably finish it up but won't bother going for any completion.			"

Early Access Review
								I got to see an early version of the game in development and was impressed, and all the more so for the size of the team behind it. It's everything I liked about the X-Wing/TIE Fighter games, done modern and done well - the combat, the mood/atmosphere, the sound, the UI. I don't have VR hardware and while that definitely amplifies the experience, it is plenty fun with just a monitor and gamepad.I've only played part way through what's live now and I know it won't (yet) be an epic, sprawling experience, but that's OK. What's there is worth the price of admission.			"

												The execution on this was done really well!  A bit of motion sickness is gotten when going through the complex manouvers but other than that it's really well made for VR. The menus are just the right size that its not oversized and taking up the entire hud and not so small that you cant read it.  The depth perception in this game is probably one of the less invasive implementations I've seen in a while too.When you are with another fighter or fleet-mate, the radio chatter really helps you personalize with your wingmen and you just cant match the feeling of looking through the abyss to see a buddy helping you out.The strategy that is involved is more in-depth than I initally thought and it isnt as clunky as you would expect for VR.Really well done.  Good game. 10/10  Would kamakazi an asteroid again.			"

												Excellent action, good emersion, grand old time for anyone missing the halcyon days of Freespace. Pros:*Great core mechanics - simple to learn, difficult to master. Flight stick highly recommended!*Intriguing story - short and to the point, yet somehow powerful regardless. *Good price - the amount of content is not consistent with AAA games, but neither is the pricetag. *Great VR experience - I cannot stress enough how much this filled an aching void within me. If you are searching for a good non-gallery shooting experience, this may be it.*Note - VR mode does not seem to require a gamepad, I played through and beat the game with a joystick, mouse, and keyboard.Cons:*Lack of storytelling - there are no voice-acted cutscenes and very little in the way of a developing story.*So-so customization - as far as I've seen, there is only one type of fighter / freighter / destroyer you can have, and you can only pilot a fighter. Equipping a choice of a few different weapons (7) on your fighters, and two of (18?) upgrades is a decent compensation though.*Short campaign - Its a small price tag, and you unfortunately feel it. I wanted there to be so much more to this game, but there are only 14 missions and they are all very quick (timed, in fact). I beat the game in 4.5 hours.Bottom Line:Do I recommend this game?Absolutely. Buy it. Love it. Pray that more like it gets made.			"

												This game is fun and is very easy to learn. Although the story is short, you can do the bonus challenges which increase the difficulty. There isn't very much flexibility in its fleet building and contains very few ship types for you to use, And if you unlock a ship, it stays with you forever (unless you restart the game i assume). This game is very fun to play but it would be great if the developers could make you be able to make your own fleet, because it would be really cool if i could exchange the capital ships into multiple interceptors so i could have some cool dogfighting gameplay. This game has very few bugs but hopefully in the future they could add more weapon and ship types. If you are interested in piloting one of the fighter ships in a space battle, and want a (very) simplified Homeworld style rts game then this may be the game for you.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a gorgeous flight-sim that serves bite-sized tactical engagements. Go in, assassinate the lords, leave before reinforcements arrive. You have just your fighter with you, but as you complete more operations, more equipment and ships are granted to even the odds for the time the traitors' capital ships are not on the field of battle ruining your day. Favours unlock more customization and replayability, as they are behind more and more challenging opponents.This is a flight sim that wouldn't have needed a plot, the game mechanics are solid, but it gave us a plot nevertheless that crept slowly until it slaps you in the face with the script.This is one of the better flight sims of 2016 even in its Early Access state, which is frankly a polished one.Only minus, and considerable minus is that it is very short. I took four hours to get to beginning from end, without grabbing all the harder missions.			"

								Seriously in love with this game.  It really scratches that old Space Sim itch, with a little bit of fleet management added in.  Almost feels like Homeworld in a sense.What I really hope is that this is a springboard for either an expansion or sequel that is much deeper with regards to fleet management.  Something akin to a 4x + RTS + Space Sim combined.  How could would it be to have your own little empire where you start out with barely anything, but you slowly capture/build new ships and take more territory from other alliances.Either way, this game is great.  The controls (I'm using a 360 controller) are seamless and easy to learn/use.  The in-game physics are top notch.  The graphics are very stylized...love it.It's pretty hard to hear comm chatter, but that's about the only real complaint I have so far.  That and maybe adding more options to avoid missles/torpedos.			"

I really hope they will add more content later on in either content patches or DLC. I see this game as a platform that has lots of potential and I wish that that potential will be used.I definitely recommend this one!			"

												It's good. Fly around in space, hunt traitors, bodyswap among your fleet's fighter pilots, commit war-crimes. Good clean space fun in bite-sized chunks.If you rush right through everything, sure, you could 'finish' in an hour. You'd be missing out on a lot, though. It's short, but it's not *that* short. Costs about the same as dinner from KFC, and it's fun for longer.The missions are brief - fifteen minutes, tops. Each has four difficulties, an optional objective, and a reinforcement fleet that *will* wreck you if you try to stand and fight. You can come back and redo old missions with newly unlocked weapons and ships on different difficulties; the reinforcement flagships are much more realistic opponents once it's not just you and your wingman and fifty billion incoming torpedoes. You fly a fighter, you're supported by a couple of NPC capital ships, and you can go into a Homeworld-style real-time-with-pause tactical map to get a 'big picture' view and issue more specific orders than ""shoot this/bomb this/guard this/kamikaze into this"".There's also a 'wave' mode; destroyed fighters get respawned if you get enough kills, but capital ships stay dead until the end of the mission, so you need to husband them.The story's quite good. Fairly understated; you can ignore it if you just want to shoot things and watch the pretty lights. Pity about the war-crimes, but you knew you were flying for the bad guys when you started. It's a bit like Brigador in that respect. It's not a Spec Ops: The Line type of rubbing your nose in what a bad little boy you are, just stuff like 'optional objective: make an example of the construction crews'. Ten seconds, brrt brrt boom, all done, and you'd be straight into the Hague if you did something like that IRL.But really, they've got it coming. They shouldn't have backed a God-Emperor-murdering rebellion in the first place, and flying ships painted like that, they're just asking for it.Be the Dragon.Kill the traitor lords.Ambush their quick-response fleets.Pierce their defences.Bring ruin to their people.Avenge the Emperor.

								If you were a fan of the old X-Wing and Tie Fighter series, just get it!A pure space dogfighter with stunning visuals and great audio. I always wondered how an updated X-Wing could work with TrackIR and this is the perfect example: The combat is fluid and the immersion fantastic. Some criticise the game for being short, but chasing enemies between asteroids and larger ships never gets old.Setting up multiple controllers is a bit tricky, but the developer has been very active on the forums and has greatly improved things since release. The mouse is still erratic in the game menus but I do have Joystick, pedals, throttle and TrackIR working perfectly in the game.Great game overall. Love the art style!			"

								Words cannot even describe how epic this game is..Sure, like one reviewer said, the very first tutorial campaign can start a little confusing, but perseverance pays dividends here folks. After a slow start, the tutorial reveals itself with commands that tell you exactly what it expects in order for you to progress. By the time it’s over you’ve been versed in the finer points of flying your craft. Of course, the mastery of those skills will take some perseverance on your part.Then BOOM! You’re in the thick of it. Alone at first. It’s just you and your trusty fighter – IN VR!!What I did not expect! Was the addition of more and more ships to my entourage as the game progressed as I chopped through the mission one by one, and then replayed those same missions on higher difficulty, I was rewarded with a progressively larger fleet. SICK!The larger fleet is where the real fun lies folks. Why? Because freaking TACTIAL VIEW! You command your fleet, send them to attack, post them up to defend – whatever you want. THEN! You hop in your fighter and help seal the collective strategic deal.Buy this game. Just shut up and buy this game. "

								I have only played a little over an hour.  So right now I dont have an opinion on where the game goes or the pay off.  But I can tell you the early stuff is great.  The price point is right and feeling of being in the cockpit mixed with the straight forward combat feels great.Edit:After playing a few hours now te game still hits me the same way.  I do wish the bite sized missions allowed for more time spent.  The impending clock on every quick mission feels somewhat like I need to just B line for the targets and not approach tactically. To the point where I came on the discussion forums looking for explanation that is missinf formt he game in how to accomplish objectives. That being said the feeling of this game with a VR headset on is great.  Its become the thing i want to return to in VR.  Thumbs up so far .Looking forward to unlocking more upgrades and weapons.

												TL;DR: 1.Good visual and sound for immersion. 2. Fun arcade space pilot 3. Limited content as a $20 game.Played this game with VRidge on HTC 10 with a random headset and Steam Controller. It was pretty fun. Being a terrible pilot, 1~2 levels felt a bit unfair without later unlocks, even on easy difficulty. So try experiment with different loadout whever you can. The content is limited for $20 USD price tag, but I got it on sale for $10 and being the first VR game I played it delivered good value IMO. Did not try challenge mode so cannot comment on that yet, but the core game is fun enough. It's what you expect for a arcady space pilot game.			"

Early Access Review
								What a terrific game.For years, the one game I've wanted more than anything in the universe was a spiritual successor to Freespace and TIE Fighter- and that became even more true once I picked up my Oculus Rift. THIS IS IT.What a fantastic game. To go into the specifics:Graphics: What do you do when you don't have a huge art team dedicated to making super high resolution textures and models? Go with an art style that doesn't need it and, at the same time, looks distinct and beautiful. The game has a wonderful 40s/50s pulp/art deco sci-fi look, which I absolutely love and works spectacularly well. It runs like a dream at very high framerates and the look is one of my favorites of any game I've tried in the last few months.Sound: You really feel like you're in a cockpit. The subdued thump of weapons fire, the muffled cockpit audio- it is, by design, intended to make you feel like you're piloting a spaceship rather than listening to some huge orchestra. It really gives you a great sense of presence.Gameplay: Here is where HotDS really shines. Ship control is tight, fluid, perfect. There is an excellent ""drift"" mechanic that lets you take advantage of Newtonian physics and turn to point any way you want. Weapons feel powerful and realistic. Not since TIE Fighter have I felt so much like I'm actually sitting in a spaceship cockpit doing battle with my interstellar foes- and that is not an exaggeration. To counter a common misconception, the game absoultely does have joystick/HOTAS support- it's just not the main or primary or official or whatever you want to call it control scheme and takes a little effort to bind it the way you want, but I played through with my HOTAS and it worked like a dream.Originally the game was set to be released with procedurally generated missions and campaigns. While I do find the idea of infinitely regenerating missions, I do believe that the exquisitely hand-crafted missions we get here probably do play a lot better than procedural content would have. The developer says a wave move is coming which should help extend the playtime a bit.To this end, to the extent the game has one flaw, it's quite short. I have only played for a few hours but have already beaten most of the content. Still, I would always opt for a short, high quality experience than an endless, more mediocre one (not to mention any other games by name, but you can imagine). I do hope some content gets added at some point, and between the wave mode and whatever the developer adds in the future I'm hopeful but, as it stands now, this is easily worth $20, and then some, today as it stands. Literally not for almost 20 years has a new space combat game of this quality been released, and I'm ecstatic over the quality of what's been delivered. VR Support: Have to throw this in here because I just started using my Rift. This is perhaps my favorite looking game on Oculus. Everything mentioned above with respect to presence, framerate, audio- it's magnified tenfold in the Rift. The head tracking is spot-on perfect, framerate doesn't miss a beat- and while Elite: Dangerous has its pros and cons, it doesn't hold a candle to this in my opinion when it comes to pure, TIE Fighter/ Freespace style combat. Ever since I started seriously considering VR, a VR version of that style of game is what I've wanted most- this is it.To top it all off, this game has, amazingly, been created by a single developer, who, unlike many or even most early access developers, graciously listens to and implements feedback and truly appreciates his players. In summary, this is a very high quality, very polished, technically flawless, beautifully controlling and playing game that finally provides the updated Freespace/TIE Fighter experience that I and I'm sure many others have been longing for for so many years. If you enjoyed any of those types of space combat games back in the day, get this one immediately. If not, get this anyway and see what the excitement is all about! And if you have a VR headset, this is easily in my opinion the best VR cockpit experience on the market today, hands down. You cannot go wrong. What a fantastic game. Excuse me, I have to go hunt down and punish more enemies of the Emperor... "

Early Access Review
								House of the Dying Sun is a fabulous game. The obvious comparison point is Tie Fighter (or perhaps Freespace 2), but it ditches the bar-management of late-90s military space sims to give the in-cockpit gameplay a lot more of an arcade feel, that ends up.. Similar to Strike Suit Zero, but with the animation & soundwork making it a much more immersive experience than that.Plot is minimal; You're the last.. You of a beaten empire, and your emperor's last edict is that you kill everyone who betrayed him. ..And anyone who works for them, watches their cat, goes to the same cafe for lunch, etc. You are not the Good Guys here. You are the diehard loyalists to The Empire, in the tropiest sense of the name, and it adds a lot to the tone that the player is put in that position in no uncertain terms. Every mission is titled ""Murder at _____"", and often your bonuses (which give precious upgrade points) are to, yes, turn innocent construction workers/whathaveyou into pink space-mist.This may be offputting to some, but.. I find it adds to the Tie-Fighter link, while giving the game room to breathe verymuch as its Own Thing.What I haven't touched on yet is what HotDS adds in terms of tactics; You may be thinking that without the bar management, this reduces the game to a simple point-n-shoot. But as the game progresses, you go from a lone fighter with a mean grudge to a small fleet (with a mean grudge). Your fighters become troops for you to command on the zoomed-out management map, as well as doubling as precious extra lives for when you mess up. Your other ships are More Punch in various sizes (orderable, but not controllable directly). All can be upgraded with aforementioned Upgrade Points.I haven't played Challenge Mode, so can't comment on that, but the core gameplay is enough that I don't mind early-access savewipes with updates, which says a lot. I've happily played through the earlygame 3 times now, and will probably again. It's just.. That solid in terms of gameplay. Pick your difficulty right, and you're constantly on the edge of your seat, with the timer counting down to when the enemy's Flagship arrives, slowly meanders across the battlefield, and squishes you into space-dirt with the ease of an elephant seal rolling over in its sleep.Basically, buy this game if:* You like your spacefighter games more structured and less trucker-y* You like being the Bad Guy* You like a challenge* You like tense, hit-n-run gameplay.* You played & enjoyed X-Wing/Tie Fighter, Freespace, etc.* You enjoy tactical management, while being able to get into the thick of things yourself.Don't buy this if:* You want a lot of plot, scripted events, indepth voice-acting, deep worldbuilding & characters. This isn't that game. "

												If you aren't playing this in VR, you're wasting your time. Go play the early X-Wing / TIE Fighter games, or the Wing Commander series. They should offer a much better experience in exchange for the lower immersion of a flat screen and older graphics.At the time of this review I've played the game for more than 11 hours, which is far longer than you actually need to beat the game, so clearly I enjoyed it a lot. But I enjoyed it in spite of one very glaring flaw: this game is ridiculously easy. Now, it's been decades since I last played Star Wars: TIE Fighter, and I was practically a baby at the time, but the one thing I still remember so strongly about it is how hard it was.Dying Sun's difficulty curve is nonexistent, but for both good and bad reasons. What's good about this game's (lack of) difficulty is that the controls definitely aren't going to get in the way, like they seem to in so many other flight / space combat games. They are smooth and streamlined, while allowing some fun and complex maneuvers using the drift button.What's not so good is the progression structure of the missions. If you can't beat a mission at the highest difficulty, you can just beat it at a lower difficulty, and still get the exact same reward (plus a slightly lower number of upgrade points), which is usually a fleet upgrade, just as if you had beaten it at the higher difficulty. Then, you can just play that mission again at the higher difficulty using your now beefed-up fleet. Though still depressing, a slightly less absurd progression would be to play the whole game on the lowest difficulty to get all the fleet upgrades, then go back to the beginning and play it again on the highest difficulty using your now wildly overpowered fleet.Either way, it's grinding, and while you aren't required to play it this way, it suggests that the missions haven't been carefully balanced to offer exactly the right amount of difficulty for progressing in a completely linear fashion on the highest difficulty, which is how games are supposed to be played.None of the above is really a deal-breaker though; if you have enough discipline you can force yourself to only ever play missions on the highest difficulty, and then it's sort of an okay game, but still ridiculously easy compared to early masterpieces of the genre.You can artificially increase the difficulty for yourself even more by trying to kill all the traitor flagships. But this deprives you of the fun of trying to escape before the flagship arrives. The best moments in the game come when you have just completed all objectives, and the flagship warps in close by and you're trying to warp out before your ship gets hit by all its incoming missiles. There is a wondrous moment of exhilaration as you warp out, knowing that you were just seconds away from getting blown to smitherines.If you instead wait around and actually try to kill the flagship, I noticed that both in the music and in my own emotional state, there was a very noticeable deadening of excitement and slowing of the game's pace. So it seems this game is about warping into traitor territory, exterminating the human garbage who were complicit in the murder of our glorious Emperor, and then warping out as quickly as possible. You just need to make sure you play it that way to get the most enjoyment.It's also drop-dead gorgeous, epic even, in virtual reality. The graphics look stupid and amateurish on flat screens, especially in screenshots; you have to play it VR to feel the full effect of the colorful environments, and for the VR lenses' godrays to accentuate the dramatic white-on-black text announcing the death of the Emperor and your mission to kill all the traitors. But the visuals are not the biggest winner here -- that prize has to go to the game's sound design, which effectively makes it way more immersive and breathtaking than it deserves to be.This game should really be a 3/5, but when I look at all the other flight/space games that are around nowadays, all I see is rubbish. So I'm giving it...4/5			"

								Dang! This is fantastic in VR! I absolutely love it. I like it a lot better than Valkyrie. It's beautiful in a different way. It's like being inside a Homeworld fighter ship in VR. I love that the outside sounds are muted. Feels so spacey! Love the controls, ship interior, space clouds. Good stuff. If you have VR and are remotely interested in space shooters, this should be in your library!			"

								An amazing game. One of the most exciting and immersive games i have played period!Update: I have played a bit more now and holy f%$#. This game is so crazy good. You know u have good sound design and gameplay when u play a game on a laptop screen and it feels just as intense as playing it in VR. Some games are so much better in VR and this one is just as intense no matter the screen size. No other game makes me lean in gripping my controller tight super focused, intent on winning. Carefully watching the positions of my fleet. Making critical precision strikes at the just the right moment. Each kill getting me more focused and positioned to the final flanking maneuver that will finally melt the enemy frigate. So good. Just amazing job Mike. I am so glad u put in the effort to give us such a great game:) Thank You!Update: Just pasted battle 10 in challenge mode. Holy balls so amazing. Again I play in both VR and on my tiny laptop screen, but when you see your wing-man get killed or you finally take down an enemy frigate it is just as profound and emotional. I don't usually sweat, swear, cry and physically flip off enemy AI while laughing hysterically but this game brings it out in me:P			"

												TL;DR: 1.Good visual and sound for immersion. 2. Fun arcade space pilot 3. Limited content as a $20 game.Played this game with VRidge on HTC 10 with a random headset and Steam Controller. It was pretty fun. Being a terrible pilot, 1~2 levels felt a bit unfair without later unlocks, even on easy difficulty. So try experiment with different loadout whever you can. The content is limited for $20 USD price tag, but I got it on sale for $10 and being the first VR game I played it delivered good value IMO. Did not try challenge mode so cannot comment on that yet, but the core game is fun enough. It's what you expect for a arcady space pilot game.			"

								I have only played a little over an hour.  So right now I dont have an opinion on where the game goes or the pay off.  But I can tell you the early stuff is great.  The price point is right and feeling of being in the cockpit mixed with the straight forward combat feels great.Edit:After playing a few hours now te game still hits me the same way.  I do wish the bite sized missions allowed for more time spent.  The impending clock on every quick mission feels somewhat like I need to just B line for the targets and not approach tactically. To the point where I came on the discussion forums looking for explanation that is missinf formt he game in how to accomplish objectives. That being said the feeling of this game with a VR headset on is great.  Its become the thing i want to return to in VR.  Thumbs up so far .Looking forward to unlocking more upgrades and weapons.

												Amazing intensive battles - it's like being a pilot in Battlestar Galactica or in a Prowler from Farscape. The sound is spot-on, spacecraft ships are highly detailed and have parts you can disable, for tactical advantages. Completing the game on Easy difficulty takes 4 hours. After that you have a full squad, and can take on higher difficulties (more intensive battles), for a total of 12-15 hours. There's also a random daily mission, where you fend off waves of enemies, to compete on the leaderboards. In the beginning you control one fighter, at the end you have 3 fighters and 6 big ships. There are about 20 upgrades and several weapons to choose before each mission start - you need to choose wisely, as the missions are quite tough, especially if you want to minimize your casualties.

Early Access Review
								What a terrific game.For years, the one game I've wanted more than anything in the universe was a spiritual successor to Freespace and TIE Fighter- and that became even more true once I picked up my Oculus Rift. THIS IS IT.What a fantastic game. To go into the specifics:Graphics: What do you do when you don't have a huge art team dedicated to making super high resolution textures and models? Go with an art style that doesn't need it and, at the same time, looks distinct and beautiful. The game has a wonderful 40s/50s pulp/art deco sci-fi look, which I absolutely love and works spectacularly well. It runs like a dream at very high framerates and the look is one of my favorites of any game I've tried in the last few months.Sound: You really feel like you're in a cockpit. The subdued thump of weapons fire, the muffled cockpit audio- it is, by design, intended to make you feel like you're piloting a spaceship rather than listening to some huge orchestra. It really gives you a great sense of presence.Gameplay: Here is where HotDS really shines. Ship control is tight, fluid, perfect. There is an excellent ""drift"" mechanic that lets you take advantage of Newtonian physics and turn to point any way you want. Weapons feel powerful and realistic. Not since TIE Fighter have I felt so much like I'm actually sitting in a spaceship cockpit doing battle with my interstellar foes- and that is not an exaggeration. To counter a common misconception, the game absoultely does have joystick/HOTAS support- it's just not the main or primary or official or whatever you want to call it control scheme and takes a little effort to bind it the way you want, but I played through with my HOTAS and it worked like a dream.Originally the game was set to be released with procedurally generated missions and campaigns. While I do find the idea of infinitely regenerating missions, I do believe that the exquisitely hand-crafted missions we get here probably do play a lot better than procedural content would have. The developer says a wave move is coming which should help extend the playtime a bit.To this end, to the extent the game has one flaw, it's quite short. I have only played for a few hours but have already beaten most of the content. Still, I would always opt for a short, high quality experience than an endless, more mediocre one (not to mention any other games by name, but you can imagine). I do hope some content gets added at some point, and between the wave mode and whatever the developer adds in the future I'm hopeful but, as it stands now, this is easily worth $20, and then some, today as it stands. Literally not for almost 20 years has a new space combat game of this quality been released, and I'm ecstatic over the quality of what's been delivered. VR Support: Have to throw this in here because I just started using my Rift. This is perhaps my favorite looking game on Oculus. Everything mentioned above with respect to presence, framerate, audio- it's magnified tenfold in the Rift. The head tracking is spot-on perfect, framerate doesn't miss a beat- and while Elite: Dangerous has its pros and cons, it doesn't hold a candle to this in my opinion when it comes to pure, TIE Fighter/ Freespace style combat. Ever since I started seriously considering VR, a VR version of that style of game is what I've wanted most- this is it.To top it all off, this game has, amazingly, been created by a single developer, who, unlike many or even most early access developers, graciously listens to and implements feedback and truly appreciates his players. In summary, this is a very high quality, very polished, technically flawless, beautifully controlling and playing game that finally provides the updated Freespace/TIE Fighter experience that I and I'm sure many others have been longing for for so many years. If you enjoyed any of those types of space combat games back in the day, get this one immediately. If not, get this anyway and see what the excitement is all about! And if you have a VR headset, this is easily in my opinion the best VR cockpit experience on the market today, hands down. You cannot go wrong. What a fantastic game. Excuse me, I have to go hunt down and punish more enemies of the Emperor... "

												The Homeworld [remastered] tactical shooter you've always wanted.9/10, Nearly Completely FlawlessJust needs some kind of Co-op or MP. It includes 3 base difficulty levels and a 4th unlockable difficulty level as well. On top of that there is a ""randomly generated"" daily challenge that is effectively endless. The game itself is short, but also certainly punishing and it leaves plenty of room for replayability. Controller highly recommended (Steam controller takes more getting used to, but it will work).

House of the Dying Sun is my new favourite Early Access game that has overall surprised me with it's fun gameplay.Warning! This review will contain spoilers for literally the entire game.Gameplay is fun but short, I finished the game in two hours. There are three types of difficulty and lots of upgrades. The game needs a lot of improvement campaign wise but it was a lot of fun to play nevertheless.StoryIn House of the Dying Sun, you are the bad guys. You play as a host body that pilots the most dangerous fighter in the galaxy, your objective? Avenge the Emporer...Wait... Was it? We don't really know, but you get to decide at the end.You fight your way through the galaxy with your ragtag team of what remains of the Emporers Guard killing each of the false thanes and traitorous lords along your journey. Killing and Massacaring countless civilians, soldiers and officers that step in your path. Until your final mission, your last dreadnought armed to the teeth with torpedos, you begin bombarding the surface of the Empire's homeworld until the genocide of over 14 million souls is over. It ends with a last stand until your host body. "

								House of the Dying Sun is in my opinion one of the best games released in 2016. It mixes First Person fighter combat, with fleet strategy in an outstandingly seamless way. The game is extraordinarily well built, with very responsive controls that are tight and, once you get a hang of it, are very rewarding. The game is well balanced, starting off reasonable, and progressively getting harder and harder. There are plenty of choices about the setup of your weapons and gear. The one big criticism of this game, is the length. The campaign, while very fun, is not especially long. Each mission has three difficulty levels, which expands the length a fair bit, but sadly - the amount of content currently is a little lacking. The good news is that they are planning an unlimited wave map, that promises to be good fun. At £15, I feel that I have definitely got my money's worth, and that this is an extraordinarily well made game. "

												I played this game exclusively in VR. If you have a VR setup, this game is totally worth it. Yes, it's short! Oddly enough my played time currently says 0.4 hours, and I have finished the game, but I don't think 0.4 hours is accurate at all.What I do know is there are missions you can finish on the easiest skill level in about a minute. Warp in, take out target, warp out. It's extremely fast. On a SSD there aren't even noticeable load times (I'm assuming warping in and out of systems is the load time).The game plays like a new Wing Commander (like the classic), but there's no fluff chatting with your squaddies, no long mission briefing (look to your right in VR), and no long escort missions.The game is very visually appealing in VR and utterly immersive. It's a fast paced actiony ride with some quality space combat mechanics.			"

								Gorgeous game with incredible sound design. Huge props to the developer for making the game very accessible and geared for a gamepad. Each mission so far is a lot of fun, and can be very challenging if you rank up the difficulty. House of the Dying Sun clearly pays homage to the classic PC space sims of the 90s, but ramps up the action and plays a bit more arcadey, which to me, is an excellent thing. Overall, a fantastic game that I'm actually suprised was released as a EA title since its so polished and finished. This may be the game that gets me to purchase a VR headset.			"

												This game has been on my wishlist for a while. I picked it up on a 40% off sale just to see what it was like. I didn't have high expectations since most VR games are absolute garbage. I played Elite Dangerous and was very disappointed. With how bad most VR games were, I was skeptical to get Eve: Valkyrie for $60. This was only $12 so I figured that I wasn't out much money if it turned out to be a flop. This game is really good. I play using the Steam Controller and it is really good.First, the graphics are okay. I use an RX 480 and many VR games are not too optimized, this included. I had to turn the graphics down to 80%. It still looks good and framerates are stable-ish. I do get framerate drops in the menus, but I get this on most games. It isn't as bad as those in Arizona Sunshine. Not enought to cause motion sickness. Distant text is a little blurry. If I had more GPU horsepower, this probably wouldn't be an issue. Many of the textures in the game are low-poly, which is cool but feels a little out of place with the quality of your ship and the enemy ships. This is something I would have expected from an Early Access but not from a full release.The interface is really good. Because you are using VR, you can't see your controller. The game shows where the button is on the controller so you can feel for it. I never had any problems with button presses. There is a tutorial for the game but it could use a little work. It does show you the basics but doesn't go through ship customization. YouTube really helped out here, especially since some of the missions require using specific weapons and armor to win. I wish that more developers would push toward the motion control interface. This is my biggest complaint with most games. The cockpit is detailed but I can't interact with anything in it because there is no motion controller suppoert.The game paces okay. In the beginning, it tells you that you may need specific loadouts to succeed at missions. This worried me a little but it wasn't all that bad. I did get hung up on some missions but after looking on YouTube for suggested builds, it went smoothly. There are some levels where enemies can one-shot your ship but this is rare. The AI, both enemy and friendly, is a little simple. I lost my ship in a fight only to find my friendly AI trying to engage the flagship. They can be micro controlled but I'm pretty lazy at this.Overall, this game is well worth the money. Even at the full price, this game has a good bit of content. Hopefully the devs keep moving forward and fixing some of these small issues. As I said before, most VR games are complete garbage and a waste of time, which is more valuable than money. This game is not one of those. Anyone with VR should pick this game up.			"

Early Access Review
								In House of the Dying Sun, you play as a Dragon, a mercenary and outlaw paid for by corporations in order to destabilize and prepare the world of Solo Nobre, once ruled by a just and despot Great Lea- oh hell, sorry, that's my review for Brigador. Let's try that again...In House of the Dying Sun, you play as the Dragon, recently released from your centuries long cryosleep to wreak vengeance in the name of your deceased Emperor. Rebellious generals and duplicitous members of Imperial Nobility have assassinated Him, triggering a final sanction and unleashing His greatest weapon upon the throneworld.I could tell you this is a stylish quick firing space first person shooter (simulation apparently now being owned solely by the sort of folk who get overly excited about the rocket equation and delta V) but you probably saw that in the video.Let's talk about how it feels like instead. It feels FAST. Even in the quietest movements there's a feeling of motility, a sense that sitting still would be pretty embarrasing. Your fighter wants to move, and with only 2 upgrade slots for your machine you will be making choices that will close the door on your ""shields and armor"" safezone to venture into hot new flavors of death dealing. Flavors like ""Kamikaze"" and ""stutterjump fly-by shotgun blasting"". Let's look at that style. Imperial equipment, all sharp edges, convex curves and aggressive coloring denoting that they are at the Top of the Food Chain, even as they fight from a position of inferiority in every mission. Witness how quickly your enemies wither under your Autocannon, how quickly your own assets fall under the guns of the Enemy, sniper turrets and torpedo-launching dreadnaughts.Listen to the sound of astronomic silence, punctuated only by muffled gunfire, the thrum of your engines and the whirring of your reloading mechanisms. Read the blurbs of lore, like perfectly carved Doritos of sci-fi, just enough to get you excited, but not bored. The UI, so light and flab-free (except maybe the joystick support, but if you aren't rocking a spare 360 pad or something what are you doing here come on this is the 21st century don't you play emulated games?). In my opinion there is definitely still a place for the minimalist, curated game. We don't need to have an indie scape littered with six million different styles of procedurally generated playing fields, all interacted with in the same manner. For Marauder to stand to their own principles and murder their own ludological children for the sake of principle is, I believe, something to applaud. Buy the game, try it out. If you're not into the short play times, simplistic upgrade trees and gamepad-focused, light Newtonian play this may not be your thing. But who are you to judge a game merely on bullet points, really?			"

All the levels are rather uniform in design, a few asteroids here and there, and a smattering of things to blow up.  It's like they combined the worst concepts of Wing Commander and Star Fox into one game(E.G. lack of variety, lack of open world). If you want a good space sim, go for Galaxy on Fire, Star Point Gemini, or pretty much any other space sim on Steam.			"

Alright this is a though one.I must say I really like the game. I played the entire thing with the HTC Vive and it looks amazing, the HUD is perfect for VR and gosh the emerssion ist astonishing. Also in regards to the not VR components:The controls are trully amazing (with a xBox controller) Fighting is tons of fun especially due to driftingThe sound/music is really well done (you get a lot notifications sounds when you are in fireing range for example which is good)Nice little loadout system its fine but not that big (you can switch 2 perks, 2 main weapons and one heavy weapon on your      playable ship fewer on the capital ships)So far it sounds fantastic, but now the reason why I don't recommend this game (YET)It is too short for the price tag. I played it rather relaxed, did some missions again on harder difficulty and had a playtime of 2 hours. This is too short in my opinionThere is so much missed potenital, you as a player can only pilot one ship, but there are already a lot more playersized ships in the game. Also I feel like this game could use the implementation of the steam workshop for custom missions/ships (playable capital ships?).CONCLUSION TIME:Buy this game if it is on a like 30% discount or if you don't mind the money. Its a really good game especially for VR.PLEASE ADD WORKSHOP DEVS! I NEED THIS!ALSO:REALLY IMPORTANT  ADD WORKSHOP  REALLY IMPORTANT "

The visuals, while simplistic on their face, look -really- good, and the sound design is more than immersive enough to draw me into the game.  Xbox controller requires a bit of a light touch in order to aim correctly, but there are visual/audio cues enough to let you know when you're on target.I hear it's a bit on the short side, but as much fun as I'm having with it, it's well worth the $18 I spent buying it on sale.

A Space Sim I can finally play with the Vive Pretty? Check Action? Check No nausea? Check Workable controls? Check Affordable? CheckI've only played this game for about 25 minutes, and I can already tell it's been one of the best experiences I've had in VR so far. I'm running with an Xbox Controller, a GeForce 970, and a Vive. After playing the first few levels in cockpit mode, it seems quite similar to Elite Dangerous in terms of visual style. The starscapes and HUD are beautiful. While Elite Dangerous is prettier, House of the Dying Sun seems more action oriented, is easier to control, and doesn't give me nausea.I've been looking for a decent space sim since I bought the Vive. Descent made me nauseous within a couple of minutes. Elite Dangerous has overly complicated controls and seemed a bit slow for my taste. House of the Dying Sun jumps you directly into combat and the ships have a propulsion setup that keeps the player moving forward and keeps the pitch and yaw slow enough to prevent any sickness so far.

								Runs really smoothly in VR on HTC Vive, GTX970, i7-4770, 16GB.The developer has taken care to make the UI work well in VR.Control settings are detailed and powerful.  HOTAS users can set everything up how they like it, if they are willing to invest a little time.The flat-shaded graphics are beautiful and crisp, playing to VR's strengths.  Similarly, the back-story is told with a few broad strokes, setting you up as the evil empire out for vengeance, and the game is clearly a labour of love. The sound design goes for a 'realistic' diegetic style with out-of-cockpit events sounding muted, which gives harsh weapon impacts when your shields go down a jolt of direct threat.I've done 4 easy (Invader) missions so far, and the game feels fun, fast and accessible. You can die quickly but there is no real penalty for doing so (yet). I look forward to figuring out the tactical interface for wingman control and will update this review as I get more into the game			"

								This game is ""better than No Man's Sky"" (tm).Ok, now that is out of the way...This game is very cool, extremely well designed, and well executed. The game runs flawlessly on my five years old PC on max-everything settings. So far, no bugs, no crashes, no lag.The immersion is excellent (I recommend turning off the music). The game reminds me a lot of one of my all time favorites: Freespace. For ship-to-ship combat, I prefer this game over Elite:Dangerous. The controls are not quite as complicated as in E:D which for me only makes the combat more engaging.The story\mission system adds a lot of structure to the game (and which is missing in E:D).If you like space fighter dog fighting, then you will certainly like this. And besides, the price is right.One thing I think you will definately want to do is remap your keyboard and joy stick. In case it is helpful, here is my mapping (work in progress): http://i.imgur.com/2MbhQDI.png "

												I wanted to like this game a lot - similar to descent and wing commander.  It has some nice qualities but in the end, after few missions in - I find myself just continually restarting over and over and over.  I was hoping this was going to be a new wing commander / descent freespace but sadly it's not even close for being fun.Pros - good sound and graphics. The subtle jump in thumps and radio chatter was nice.easy to track targetsupgrading feature for your ship gives incentive beyond just clearing missionsCons - -Idiotic wingman (even after you give them commands) - pretty much die instantly going after sentry guns or anything that has any form of firepower (apparently from other comments by players - you have to constantly fly avoidance patterns) - they should teach wingmen how to do that. I personally wish i could tell them to sit out of range and after I use my heavy weapon switch to them and use theirs intelligently.-Unofficial time limits. It would be nice to apply better tactics (like trying to fly toward a different approach of a ship).  But you don't have the time.  a ""traitor"" flagship always jumps in about 5 minutes in that will destroy you flat out.-limited heavy weapons to use (if you wanted to take out a ship).  How many?  ONE (torpedo - long range)  2 bombs - close but you have to get very close then if you can survive getting that close..  You can target their subysystem (bridge) from afar with a torpedo - and if you hit it - great. If not - RESTART .(you can try to jump to another fighter in your squad - assuming they haven't been squashed).-upgrades- spend favor points to get them. But to get any decent amount of them you have to fly warlord or last - in which again you will be squashed pretty quick and you will have to RESTART again and again (and you only get them for ""bonus"" objectives - not the main mission.

												House of the Dying Sun has great aesthetics and the best implementation of gamepad controls for a space fighter game I've ever played.  Sadly, it's let down by a dire lack of content and an overall game design I found very unfulfilling.The game is kind of ""mechanical"" to a fault, with little flavor to the between mission presentation beyond an inspired font choice.  What story you get is in very short text blurbs.  It has only 14 missions and it's intended for you to play those missions multiple times at progressively higher difficulties; but while the missions do change a bit between difficulties (mostly just additional ships), they're still not different enough that I'd take their slight variations in lieu of a more lengthy traditional campaign.In addition to the small number of missions, they also go by too quickly.  Every mission has a hard time limit enforced by a more or less unbeatable ship warping in.  You're constantly being rushed to the extent that you barely have time to take in what's going on in a mission.  I often failed missions not because I was killed, but rather because I actually tried to enjoy dogfighting a bit instead of just making a beeline for the objective, and ran out of time.  I personally think that being under a time limit in a game is rarely enjoyable and here's an entire game built around that concept.In my hour with the game I already got through 10 of the 14 missions and at that point I had to evaluate whether I had any interest in playing them again and again to get my money's worth.  I just couldn't see myself doing that, so I had to make the somewhat tough choice to return the game.HotDS isn't bad, in some ways it's quite good, but for me, that kind of makes it all the more massively disappointing because all I could see when I played it is the missed potential for something so much better.  I wish the game had a slightly larger team behind it that could create a campaign that more closely resembled the story based space fighters of yore. A game with around 30 or so longer lasting, hand-crafted missions and more elaborate development and presentation of the story between missions (even if it was just ""motion comics"" or something like that) would be amazing			"

								House of the Dying Sun offers a glimpse of an alternate future of what space sims would look like if the genre didn't precipitously fall off the face of the Earth following Freespace's demise. Sure, the genre is resurging thanks to crowd funding and the novelty of VR. But the genre finds itself carrying the inertia of Chris Roberts and David Braben's gradiose visions. That's not to say their visions of widescope of space combat and exploration are any less valuable contributions to the parched space sim landscape. But sometimes you just want to get in, shoot stuff, and get out. And more importantly, play around with mechanics that are tighter focussed for that quick pace. While also being titillated aurally and visually.That's where House of the Dying Sun comes in. House of the Dying Sun is such a tightly focussed space sim with mechanics and gameplay that have taken the Freespace and X-Wing mold but have applied such a wonderful spin on the concepts taken for granted. The game feels familiar but so different than anything I've ever played. The shooting feels great. Maneuvering is straightforward but still reflects a certain mount of tension and stress via the speed conveyed and the drift mechanics that can be used. And the sounds are meticulously detailed such that it greatly enhances the immersion. And dat hyperpsace effect. I have trouble believing that a game as polished as this was primarily developed by one man. Buy this game, just for that awesome warp effect alone. I don't have a VR headset but playing this game is really making me considering getting one.			"

I truly hope you guys can bring out the full potential to this game.			"

								House of the Dying Sun has so much wasted potential. While techincally excellent, though at times lacking in polish, it completely fails to build any tension, instead throwing the player into a handful of short combat gauntlets.At some point the developer has decided that his procedural generation was working to produce too much empty 'time' and the game needed to be pared down to make it fun. In doing so he's lost a major part of what makes the combat exciting. Downtime, planning, random situations, travel time, even in very small amounts these work to bring you into the world and give you a stake in the fight. Instead you'll find yourself sitting in the map paused trying to work out things you should have discovered before you decided to go in.Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any plan to return this to an open-world roguelike, I'd suggest your time and money is better spent elsewhere.

								Why release your game on PC if you have absolutely no intention of making the game playable on Mouse and Keyboard? Right from the get go, at least half of the keys are unbinded, which is already a huge pain in the butt. Then you get to the actual mouse and keyboard controls, which are floaty as hell and lack the precision needed to enjoy a game like this. These are basic things that should've been addressed before the game came out. I'll update the review once these basic features are implemented properly.Edit: I still don't like the fact that they prioritized gamepads over mouse and keyboard, but the developer's been great so for that reason alone I'm switching my score from negative to positive. It's a rare sight these days to see a Developer that actually engages with the consumer, instead of getting butthurt over constructive criticism.			"

												It was about 30 minutes into my playthrough that I noticed I had already completed 6 of the 14 missions. This game is a masterclass in seeming without being. The hook in the trailer makes you think you're in for this rich narrative about vengeance and the death of an Emperor, but the reality sinks in pretty quickly that this game is just an engine and a few ship designs strung together with less than three pages of text. This game is a waste of money, and more importantly, a waste of an awesome title that should have been used on a cooler game. Its a totally competent space combat sim, and nothing else in any way.

								Really impressed with my first 3 maps. Most of the things run smoothly and exceed my high expectation that Elite Dangerous has fail (in terms of VR to be specific).Works without any need of custom setting in option with Vive and PS4 controller, can jump start right away.Well worth the price for it currently offer if you ask me, Most likely the best purcahse on steam this year.Some suggestion/question/bug I have so far:1) seems there's not much room for advance manuver. You can now either go where your nose point to, or drift in a straight line and point anywhere. I would expect to able to perform a mix of it, i.e. I can boost while drifting to change my path in a much more dynamic way.2) on mission where you esceort an assault ship, there seems to be a bug when you warp away as soon as the traitor flagship  come. I got a message that I abandoned the objective during the long warp, then the assault ship come in and said mission completed. then I am left in that empty space not able to do anything. no where to warp to, not even going back.3) When my ship explode the debris focus is too close to my eye in VR and that's the most/only uncomfortable moment I had.4) Can we have some random generated map/mission later instead/on top of the endless survive wave?

Others have noted the excellent source material it draws on: Homeworld, Freespace, Battlestar Galactica.  The hit-and-run approach to mission design gives the gameplay a great sense of urgency.  The music helped a lot there, too.  I played it all the way through, and the last mission was particularly gratifying.  For an early access game, it feels very well developed. My only disappointment (I won't say complaint) is the lack of multiplayer.  Hope to see more content or other titles from this developer soon.			"

Probably my fav VR app so far.I went back for another HOUR - totally get it now.  TOTALLY INSANE without question the best VR game/app available to date.

Feels like a modern Freespace combined with Tie Fighter.- It's waaay too short :-( I played every mission on easy mode in less than 4 hours Bottom line: the game have LOTS of potential. Please developers, you have something special in your hands, don't throw it away.Suggetions: - More missions or make the current missions longer, with checkpoints and waves of enemies and objectives (like Freespace).- A pinch of story was plus, so maybe elaborate more to get us more involved with the plot.

								House of the Dying Sun is all around a great game. In HotDS you must make your way through missions, eliminating traitorous lords and destroying their false empire. As you go through these missions you grow your fleet, and gain access to new weapons. Each mission has three difficulties which you can complete to earn points which you can spend on ship upgrades. In these missions you can choose to use a tactical map and/or commands which allow you to control your fleet. This is really where there game shines in my opinion. I really enjoy switching between the fast-paced cockpit of my Executor and the tactical map. If this game looks at all enjoyable to you, or you love the combat in games like Elite: Dangerous or Star Citizen, then I would highly recommend House of the Dying Sun to you.			"

												Stylish, immersive, fun warcrimes.Get this immediately.-----------------------------------------This game rules and deserves way more attention than it gets. The perfect starfighter/traitor punishment sim.Slick style and sound, feels great, and a hint of fascinating lore. Fairly short, but in the sense that it encourages you to replay it at harder difficulties anyway. Has an indefinite leaderboard challenge mode for when you've exhausted the campaign and want to Ice Man/Maverick it against everyone else. And then of course there's the Dragon Difficulty setting. Amazing developer who is probably beset on all sides by horrible people demanding he build in better parameters for their Thrustmaster Prostate Massager HOTAS or whatever			"

												Pros: Fun, fast, polished, immersiveCons: Short, poor audio balance for radioI picked this game up, played for a while, got to the end, thought it was absurdly short, then noticed I'd been playing for almost an hour and a half. I've seen all three endings and am a quarter of the way through on the hardest difficulty in 2.5 hours. And I suck at these games.It is an absolute blast. I haven't had this much fun busting cap ships since X-Wing, and it's amazingly fun. But it's really, really short. Not a lot of loadout options, either. Radio volume is a bit low. Weapon balance is pretty skewed. Still, love it, will continue to play it, will reccomend it, and will hope more content will make its way in as the game develops.Edit: Minor, minor spoiler. Just checked the hidden achievements, I may be wrong about seeing all the endings.			"

								Pros - Super nice controls - Great gameplay mechanics (diping in and out of shields, long range attacks, drifting)- Some actual strats are necessary to win most levels- good homeworld esc rts interface- beautifull minamalistic esthetic - amazing sound design- enticing mission descriptions and background lore- (on hardbringer) features actually challenging levels that are very rewarding once completed- you play as the bad guys for once :DCons- a bit of a short campain, (6 hours on the hardest difficulty)- as you progress and build your fleet missions seem to only get easier rather than harder- not alot of atatchement to your fleet. (You never feek bad when you lose a frigate or a fighter because once you get enough kills another one will pop in, or by the next level your fleet will be replenished)Overall I'd give it a 6.5/10 mainly for how short the game is at the moment. If there were more missions, maybe double the length it is now with new mechanics and twists included I'd give it an 8.5. I still think it's worth the pick up right now, it really is a fun game.			"

								House of the Dying Sun is an intense and very fun space shooter. What makes the game unique is the nature of the missions you have to complete in order to progress. They are basically hit and run missions, where you have to assassinate an enemy lord or complete a specific task and escape, before enemy reinforcements arrive. This feature is what makes this title so much fun to play. As you complete more missions you can unlock modules, weapons and more ships to join you in your campaign.By equipping different modules and weapons you can customize your ships and make them suitable for a certain role, like bombing capital ships or going after enemy fighters. Different loadouts change the way you play and how you can approach your targets.Changing to the tactical map gives you the option to take a better look of the battlefield and guide your wingmen more efficiently. Overall House of the Dying Sun is very good game, with intense combat, perfect for fans of the genre but also newcomers.If you enjoyed this review and found it helpful, then please consider following my curator page.

												There is a lot of concern that this game is 'too short'. Yes, you could crash through the missions once in an evening, but that is not how the game is supposed to played. Each mission is designed to played played multiple times in different diffculty modes. Then there are the daily challenges, the 'end game' if you will. I've put 30 hours into this game so far, thats far more than most game I buy.To the game proper. The minute to minute gameplay is excellent. Fast, brutal dogfighting. I can't say much about the game mechanics, just trust me if you like old school space sim combat then you are in safe hands here. The atmosphere though, oh my. The muffled, almost subsonic rumble of the weapons. The radio chatter. The audio is incredible. The story is beautifully hinted at. You will want to unlock all the story snippets. Grand space opera light on details. Loved it.Oh but you have a Vive? Yeah then just buy it. I've had a chance to play a few VR games, and the ones I've seen so far are really just mini game tech demos. This game blew me away when I tried it in VR. You are in your ship. The increase in situational awareness is amazing, Ships and asteriods are vast, physical things. The sense of being in a vehicle whipping about in 3D space is incredible.So yeah, I like it.			"

								So yeah, I saw this game ages ago when Scott Manley got a dev build and showed so many people it... I literally didn't know it was released all of a sudden, and that the dev had changed the name. I just looked it up after remembering it, and after seeing footage of the stuff from forever ago, I was super interested in what this game could be. Unfortunately, I was a bit let down. I played through the whole game in under 2 hours, meaning I could refund it (and I will be honest, I will, since it was certainly not worth $20). There is so little content in the game, and the whole time I was playing it I was just hoping there were more upgrades, ship types, or something else to keep me interested past the 2 hour mark.Sorry, but this game is not worth $20. I will continue to scratch my space-ship itch with Children of a Dead Earth instead, since that game actually has something to it (or actually, it has quite a lot to it).			"

								When I first saw this game a three days ago, I was hooked from the start. The combat is quite polished, and the replayability of the missions are not JUST on higher difficulty, the combat AI is smarter and more aggressive. Also the enemies you fight through the difficulties change based on the level. Although the lore/story are short, I found them very good and unique, honestly one of my favorite parts of the game.10/10 - Would accidentally drift my ship into an asteroid again.			"

								Owned this since launch - it's a fast paced classic space combat simulator with multiplayer (online) elements that are optional.I'm using an xbox one controller and it maps well.HTC VIVE owner, bought this on launch, popped in for 5 minutes or so a few times and came back to it now (August) the progress is outstanding and its becoming very well polished.Good to enough to consider as a current Vive title in my library, I hope I get to plough hours into this.

								Amazing cockpit shooter, if only it wasn't lacking in content. 19 missions which last around 5 minutes each isn't really worth the asking price tag even on sale. Under $10 it would be a great purchase, but at any other price it isn't worth it.			"

Early Access Review
								tl,dr : This game is really impressive! pros:-stunning visuals-really nice controls, on keyboard and mice and with a controller-unintrusive HUD-stellar performance, lots of fps even with settings on ultra-high content/price ratio!-the levels are not too easy, and can be very hard if you choose toocons:-still has some bugs (i've written this review on first day of earlz access, they should be fixed soon)-the voices have too much interference in them, making them quite hard to understand-the campain is a bit short (3 hours and you should have finished all levels, though not on high difficulty)other comments:the game is a bit silent, but i find this quite nice and immersive. there still is music in the background but it's quite low relative to the noise of chatter, engines and guns. It is quite impressive how this game has a stellar performance, considering the impressive visuals, even when the graphics are set to ultra. I will certainly keep playing it after beating the campain! I recommend this game to anyone!			"

												Really tight game that scratches that space starfighter itch everyone has at somepoint. The campaign by itself will only take you 3-5 hours, but most of its longevity comes from trying harder difficulties and playing the challenge mode. Generally something you dont binge for hours on end though.			"

								This game plays the way X-Wing or Tie Fighter would (hopefully) play if remade today. Highly intuitive and responsive controls, clean flow through the UI and fun mission design make this game great. In particular the display of craftsmanship and attention to detail put it far ahead of its competition. This is an incredible piece of work in its own right, and I can hardly believe it was made by a single developer.			"

								I'm only four mission in, but I'm enjoying this game emmensely so far. The controller scheeme is just right, responsive and not too complex or too simple. The tactical focus of the game really shines through, and I love the map feature on each level. The difficulty and bonus objectives seem just right as well, I have enjoyed multiple playthoughs of each of the early levels on multiple difficulty settings, asnd I appreciate how higher difficulty levels are achieved, the scenarios change somewhat, as opposed to simply tweaking weapon damage and such. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys tactical shooters and space games.			"

								Mouse and keyboard control is a pain, wildly inconsistent damage model (point blank shots on targeted enemies weren't connecting while long range hail mary shots with the same weapon seemed to melt them) tutorial teaches you virtually nothing, and I failed the second mission at least half a dozen times due to being unable to find the damn escape vector - which you would expect to be fairly obvious - after a completing a mission and ended up getting torn apart by the flagship.Might be fun in VR where you can actually look around, but this game is NOT for standard mouse and keyboard PC play.

												Maybe Im missing something - Summary is its boring. Choose a map sector, attack or defend ships, when done get out before indestructable ship arrives.I played this for an hr hoping it would get better, but it didnt of course. After every mission I thought like I hadnt accomplished anything. Even after I destoryed the main objective. Music I turned off real quick as it added nothing to the atmosphere. Overall sound was a let down and it made me feel like I was playing with a tv strapped to my face rather than VR. The cockpit I only looked at a couple times as it seemed like I didnt need to and it served no purpose. Graphics are ok I suppose. X52 was ok too. I thought at the start great ELITE with a goal. How wrong was I.			"

								I have been super hyped about this game for more than a year but the reality is super disappointing. Continual hangs make the game unplayable in VR. The developer has proposed a workaround (disable VR and use DX9 mode) but that only reduces the problem: it still hangs frequently. The HUD is hard to use and not very pretty, and the sound design is awful. Important voice messages from your wingmen are muffled and almost inaudible.The developer changed the way the one remaining game mode works shortly before release, and the gameplay feels lacklustre as a result. It's more like an arcade shooter than a tactical experience, but without the visceral rewards that the best arcade games offer.			"

								This is a very pretty game, and the sound design is fantastic. But it expects that you already know how to play it, gives virtually zero feedback and swings between ludicrously easy (early levels on lower difficulties) and basically impossible (mid-game levels).- There is very little feedback for motion or speed.- There is very little feedback when you get hit- The UI contains very little visual feedback for anything- Weapons feel completely anemic- The upgrade system has zero explanation- The tutorial explains the absolute basics on how to fly and nothing else- The tactical view is never really explained- Orders are too vague to be of any use- You are repeadely punished with reinforcements because ""a ship escaped"". This happened multiple times when I was following the only ship left alive- It's often really hard to find out what you're actually supposed to do in a mission+ It's pretty+ The sound design is mostly very good+ Did I mention it's pretty?

								If you want to play in VR or with a controller that is not the XBOX controller, don't get this game.  Don't even try VR WITH a joystick.  You can't even get past menus!It's been awhile but they have simply not fixed the menu problems.  They have recently overhauled the input system but it takes an inordinate amount of time to bind to the tons of buttons for a very simple arcade space game.  If you must play, get an XBOX controller, or try to fly with mouse and keyboard.  And don't bother with VR.If they ever fix this, I'll change my review.  If... ever... they fix it.			"

								This was going to be the ""killer app"" for VR in my book... well, that was before Star Citizen and Elite (yes, that's how long its been in development). It was going to have a dynamically generated campaign with infinite rouge-like content and fleet management. Instead, we got 14 canned missions, some which can be completed in around 3 minutes...I'm not totally sad about it though, because to my great surprise, even though it looks fantastic, it feels... ""off""... at least in VR. Something is not right about either the scale, or the design of the cockpit and environments. Gameplay also feels ""off"" somehow. Perhaps it's the fact that you are flying a spaceship with a gamepad. It doesn't officially support other controllers, and it is very difficult to remap to a stick and still feel that you have a playable game.I will play more, but so far, this has been my biggest gaming disappointment since Godus.

								I've followed this for years on the forums and even bought the enemy starfighter poster. Bottom line It's just damn unsatisfying to play.The story is barebones (click, click, click I'm in game - don't know why I'll just read the objectives).The ships are paper thin, even a slight nudge will kill you.Combat is weak - can't dodge shots in any way just wait for them to hit you and when they do there is little feedback until you die.Sound is muddy, which is stylistic but conveys no actual information. Again it's up to you to read the briefing and play it by ear.Nothing has any permanence - fail a mission? Doesn't matter hit replay. Lose a ship, doesn't matter try a previous mission on a higher difficulty. Grind to unlock until you win.If I could get a refund I would.			"

												As a Spacesim fan buying this after i got my VR was a no brainer.But in the end I refunded it mainly because of two reasons.1) The options for the controls are very simple and lacking. I like me some very complicated control schemes in my Space-Sim and this game just provides the absolute basics.2) Number 2. and the real reason for the refund was the max resolution in VR mode.It's not even near what the HMDs actually can render on their screens and because of this the game becomes a blurry mess, especially in the faster paced parts of gameplay.Normally i wouldn't care that much about the resolution on the game. But space + blurry mess + VR = eyestrain.It was basically impossible for me to endure for longer periods of time and is a problem i don't have in a comparable game like Elite:Dangerous that gives you more freedom with your GFX settings.

								Hold off until they can do some tuning. One quickly encounters enemies that are ultra aware, unerringly firing upon all targets no matter which direction they're facing. Such enemies may even fly in pairs, simultaneously engaging targets (your spacecraft) behind and in front of them, making any victory plain dumb luck rather than any kind of tactical or skillful achievement.There's plenty of promise here but it's painfully clear that this game is in early, early access.

												This game is written using Unity and Rewired (an adavnced inout system for Unity) and thus should be able to handle any joystick setup. Unfortunately the implementation within this game has a flaw in that it will not save the joystick assignments even though they work while playing the game but not after a reload. So that is why it now states it supports only gamepads. I swear these programmers today seem to have a lot of problems with joysticks (most don't even own one).

								I'd like to recommend this game, the dev is active responding to people's problems etcand the game has some promise.    Sadly the cockpit design needs a rework since the scale is wonky which breaks immersion. If you were sitting on the seat in real life you would not be able to see over the dashboard, which results in a rather bizzare requirement to recentre the HMD whilct sitting up, then you can see over the dashboard but you appear to be a couple of feet above the chair, The first mission, well I just flew about binding keys to the X52, I received no AI messages at any point telling me what I needed to do, no enemies fired at me, and to be honest it seemed a bit samey with some nonsensical radio chatter going off in the background. I was not well directed as to my purpose.Me and this game got off on the wrong foot, it's £14 . For that cash, simple things like the issues I instantly came acrosss and wasted my time with shouldn't really be there. Refunded till it's fixed			"

												I'll start this off by saying that I was ready to give this a ""not recommended"" rating BEFORE I found out the the missions often change completely when attemting a new difficulty level. It was a pretty big letdown when, after around 2 hours of playing the game, I had reached and completed the final mission.After finding that there was actually quite a bit more to do I was much less disappointed, but I still feel that the game was mcuh too short for it's own good (and pricepoint).The game itself is pretty fun, and gets downright satisfying as you get into the groove of commanding your units and begin picking apark frigates and capships.I would definitely recommend House of the Dying Sun to any space sim fans, but unless you absolutely need the game NOW to wait for a sale, as the main game is still quite short.

								I own 22 VR games on Steam.  The descripotion of this game says VR Support HTC Vive and Oculus Rift.  However, this game does NOT offer an Oculus Rift selection, only SteamVR.  For some reason, I cannot get SteamVR to work on this one game.  I wish it has an Oculus Rift setting selection as well, as the game looks pretty awesome in 2D.			"

												There are a few things that i didn't like with the game. It's laughable short. (you could finish it and get the refund short) And as a starfighter like game, that you can only fly the one type of starfighter also feels very limited. But i do nominate the WHOOOOAAAAA, DUDE  award for the ending.			"

												Jump in, ""Avenge the emperor"", Die, Repeat. At first at least... This game is a great ""pick up and play"" space game. No complex controls, just pure, refined space combat action. The common Tie Fighter meets homeworld description is a good start but it's worthy of deeper exploration.Also, it's amazing in VR.So it's a must own for fans of the genre and VR users alike.  "

The pressure to get out before the capship arrives and blows you away is just intense!  Performance is fantastic too, playing in 2K on a gtx 580 machine is quite a miracle.  Actually, it's got a bit of a Starblade vibe which takes me back to the days of lockins at the arcade....			"

												This Game is great on so many levels but so short and it has so much potential in my view, the mysterious story, the grafix, the riveting gameplay, and for the ♥♥♥♥ing love of GOD... I love DRIFT, in my opinion it makes everything seem so ♥♥♥♥ing easy, like jeez. There are a good few upgrades to have you play the way you want. Also the orbital thingy is pretty neat, it gives the game a good strategy aspect. Pls give this a game a go if you like space shooters. Great concept. AND DONT BUY FULL PRICE, its not worth paying 20 dollars in my opinion compared to other game. Overall this game kinda had me in an emotional spot at the end because... you'll see.			"

								This is the closest I've seen a space sim post-90s nail the fundamentals perfected by my old favourites like TIE Fighter and Wing Commander. All the modern touches they've added, from the gorgeous graphics and Homeworld-meets-Warhammer 40K atmosphere to the light tactical overlay and non-existent load times make this such an easy sim to get into. The features and content are understandably light for the asking price so fence-sitters may just want to wait for an official release.			"

								House of the Dying Sun is really sharp spacefighter game with RTS elements. The atmosphere is very engaging and the sound design reminds me of Battlestar Galactica. I'm not playing it with VR, but I'm sure it's great that way too. I was worried about the keyboard controls for the game since I play a number of spacesims, but the controls are solid. The game pad controls are great, and I'd use those if I could manage to keep the batteries in my controller from dying. The great thing about the game is the length of missions. It really is designed for short sessions and you constantly feel like you're under preassure. You really do feel like a rebel pilot raiding your enemies. It's a great game. If you like space sims, then just stop thinking about it and by the game. The price point just makes it all the better. I'd honestly pay more for it.The only thing I wish it had was a co-op mode.

								What a fascinating hybrid!I enjoy how combat strongly favors tactics over thumb-skill by having weapons of all types strongly lock onto targets when in range and within angle. Adding to that the ability to pause the game and examine the situation on the tactical-map is also quite excellent, as that supports depth being added to the game (eg. stronger  shield/armor/countermeasure considerations), such as explicitly commanding your long-range units to disable a ship's engines so the slower craft can catch up. There's also fun details such as most ship shielding being large enough that brave fighters can actually fly through and directly hammer on the hull (eg. with the shotgun), which adds neat ""seeing the whites of their eyes"" experiences.The time-pressure on each scenario (in the form of a capital ship always hunting you down) is also quite interesting, as it means each attempt on a level is both short (success or failure), and feels like a puzzle whenever your current armada is well-matched to the current difficulty (each scenario has three difficulties for replayability).On a side note, I'm also very thankful for the flat-shaded graphical style, both for the Homeworld-nostalgia (which is quite substantial), but also to make sure this game plays smoothly in VR. After having Elite Dangerous never be 100% consistent for staying above 90 fps, it was great to see Dying Sun's focus on gameplay over detailed graphics pay off.			"

								So, I played the original homeworld back in the day, along with the sequels.  I loved the atmosphere of those games and always wondered what it would be like to be in the battle instead of directing it from Fleet Command in the mother ship.  House of the Dying Sun gives you a glimpse into what playing Homeworld from the first-person perspective of a fighter-jock might be like.  And, for that I give this game a hearty Hells Yeah!I hope that the dev does not stop here.  There is so much more that can be done with this IP.  I can see being able to work your way up from fighter-jock to an admiral commanding a massive capital ship.There may be some who will balk at the price, but I felt like $20 was perfectly fair considering the amount of attention the devs gave this game.  It is obvious that the creators put some heart and soul into this game, but they didn't have the resources to make it a AAA title with awesome cut scenes and celebrity voice talent.My message to the devs is this, ""don't sit on this IP too long, you've got a winner here!""

								Very good space fighter/space tactics game;In House of the Dying Sun, you fly missions to defend a falling empire. In a sequence of story-missions, you achieve your objectives in two ways:1. Macro-management: command ships from a 3D overview map; send them to attack, bomb, kamikaze or defend. This overview is key in all but the very first missions2. Take command of fighters to do attack runs yourselfBoth are implemented in a graphically simple, but cohesive way. Switching between these modes keeps things fresh.Outside of the tactical component, there is also a strategic component that lets you select missions and upgrade your fleet. This is servicable, and certainly not the focus of the game.While the game is ""Early Access"", is still feels complete.I highly recommend House of the Dying Sun to everybody.			"

								House of the Dying Sun is a high paced, action packed series of well crafted missions placing you in the cockpit of a star fighter from which you can direct the actions, eventually, of a fleet of ships. Each mission is played within a pretty tight time limit, and you have more than enough to cope with within the 5 or so minutes each run of a mission lasts. This is helped immeasurably by the music which sets the tone and gets the pulse racing before you've even fired off a single shot. If you crave a solid space combat game that you can play either in a long run, or even for the occasional quick blast, with plenty of replayability House of the Dying Sun is a great entry in the genre with it’s own clever take on proceedings.

								This game is awesome.This is a tactical* space fighter sim game that has be polished to a mirror shine. The sounds are amazing and tactile, the visual look of the game is evocative and the gameplay is just totally spot on. The writing is sparse, but a great example of ""show, don't tell"" and is entirely fitting with the game's theme.*tactical in the sense that you need to think about what you are doing and can juggle commanding a small force at the same time as fighting.The campaign is a fun, short romp into the game mechanics with a few nice set pieces that should only take you a few hours to finish on even the hardest difficulty. However then you'll be well prepared to face the challenge mode which is a timed wave defense game that'll need the best of your abilities and guile to survive.Your ""Executor"" class interceptors that you pilot in the game are apex predators that are a delight to fly and can pack a varied arsenal, from space-shotguns to a three-pack of micro-thermonuclear bombs.I've only been playing with a M+KB on a laptop and it's very controllable and fun, it definitely doesn't need a game-pad, joystick or VR headset (though that will make it even more fun!).So, press start (or rather, ""add to cart"") to start fighting enemy star fighters. You won't regret it!			"

Early Access Review
								Hoo boy, was this game a pleasant surprise.  I grabbed it during the 2016 Summer Sale and didn't regret it.  What's most surprising is the amount of polish House of the Dying Sun has.  It runs smoothly, controls perfectly (with my PS4 controller, that is), and feels like a complete product, not an Early Access game.  The gameplay is lighting quick.  With a couple of exceptions, each battle is framed as a hit-and-run mission.  You're encouraged to only focus upon completing the primary objective, dealing with immediate threats in the way, completing the bonus objective if time permits, and then successfully warping out before the enemy Flagship arrives.  Thus, battles are finished within less than 10 minutes.  Trying to clear out every single enemy provides no bonus and is a foolish idea in most situations, especially since you're often heavily outgunned and won't have any effective options to deal with the Flagship until the last couple of missions.You're encouraged to use the tactical view and give orders to the starships, doubly so on the higher difficulties.  This is because while you do have the edge in firepower, your fleet mostly consists of 'glass cannons' and will easily be wiped out by the superior numbers and capital ships the enemy often receives each mission.  It's at this point that you'll begin to get a strong Homeworld vibe from the game, because the tactical view looks and controls much like Homeworld's, and it's indeed possible to flank enemies from above or below - this is three-dimensional space, after all.  Furthermore, each time a ship surivives a mission, it gains experience.  It's most notable with the Interceptors, who will be more intelligent during bombing runs, deal with enemy fighters on their tails more effectively, and dodge incoming fire - something the standard rank Interceptors kinda suck at. The sound design is EXCELLENT.  The developer chose to go for a more realisitc muffled audio for everything outside of the fighter, and allowing the player to hear all of the subtle noises inside the cockpit, including the pilot's breathing and background radio chatter.  The few times you hear a loud bang become notable and worrisome, because it means that you suffered a direct hit and may see the damage in the form of cracking glass or loose parts on the exterior hull.  The music  and it's drums only help to add to the game.However, the biggest complaint that everyone else has - that the game is too short - is indeed true.  Chances are that if you were to play only the easy mode you'll end up beating the game in 3 - 4 hours.  Granted it took me longer to beat the game due to playing on the normal and hard difficulties, not to mention unlocking all of the upgrades, and finally trying out the survival mode, (hence why I have 12 hours on record), but that's still not very much.  And it's not because the game is incomplete either - with the recent addition of the survival mode, we're probably not going to see much else added before the game is finally considered a finished product.NOTE: I don't own a VR headset, so I can't give any critique on that aspect of the game.TL;DR?  Get it if you're more into quality over quantity, and more a fan of the tactical dogfighting part of space combat sims versus the slow, grindy style of Elite: Dangerous.			"

Early Access Review
								Very good space fighter/space tactics game;In House of the Dying Sun, you fly missions to defend a falling empire. In a sequence of story-missions, you achieve your objectives in two ways:1. Macro-management: command ships from a 3D overview map; send them to attack, bomb, kamikaze or defend. This overview is key in all but the very first missions2. Take command of fighters to do attack runs yourselfBoth are implemented in a graphically simple, but cohesive way. Switching between these modes keeps things fresh.Outside of the tactical component, there is also a strategic component that lets you select missions and upgrade your fleet. This is servicable, and certainly not the focus of the game.While the game is ""Early Access"", is still feels complete.I highly recommend House of the Dying Sun to everybody.			"

								Lot of potential here, someone compared it to Homeworld and it got me interested off the bat.  I really enjoyed it.  Ran through all the missions at least once in the first day I got it, but it has a ton of potential.  If there was one thing to complain about is that it is very short.  I hope for more missions or something to add more replayability.  Nothing that I saw to knock it down from having 5 star potential here.			"

								This is an excellent space sim. The action is fast paced. Your foes are cunning and vicious. The switch between strategy and dogfighting is seamless and allows you much more control than even some of the finest sims out there. How many times in a game have you wanted to tell your allied AI to stop attacking something they just can't handle? Well now you can.There are some obvious influences. I beleive the project was originally a modified version of homeworld so it's no surprise to find that same cell shaded aesthetic in play. The music and atmosphere take a que from the BSG reboot. But there are plenty of references stuffed into this little gem of a game. I can't speak to the VR support of the game, but I would imagine that the current generation lends itself well to the idea of being in a cockpit. The one problem is its length. I'm about 4 hours in and I'd say i've done most of what the game currently offers. We're apparently getting a wave defence mode of some sort so that should help with game length a bit. Still, as it is, I would absolutely recommend buying it for the gameplay and immersion.			"

								As others have said, this is a short game, even if you replay the missions on the higher difficulty levels (which is where it really shines IMO). However, this short game is hewn from a solid block of pure awesome. It is basically a bite-size version of Homeworld with the addition of pitch-perfect first person piloting (there is a Homeworld-esque overview and you can also issue commands from the cockpit of your fighter). In VR, it really is something special; you can tell the developer put a lot of time into making everything feel just right, from the flight model to the surprisingly deep and complex soundscape.I'm not sure what it's like outside VR; I'll probably never find out. IMO, if you have a VR headset, this is a transcendently good experience and a no-brainer purchase.			"

								Really great game, looks amazing, very immersive, and really fun in vr. The space battles in this game are probably the best I have ever experienced, other franchises could learn a thing or two here. The only problems I had with this game are the small amount of content, and when playing in vr there is an excessive amount of screen-shake, especially in menus; it could be a headset tracking issue (which I haven't had previously), but i do not know. This screen-shake made me motion sick a lot quicker and was very uncomfortable, I hope they can fix this before the main release.			"

								This is a game I've been waiting for since I saw it at PAX several years ago. The mix of Homeworld inspired Aesthetics with classic Freespace style combat is something i've been dreaming about since I was a teen. When I met Mike Tipul and figured out he was working on this game essentially alone I knew it was ambitious even with such a long dev cycle.I am happy to report he did it. He really did it.This game is small, tight, and satisfying. For a single person to do even half this good of a game would be impressive. As a game developer myself I cannot even imagine how much work went into getting all the details right.This will seem like a strangely myopic thing to focus in on but consider the menus.In indie games menu and UI design are normally not at the forefront. you just don't have the development time, money, or expertise to excel in all areas. So, there are bound to be some rough edges because you need to polish the core gameplay loop. But damn if this game doesn't have menus that just *FEEL* good. Good feeling things you often don't notice. These are so good i do.The campaign is concise and very tight. The aesthetic and story remind me of Homeworld from the opposite side, which is full of classic 1970s Dune-esque themes. Rather than glorifying revenge this game feels fascinated in how or why we justify our violence to ourselves. Even if this isn't the core focus of the game you get the sense the developer was thinking about those ideas.One of the most impressive things is how the game keeps the energy up over the 5-6 hours it takes to beat the campaign once through. A lot of older arcade style space combat games - x-wing, freespace, starlancer - had definitely ""filler"" missions. Those would be the missions with lots of gaps between combat encounters, often with very challenging elements late in the mission, that were a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to repeat if you failed near the end. This game has no filler. Each mission is a unique and challenging combat encounter that requires thoughtful use of both tactics and dogfighting skill to execute successfully.One of the ways the experience is improved is the short load times. On my computer, at least - SSD, i7920 - the missions load and restart exceptionally fast. This means if you fail because of a mistake in your tactics you can restart fast enough that the lesson from that mistake is fresh in your mind. It is really hard to get load times down in Unity so props to him for that piece of polish.I don't know if this was a side-effect or an intent from the beginning but this game runs really well in VR even on slower machines. The simple aesthetic combined with good use of simple color means the actual effects and models are pretty slim on memory requirements. Despite this it looks absolutely fantastic on my DK2. Not realistic in any sense but stunning in that way that, again, reminds me of Homeworld's use of painted textures on simple models. The first time I flew by a frigate at close range it looked just like a plastic model from a 70s sci-fi film.And that is rad.I would say the only way I could see this game easily improved upon is the customizability. I hope it was designed in such a way that would allow to build out a campaign creator toolset if Mike makes enough to justify the time. I would love to see custom campaigns or new player-created in this game. "

								This game is great mix of arcade space sim combat with Homeworld strategy. You can freely switch between controlling each of your ships manually. Controls are smooth and combat is fun.I have to especially commend the music. As a Battlestar Galactica fan - I LOVE IT. It is very energetic and goes greatly with the flow of the combat.During the campaign your ships get experience, you can upgrade them and you get various rewards for missions like new ships or weapons. This keeps the game fresh and there is always something new to look forward to. Which is an important feature many current VR games are missing.I had no VR motion sickness despite doing some heavy maneuvering while personally controlling my fighters and quick camera angle switching in strategy mode.Only issue I had was a lot of dropped frames and stutter (I have 980Ti), but changing Power management mode from Adaptive to Prefer maximum performace in Nvidia Control Panel (thanks for the tip dev!) solved that and I can play on all settings maxed no problem (with a dropped frame here and there, not noticeable).It is one of the few VR games I see myself coming back to frequently.

								This is a good space shooter. I know this game is in development, so I'll keep this brief for now. This is a game perfect for a quick sitting, and enjoy a bit of space battle without much complications. And for that, this game is fun. However, if there is not much else to this game in final form.. then I will be a bit more worried. Because there is very little story to this, and longer sittings will quickly be tedious (again, in its current form) But mostly because the missions are not very complicated, or long for that matter. Then again, I have not played through everything there is to play yet. But this far in, I doubt it will change much. Once this is released in final form, I will have another deeper look at this. The graphics are OK, a bit like Homeworld (a game I think they take quite a bit of inspiration from) But it is still too early to saying more on that. Good game though, I recommend it! Even in its current form. I just have a nagging feeling there is not much more to it. I hope this is not the case.			"

								Fun but short game.Pros: VR Support is great, tactical view in VR was cooler than expected.Cockpit design feels cool.Flight controls are tight, I appreciate the addition of the Drift button and functionalityOrdering your Capital Ships to take down your enemies capital ships is satisfying.cool visual designCons:No body in cockpit breaks immersionthere are no lasting consequences to losing ships, so there is no incentive to abandon mission if things aren't going wellAI is weak, enemies will chase you down, but your fleet follows your orders to a T, there is no sense of human fault anywhere in the teammates or enemies. They are too predictable.Limited weapon loadouts, and unlimited resources when outfitting a missionNo real need to use tactical view during combat, most scenarios can be conquered from just the cockpitUI elements are occasionally obscured by environmental elements, creates the weird effect of a distant asteroid being closer than screen elements.Suggestions:Add an ""Ironman"" mode that will give weight to losing ships, especially capital ships. Those things should be expensive, and weighty losses in the gameConstrain the budget for each mission at each difficulty. You shouldn't be able to bring your frigate with you into the first level's warlord difficultyMake sure your UI and Environmental camera layers are setup correctly. Add a body to the cockpit with a hand on the stick, it gives VR players a sense of being there. the body doesn't even have to move.I like the quick scenarios that make up these missions, it would be cool to have a scenario editor or something that would allow the player to create and share challenges with friends.I am probably the only person that wants this, but I would like to be able to fly the capital ships, I know they are slow and big, but a first person view from the helm of the bridge, and controlling the fleet from the true seat of power would be cool.I know this was way too long, but the game was fun, and pretty polished for a early access game.

								Great game. Honestly for 20 bucks it has what I expect in terms of $ to value.What's so great?SpaceGunsExplosions Instant actionAnything not great?People complaining about the length of the game.OK this game costs less than a trip to the theater and last about twice as long. On the other hand, I did enjoy it and wished it was longer. Guess I will go after all of the achievements.For me, the Tannhäuser Gate level, compared to the rest, is overly difficult. This needs to be balanced out, preferably by making the others a bit more challenging.Conclusion: Great game, hope to see more from this dev, and really hope that if this is the end of this game the devs open it up to the community to build levels or that they develop some more as a dlc... my wallet is waiting.

								I love this game. The cleanliness of the graphics through to controllability during in-flight modes, make it worth playing. I did find when hitting the 'D' button to control your ship prior to starting the mission, resulted in some lag by taking the user to the motion sensor setting. Eventually, the mission then started. Unfortunately, you're a bit annoyed by then. The latest update seems to have reduced the lag. Fingers crossed. That's about the only negative so far in this game. The in-game graphics are just as good as the preview trailers. The sound and musical score reminds me of watching one of the original Battlestar Galactica episodes - one of my all-time favourite sci-fi series. The weapons load-out screen through to coordinating attacks with wingmen are smooth and gives the user an excellent sense of immersion. You have to check out the main menu. It's like watching your very own space battle in VR with blast fire and missiles flying all around you - I sometimes forget that I haven't started the game yet. If you are a hard core space fighter sim fanatic, perhaps the game might be too easy. If you're a sci-fi enthusiast (I'm definitely in that genre), then you'll enjoy this game.			"

Early Access Review
								First, a disclaimer. This game has only been released early access for a few days. Most models are simple, few skins appear even close to complete, and there is a balancing issue or two. That being said, I just bought it and played straight through the campaign until complete, loving every second of it. There is an element of realism, even without VR, that you just don't see as often as you should. It's quick, fast, and dirty dogfighting, ordering Capital ships around, and generally turning other vessels into tiny pieces. I could stand to see alot more of this, and some co-op would be amazing. Don't worry about another campaign, just allow a buddy or two into the current one, at one of the higher difficulties. Without going off the deep end with this, I love this game. Great work, and I've already gifted a second copy to a buddy of mine.			"

								As others have said, this is a short game, even if you replay the missions on the higher difficulty levels (which is where it really shines IMO). However, this short game is hewn from a solid block of pure awesome. It is basically a bite-size version of Homeworld with the addition of pitch-perfect first person piloting (there is a Homeworld-esque overview and you can also issue commands from the cockpit of your fighter). In VR, it really is something special; you can tell the developer put a lot of time into making everything feel just right, from the flight model to the surprisingly deep and complex soundscape.I'm not sure what it's like outside VR; I'll probably never find out. IMO, if you have a VR headset, this is a transcendently good experience and a no-brainer purchase.			"

								I enjoyed this game for what it was and reading the reviews I didn't expect more than a few hours of entertainment.I dont have a VR headset so missed out on that aspect, though I did pick up this game to support VR developers.Hopefully by the time this game in no longer early access I'll manage to get a headset and play it again.The game is very short but the gameplay is solid and fun.  Being able to fly a fighter but command capital ships works well and the flight physics is spot on.I can see a lot of potential here and look forward to seeing it develop.  The foundation is there, it's just needs more content and perhaps a compelling story to add some depth.The upgrade system is interesting but needs a lot of work as I didn't find myself wanting any of the upgrades, though it's nice to see that it's there and could be more meaningful as the game develops.

								Been following this game for a LONG time.  Loved the design and aesthetics of it, and the gameplay is one I've loved for decades.  I've made my way through most of the missions, but am going back and doing them at higher levels to get the ""gold"" so I can buy all the upgrades for my ships.  The game starts out with you being a lone wolf, but soon adds support ships to take some of the heat off you while giving you some fire support needed in some of the later and harder missions.  Scales up nicely, never felt overwhelming.  The lore is pretty neat too, but you have to investigate it.  This isn't a long, in depth single player game, but it is very fun.  I have heard that there is going to be an added mode (wave clear) on release, but don't purchase it for that.  Purchase it because you like the gameplay, the visuals, and the feeling.  It might not last as long as an X game, but it's very well suited for when you have that dogfighting itch.			"

								Really great game overall, one of the best I've played in a while. House of the Dying Sun has a lot of fun mechaninics that I feel could be developed into some really expansive content in the future. That's my only complain; the game is great fun throughout all the missions, but there are only 14 of them, and they all only last over a couple minutes. Right now, It's short, and leaves me wanting much more. The atmosphere of the whole game is dark, and although there's not alot of outright lore, through descriptions and etc, the game gives off a deep and powerful vibe. It reminds me alot of the Red Rising series. It has a ton of strategic value to it, but you're only able to ever play as the Intercepter-class ship, and the fleet could use more expanding. Also, I think it would be cool if we were able to rename the ships ourselves, instead of having random titles assigned.			"

Early Access Review
								###   TLDR;   ###A brilliant, immersive and intense game that checks all the boxes of the Genre while adding its own flavor. If you like liked any Space Combat Flight Simulator ever, go and purchase this game and you will have fun.###    DRM    ###At the time this review goes up, 12 June 2016, the game is DRM-free and can be launched and played without Steam (http://steam.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_DRM-free_games). Let's get on with the review now shall we?###    FULL REVIEW - NO SPOILERS   ###House of the Dying Sun asks of you to beat around 15 hand-crafted levels / scenarios by piloting your lethal fightercraft through enemy formations and flak-fire, destroying opposing interceptors and capital ships. The scenarios are short, intense and well crafted, in short they are fun and replayable. Every single one prioritizes player agency and gameplay, this is a game about you beating the challenge the level designer has prepared for you.In terms of gamplay, HotDS can probably best be compared to Tie-Figher's or Freespace 2's style of space combat but like stated before, that is a rough comparison. There are different flavors of capital ships, there are sentry guns and cargo containers and enemy fighters in between and it is your job to figure out how to best use your available assets to achieve your objectives. Situational awareness is key.To this end (and to teach you these skills), the game comes equiped with a tactical pause mode in which you can freely give orders and assess the situation. And in contrast to said Tie-Fighter (or Wing Commander Prophecy), the feature is fully integrated and controls very well. Make no mistake though, this is a flight simulator and not an Homeworld-style RTS and you will not triumph without throwing your skills into the breach!You will equip your fighter, and later your escorting capital ships, with different variants of weapons and equipment such as shields or better (but slowing) armor. The vast majority of these feels useful and well balanced, supporting different playstyles.Flying and controls are spot-on and very precise, I personally preferred the gamepad and ignored both my Keyboard (which I use for Freespace 2 and the old Wing Commanders) and my HOTAS (which is my method of choice for every other flight sim bar the ones in the previous brackets). You feel very much in control of everything that is going on.Graphically, the game is very beautiful and I can only imagine that is looks brilliantly on a VR Headset (will purchase the next generation in one or two years). The ship models are surprisingly detailed will background noise such as asteroids are kept flat and uninteresting to control your focus.Sound design is outstanding, the same goes for the music. Think a more intense version of the reimagined Battlestar Galactica design and you are spot on, as far as I am informed the composer of the now defunct ""Beyond the Red Line"" Battlestar Galactica Total Conversion is on board here. Everything here serves both its purpose and its artistic goal perfectly, the sound is actually so incredibly brilliant it might just outshine all the other things that the game does...Being so scenario-focused, the game has no traditionall-told narrative to speak of. What is present however is written exceptionally well and the credits reveals that one of my favorite weaver of English words, the great Seth Dickinson, was involved here. To discuss what is present would already be a spoiler, so I leave it at ""do not expect a story driven campaign, but rest assured you will not miss it"". And note that this comes from a die-hard single player story enthusiast, hence what is present compensates :-)I refuse to add anything to the usual fuzz regarding the completely senseless ""how much playtime"" discussion. You should only judge an experience based on its overall quality. This is a very good game in all regards and achieves the rare feat of both appealing to the very hardcore audiance and being accessible enough to be able to teach less experienced players how to a) have fun and b) get better at it.Being in Early Access, every review should also state something about the technical side of things: In regards to stability and performance, everything present was already very promising. I had very little problems and zero crashes. In fact, I have only nitpicks at all, namely a very minor performance hiccup at the start of the last mission (game probably has to load many ships at the same time there) and sometimes a audio-crackle when entering another craft's shield bubble. And THAT IS IT. Lets face it, every triple-A game released today has way way WAY more issues at launch.Judging from the forums and already released updates, the developer is currently responding to all reported issues at an absolutely alarming rate...    I have no idea if Mike Tipul currently sleeps at all. Here is hoping he does.###    SUMMARY   ###This is an outstanding release, both in terms of actual game design and content, as well as in terms of polish and supporting it.SUPERCONDUCTOR CARAPACE FLUSHED WITH CONDENSED SUPERFLUID HELIUM.QUANTUM STASIS SYSTEM.ONE SOON-TO-BE-ENTERTAINED OCCUPANT.BREAKABLE SEAL.PURCHASE GAME TO OPEN.

												I've never written a review on Steam before, but I liked this game so much I figured now was a great time to start.This game is pure fun. From the very first mission, you're thrown immediately into battle and the action never ceases throughout the campaign. The only thing negative I have to say about this game is that it's made me want to buy a VR headset! Controls feel very smooth and intuitive on an XBone controller, and I appreciated the Homeworld-like feel of the tactical map. Drift mode also blew my mind—there's something immensely satisfying about flipping around backwards without changing trajectory and shooting down a pursuer. I do agree with others that the campaign itself is short—it took about 5 hours to get through the first time around, and I just completed all achievements in 20 hours. Still, at $20 retail, it's tough to fault a game that provided that much entertainment for just $1/hour. Knowing what I know about the game now, I'd have gladly paid double that.The only question left is: when's the sequel coming out?			"

												At 4.2 hours into this game while writing this review, I can say that I've done all that there is to really do in this game. The only things I have yet to do are finish the hard and expert level difficulties of all the missions, but really they are not much different from the previous difficulties.It’s a mixed bag for this game, and I’ll list why below. I’m going to recommend it because I’m finding it sort of difficult to find any decent VR games that aren’t just a 3rd person perspective camera with movement linked to your head. Cockpit games just have the edge in VR.PROS:- A decent VR (Played with the Rift) cockpit space fighting game where you command a growing squad- The combat is good too, good pacing and you’re able to change out your weapons and ship upgrades for slightly different play styles- Supports the X-55 Rhino Saitek joysticks, though as usual you will need to figure out the mapping. ( I actually ended up using the Xbox One controller, which worked perfectly)CONS:- Lack of content. Probably the biggest downfall of this game, there just simply isn't enough content. I was able play the game to what I'm considering completion in 4 hours.- The squad management screen can be annoying at times, when you're trying to cycle through your units and just can't seem to get the right unit selected.- While able to buy upgrades to get more stuff, once you get the first 5 upgrades, there really is no driving force to get the other ones other than preference or curiosity. I didn’t use any of them to beat the game and I rarely changed anything.			"

The controls are the best of any I have as well. It's very easy to maneuver without getting sick like I do in some of the others. I'd like to see a little more variety to the missions and some realistic looking astroids rather than the low-poly ones in the game. Highly recommended!			"

								I'm enjoying the game. I'll make a quick pros/cons list:Pros:-Looks good.-Runs great (all settings maxed using a GTX 980)-Sounds are cool.-Controls well with a gamepad (I haven't tried the kb/m yet)-Combat is fun overall.-Weapons are pretty fun.-Ships control predictably.-Newtonian drift mode so you can ""slide"" while you turn, which is cool.-Ship size and scale is pretty cool (big ships vs. little ships).-Dogfighting is what the game is built around.Cons:-Repetitive. Each mission feels basically the same. My biggest gripe, by far.-I've played through quite a few missions and have only upgraded two things, so feels a little grindy. To be fair, I am playing on the first ""star"" option of each mission, so lower rewards. It warns against going higher though if you're ""new to the game"".-The ship radar could use a little more color to help assist with not just where something is, but WHAT something is.-I have trouble finding the ""warp out"" point at the end of a level sometimes. Not sure if that's a bug, or if it is just something that doesn't show up on radar all the time.-By default, there doesn't appear to be any left/right/up/down (horizontal or veritcal) thrust, which seems really weird to be absent from a space flight game. I can pitch, roll and yaw, but not thrust up/down/left/right. Maybe it's in the controls somewhere, but by default it doesn't appear to be enabled unless I am missing something (using an Xbox 360 gamepad).I say it is worth the $20 if you like space dogfighter games. It's a well built game. The repetitive nature, for me, is the biggest down side of it. However, if you have VR (I do not), then I imagine this game is EASILY worth $20. I'm guessing it probably looks pretty amazing with VR, because it's not bad looking on a regular monitor. I give it a 7/10. If you like space dogfighter-type games, this is a good pick. "

Early Access Review
								This is the first space game I've ever played and I think it's great. I think I'm around halfway done (with little over two hours played), but I've only been playing on the lowest difficulty and depending on what occurs at higher difficulties I think will determine re-play-ability. I've read countless complaints on other games (Elite Dangerous) regarding text legibility and the text looks great in this and I haven't had any trouble reading it (note: using a Vive). The levels themselves (so far) are rather stagnant play-wise. It's centered around destroying a ship or two paired with a bonus for destroying something else. Once this is completed, warp out. I'm perfectly ok with this, but I do think more could definitely be added. I am not a huge fan of the cockpit itself simply because I don't find it super user-friendly or futuristic. Things I would personally like to see added:- A more futuristic cockpit (or just cockpit UI) since I feel like I'm looking at a 1940's doppler radar and then a little screen.- Destructible environments (ex: Asteroids if shot by a massive cannon don't just continue floating around)- Larger variance in missions (I am still 100% alright with current missions just being built on, but would be nice).- An open world set in this universe where I can kind of just fly around and run into whatever (would drastically change the game, but yeah).Also, for those who are wondering, the Steam Controller works wonderfully.

House of the Dying Sun is the best game I'd never heard ofThis space shooter hits all the right marks: The combat is solid, satisfying, and fun. The atmosphere is engaging, and the setting and story elements hit the balance of vague but not obtuse in an excellent manner, similar to the backstory of Homeworld. While we're drawing comparisons, yes, the art style evokes the Homeworld games (and is great), and it kinda feels like the space shooter version of Homeworld I never knew I wanted. Participating in fleet actions is fun, although I wish your AI-controlled fleet was a little more active, and the scale of combat is interesting. Instead of being able to be a one-man army in a strike craft like other games (here's lookin' at you, Freelancer), you will die if you're not careful. So will your fleet, although it's less ""aw hell, I messed up"" and more ""My frigate died? Why?"", which can cause some frustration, especially after your fleet gets loaded up with promotions which presumably make them more effective in combat, but isn't entirely clear.The biggest complaint I have with the game is a lack of depth - there's a 14-mission campaign mode with 1 optional bonus objective and 3 difficulty missions per mission, and only the Harbinger difficulty really evokes the space brawls of the 199X/200X space combat sims, at which point you're dipping your toes into the Dark Souls of space sims. Previous dev updates look like there might be a wave clear skirmish combat mode in the works, which will add a depth of replayability to the game.It's high praise to House of the Dying Sun that the biggest complaint I have is that I wish there was more of it. Follow this game closely as it evolves in Early Access and if you want an excellent spiritual successor to X-Wing/TIE Fighter, Freespace, Starlancer/Freelancer, and the like, this looks like the go-to game.

								The greatest space combat game since Freespace. Worth every penny. The campaign is short, but the challenge difficulties will keep me playing for longer. The action is fast and brutal. Failing missions and coming up with a better attack plan is part of the fun. Worth every penny.Pros: Great dogfighting mechanics, compelling and challenging campaign, good sound and music, excellent AI, pleasing visualsCon: Short campaignHere's hoping this gets some more love from the dev!

								Even in Early Access the game is polished, immersive and just downright feels awesome. I may have completed the game in < 3 hours, but I feel it was worth at least every cent. Probably more.If you enjoy dogfighting, homeworld, X-Wing or anything else this has been related to, I couldn't reccomend this more.			"

								This is an excellent space sim. The action is fast paced. Your foes are cunning and vicious. The switch between strategy and dogfighting is seamless and allows you much more control than even some of the finest sims out there. How many times in a game have you wanted to tell your allied AI to stop attacking something they just can't handle? Well now you can.There are some obvious influences. I beleive the project was originally a modified version of homeworld so it's no surprise to find that same cell shaded aesthetic in play. The music and atmosphere take a que from the BSG reboot. But there are plenty of references stuffed into this little gem of a game. I can't speak to the VR support of the game, but I would imagine that the current generation lends itself well to the idea of being in a cockpit. The one problem is its length. I'm about 4 hours in and I'd say i've done most of what the game currently offers. We're apparently getting a wave defence mode of some sort so that should help with game length a bit. Still, as it is, I would absolutely recommend buying it for the gameplay and immersion.			"

								Game feels absolutely fantastic, love the movement options offered by the drift mechanic and the GAP drive. Fighter customization has left me itching for something akin to Mechwarrior in starfighters now - I'd kill to be able to delve even deeper into outfitting a fleet and fine-tuning each ship for each mission. The bite-sized missions work very well - you're out to assassinate targets, being rewarded for being quick about it is a good feature. As others have said, the game is very short and the replay value is less than tremendous. The survival wave-clear in the challenge mode isn't enough to keep you coming back for long, the game could really stand to benefit from a level editor/workshop so other players can keep adding custom content to the game. The biggest complaint I have is that the game does so many things extremely well and there's just not ENOUGH of it all. All things considered, definitely worth my money, I'd encourage other people to give it a shot.			"

								I recommend this game if you're looking for a very tight, very polished but not overly long experience. The missions are fairly focussed, combat is great, fleet command is very nicely handled. The whole game just feels very well put together but...It definitely feels like it is lacking in content and is very short if all you're looking to do is go from A - B and finish the campaign. On low difficulty, you can easily complete all of the campaign missions in under 2 hours.This is adjusted for by having multiple difficulty levels for each mission which significantly increases the difficulty for each step up you go. This also increases the time it takes to complete each mission, which makes up for how short missions can be on lower difficulty ranks. If it were up to me, I would probably increase the health of all ships and rebalance everything to make the engagements more lengthy affairs.As mentioned, the fleet system is nice and the interface is very well done. The upgrade system is a bit underwhelming as there are some clearly better upgrades over others and some upgrades have such high purchase requirements that by the time you actually get the upgrade, you'll have basically had to do everything in the game thrice over already and might not even be inclined to keep playing.It's difficult to say whether £14.99 is worth it for this length of an experience, but I would verge on yes. If on sale then I would definitely pick it up.TL;DRGreat fun but very short.			"

								Do yourself a favor and play this on Harbinger difficulty. I'll explain why in a minute.I recommend this game for anyone who is looking for a quick fix for their space sim needs.If you're expecting an epic space opera, you might want to look elsewhere. The story that ties together everything is a little on the abstract side. Personally I thought it was intriguing. The developer has said there won't be any additional single-player content added in to expand on the story, which is a shame. I do hope that they come back to that eventually.Gameplay is excellent - if you're a veteran of space sims like Evochron, Elite, or the X series of games, you should feel right at home. Controls feel good, especially with a HOTAS, and TrackIR is supported so that adds quite a bit to the immersion factor. (I can only imagine what it's like with a VR headset.)The visuals are good too. I like the colorful backdrops and the game runs smoothly on my rig. There's an aspect to the game that I thought was fairly interesting as well, and that's the ability to command your ships individually by ""hotswapping"" between fighters and issuing orders to your capital ships in a way similar to Homeworld. It's not my preferred method (I like the radials because I can stay in the fight) but it might strike some people's fancy to switch between flight sim and strategy game.Now, the reason why I suggested playing on Harbinger difficulty: The game is short, the missions are straightforward, but they can be very brutal and therefore very satisfying if you play it on the highest difficulty. Some missions can be completed in a matter of two or three minutes (and that's on the long end of things) but that doesn't mean it's going to be easy. Some of them you'll have to white-knuckle all the way, lest your capital ships and supporting wingmen get annihilated. Trust me, you'll need them. This is especially true in the early stages of the game when it's just you and possibly one other interceptor. There's one mission in particular that gave me a lot of trouble for the sheer fact that I simply didn't have the firepower to take down the target before the enemy flagship arrived and started lighting me up. And I love that about the game - you really do feel like you're under the gun all the time and if you're not focused on achieving your primary objective, you're going to lose ships. Because of the ""warp out"" mechanic, it is entirely possible to get destroyed and failing the mission despite achieving the objectives. Happened to me a few times. So don't stick around if you're feeling the heat.All in all it's a pretty quick play. It's easy to dive into, easy to pick up, and it's a good bit of fun if you don't have a lot of time to sink into something meatier like Evochron or Elite.			"

								Executive summary: definately buy!After first level I was like meh...this is too easy and gonna go too quick...then after a few more levels I was like wow...this is actually way more fun than I expected for what I paid...can't wait to play that level again on harder.  Then I was like oh man...that was way too hard...gonna have to return to that later.   Finally with my whole fleet and upgrades done I truely became one with the universe's most terrifying starfighter.Fair amount of replayabilitiy with levels being fun to play on increasingly harder settings.  Realistic enough feeling controls, fun to control your fleet but nice it isnt required, big ships have targets for their different weapons which is cool.WISHLIST:-- levels need many more levels of harder difficulty.  The first few levels are a joke even on hardest. -- need 4x the levels.  Seems like it could be easy for devs to give us way more stories.  Just make up a few sentences for the senario of how enemies are protecting their lord for the drama and then randomly generate some groups of enemies.  Every lord should have a chain of prereq levels each encouraging different loadouts.-- Tutorial doesn't go over everything.  Took me a few missions to figure out how to change ships, control my other ships, queue up commands.-- asteroids look meh.  They should look a tiny bit better under ultra setting so they don't remind you its all fake.-- I want to play my non-fighter ships a little and doesn't seem possible. -- would be nice to be able to customize each similar ship in fleet differently (ie each fighter has different weapons) -- daily challenge should give you more information when you finally die.  It just restarts without rewarding you for holding out so long.-- long distance guns make you feel powerful when you one hit kill from across the map but are overpowered and take away from the fighting experience.  Should fire 4x faster, with 1/4 power of each shot, half the range to increase the drama.-- enemy ships should be way bigger, harder to kill at range and make it more easier/more clear you should target their weapons/shield generators to go down easier.  Big ships should have weak spots.-- i think it could be interesting to be able to allow more guns on the ship and be able to upgrade each one-- more types of weapons, missles, armor, shields, engines, drones and let me choose my type for each-- afterburner should recharge and have more disadvantage like draining shield power "

								I would recommend this game on a sale. 15 quid seems to be a little steep unless you're actually seeking a VR experience.

This is a good game but I personally think that it wasn't a great purchase and a little expensive. Don't play this game if you're looking for a space combat sim with a good story and a good length of content as misisions in this game are very VERY short but are, in fairness, enjoyable.			"

This is really a great game that delivers on a simple yet hard to achieve-premise it's going for.I love all kinds of space games, but as combat goes, this is my favorite along with Elite. The major difference being this is much more fast pace arcade like.If you have an VR headset, get this game asap! It's one of the best experiences out there.

								Played the entire game in VR (Vive). Ran fine for me on a 970, so no complaints there.Overall, solid stuff. Around 3-4 hours for the price. If that doesn't bother you then its an easy recommendation.Has a strong Homeworld feel to it, a solidly exectued aesthetic, and enjoyable - if fairly straightforward - fighter combat as the meat of the gameplay. Tactical layer adds something interesting to the overall mix and does a good job of making the battle larger than just your fighter's cockpit.For the VR aspect specifically, its a solid implementation. The whole game, including menus, works well and feels cohesive in the headset. Text and gauges are easily readable.Plot/story is thin, but perfectly servicable. The focus in that area is more about atmosphere and the feel of the world than it is about an explicitly told story. Works well for it is.The notable weakness of the game is its relatively short length. The missions can be repeated on harder difficulties (different configurations and more opponents, not just inflated health pools), which awards more unlock points. I repeated quite a few on the way to finishing the game. The missions themselves are fairly simple, contained tactical challenges, but statisfying nonetheless. In all it took me a little over 4 hours all up. Reasonable enough for the price, but a little more would have been appreciated.			"

								This is a good space shooter. I know this game is in development, so I'll keep this brief for now. This is a game perfect for a quick sitting, and enjoy a bit of space battle without much complications. And for that, this game is fun. However, if there is not much else to this game in final form.. then I will be a bit more worried. Because there is very little story to this, and longer sittings will quickly be tedious (again, in its current form) But mostly because the missions are not very complicated, or long for that matter. Then again, I have not played through everything there is to play yet. But this far in, I doubt it will change much. Once this is released in final form, I will have another deeper look at this. The graphics are OK, a bit like Homeworld (a game I think they take quite a bit of inspiration from) But it is still too early to saying more on that. Good game though, I recommend it! Even in its current form. I just have a nagging feeling there is not much more to it. I hope this is not the case.			"

								So, I played the original homeworld back in the day, along with the sequels.  I loved the atmosphere of those games and always wondered what it would be like to be in the battle instead of directing it from Fleet Command in the mother ship.  House of the Dying Sun gives you a glimpse into what playing Homeworld from the first-person perspective of a fighter-jock might be like.  And, for that I give this game a hearty Hells Yeah!I hope that the dev does not stop here.  There is so much more that can be done with this IP.  I can see being able to work your way up from fighter-jock to an admiral commanding a massive capital ship.There may be some who will balk at the price, but I felt like $20 was perfectly fair considering the amount of attention the devs gave this game.  It is obvious that the creators put some heart and soul into this game, but they didn't have the resources to make it a AAA title with awesome cut scenes and celebrity voice talent.My message to the devs is this, ""don't sit on this IP too long, you've got a winner here!""

								This is by far one of my favorite Vive games.  The true joy and fun of this game comes from trying to beat each game on the hardest difficulty, which requires patience (getting unlockables on easier settings) and strategy.  Warping out when you are the last bullet riddled ship out there after completing an objective is amazing.  Even if no more content is added its worth the money.  Controls taking some time to get used to but thats part of the fun.  Light on the lore, just good ole fashioned dog fighting with some strategy thrown in when commanding your other fighters, destroyers, and frigates.			"

On the other hand, I did enjoy it and wished it was longer. Guess I will go after all of the achievements.For me, the Tannhäuser Gate level, compared to the rest, is overly difficult. This needs to be balanced out, preferably by making the others a bit more challenging.Conclusion: Great game, hope to see more from this dev, and really hope that if this is the end of this game the devs open it up to the community to build levels or that they develop some more as a dlc... my wallet is waiting.

								I love this game. The cleanliness of the graphics through to controllability during in-flight modes, make it worth playing. I did find when hitting the 'D' button to control your ship prior to starting the mission, resulted in some lag by taking the user to the motion sensor setting. Eventually, the mission then started. Unfortunately, you're a bit annoyed by then. The latest update seems to have reduced the lag. Fingers crossed. That's about the only negative so far in this game. The in-game graphics are just as good as the preview trailers. The sound and musical score reminds me of watching one of the original Battlestar Galactica episodes - one of my all-time favourite sci-fi series. The weapons load-out screen through to coordinating attacks with wingmen are smooth and gives the user an excellent sense of immersion. You have to check out the main menu. It's like watching your very own space battle in VR with blast fire and missiles flying all around you - I sometimes forget that I haven't started the game yet. If you are a hard core space fighter sim fanatic, perhaps the game might be too easy. If you're a sci-fi enthusiast (I'm definitely in that genre), then you'll enjoy this game.			"

Early Access Review
								This is an Early Access review, and things are subject to change, remember that.This game is like Elite Dangerous, if you took out the ""simulation,"" and replaced it with a superb feeling arcade look and feel. It not only runs well, but it plays better. There is no better feeling than drifting perpendicular to an enemy blasting him to bits like the ""Teacher"" in Sky Crawlers. This, obviously, is the main point of the game. If you do not enjoy somewhat non-realism, then please don't buy it. If you like fun, then you're missing out if you don't drop that wallet.Starting with the post/pre-mission, each weapon and ability that can be equipped to your fighters, destroyers, or frigates, affects how you should use them. On Harbinger difficulty, prepare for a phyrric victory. Losing all your (and only your) fighters is the end of you, which was hard to understand at first, but the reveal at the end somewhat explains that, while raising a billion more questions. It's something you are more likely to find either A) wierd and interesting as hell or B) not something worth paying attention to.But there is no contest, gameplay has been put first. You have FPS fighter controls that you operate manually, and a RTS esque strategy mode in which you can command your ships. It is about as depthy command wise as most generic RTS' out there (go here, attack this, bomb this, kamikazi that, etc.), which came as a surprise to me given the polish of the fighter controls. You can even command ships while in fighter mode. There are actually a lot of command/strategy controls that aren't addressed in the ""tutorial,"" so please check your bindings and experiment before putting down the controller or keyboard.Generally, once you have more than one fighter, you may be micro-ing by switching between each manually, and turning the flowing tide of combat, similar to the  Men of War series (a WWII RTS), while pausing the gameplay to give bigger command queues to your other ships in strategy mode. The styling of the strategic gameplay isn't super in depth of course, but it does more than I would have normally asked for based on the premise of the title.There is a difference between a good pilot, and a good commander, and if you are both, the harbinger difficulty will be far easier. Knowing which ships and weapons in each mission becomes a neccessity, and while it may be easy to send a wave of ships at a target, wisely managing each to manage the different objectives may be the only way to result in total victory (bonus objectives, which add more ""favor"" for upgrades), or crippling defeat (I have beaten the current campaign on all difficulties in just a few hours).The upgrade system itself is unshamefully arcade like, you have weapon sets and two buffs for each type of ship in your fleet. The bigger ships often function as bullet shields, whilst the ""Executor"" strike fighters act as the sword to strike enemies of the emperor down.You are not a good guy, hence ""Enemy Starfighter"" (original title). You pillage and kill at will, and if they try to eject in an escape pod... blow it up, ram it... kill them, so their heresy may never continue.The campaign is short at this time, however, there will be  survival/wave mode added in the future.The story is bare-bones, with more questions than answers, but as I said, everything else has meat where there should be fat.It's a beefy, brawly, space fighter, and you are the baddest of the bad guys.PS: I would like to note, as other reviewers have, that the ""upgrade system"" and ""strategy mode"" options aren't particularly vast. It isn't, but to be honest, what aircraft dog-fighting arcade games have ever had either of those? The envisionment (from what I have gathered) is an supremely enjoyable arcade spacecraft fighter, with some rather unique mechanics thrown in, and it achieves that. For the price, even in this state, there are far worse games you could buy. Given that this is early access, and the campaign is going to be extended (along with the addition of a survival mode) I'm pretty satisfied with the purchase (it was on sale for a few bucks off when I got it). I won't force you to buy it, but honestly, I think the developer's could use the money to make more great games. Or was it developer...?EDIT (6/8/16): Found some hitching using gap drive whilst all my other fighters were in transit, likely due to the rapid movement affecting the GPU, first and only problem I've had running it so far, minus the 'chieves (which I could care less about).

								I'll keep this short and sweet, just like this game.While it may not have hundreds of hours of content, what it does have flows like liquid gold, feels like a triumphant hurrah to the space shooter genre, and looks like a perfect blend of TIE Fighter and Homeworld with a little BattleStar Galactica thrown into the mix.The price tag is a bit much, perhaps, but I don't regret a penny of it. I don't have a VR headset, so I can't vouch for that, but just playing it with a joystick at a desk was brilliant.If you're looking for something to scratch that starfighter itch without distractions, then this is the game for you.

								This game is awesome, but very short.  Everything's very tight and the combat is a blast to play, but the 14 mission (times three for the different difficulties) don't give the mechanics enough breathing room.  There's ship progression and upgrading, a full tactical view (which isn't nearly as difficult as others say, as long as you remember it was designed for a gamepad), and plenty of nuance in the combat, but by the time you're getting it all down you've probably run through most of the levels on two difficulties already.  Don't get me wrong, this game made the switch from an infinite procedural campaign to 14 very tightly designed levels and that was the right call.  But that doesn't stop me from wanting more.The developer is planning a wave-based mode to play, which should be a lot of fun.  But I'm hoping for a procedural campaign DLC, like was originally planned for the game.			"

								I've enjoyed this game very much so far using the HTC Vive. I don't have HOTAS controls yet, so I'm using an xbox 360 controller instead; but the controls are intuitive enough that it becomes natural after a short amount of play. The HUD system does a fairly decent job of guiding you to your targets and bonus objectives. It is a bit short, and it's not the most immersive game out there, but it's well done and worth the price.			"

								TLDR: Some hazels, but they are worth it. Get it if you a) you own a VR headset b) wanted a Home Wold fighter game. DLC could push this game from good to great.In the beta client (opposite click in library, beta tab) removing binding for the axes with double-mapping/issues, then rebing them fixed the problems for me. As of writing this review (19th Jun 2016) the most urgent issue with this game is the randomness of rebinding keys/axes, something makes it inconsistent. And I have to the bindings every time I load up the game! I expects this to be fixed, but now you know.VR note, moving the ship (max yaw) creates inconsistent movement of/in the background textures, moving the headset (at approximately the same speed) does not cause this. For me this wasn't to much of a deal, but it may cause you to suffer vertigo. PS. I've seen this in other Unity games as well (high end AMD cards ~90 fps average, no DPC latency problems).With that out of the way, it's a solid game and it gives you some options (ship customization) in how to tackle the missions. I got the game for the equivalent of 20$ while it's not cheap (for the length), it sits well together with Pool Nation VR and Space Pirate Trainer as one of the games you should own if you have a VR headset. If you don't have a VR headset, it'll probably end up feeling a bit expensive.			"

								Very good space fighter/space tactics game;In House of the Dying Sun, you fly missions to defend a falling empire. In a sequence of story-missions, you achieve your objectives in two ways:1. Macro-management: command ships from a 3D overview map; send them to attack, bomb, kamikaze or defend. This overview is key in all but the very first missions2. Take command of fighters to do attack runs yourselfBoth are implemented in a graphically simple, but cohesive way. Switching between these modes keeps things fresh.Outside of the tactical component, there is also a strategic component that lets you select missions and upgrade your fleet. This is servicable, and certainly not the focus of the game.While the game is ""Early Access"", is still feels complete.I highly recommend House of the Dying Sun to everybody.			"

								This game is great mix of arcade space sim combat with Homeworld strategy. You can freely switch between controlling each of your ships manually. Controls are smooth and combat is fun.I have to especially commend the music. As a Battlestar Galactica fan - I LOVE IT. It is very energetic and goes greatly with the flow of the combat.During the campaign your ships get experience, you can upgrade them and you get various rewards for missions like new ships or weapons. This keeps the game fresh and there is always something new to look forward to. Which is an important feature many current VR games are missing.I had no VR motion sickness despite doing some heavy maneuvering while personally controlling my fighters and quick camera angle switching in strategy mode.Only issue I had was a lot of dropped frames and stutter (I have 980Ti), but changing Power management mode from Adaptive to Prefer maximum performace in Nvidia Control Panel (thanks for the tip dev!) solved that and I can play on all settings maxed no problem (with a dropped frame here and there, not noticeable).It is one of the few VR games I see myself coming back to frequently.

								This is a good space shooter. I know this game is in development, so I'll keep this brief for now. This is a game perfect for a quick sitting, and enjoy a bit of space battle without much complications. And for that, this game is fun. However, if there is not much else to this game in final form.. then I will be a bit more worried. Because there is very little story to this, and longer sittings will quickly be tedious (again, in its current form) But mostly because the missions are not very complicated, or long for that matter. Then again, I have not played through everything there is to play yet. But this far in, I doubt it will change much. Once this is released in final form, I will have another deeper look at this. The graphics are OK, a bit like Homeworld (a game I think they take quite a bit of inspiration from) But it is still too early to saying more on that. Good game though, I recommend it! Even in its current form. I just have a nagging feeling there is not much more to it. I hope this is not the case.			"

								###   TLDR;   ###A brilliant, immersive and intense game that checks all the boxes of the Genre while adding its own flavor. If you like liked any Space Combat Flight Simulator ever, go and purchase this game and you will have fun.###    DRM    ###At the time this review goes up, 12 June 2016, the game is DRM-free and can be launched and played without Steam (http://steam.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_DRM-free_games). Let's get on with the review now shall we?###    FULL REVIEW - NO SPOILERS   ###House of the Dying Sun asks of you to beat around 15 hand-crafted levels / scenarios by piloting your lethal fightercraft through enemy formations and flak-fire, destroying opposing interceptors and capital ships. The scenarios are short, intense and well crafted, in short they are fun and replayable. Every single one prioritizes player agency and gameplay, this is a game about you beating the challenge the level designer has prepared for you.In terms of gamplay, HotDS can probably best be compared to Tie-Figher's or Freespace 2's style of space combat but like stated before, that is a rough comparison. There are different flavors of capital ships, there are sentry guns and cargo containers and enemy fighters in between and it is your job to figure out how to best use your available assets to achieve your objectives. Situational awareness is key.To this end (and to teach you these skills), the game comes equiped with a tactical pause mode in which you can freely give orders and assess the situation. And in contrast to said Tie-Fighter (or Wing Commander Prophecy), the feature is fully integrated and controls very well. Make no mistake though, this is a flight simulator and not an Homeworld-style RTS and you will not triumph without throwing your skills into the breach!You will equip your fighter, and later your escorting capital ships, with different variants of weapons and equipment such as shields or better (but slowing) armor. The vast majority of these feels useful and well balanced, supporting different playstyles.Flying and controls are spot-on and very precise, I personally preferred the gamepad and ignored both my Keyboard (which I use for Freespace 2 and the old Wing Commanders) and my HOTAS (which is my method of choice for every other flight sim bar the ones in the previous brackets). You feel very much in control of everything that is going on.Graphically, the game is very beautiful and I can only imagine that is looks brilliantly on a VR Headset (will purchase the next generation in one or two years). The ship models are surprisingly detailed will background noise such as asteroids are kept flat and uninteresting to control your focus.Sound design is outstanding, the same goes for the music. Think a more intense version of the reimagined Battlestar Galactica design and you are spot on, as far as I am informed the composer of the now defunct ""Beyond the Red Line"" Battlestar Galactica Total Conversion is on board here. Everything here serves both its purpose and its artistic goal perfectly, the sound is actually so incredibly brilliant it might just outshine all the other things that the game does...Being so scenario-focused, the game has no traditionall-told narrative to speak of. What is present however is written exceptionally well and the credits reveals that one of my favorite weaver of English words, the great Seth Dickinson, was involved here. To discuss what is present would already be a spoiler, so I leave it at ""do not expect a story driven campaign, but rest assured you will not miss it"". And note that this comes from a die-hard single player story enthusiast, hence what is present compensates :-)I refuse to add anything to the usual fuzz regarding the completely senseless ""how much playtime"" discussion. You should only judge an experience based on its overall quality. This is a very good game in all regards and achieves the rare feat of both appealing to the very hardcore audiance and being accessible enough to be able to teach less experienced players how to a) have fun and b) get better at it.Being in Early Access, every review should also state something about the technical side of things: In regards to stability and performance, everything present was already very promising. I had very little problems and zero crashes. In fact, I have only nitpicks at all, namely a very minor performance hiccup at the start of the last mission (game probably has to load many ships at the same time there) and sometimes a audio-crackle when entering another craft's shield bubble. And THAT IS IT. Lets face it, every triple-A game released today has way way WAY more issues at launch.Judging from the forums and already released updates, the developer is currently responding to all reported issues at an absolutely alarming rate...    I have no idea if Mike Tipul currently sleeps at all. Here is hoping he does.###    SUMMARY   ###This is an outstanding release, both in terms of actual game design and content, as well as in terms of polish and supporting it.SUPERCONDUCTOR CARAPACE FLUSHED WITH CONDENSED SUPERFLUID HELIUM.QUANTUM STASIS SYSTEM.ONE SOON-TO-BE-ENTERTAINED OCCUPANT.BREAKABLE SEAL.PURCHASE GAME TO OPEN.

								This game is short, around three hours, but it has an incredible vibe. It is minimalistic in the best sense of it. There is nothing to take away, but what is there is just brilliant. The music and the ambient are so awesome that I want to turn it louder and louder. The story is simple but hooks you from the first verses. Reminded me of I-War.Avenge the Emperor!			"

Early Access Review
								Intro:This is my first review ever on steam. I usually don't write reviews because I don't write for free however in extraordinary circumstances sometimes one has to do things differently. And one word describes this game extraordinary. Some background to give first because I believe its always good to shortly describe who the reviewer is before getting into any review proper. I have been following this game since 2013. Watched all the trailers multiple times, followed the dev on twitter tumblr, his website, religiously read the blog etc., So I am a fan of this game and therefore my review will be coming from the position of a fan.Summary: The game does more than just check the boxes off of what an arcade space shooter should be. It does more than just bring Starlancer and Freespace to the modern era. It is its own animal, and it fully immerses you into the cockpit and into the battle. Where other games dillie daddle with a long boring tutorial this game House of the Dying Sun now being referred to as HDS gives you a short and sweet tutorial and then blast you off into hyperspace.One thing this game doesn't do and I am so glad for it, is it does not waste time. It doesn't waste your time. It doesn't waste it's time. The game is not slow, and battles take place at short range CQB knife fight ranges. The fluff and chaff has been cut away and burned. And whats left is a purified vision of a modern stylish gorgeous arcade space shooter brought into reality. All weapons accept for the heavy weapons have infinite ammo. So watching ammo counters is no longer a distraction. The controls are tight and not lose. I am playing with an x360 controller. It doesn't bog you down with a long boring convoluted story that make no sense and it does everything to keep you immersed and to keep you in the feeling of actually being in space fighting a guerrilla war to the death.I will break the review down into three parts1. Gameplay2. Sound3. GraphicsGameplay:The basic gameplay loop is this. Pick a mission on the starmap, customize your ships, warp in to the level, complete the objectives, warp out of the level to the starmap, pick a mission on the starmap again. Repeat.Along the way you unlock something called Codex which has story and lore for you to read if you choose to.The whole design of the game is to purposefully elicit a feeling inside you. That you are hunting down traitors, people that have back stabbed you and betrayed you and you have now been ""activated"" to cleanse the galaxy of the betrayers on behalf of your emperor. Everything is designed about trying to make you feel that. That you are the hunter even while the enemy also feels like they are the hunter. There is a strong feeling of progression throughout the game the more you fight the stronger you get, the stronger you get the bigger the battles.There is a constant feeling of intensity with 3 difficulty levels, normal, hard and harder. This is a twitch game and you will need good reflexes. This is not a slow paced game. If you are a slow paced gamer and not willing to add on to your preference you will not like this game. There is an extreme feeling of quickness that grabs onto you as you fly and juke between fighters corvettes and capitals.The game can be played using a x360, xone, ps3, ps4, hotas, mouse&board, or other usb controllers. With hotas, and other usb controllers you will have to manually set up the buttons and sticks. With the xbox and playstation controllers it is auto configured for you out of the box and then you can choose to modify the buttons. For example I switched the y button and right bumper on my xbox controller as I have a very specific set up when I play space games.Sound:Sound is awesome. Muffled explosions really really hit your ears. I do realize that not everyone has a finely tuned and sensitive ear or has ever played instruments. I have an instrument and music background so coming from that perspective I notice tonality and sound and in general sound is just as important as gameplay and graphics. The music has been compared to battlestar galactica but I feel the music really comes into its own and doesn't sound as much like battlestar as others say and feel. Because sound is very subjective these difference in opinion is to be expected and no one is right or wrong. A soundtrack will be released and once it is I'm buying it.The music has been coded in to match the gameplay so it is a dynamic soundtrack, with the game code deciding based on the action what prerecorded musical loop to play. Some might fear or worry that this would make the music boring or repetitive but I feel like this is unfounded because you will be so focused on the actual battle that the music doesn't overshadow or de-immersify you out of the game, but it pulls you in more and deeply into the cockpit as you fly around blasting bad guys.I have some experience creating mods with sound effects for other games it is another hobby of mine. The most important question one should ask about sound effects is this. Does it help me feel like I am in the game? Or does it make me feel like I am listening to poor quality low quality effort made by someone with no experience using ableton live or whatever sound design program? The answer is it definitely does help you feel like you are in the game. The sound effects make sense. It feels like a missile. It feels like a bullet. It doesn't just sound like some random noise some guy put together. The soundscape and tonality match what you see with your eyes on the screen when you go to shoot that gun when you go to fire off the salvo. There is no disconnect. Its connected. And good sound design coupled with good background music help you feel connected to the game and what you are doing inside the game.Graphics:It's definitely a call back to homeworld in many ways. From the design of the ships to the way the ships were modeled and textured to the way they look like when you move etc., With that being said the developer in no way ripped off homeworld as there are plenty of stark differences between homeworld and HDS to make HDS have its own distinct style. Its got a retro modern feel. The graphics are not hyper realistic at all, its semi cartoony with a smooth look to it. It feels smooth it feels smooth it looks smooth. The details are in the edges not the center. I have experienced skinning and texturing as I enjoy making mods using skins and textures. In graphics design there is a school of thought that says let the viewers eyes wonder. So in this specific example with this game the way the ships are skinned and textured to not be hyper detailed or hyper realistic lets you focus more on the overall shape of the ship in other words the edges of the ship or the outline of the ship. This removes visual noise and clutter and helps the gamer to determine at a quick glance what ship is what by letting your mind take in the big picture outline of the ship. The skybox has a soft feeling to it with softer non glaring non crisp colors. The skybox does not feel crispy or sharpened but has  a blur filter or a desharpning filter or a soft edge filter or some combination of filters on it is to soften it.I have slight issues with the ingame in cockpit ui. The colors in my opinion are too soft and semi hard to see. I wish there was an option to brighten and sharpen and deblur the ui and/or at least change the ui colors. There is an option to decrease or increase the font size at least. That is very welcomed.Closing:HDS is an arcade 3d space shooter with mission based gameplay that takes a genre that has really gotten stale and does something new and different			"

								My initial review was negative due to poor HOTAS support. I have decided to rewrite it and recommend the game based on what is probably the best developer response in the history of gaming. He has put out two patches in as many days and worked very hard to implement some changes to Throttle and Stick gameplay. It is not perfect, but much better and I have been able to get mine working fairly well. The game itself is great. VR experience is top notch. It is much more action oriented than games like ED and much less complicated which I really enjoy. I hope in the future controls for common HOTAS systems like Thrustmaster T-Flight X and others will be prebound with the option to change them similar to how the mouse/keyboard and xbox controller is set up. It can be a very slow and frustrating process binding every action, but that isn't enough for me to give it a negative review and it seems like this developer is really working hard so that may happen in the future. Good game, buy it now while it's on sale. You won't regret it.			"

								I loved this game.Fantastic controls.Amazing sound design, seriously, the cracks and thunks you hear as you fire your weapons and get hit just sound right. They don't sound futuristic at all, just real.It's a short but damn well designed campaign. Every mission is hard when you first try it (I don't know if I've gotten through one on the first try besides the tutorial level, but you learn the ropes and by the time you finish the campaign you'll be making space-tracks and drifting to fire whenever your weapons reload.If you have a VR headset, absolutely get this game.

								This is a VR review using a HOTAS.Among the many games which I've played in VR, this one is among the best. There is hours of content to be had. Upon beating the game, I felt proud. I don't think I was very good at the game though. Because of the immersion, it was easy to buy into the intense passion that is the drive of the story.Setting things up with my HOTAS was frustrating, but after getting used to everything it became easy. The capital ships in your command often are more useless than useful. The upgrade system changes up gameplay while sticking to the core idea of the game.For a VR game, I recommend it.			"

								This game is great mix of arcade space sim combat with Homeworld strategy. You can freely switch between controlling each of your ships manually. Controls are smooth and combat is fun.I have to especially commend the music. As a Battlestar Galactica fan - I LOVE IT. It is very energetic and goes greatly with the flow of the combat.During the campaign your ships get experience, you can upgrade them and you get various rewards for missions like new ships or weapons. This keeps the game fresh and there is always something new to look forward to. Which is an important feature many current VR games are missing.I had no VR motion sickness despite doing some heavy maneuvering while personally controlling my fighters and quick camera angle switching in strategy mode.Only issue I had was a lot of dropped frames and stutter (I have 980Ti), but changing Power management mode from Adaptive to Prefer maximum performace in Nvidia Control Panel (thanks for the tip dev!) solved that and I can play on all settings maxed no problem (with a dropped frame here and there, not noticeable).It is one of the few VR games I see myself coming back to frequently.

								First of all, this game is incredibly short and sweet. It's my biggest gripe.But there's a lot of meat on the bone. HotDS is a Newtonian fleet combat game with a focus on hit-and-run attacks against high value targets. You can customize loadouts to suit a particular mission, issue commands to divide and conquer objectives, and pursue secondary goals while racing the clock to get out before the enemy flagship (a heavily armed missile cruiser) FTLs in. It's exciting. Seriously.There are some interesting tactics that you won't get with other aerial combat games: using a tactical FTL fold to close in to an enemy face to face, instantly turning around with inertia, hitting the brakes, and ending up inside his energy shield. Target a subsystem (such as engines) and blast away with the canister shot. Stay in his wash and his weapons can't hit you and his shields can't protect him. It's a potent tactic you won't find in Freespace / IWar games.This game has an interesting bedfellow, a Square Enix 360-exclusive Project Sylpheed. They both have fleet-on-fleet action where the strike fighters play a pivotal role in taking down subsystems and providing much-needed fighter screen. To a lesser extent, Strike Suit Zero and Macross VO hit the same sweet spot.If this game was purely about the ambiance: the Battlestar-like music, the Homeworld-like radio chatter and contrails, the fantasy sci-fi of Destiny, then you would be perfectly content watching this game on YouTube. Don't. It plays like the PC port of Sylpheed we've needed for years.			"

												At 4.2 hours into this game while writing this review, I can say that I've done all that there is to really do in this game. The only things I have yet to do are finish the hard and expert level difficulties of all the missions, but really they are not much different from the previous difficulties.It’s a mixed bag for this game, and I’ll list why below. I’m going to recommend it because I’m finding it sort of difficult to find any decent VR games that aren’t just a 3rd person perspective camera with movement linked to your head. Cockpit games just have the edge in VR.PROS:- A decent VR (Played with the Rift) cockpit space fighting game where you command a growing squad- The combat is good too, good pacing and you’re able to change out your weapons and ship upgrades for slightly different play styles- Supports the X-55 Rhino Saitek joysticks, though as usual you will need to figure out the mapping. ( I actually ended up using the Xbox One controller, which worked perfectly)CONS:- Lack of content. Probably the biggest downfall of this game, there just simply isn't enough content. I was able play the game to what I'm considering completion in 4 hours.- The squad management screen can be annoying at times, when you're trying to cycle through your units and just can't seem to get the right unit selected.- While able to buy upgrades to get more stuff, once you get the first 5 upgrades, there really is no driving force to get the other ones other than preference or curiosity. I didn’t use any of them to beat the game and I rarely changed anything.			"

								Ok so, I have always been a fan of space combat, looking at those sequences from Star Wars, Battlestar... etcI must say this game brings you the best experience for that, and adds its own little style to it with its tactical options. This is really a great game that delivers on a simple yet hard to achieve-premise it's going for.I love all kinds of space games, but as combat goes, this is my favorite along with Elite. The major difference being this is much more fast pace arcade like.If you have an VR headset, get this game asap! It's one of the best experiences out there. Perfect completed game, stunning visuals and sounds, perfect mechanics, you're in for a treat!			"

												I've never written a review on Steam before, but I liked this game so much I figured now was a great time to start.This game is pure fun. From the very first mission, you're thrown immediately into battle and the action never ceases throughout the campaign. The only thing negative I have to say about this game is that it's made me want to buy a VR headset! Controls feel very smooth and intuitive on an XBone controller, and I appreciated the Homeworld-like feel of the tactical map. Drift mode also blew my mind—there's something immensely satisfying about flipping around backwards without changing trajectory and shooting down a pursuer. I do agree with others that the campaign itself is short—it took about 5 hours to get through the first time around, and I just completed all achievements in 20 hours. Still, at $20 retail, it's tough to fault a game that provided that much entertainment for just $1/hour. Knowing what I know about the game now, I'd have gladly paid double that.The only question left is: when's the sequel coming out?			"

												Who doesn't want to be a Viper pilot when they grow up?The controls are a bit simplified. I wanted full 6 axis thruster control but all you get is a simplified ""glide"" sort of thing for advanced maneuvers. Not a huge issue. The story is minimal and I burned through the campaign with several replays in 4 hours. I've probably got at least that many again replaying missions though. I'd really love to see more of the story fleshed out.I may sound a bit ""meh"", but for the price of a movie ticket I can't complain at all. My only negative is the amount of content; what is here is great quality.My 2009 AMD x955 and 2010 Radeon 6970 run this game at 60fps on medium quite comfortably and I've never noticed any FPS dips using the non-DX9 option, whatever that is.

												I still stand behind this review, but I won't recommend the game anymore. To quote the official site (dyingsungame.com): ""There is a patch in the works to fix some small issues but the game is very close to getting frozen in carbonite for good""No additional content + no workshop integration = not worth the pricetagIf you are looking for the next FreeSpace or Wing Commander, stay away. This is not it.PROs- After getting used to some movement mechanics (drifting, GAP drive if available) it's just as fun as it looks in the trailers. It's like Pearl Harbour in space and you are the aggressor.- The 3D map is an essential tool and works well ... until you think you're playing Homeworld and hit the wrong keys (silly me). Thankfully the game pauses, giving you all the time you need to assess the situation, plan your moves and order your fleet around.- Once unlocked all ships can be equiped with various weapons and modules, allowing for different play styles (most of the time).- Everybody is expendable and some upgrades will encourage suicidal tactics. It creates some rather unique options.- Controls are fully customizable. From simple Mouse+Key to HOTAS+TrackIR everything is possible.- runs well even on potato rated PCs- basic but beautiful art style + incredibly immersive sound designCONs- 14 missions isn't very much and you can often skip lower difficulties as they offer no extra reward.- A lot of trail and error when it comes to equiping your fleet for certain missions. I find it repetitive but others might see it as increased replay value.Wishlist- A replay feature. If I jump in there, do a perfect assassination and improve my personal record I'd just love to watch it from every perspective imaginable. How else am I supposed to appreciate all the eye candy?- Workshop integration because 14 missions + survival mode just isn't enough in the long run.- Multiplayer ... which is probably never going to happen. Given how switching between vessels works I could see it being used in 2 - 3 player coop.A well done (very) fast paced space shooter with tactical depth and the occasional puzzle about how to outfit your fleet. Won't keep you busy for weeks but will make you come back for more every so often.			"

												Coming from the dogfighting of X3 I really enjoyed this game. It just felt incredibly short. Played under 5 hours and seen pretty much all the game has to offer. And being so linear the replayability is pretty low. Might do another run through it sometime though. The fighting and controls and execution just feels fantastic, it really is great fun. Just really lacking content. Would probably give a 6 / 10. Pick it up on sale.			"

												I'll start this off by saying that I was ready to give this a ""not recommended"" rating BEFORE I found out the the missions often change completely when attemting a new difficulty level. It was a pretty big letdown when, after around 2 hours of playing the game, I had reached and completed the final mission.After finding that there was actually quite a bit more to do I was much less disappointed, but I still feel that the game was mcuh too short for it's own good (and pricepoint).The game itself is pretty fun, and gets downright satisfying as you get into the groove of commanding your units and begin picking apark frigates and capships.I would definitely recommend House of the Dying Sun to any space sim fans, but unless you absolutely need the game NOW to wait for a sale, as the main game is still quite short.

												Overall I'd give this 7/10, it's alright. Ever since X-Wing came out in the early 90s I've been waiting for a replacement. Although this game promises the same space combat experience, it falls short in a couple of key areas. The first is mission design, they're all the same, *spoiler alert*, you warp in, blow up a couple of ships and warp out a couple of minutes later (no need to turn up for the pilots' briefing). In X-wing there was a great variety of mission types. The second shortcoming is there's very little you can do in your ship, you can't divert power to the shields or weapons for example. The third shortcoming is there are no tight dogfights, you just kind of sit a distance away and strafe the baddies, hoping you don't get picked off yourself. I realise this is still an early release and hope the game improves, as there is a kernel of a good game in here.			"

												It may be a relatively short experience but what an experience it is! Excellent space combat gameplay combined with some incredible art direction and sound design. It's also highly replayable with higher difficulty modes and challenges, which the tight gameplay mechanics support beautifully. You can really tell where the development effort went - to impeccable mission design and gameplay, not padding out the game unnecessarily. Highly recommended!			"

												This is a pretty fun arcadey flight sim.  Think Tie Fighter/wing commander, but shorter missions.  I've been playing for a bit and I'm already glad that I bought it.  If you like space dog fighting, this game is for you.  It's under 20 bucks so that should set your expectations well.			"

												Good fun although probably a little expensive for the amount of content. Luckily has a lot of replay and feels good with dual sticks. Would love to see a sequel or additional content.If you have a VR headset this game would be awesome.			"

												I still stand behind this review, but I won't recommend the game anymore. To quote the official site (dyingsungame.com): ""There is a patch in the works to fix some small issues but the game is very close to getting frozen in carbonite for good""No additional content + no workshop integration = not worth the pricetagIf you are looking for the next FreeSpace or Wing Commander, stay away. This is not it.PROs- After getting used to some movement mechanics (drifting, GAP drive if available) it's just as fun as it looks in the trailers. It's like Pearl Harbour in space and you are the aggressor.- The 3D map is an essential tool and works well ... until you think you're playing Homeworld and hit the wrong keys (silly me). Thankfully the game pauses, giving you all the time you need to assess the situation, plan your moves and order your fleet around.- Once unlocked all ships can be equiped with various weapons and modules, allowing for different play styles (most of the time).- Everybody is expendable and some upgrades will encourage suicidal tactics. It creates some rather unique options.- Controls are fully customizable. From simple Mouse+Key to HOTAS+TrackIR everything is possible.- runs well even on potato rated PCs- basic but beautiful art style + incredibly immersive sound designCONs- 14 missions isn't very much and you can often skip lower difficulties as they offer no extra reward.- A lot of trail and error when it comes to equiping your fleet for certain missions. I find it repetitive but others might see it as increased replay value.Wishlist- A replay feature. If I jump in there, do a perfect assassination and improve my personal record I'd just love to watch it from every perspective imaginable. How else am I supposed to appreciate all the eye candy?- Workshop integration because 14 missions + survival mode just isn't enough in the long run.- Multiplayer ... which is probably never going to happen. Given how switching between vessels works I could see it being used in 2 - 3 player coop.A well done (very) fast paced space shooter with tactical depth and the occasional puzzle about how to outfit your fleet. Won't keep you busy for weeks but will make you come back for more every so often.			"

												I would give neutral rating because $20 retail price for couple hours length isn't worth it, and I'm not in favour of their idea of extending gameplay by adding difficulty modes. Aside from that, the elements of this game (gameplay, controls, graphics, music) are simple yet effective. It's my first ever playing space combat simulation game, and House of the Dying Sun was a great start. I'm looking forward to play more simular games or come back to try harder difficulty. Wait for sale and you won't be disappointed.			"
