Early Access Review
								It's been in Alpha for a year and is suddenly going to 1.0 next month. They're just gonna skip beta stage, add a tutorial, iron out a few bugs, and leave the rest to modders. Almost none of the stuff originally teased http://web.archive.org/web/20131018054131/http://spacebasedf9.com/devplans that people bought the game for is to be found. This game is too barebones to be worth your 25 bones. Double Fine has fallen from grace, for whatever inexplicable reason. :/You can play through all of the content within a few hours.boooooooooo!

												I'm so sorry - even now with 1.06, read some episodes:- Tried the new tutorial, how to play; got to the explore derelict task - but the derelict never appeared :-) :-(- Started a new game and despite in a sector with ""low"" threats, there were plenty of hostile ships chiming in from time to time.- I was expanding my base; suddenly I got hails from friendlies. Two new ships/buildings appeared; one docked in the middle of a room building operation leaving it inaccessible; the other docked on a wall that had a ship engine. I could access the latter by cutting a wall and tearing down the engine to free the main entrance, but the former still inaccessible.- There's a dead raider lying in the room to be the second reactor room. I can not build a power generator since the raider blocks it - seems bodies just don't disappear. I also have a floating dead astronaut in the middle of my bar; he was killed when the room didn't even exist.I've spent hours in the game but only got frustration out of it - whatever progress I made, disappearing floor tiles, stupid AI, bugs, ... ruined it. Maybe I should finally uninstall it - I'd have had fun with it if it had been more mature.			"

""Thanks for the money. I'll need it for my other projects."" - Tim ""3.3"" Schafer (Not an actual quote he made, meant to be satrical)Another title that's a stain on the early access program. You'd think a developer like DoubleFine couldn't mess up a PC game like this. Just take everything from Theme Hospital, mix abit of Dwarf Fortress in there add abit of originality and hey presto, you have a game. Not really though, as you've come across the bad reviews/recommendations for this game and there's alot of them.There's nothing good in this game, it's bare-bones as it comes. Unless a very, very talented modding crew works relentlessly on this game it's never going to be worth a purchase.Oh and one more thing; Recommending your own game through the Curator system isn't ethical. Stop that.Edit - 21/07/2015Wow, didn't realise that this 'review' would get so popular.I'd just like to thank everyone who took the time to click on that good ol' green thumb and bring to light the trash that is early access and greenlight games. Thanks to Steams new refund option, broken, half made games like this will hopefully never come to be.

Early Access Review
								SEPTEMBER 22 EDIT: Do not buy this game. The game is going into ""1.0"" release next month and is being left to modders to finish it up. They claim they're going to fix bugs, but as I made clear in the review below, they couldn't even finish the A.I. during thier ""Alpha"" stage.This game is like an incredibly dumbed-down Dwarf Fortress in space. Key word being dumb. The AI has incredibly complex inabilities to solve their problems. They would rather let themselves asphyxiate in the cold of space than finish constructing the airlock that is filled with oxygen. Why? Because the unfinished part is a space suit locker. They were in space suits already.In a previous run, the builders refused to add onto the life support section because oxygen was running low (for some unknown reason) and so the whole crew suffocated. Another run, I had to tear down a door I placed. That destroyed the wall and converted the next room from an airlock into a reactor, and while trying to fix that, the builder simply never finished construction. The crew died because they had no airlock to exit and expand and there was a hole into space.The security have no sense of uniformity and would rather walk one at a time into a derelict and die continuously to the same thing.You can't place objects in 4 directions, only two. I don't know why 4-view camera controls aren't implemented yet, but its frustrating to deal with as you have so much unused space. It's a neat concept and can become a good game, but it is not at all worth your time or money. It is bug-ridden. It has very stupid AI. If the developers can create useful viewing controls and decent AI that you don't have to play around in a nit-picky manner, it'll be a fun, hard game of balance between many facets of every characters' needs and wants, and management of a space station.

												Don't believe the release announcement. Spacebase DF-9 hasn't been really updated in months. The developers messed up the Early Access model with months of no updates and lack of content and this is them saying that they're not going to work on the game anymore.Features that were originally planned for were scrapped, no real end game or even a mid game and people are still reporting bugs despite them having all this time to ""finish it."" Avoid this one and for a game that gets Early Access, check out Prison Architect.			"

												While the game in its current state is relatively playable it is sadly unfinished.  The UI is rather clunky and unfinished.  The AI even more so. There doesn't seem to be any dynamic events other than meteor strikes and random raiders which given the basic nature of the AI means that a lot of your personnell will be left dead and dying on the floor.  There was no effort put in to making the Random derelict encounters anything other than a randomly generated set of rooms to be a ""starship"" or chunk of space station and they pop into exisence randomly on the map sometimes popping in attached to your base.All in all it is a stable game which is sparse and empty that will hopefully be completed by mod teams into something a little more robust.However this only serves to prove that Double Fine missed the while point of what utelizing early access is for and clearly started this project with the hopes of funding it exclusively through EA rather than making sure they had the capital to put out a product.For the price its going for you'll get a better deal by either waiting for Starbound, Planet Explorers, or Space Engineers to get out of alpha and into beta.

												Unfortunately I can't recommend this game.  I personally like it but since the developer decided to leave the game unfinished and incomplete, I can't recommend it.  What you have is a fun Spacestation simulator that minus the bugs and glitches would be good enough on its own.  However these bugs and glitches are often game breaking and could even destroy your save.  That being said, don't buy this game unless you have a high tolerance for pain.			"

												For formatting and pics go to: http://wildwoodgeek2.blogspot.com/2014/12/space-base-df-9.htmlWhat Space Base DF-9 did right -Great visual AppealOne of the things i love about SBDF-9 is the look and style, they just seem right. And it reminds me of the Sims 4 or Sim City(2013)-Great idea for a gamelots of people have done building games, city games,etc, but Space Bases are few. The idea for this game is Perfect, now if only the game was...What Space Base DF-9 did wrong-Did not deliveron the Double Fine Games website they had a roadmap (now long gone) of things they said they were going to try to add. It was a big one. And yes i know that even they said it wasn't ""set in stone"" but it was used to get people to buy the game, and now only about 20 to 40% of those features are in the game, and it kinda feels like they tricked us. -Left the Game unfinishedDouble Fine Games the dev and publisher has left SBDF-9 to make another game and thereby make more money. They basically blame the community citing that ""not enough people bought the game to fund it"". Perhaps because the game is in an Alpha state at the most -♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AII don't know about you but when i'm in a space base on the far reaches of the milky way, i get pretty damn ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when i don't have Five Star meals, or Gyms, or bars, or TV. So mad i start trashing my own Oxygen tanks thereby killing myself. What? You wouldn't do that? Well the AI in this game does that. Yep, if they aren't living in luxury they decide life just ain't worth living. -Not Worth the priceIf Double Fine Games was going to keep working on this, i would say this is worth the price, however they aren't so really there is no point in spending cash on it. Its not going to get better, its not going to get fixed, and its not a good game. -bugs and glitches that will never be fixedNot being able to build, Oxygen not being produced despite the fact i have Oxygen tanks and more, these are bugs and glitches that will never be fixed. -Made us pay for their failureThis is more of a issue of Double Fine Games itself. They the whole reason they said the game is being shut down is because one: Not enough people bought it, and two: they ran out of Kickstarter money. If they did run out of kickstarter money then STOP working on another game and spend that money on the game you sold us. -This is not the first time Double Fine Game has let people downAnother game by DFG, Broken Age was also misleading. The game is sold as a full game but it is like TellTale games in that there are ""Episodes"". Right now, a year after the funding for the game ended there is only ONE  episode, with a ""promise"" that the second one will be coming on ""sometime in early 2015"" Who Space Base DF-9 is for-People who like wasting money -People who don't care about playing an unfinished game -People who buy games on sale -IdiotsFinal ThoughtsThe idea behind this game is amazing, and if worked on properly it could be a masterpiece. But it won't and thats a shame. Normally i keep supporting even bad EA games because i figure ""eh, they will fix it later"" i mean at the point i've already given them money, the best thing to do is hold on to the hope (however pointless) that the game will get better. There is no hope with SBDF-9, not anymore. And yes, modders could make it better, and they could make it a great game, but my belief is that if modders have to fix your game, and i mean Make it playable, then you've already failed. "

												When I get a full refund from Double Fine for Spacebase DF-9, then I'll consider buying another DF game. I don't care how great the guys developing Massive Chalice are, they're from the same studio that scamed me out of 25 bucks.25 dollars, in the grand scheme of things, it isn't much. But there's alot of things I could've done with that 25 dollars, first thing that comes to mind is buy a case of mediocre beer. Now when I buy a case of Budwieser I expect certian things; I expect bland taste, I expect to get a mild buzz, sounds like a pretty ♥♥♥♥ty use of 25 dollars right? Here's the thing, I was never promised anything more.Lets expand on the beer analogy: instead of Budweiser, DF is now the brewer. DF promises me a pretty nice brew: nothing amazing, but something well worth my money. Having heard DF has produced some quality brews in the past I buy a case from the affable salesman. I take the case home, eager to try a fresh new flavor from the brewer I've heard so many good things about; then I open the first bottle. ♥♥♥♥, this bottle contains nothing but ♥♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥♥ fumes; disgusted but still hoping to at least drink my initial disgust away I open another bottle..........more ♥♥♥♥. So the evening rolls on with me opening up bottle after bottle of DF's ♥♥♥♥ untill the whole case is gone in the midst of my now pungent apartment I realize: that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at DF scamed me.I storm down to the storefront where I bought the not-brew only to find the signs down, the windows shuttered, and a note on the door: closed due to lack of customers.That's the best way I can think to describe my one and only transaction with DF, they sold me a case of ♥♥♥♥ and said the reason the ♥♥♥♥ was ♥♥♥♥ is because not enough people bought their ♥♥♥♥. So I hope you fine folks at DF can understand why the next time someone asks me to spend my money on one of your products, I'll tell you to shove your product up your ♥♥♥.			"

												This is not my review but I thought it should be noted that this game won ""Best mod support"" from PC Gamer. http://www.pcgamer.com/goty-simulator-2014-the-alternative-pc-gamer-awards/What does that mean you ask?""It's always great when games arrive with built-in mod support, but this year Double Fine went a step beyond. Not only did they release the full source code for their Early Access game Spacebase DF-9, but they left hundreds of planned features incomplete, giving modders the exciting challenge of finishing the game themselves. It's rare to see that sort of selfless generosity from a developer, and we salute Double Fine for passing the torch to modders, or at least hurriedly chucking the torch at modders from the window of their limousine as they screeched away from the curb.""So yeah.

Early Access Review
								I really try to like this game, I really do. But between the horrible AI, UI, and overall game meta, not to mention lackluster developer support over the course of the last year I cannot with good conscience recommend this to anybody. Wait at least until beta to buy this, and only if they significantly alter the meta-game.As it stands the AI are imbecilic, the gameplay progression borders on unfair or unplayable even at low difficulty, and the game has a daisy chain of progressive bugs and glitches that functionally cripple your base the longer you play. Invisible raiders? Yes. Unhealable citizens? Got that too. Ludicrous pathing? Sure! Lack of transparency in regards to what you're placing into the game? Oh hell yes, have to rely on an oft-incomplete wiki full of speculations.You would be better off looking to ancient games like Space Colony, or Startopia for a game of this genre that works. (More in the case of Startopia) This is what bugs me the most, since I normally would expect good things from a Double Fine game, if only because I enjoyed Brutal Legend. But it is obvious to me that Double Fine isn't investing many resources in this game, and probably have no intention of doing so either.My prediction? A halt in development by Fall of 2014 when the dev team gets recalled to work on what is seen as more 'profitable' ventures. But maybe I'm just pessimistic because I've played games like this in the past with far higher levels of development from studios most people have never even heard of. (Okay, it's moving up into fall 2014 when I edited this and still no halt.. I can only hope that alpha 6 is some sort of incredible improvement.. But I won't hold my breath.) Spacebase DF-9 - 24.99Startopia - 6.99 (Space Base DF-9 could learn something about meta from this)Space Colony - Available on GOG for 9.99 (Again, something Spacebase DF-9 could learn about creating at least tolerably realistic social interactions in somewhat of a fun fashion.)

												This started out as a good looking project from a respected maker of novel games.  Then apparently Double fine's collective brains fell out and they decided that since people had already payed for their game in early access they didn't actually need to bother to finish it.The release version of the game is fundamentally broken, and cannot even claim to be a working beta.  It's a half finished alpha they just dumped with zero consideration for their customers.  Most of the features promissed don't exist, or if they do are not functioning correctly.Issules include but ar not limited to:Spotty AI of both crew and hostile mobs.Exploring wrecks is almost pointless since the risk of loosing crew because they refuse to come back to the station after checking it is usually greater than any benefits you may get from it.  Plus the mining reources always run out far too early leaving gutting wrecks for matter the only way to keep a base running.Station power supply only works sometimes.The only way to satisfy the entertainment need of station crew is to put at least 2 televisions in EVERY room of the base (including airlocks) since nothing else was ever added for entertainment.The shield tech to stop asteroids punching holes in the base was never added, so you tend to spend half your time patching holes.Don't even THINK of buying this game, and if you want my advice, stay clear of anything else from this developer as they do not deserve to exist.

												I purchased this game when it was still in Early Access for the full price (was $25 when I bought it).  Developers promised a lot of things, new features, customization, and a vast amount of gameplay.  Unfortunately, none of these promises were delivered.  I bought the game because I enjoyed Double Fine's Brutal Legend.  They seemed like a trustworthy developer that could get a fun quirky game done and make it worthwhile. After months of no updates and no communication I began to lose heart.  The minimal amount of playtime (logged 0.6 hours) was due to the lack of a tutorial (which they have since added, and it's sub-par) and (I assume) a bug that prevented my characters from entering the base I built.  I started another game, and again they wouldn't enter the base I built and ended up suffocating.  Started another game and I finally got them to enter the base, and that's where more bugs appeared.  Just read the forums to get an idea of how frustrating the bugs are and how broken the game is, despite it getting a full release.  Very disappointed in Double Fine.  Their lack of communication regarding the game's development, refusal to be honest with people who bought their product (e.g. not letting us know they planned to stop development and leave the game as is), and the fact that they had the gall to release the code and tell the community that if they like the game, then they have to fix it.  Come on.  To conclude, I'd say avoid this game, it will receive no further updates, and as it stands it's an incomplete mish-mosh of ideas.  Even for $12 I'd say skip it.  Hopefully they update Gang Beast, which I also purchased before this fiasco, although it hasn't received an update since the day I bought it (2 months ago).Update: Source code has been released...and there are still parts of the code that are hidden, as one person on the forum mentioned, the Oxygen Recycler.  One of the most basic units of the game.  It's used to prevent your base from losing oxygen, thus preventing everyone from suffocating.Update #2: Price has changed to $20.01 (from the sale price of $12), and that's about it.  Tried playing the game again and it wouldn't let me complete the tutorial (was not allowed to place a second airlock door where it indicated).  Still have yet to build my own base.  They supposedly also fixed some bugs on October 30th.  This is what one user had to say: ""crlsniper Nov 1 @ 2:30pm Glad to see your working on fixes, though the bigest fixes need to be AI fixes, Mostly for doctors and security. I lost an entire base just because none of the doctors would go help people who where incapacitated, neither would soldiers go arrest and move raiders who where incapacitated either.""Multiple counts of the same complaint.  Furthermore, despite where you establish your base, you will have near constant attacks from pirates/raiders.Some brave souls have attempted to mod the game (essentially having to rebuild the game from the ground up), check this thread out: http://steamcommunity.com/app/246090/discussions/0/613940477963640858/It outlines a lot of the bugs and problems with the game, such as faulty oxygen recyclers (e.g. too many people in a room would cause dramatic decreases in oxygen no matter how many recyclers you had, thus everyone in that room eventually would suffocate).Update #3: Free copies of Hack n Slash were provided to buyers of this game (myself and a few others received a copy), however it strikes me as more of a political ploy than a genuine apology.  This is because people who purchased Hack n Slash got a copy of this game.  As far as I know, Hack n Slash purchasers weren't spat upon and kicked to the curb by Double Fine, so this move makes no sense to me.And of course I'm not eligible for the new refund policy, since I purchased this game over a year ago.  GFY Double Fine.			"

												It's fun if you want to simulate trying to keep a bunch of literal violent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ alive in space.  Am I joking or exaggerating?  No I am not.  I have never dealt with such mind-crushing stupidity in any game of this sort, ever.  The stupidity of your citizens goes above and beyond funny and delves into the absolutely painful and rage-inducing.  I'm talking about builders not building airlocks and dying from it, Techs not maintaining their oxygen recyclers, panicing when the lack of oxygen makes them suffocate, and then dies flailing around in circles - going into a raider/monster infested derelict one after another for the sole purpose of greed; the overwhelming desire to pick up some stupid, worthless toy and dying for it in a pile of their greedy dead friends, stamping on a roaring fire the size of a house and burning to death in a huge mass instead of using the fire extinguishers directly outside and in said flaming room - walling themselves into small rooms and dying, refusing to tear down the wall to escape or build a door,   Downright refusing to maintain the station, their lives, their jobs, or anything relating what so ever to order, because they'd rather bash each others brains out in some psychotic fight, or they'd rather have a temper tantrum because they need to keep the oxygen recyclers operational and they can't play with their rubber duckies.Yes, all of this actually happens, and it happens constantly.  It isn't some stupid trivial issue that appears once in awhile, it's literally ♥♥♥♥ing constant and it never ♥♥♥♥ing ends.  Seeing 30 people die one after another because they individually decided to stop working/cooking/sleeping to go steal a ♥♥♥♥ing trinket from a derelict near-by, and absolutely nothing I try to do can ♥♥♥♥ing stop them (Making them security and putting the deployment icon elsewhere, making them builders and trying to make them build, ANYTHING BUT DIE IN THAT ♥♥♥♥ING DERELICT ONE AFTER ANOTHER FOR YOUR STUPID ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T).Again, this isn't funny.  It goes beyond funny.  It's unplayable.  It's literally ♥♥♥♥ing unplayable because you're actually trying to manage severely mentally disabled humans and aliens in a ♥♥♥♥ing space station.  If they don't kill themselves from suffocating, greed, or just random senseless violence and fighting, the almost constant raider attacks (that eventually culminates to a literal raider fleet, for no reason what so ever) will kill them.  The best part is apparently the developers took the money and ran, haven't been doing anything with the game, ban people who point this out or mention it on their forums, and are making new projects/♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t with the nonexistant money.This game could be really, really good if the crew wasn't so ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and suicidal.  If they were competent and HAD PRIORITIES like ANY LIVING CREATURE WITH SOME SENSE OF SELF-PRESERVATION, the game would be good, REALLY good in fact.  As it is right now?  No it's unplayable ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.Maybe some modders can take it over and fix it, do anything with it, I don't know.  But by default this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is awful.			"

Early Access Review
								Great UI, some good ideas, but current feature set is exremely small, leading to a shallow game where you'll have seen everything it has to offer within an hour.   It's also riddled with severe, game-breaking bugs; your station's success usually has more to do with whether or not the game decides to malfunction, and less with the environmental hazards. Down the road I could see this evolving into something excellent, but in it's current state it's falling short of playable.  I would only reccomend purchasing at this stage as a means of supporting the project, don't expect a fully playable game at this point.			"

												I poured money into this expecting it to be an ongoing project. It started out interesting for an alpha but then we realised that this was as good as it was going to get.The developer either mismanaged the money so severely to the point where it should honestly be questioned whether Doublefine has any business in early access or they simply took the money and ran. Not bothering to finish this game as other projects needed more attention.Either way we are left with a sorry excuse for a game. Horrendously shallow gameplay with barely any of the initially promised features. It is a barren boring game that you will grow weary of in less than half an hour of starting it up.Do not buy unless it goes for less than a dollar.			"

Early Access Review
								I had a lot of hopes for this game but regardless of what Double Fine says this game is not finished. It's broken, it's missing features, it's a game full of promises that won't be delivered. Double Fine does try to rectify this by releasing the game's code to allow modders to take over, but how is this fair? I want a game I don't have to go and search for 3rd party mods of varrying quality or even security. Disapointed in this game and disapointed in Double Fine who I once could call my favorite developer. Getting rid of my poster with Tim Shaffer's signature on it. Don't get disapointed like I am, don't buy this.			"

												I've finally decided to give the ""release"" version a full go. After completing most of the goals in the game I've come to a conclusion:DF-9 does not hold up to its promise. Not by a long shot.Aside from the fact that fact that Double Fine abandoned (I do actually understand their situation) the game long before their planned goals had been implemented, the unfortunate truth is that what we do have isn't finished either.Most prominently the power system. Without an actual power meter (like we have for O2) your base will just suddenly lose power if you've built too much. You have no useful way of knowing when to build another reactor. The devs expect you to hover your mouse over each and every room and sum up the power consumption in your head each time you want to take inventory.Next up is the ""story"" of the game. One of the last versions must have shoehorned this in because I don't remember it from Alpha5. Basically at some point the game will spontaneously throw multiple raider ships and raider astronauts at you in bulk. I've you've managed to build your base accordingly by then: congratulations for figuring out the simple and boring strategy needed. If you haven't? Well, you can start all over again.Then as you continue to play and expand your base to meet the other goals you'll notice how the game becomes increasingly glitchy.And speaking of goals: The ""build all the things"" goal isn't even possible. I tried. I built everything there is and allegedly I'm still missing something.			"

Money has changed hands. The consumers have paid for a product with the expectation that it will be finished.That itsn't happening.			"

Early Access Review
								Warning: AVOID.Very sad to say this, but it seems that the developer is cutting this title loose. The store page says this is in Alpha. It is not. It is in final beta stages since they have just announced that after a round of bug fixes they will release version 1.0 in october and content updates will stop. The game had huge potential and I was under the impression this still had at LEAST a year left of updates, but sadly it seems like they are ditching it. What exsists today is the shell of a full title, a scant promise of something it could be after a lot longer in development, but £19 for this? Forget it. This is the first time I have been badly stung by Early Access and it has shaken my faith in it completely. I have huge respect for Double Fine, but I will NEVER buy any of their Early Access titles again (and I was so close to getting Gang Beasts). Just have to put this one behind me I suppose. Can't see how this won't hurt the developers Early Access reputation however.Very disappointed.			"

												This game was great. Keyword ""WAS""It seemed very promising and I bought it right after it came out, put almost 24 hours into it. Soon after, they went from alpha to finished, and didn't complete anything on their ""To Do List""Absolute garbage when a publisher does that. I would suggest that you family share with a friend that has this game already if you want to play. Not worth buying.Another thing that sucked was the fact that most of us purchased this game for a significantly greater price than it is now, expecting the early access updates(which never happened)Fun game, still has too many bugs that need to be fixed, and even when playing on easiest settings, the best of bases will fail from bugs in the game.Advice to you: Save you're money!!!

												Unfortunately this game is a bit of a disaster. DoubleFine supposedly had to cancel this game and release a final version early after finding this game to be uneconomical. A shame.Time for the good/bad/ugly.The Good:The art style is niceOxygen simulation works wellCharacters have moods and these change according to what happensThe Bad:General lack of features; boredom does not take long.Building a large base is not difficult, merely very time-consuming.The Ugly:The AI. DEAR GOD.Seriously, half of the time people don't do their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ jobs.I'm not kidding. Characters manage to kill themselves REGULARLY.In my personal opinion this should not even be on sale anymore.

												As good as this game promised to be, Double Fine sadly ruined their chances of making a great game when they chose to fund this game pretty much from their early access sales, which is a perfectly reasonable strategy, if you deliver regular, great content. Sadly this has not occured, and the game sales stagnated. DF have now quickly pushed the game into a half complete, half-featureless husk of what it could have been, and it's still not very fun to play anymore. A lesson for everyone going forwards.

												The game has been abandoned in the Alpha stages and really it seemed like it had quite a bit going for it. But DoubleFine really screwed the pooch when it decided to do damage control on the disgruntled community. Instead of apologizing and admitting the problems they decided to ban threads, remove forum posts, and keep everything as quiet as possible. I would have been mildly upset with DF-9, but with the way DoubleFine is handling the situation I'm outright refusing to even touch anything else they make. Bad business practices don't deserve support. Vote with your monies and don't support DoubleFine.			"

												Well thats how fast it can go. Apparently this alpha if going to be 1.0 in a month...with LARGE parts promissed not yet implemented and, if you read the new devplan posted lately, not going to be in. Without a betaphase. I was pretty content with this game and its developmentpacing until now. If this is realy what they want to call finish then this game is basicaly a scam. For this price you will get 2h of playtime and after that there is NOTHING to do anymore exept getting a larger base...without any goal...just building more rooms. I`m deeply dissapointed right now. How this could happen out of nothing puzzles my mind. Especialy since Double Fine is developing this so no...they didnt run out of money.Edit: http://web.archive.org/web/20131018054131/http://spacebasedf9.com/devplansThat was the plan.

												Double Fine slapped a ""1.0"" sticker on this game and abandoned it. Whilst I appreciate that there are times that an Early Access game may not deliver all of the promised features, this game received a small fraction of those features proposed.But this is a game review, not a review of Double Fine's business practices. So how is the game?In short, the game is a mess of buggy AI with barely enough gameplay mechanics to sustain more than a couple of hours of play. The character morale system is horribly half-baked, and the game is little more than a series of repetitive busywork tasks.That Double Fine now has it's greasy mitts out for Early Access funding for Massive Chalice barely a month after abandoning DF-9 is an insult to all of those people who put their faith in the company.Never again.

												I promised I wouldn't leave a review until it was finished, as leaving negative feedback on an early access game is just unfair.  I loved this game, and with every patch it got better and better.So why don't I recommend it?It's simple.  It's far too unpolished for a finished game.Missing text, UI errors, and dodgy AI prioritisation, The AI is good most times, but it has glareing holes where it puts things like ""stomping out fire on the other side of the raiders"" above ""the raiders are shooting at me, run away"" and you end up with ""look a fire behind those raiders that they just set that doesn't affect anyone, let’s get every civilian to run over to the raiders and stomp out a fire while they shoot us all""My personal favourite is ""the oxygen recyclers are breaking?  No, don't fix them, lets panic for two hours while the oxygen slowly runs out""Now you can put most people down to blind panic in situations like those, but out of a crew of 64, 52 of them went to stomp out the fire (they ran all the way from a safe section of the base, past security and into the raiders, most of which were assigned to security and tasked with killing the raiders.  You just wouldn't get a situation like that in real life.I understand the reasons behind it, and the bug fixing is ongoing.  However in its current state it is still very very difficult to play smoothly, and I don't mean that the game is hard, I mean the game visibly holds you back when you want to play it and a single bug can be a game breaker.If you like the look of this game, feel free to get it, back up your saves MANUALY on a regular basis, and don't be surprised if a sudden bug/glitch wrecks your experience.  However please don't buy this game if you are thinking it will be epic.  It's epic until a bug kills it.As major bugs are patched I will update this review, but it’s looking like the ""patches"" will either not continue or be few and far in-between.  There is currently a comminity unofficial patch in the works so I will be interested to see how/if that pans out.			"

												Wouldn't Recommend this game A.I. is mainly broken and buggy.  The only update that they classified as it being released version of this game 1.0 are a few bug fixes and tutoral a massive 50.4mb probably done in a lunch time by the devs but took over 30 days to release.I feel let down by double fines this was the first EA game I backed from them I had doubts at the time but felt I could trust them as they were a big company but they just seem to be using Steam for gold digging and are a fly by night EA dev's.Don't buy this game if I had a choice I would get a refund and back a better game such as prison architect which I do own and can recommend two devs who done a better job than double fines.

Early Access Review
								DO. NOT. BUY. I bought into this game very early, paying $25 for basically a tech demo, because I loved the concept. I also trusted DoubleFine and Tim Schafer, being a respected studio and developer, to deliver an awesome product in the end. Alas, the development of this game seems to have been mismanaged into the ground. DF is abandoning the project and leaving us gamers with an unfinished buggy mess and calling it 1.0 release. There's about 10 hours of playtime here at most and quite frankly that is just not worth the pricetag.Update 11/12/14: I tried playing this game again after the 1.0 release. It still feels terribly unfinished. The new tutorial and goals system feel slapped together, lackluster, and unnecessary. I wish they would have spent the time adding more actual game content instead of these ""features"". Not to mention, the game is still very buggy. My first attempt at a base fell apart rather quickly after a derelict showed up. I set  a beacon to have my security guard check it out, who got killed by a bot. That alone would be fine as a possible risk of exploration, but then my other non-security personnel decided to go to the derelict ""picking something up"" (presumably the body) even after the beacon was removed. They all subsequently got killed, too. Nothing I could do would send them back to the safety of the base. Basically, I just got too frustrated to want to continue. If you still want to try this game, get it on super sale. It is just not worth the new lower price of $20.01.			"

												So I guess this is what happened:- Tim Schafer goes to a handful of investors with a prototype for a game. A game that has potential, a game that has that Double Fine sense of humor we all love, and a game that will fill a void in the market that has been left open for far too long.- The investors love it and give Tim Schafer $400,000 to make this game.- Tim Schafer gets addicted to cocaine and hookers and completely blows (heh) all of his investors' money, but just about this time Steam early access was hitting its stride and crafty Schafer cooks up a scheme.- Tim Schafer puts a very early, borderline-developmental build of DF9 up on steam for $25 with a link to a web page promising tons and tons of features - all with a very nebulous timetable attached.- A few months later (and a few inconsequential updates later) Tim Schafer finally cons enough money from hard-working people to pay back his investors (and get himself into rehab). Unfortunately, Double Fine is now broke.- Tim Schafer announces the latest development build as the final release, takes down the webpage with the planned content, and releases the source code in a futile attempt to placate his former fans.- Tim Schafer goes off to further bankrupt Double Fine.tl;dr, DO NOT BUY.  This game is fundamentally broken and lacking in content.I realize game development can be expensive, but I think it's pretty obvious from this and the Broken Age debacles that Tim Schafer isn't particularly good with money. Maybe Double Fine's next project should be an Excel spreadsheet so he can keep track of expenses.Also, I really don't see how releasing the source code, or modding API, or whatever will possibly save this turd.  Modders are not going to want to spend time making a bad game adequate.  I think a complete rewrite of the AI should be the first thing to be done, but by the time they familiarize themselves with the code and rework the game, it'll be months from now. Months of work, just to maybe make the game playable and - best case senario - make Tim Schafer a few more bucks from sales.Tim SchaferTim ShillferTim PilferTim Tookallyourmoneyfer			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.The Game is incomplete and will not be completed. This game was funded via Early Access and because the Early Access version had maybe 40 minutes of gameplay, no one bothered to buy it and Double Fine decided to cut their loses and go straight from mid-alpha to release when it is still full of bugs, and told modders to finish the game for them. They gave out free copies of another game, Hack N Slash, just to be like ""We messed up, Whoops sorry!"" This game is a scam even at 90% off.The game still consists of very little to do. The AI people die from suffocation and other stupid reasons all the time due to poor programming. The start of a new base also leaves very little margin for error.You can find a rant I did about this whole thing in the video below. Avoid Double Fine games in the future.

												This game is based on a really nice idea. It's just not completed yet.Let's start out with management. Since the tiles you are working with is not directly underneath the stuff you're actually building, it's impossible to know if you're for example deleteing just this room, or also deleting the wall for the next room, which would mean all of the oxygen sucked out of your base.Another thing is, that you can't move citizens around. This means, that you'll have to wait with (for example) destroying a room, because there are people in it. It can also be annoying, when you know theres a fire in a place, and you just have to wait until somebody discovers it. Even having the rooms alarm on won't help you. People only notices fires (and mostly also intruders), if they accidentally walks into them.A third thing is bugs. There are bugs everywhere in this game. One bug happens when you have an intruder. You then mark the intruder with an icon saying ""kill this man"". Even if all of your citizens are security guards, they can just be standing, looking at the intruder destroying all of your reactors, and they will first react, when he actually starts shooting at them.OMG thats annoying.Another bugged thing is the airlock, the chamber between the base and space. Here you have two doors, that are never ment to be opened at the same time. Despite that, i've had a whole base killed twice, because the doors sudenly opens at the same time, and everybody is sucked out into space or suffocated. I've also tried people just standing in this room with the outer door opened, waiting until they die, and the door closes again.AHHHHHHHHHThis is just some of the bugs i have experienced. Tough i've tried several times now, my best game has only been finishing my base, and starting to make research, when some stupid bug happens, or some superior enemies destroy your entire base in seconds.If DoubleFine made this game 10 times more solid, i would definetely think it was a good game.But unfortunately for everyone, this game is totally ruined by the crazy amount of bugs and poorly crafted tools in it.

								I love everything about this game.

Sadly, I only got a 1/10th of what I expected, so while I love everything about the game, there just isn't enough to love.			"

								Noble effort, very polished for an Alpha, but simply not enough content or player feedback at this time.It's like feeding space fish right now.  You give them food, you clean the filter, and they do stupid sh** like poop on everything and then eat each other.    Your pH instruments say everything is perfect and yet they die, doomed to float for all eternity at the top of their little aquarium in the universe.As of Alpha, several rooms don't do anything, customization of your base is extremely limited, the UX is uninformative, and your ""Sims"" do random, stupid stuff instead of fixing the life-threatening oxygen pump (despite being assigned to do exactly that).Good luck devs!   Get some more people on the team (I think I saw a blog post that there were 3?!?), and this may be worth the buy in.    "

								This game taught me a 24.99 lesson.  I will never purvhase another doublefine game.  A developer this large should not use the greenlight games as an alternate development strategy.  I am almost embarassed that I purchased this game and the only reason I did is that the green light games I have purchased in the past were KSP and starbound, both excellent purchases.  Remember before buying any greenlight game that you are buying an unpolished and unfinished game as is and the developer, as doublefine affirmed, does not owe you ant future content.  If someone has a game where you can currently jump and play a card game, even if they promise the best RPG of all time, you are buying that game and not what they promise.  I have bought games that have tremendous glitches and that dont start on my laptop through steam and this is the one I am most dissapointed about. This is the one I want my money back for.  I probably own 5 doublefine games on my xbox and I will never buy another game from them due to this experience.  Google this game and read a news article as to why you shouldnt buy it,			"

								Once again, buying early access amounts to buying a half finished failed product. If double fine wanted money security for development, they should not have relied on an audience that have already had to deal with the fact that almost no kickstarter or early access games have amounted to anything. Sure, there are a few gems to come out of these funding sources; however, most end like this. Overpromise, underdeliver, blame people for not giving them more money.

That was a mistake.The game is not just unfinished, its in an Alpha state. Which is sad, because I definetly would enjoy the game if it was done. As it is, the game is entertaining for a couple hours, then quickly grows tiresome and frustrating. The bugs are not crippling, but taken as a whole they represent a game that is very unbalanced and grates on you over time. If DF-9 ever hits the $5 pile, pick it up. otherwise pass.			"

												I was really enjoying this game earlier in the year when I bought it. It was buggy as all hell but I knew it was early access and it had a dedicated team working on every problem. I could see the potential this game had and the creativity it would inspire in the future. Then Double Fine just gave up. They mismanaged their budget for this game and basically said ""Here, you finish it."" I've never been so insulted by a game company since the last time I bought something made by EA. The game is still a broken, buggy mess despite the patches coming out and that trickle of patches will end soon and it will be up to the community to fix it, mod it, add features and make the most out of a game abandoned by its original creators. Double Fine then tried to quell my outrage with a free game...that I promptly gave away. This ugly event has killed any faith I had in Double Fine. I will never buy their products again and they have no one to blame but themselves.Oh, and about their new ""$20.01"" price point...har har har. That's a joke but not for the reason they think it is.

												Spacebase DF-9 lets you create your own space station, managing crew and resources all while staving off pirates and taking hails. It sounds like a lot of fun for anyone that was into Star Trek or even games like Dungeon Keeper 2, but it turns into all of the management and none of the fun. The big issues that I have with the game is that its tough to survive the first few moments of a normal game and beyond that, its just a dull game that forces you to assimilate all metal to keep growing your station to accommodate more crew.Your objective is to keep your crew alive against first asphyxiation and later raiders. Even when your crew dies and the game tells you start a new game, it still continues. It is a game over without being concrete or giving you a final score before you have to start a new game.To start with, there's an optional easy how to play tutorial level that will guide you through the basics without feeling forced upon you. The tutorial makes it easy to get up and running. Assign crew to the roster of jobs. Builders build when you construct rooms or objects. Miners will mine ore to be refined to get more matter to construct with. Technicians fix things and that's about as far as the tutorial gets.You'll need a few things to get a space base operational. The first is power that comes in the form of reactors or a seed to start with. The second is the base itself which can be a giant room. You'll need an oxygen recycler since you are in space after all. After your space base has O2, an enclosed room and power, there's another matter and that's getting in. To do this you need to setup an air lock with two airlock doors one to the interior and the other to the exterior. This room also needs to have a locker for space suits.Outside of the tutorial the giant problem that I have with the game is the level of difficulty when you're even getting started. The tutorial is nice and setup and it does let you continue on playing which is perhaps the best method. Consider that easy mode. You get to select your location and the game tells you how rich in ore and the frequency of attacks. Its a nice choice of difficulty without being a blunt difficulty slider.In normal play, the game starts you with a seed for power and three crew in space suits with limited oxygen. There is so much that can go wrong. Running out of matter before your crew is in oxygen will doom you. So you need to budget building a small room to house the seed, a recycler, food dispenser, and a second for the air lock. Then you need to wait for the station to fill with oxygen and even for the air lock to cycle air in and out. Your spacemen can die in their suits when waiting for an air lock to pressurize. Oh but there is another nail to get caught on and that's the fact ore needs to be converted into matter, so it requires a matter refinery. This getting started kicks off the game and it will scare people away.On paper, interesting things do happen. Derelict space stations will come into your area for you to explore and spaceships will dock with you. From there you have a choice, send your security over to investigate them or ignore them. The spaceships become part of your base where then you need to claim each room, which can be tedious and cumbersome since many small rooms are just tough to click on.People can come aboard infected with a disease and then your science station will be put to work finding the cure. To do so, click whatever science room you've setup and select whatever they should research. There are a number of diseases to cure and upgrades to unlock. Upgrades include things like body armor and heavier doors.You will get attacked from time to time. Raiders will float out in space and either try to shoot your miners as they pass by or they will board your station. Other times vessels will dock with your station and you'll be invaded. The catch is, unless you're watching a mining operation, its easy to spot and prepare for. You can have your security waiting for them, unless they're busy putting out a fire. It seems like more of an annoyance than a fun or cool challenge. You can also purchase wall mounted defense turrets.Normal crew will still engage the enemy if they're in the same room, but to send crew in to fight hostiles, you'll need to assign crew to the security. From there you can make a security beacon that draws them to the area. It feels like an extra step and even marking the point and calling off security seems like it could be streamlined. A lot of the game needs to be streamlined.Once attackers are incapacitated you can act to cuff, uncuff or execute them. In fact you can chose to execute or cuff any of your crew. Its just a little odd. Sometimes they will even chose to join your crew. Once resources become scarce, its just easier to execute them and dump them into the refiners to make matter.Sometimes there is an issue where a firefight in an airlock can down the only crew inside the station. So anyone outside the station is forced to suffocate over time because the air lock refuses to open when someone is in there without a suit. It gets more hilarious because in smaller stations, crew will just stand in the air lock when its too crowded everywhere else. Spacebase DF-9 is an amazing game to watch because of its logic.Speaking of logic, I managed to glitch the game into thinking there was no airlock. Those outside the station would die of asphyxiation and those inside the station would stay in there. Even crew joining would stay outside until they died. Destroying the airlock doors and rebuilding had no effect. Yet I could manually keep a door open so the spacemen could float into my base still in their suits. They would still suffer the same fate with no oxygen. The only way I was able to get people in and out was to build a new airlock.In terms of crew management, when it comes to the roster everyone has an emotion to specific jobs no matter what their skill level is. You can have someone great at botany, yet hates doing it. Crew member you're the best doctor we have! Yeah but they get sad while doing it. Its a realistic and offers a level of micro management. Once you get to a point where you have crew of every class it gets easier since you no longer have people flip jobs such as having a miner one day and builder the next.You get constant hails to answer and decide if you want them to join. It feels like a chore so I opt to avoid the calls. Sometimes the hails are to lull you into security so they can get ""in your base, killing your dudes."" Their transmissions all seems sketchy. There is no one that sounds like a clear cut good or bad choice. They all sound like they're trying to be funny and questionable, because that's what people like in their games, humor and charm. Well both fall flat and it feels forced.Its also annoying having to press the faster speed setting, because the game will drop to normal speed whenever a yellow notice appears. It could be worse by being a popup box that you have to click like in so many other games. These warnings are things such as a crew member is starving or running out of oxygen. These warnings are color coated. Green means an overall hint on what's needed in your station such as more self space. Yellow and brown seem to be specific crew have achieved something or need something. Major warnings like crew being attacked or raiders about to board are in yellow so they blend in. A lot of times I realize we've been attacked after I see the number of crew go down. Raiders look similar to your own crew.Spacebase DF-9 is just a tough game to love when it feels like a tough start followed by dull and uninspired management. It does feel like a fleshed out game with a lot of annoyances. I think scenarios would help extend my interest, but within a few hours I feel like I've seen everything there is to see. With all of that said, it is still worth the one dollar I paid for it.			"

												To start off, i'm more neutral towards the gameplay factor, but i have to give this a negative rating for the fact that DF just abandoned the game when they saw it progressed to slow.But here's the gameplay review, if you're still wondering if you should buy it or not : The game's idea is wonderfull imo : build a base in space, maintain it and welcome new colonists into it while fending off raiders and managing the jobs the citizens do. The way they did it was not bad at all, simple drag-build controlls and assigning the different areas by a simple click of a button and design the interior as you like with various props. Easy. Simple.But the thing that made the game bad is the fact that it's unbalanced, buggy and just unfinished.The A.I is pretty bad in prioritizing their tasks, and with the new mood system there is just no way of keeping them happy, even if you furnish every room and give them their favourite jobs. they all eventualy get depressed and start fighting over nothing, which screws up the whole base and delays tasks as they recover in the sickbay.The gameplay is refined for an Alpha at the time, but there was no change in it whatsoever when it went to V1.0 .I wouldn't recomend the game to someone who disliked game-breaking bugs and dumb A.I , but if you just like building a base and dont mind using mods to fix all of the vanilla game's problems, it is worth buying whenever it gets on sale.But otherwise, i sadly can'r recommend it, sorry Double Fine, but ya kinda screwed it up here.4.5/10 "

												Wasted My money:Turrets have too short of rangeEnemies outside of their ship have just as much health as the ships do...why?Sometimes the lights of the base do not light up when you come back onlineI chose the perfect sector 22-31 where the crime rate was supposed to be extremely low, after a few minutes of playing I get swarmed with raiders.The game was designed with minimal resources as this game has no goal other than sandbox mode and build until the raiders come to destroy you. And if you do manage to thwart off the ridiculous amount of raiders, when you build a decent sized base I got a raider message saying my base was too large and I got swarmed by soo many raiders that even with my base being completely built with turrets on everyother outside block on my base that even this wasn't enough to kill those raiders.Eventually the game AI will always destroy you so very un even programming.There are not many options to customize your base withThere are upgrades but you have to find the plans to them on derelictsBesides raiders in between those raids you have people parking their so called ships on your base and you eventually have to continually play cleanup where you kill the people aboard, select and highlight their ship and try and dismantle it, and once your done finally clearing away their junk it seems another NPC wants to park their ship on your base where it become permanently attached until you tell again your workers to disasemble it.It might have had potential if the game designers decided to spend more time polishing it and expanding the way the surfaces interact...as in raider ships come in at some wierd xyz angle that looks goofy and unrefined.Anyways there is more I can complain about but I would rather throw money at a hole in the wall.-----Do not buy it unless your addiction to buy stupid games and crossed yet another questionable line.----			"

Early Access Review
								Double Fine are giving Early Access a bad name here, by confusing it with crowd funding. This game is overpriced, unfinished and, worst of all, abandoned. The argument that not enough people bought the title to warrant continued development is a silly one, as most people tend to wait for a title that is at least playable before purchasing, no doubt explaining the poor sales. On top of that, they will not be offering refunds, and complaining about the people who did not purchase, Double Fine are just providing an extra slap in the face to those that did. There was so much potential here, but as it stands the AI is a mess & it isn't possible to prioritise tasks so DF-9  becomes an exorcise in frustration.  You may find yourself wanting to create a turret to defend against incoming raiders, but because you can't tell your builders to do so, they'll continue to build a room before the turret and by the time they've finished it's too late and your whole base has been destroyed.Raiders are also occasionally very overpowered, a raider single handedly killed everybody in my base because all of my crew members seemed to just flap about and let themselves die.Even if you get round these issues, there simply isn't enough to do to warrant a purchase, especially at the frankly ridiculous price of £18.99. I will never buy another Double Fine title again. If you'd like to see an Early Access title that never deserted its backers and continues to get more and more brilliant by the day, try Project Zomboid. It's being made by friendly, helpful developers and is 3 times cheaper than this one for at least 10x the content.			"

												Spacebase DF-9 Version 1 plays like a badly designed tower defense game now it has finally been released. Where you get a limited amount of time to build your station and then have to defend it against attackers. In one game I had a raider visiting by shuttle and 2 other ships attemping to breach my station and right after that pirates appeared. My crew went from 9 down to 1 before the last pirate ship appeared.During the Alpha this game was about building a space station and whilst that was its main aim, I quite liked it. But the second it was released, it became something else entirely.Games typically last about 40 minutes before one raider or another wipes you out having magically appeared in a room they did not have access too. I liked this game during the Alpha but now, I am afraid I must give it a thumbs down.... they seem to have ruined it in the rush to get version 1 out. Pretty Sad... If your looking for tower defense games, look else where, if your looking for space station games, try Startopia.			"

												While initially fun and full of promise, this base-building game quickly turns into a frustrating mess.  As a fan of the genre, I'm generally willing to look over minor flaws in base-building games, and when I first fired up Spacebase DF-9, I'll admit I let the excitement of building a space-station get the better of me.  Now, countless hours in, I find myself pinching the bridge of my nose in frustration and dissappointment everytime I boot the game up. The game begins by mousing over an imaginary galaxy to find an area to establish a new space-base.  While I dreamed of building my own Deep Space 9 or Babylon 5 at an optimal location, I found that I needed to spend 5 full minutes dragging my mouse around the galaxy map looking for an ideal location.  Rather than allowing the player to set start parameters, the designers force you to hunt the 2D galaxy map for 4 varying starting conditions, consisiting of generally unclear parameters.  Sure, levels of mining materials, a threat level, and a proximity to a warp gate seemed to make sense since I was a sci-fi fan, but through different playthoughs, they had only small differences.  The final and fourth parameter, Magnetic Interference, remains unclear.  This is because none of these parameters are ever explained, even during the tutorial. Once the game begins, regardless of the parameters selected, the player has but a few minutes to build a basic base before the three astronuats supplied run out of air to breath.  They must be assigned tasks, which, at first are dictated by necessity, and later by NPC prefence, which is shown via an assignment screen using varying degrees of happy and sad faces.The problem with building a basic base is that your resources are so low, no matter what world parameters you set, that you need to be near absolute barebones.  There is very little room for error.  Of course, once basic resources, like air, food and the ability to create building material are met, a player can always expand, and sometimes with ease.  But, this is where bugs, even in version 1.03 begin to appear.I've had my start point pressed up against materials which have made it extremely difficult to start a base.  I've had one of my 3 vital NPCs get caught on what little terrain there is at the start.  NPCs get caught inside fully constructed rooms until you place a door, which usually isn't bad, unless you go pet your cat for 30 seconds and then look up to find everyone dead.  Or, in my last three games in a row, which inspired this review, have NPC's get stuck in terrain that was under construction, rendering the game a death sentence.  Since there is only one save, this requires a new base, which in turn requires mousing over the 2D galaxy for 5 minutes to find starting parameters...Once a player has a basic base up and running, the game begins to punish it much too soon.  Incoming asteroids, disease, incoming asteroids, raiders, incoming asteroids, and NPC incompatibilty all appear just a 4 or 5 rooms into the base.  Did I mention that incoming asteroids will hit your base and ALWAYS target vital systems?  Once a base is established, NPCs start getting sad, angry or upset.  They all have demands.  Nobody knows how to please those demands.  I even doubt the developers know.  I have never found a correlation between the limited items I can place and NPC happiness.  I try to supply them with, say, Monitors.  What do Monitors do?  I have no idea.  Are Monitors cosmetic?  Do they increase Happiness?  Do they decrease stress?  No one knows.In summation:  The game works.  It does some basic stuff.  But, I get so frustrated everytime I bring myself to give the game a 8th or 9th chance than I'd rather watch watch seconds tick by.  Furthermore, I'd like to say that my faith in Double Fine is rattled - a company that once did no wrong has now done wrong.			"

All of which, Would be fine, If the Dev team was working on it, But, Oh, Yeah, I forgot, The Dev's have done absolutely nothing on this game since November 2014.And incase you were wondering, The patch they did back in november, Was not good, It essentially added in loads of broken, Terrible mechanics that completely broke an already not good game, Not its just not playable, Seriously, Do not buy this game, Its terrible.With the Dev team essentially walking away from this game with all the money of their supportrs, You would only be giving those thieves money if you payed for this, Do yourself a Favour and pick up a Different space game ;).Gameplay - 3/10Dev Team - 1/10Bug Support - 1/10Waste of money - 11/10			"

												An abandonware scam, essentially. Double fine stopped work on the game when the money from the initial rush stopped rolling in. Heaven forbid they learn to manage their finances more prudently and move out of ultra-expensive San Francisco offices. Like a financial black hole devouring money vastly out of proportion to the reasonable requirements of a project, it has become apparent that no amount of funding short of a bottomless AAA corporate money pit is too great for Schafer and his gang to squander. No, clearly the better decision is to make bait-and-switch scams like this in between making quirky over-hyped and obscenely over-budgeted hipster adventure games with A-list geek-chic voice talent. For me, this is the last double fine title I'll ever spend money on. Not that they'll ever learn with so many other people begging to throw money at Schafer for whatever poorly conceived swindle he's got lined up next. ""Remember my Lucasarts adventure games and Psychonauts? Good, now shovel money in my general direction to feed my SF hipster pub crawling habit."" As with the pathological liar Molyneux, enough is enough.			"

Doing so would be disastrous for our reputation and would kill us emotionally""Unless they decide to be true to their word and finish what they started then their reputation should suffer.

												I was in love with the potential for this game. I loved dwarf fortress, psychonauts was amazing, what could go wrong?I bought the early access copy since it was Double Fine, these guys are gamers, they get it, they wont mess this up.Well the could be lazy and greedy and  just release half finished ♥♥♥♥ when they get bored thats what.This could have been a truly amazing game. Instead it is a half finished idea, you can still see the  whiteboard brainstorm session. Zones? Incomplete. Progress? Nonexistant. It is a  gesture at dwarf fortress in space but instead of living up to their studios name they just ♥♥♥♥ed off when the cash grab was done.Every time I logged into this game I said to myself ""okay, still a lot of huge problems, but Double Fine will fix it and eventually this is going to be the next iteration of dwarf fortress. I cant wait to see where this goes.""I said that every time I played this game for a few hours, dealing with horrendous AI was okay because hell, its still alpha. They will fix it.I logged into steam today, saw that it was 1.0 and was thrilled. Oh my to go to 1.0 the AI must finally be good! They must have fixed all the hilarious behaviour where a guy repairs an oxygen recycler and then freaks out and dies, finally i can play a base that wont just come undone due to insane citizens after a few hours! Great!I created a new base and was horrified to see the exact same ♥♥♥♥ing problems that made the alpha quite literally unplayable. The citizen ai will guarantee your base will fall apart after a few hours.No matter how smart your contstruction, no matter how carefully you manage the base, some collection of events WILL occur and wipe your base out. And it will be because of the ♥♥♥♥ AI. like telling people to repair a hull breach but instead they all just run around and suffocate. Or when a base adds on to yours and you explore it but then your whole base thinks it would be cool to explore and then they all suffocate and die. My favorite one so far was a guy who refused to build a door to get out of a room even after making him a builder and watching him starve to death, which caused the entire base to become depressed and stop repairing things so the base falls apart.This is infuriating and flatly unacceptableI will never buy another game that has Tim Schafer in the building, and I will never purchase another Double Fine game. if this is how they want to play the game, fine. ♥♥♥♥ them.also the DF = double fine = dwarf fortress?? reference can go eat a ♥♥♥♥. These people are the worst.			"

												This is the game that made me start reading reviews.I bought this thinking that it would be like a sci-fi version on Towns without the clunky crafting system, also it reminded me of FTL. The game was just released in alpha when I got it, so I overlooked the plethora of bugs and unfinished... everything.It didn't get better.I am one of those people who gets angry at videogames, mostly due to something irritating that the devs decided to go with instead of something I think makes sense, and I get over it and come back to the game after a bit. This is the first time I have felt truely cheated by a game dev though. I have put up with the abuse that big companie give their customers like selling DLC that is vital to the game it's being sold for and should come with it stock,(*cough* ea *cough*), and many of you have too, but this is the first time that I have been sold a demo for the price of a full game and then be told that if I want it to be better that I should do it myself. This kind of thing is unacceptable in most other markets.Yeah sure they gave everyone that bought it Hack 'n Slash, but if I wanted that game I would have bought it. I shelled out a good amount of money for a simple indie style game that was not delivered, in any other market I would be entitled to a refund. There should be a class action suite against Double Fine.TL;DRThis game is an over priced and incomplete insult to everyone that bought it. They jumped form alpha 6e to 1.0 and I can't help but feel cheated.			"

Early Access Review
								One of my favourite games from years ago was Theme Hospital, I liked the style and the humour to this end this seemed to scratch a particular itch.Because of this I bought this game when it first came out, it seemed a little buggy but as an early access I was willing to let it slide as they were promising monthly updates and seemed to have a solid list of achievable goals.I played the game until the my guys locked themselves out and suffocated. I thought ""A bug, I'll come back in a couple of weeks""I played it a couple of weeks later, I maxed out the building element of the game, built a couple of each room, hired people based on skills, trained them up etc. not that it made any noticable difference and then a similar thing happened. people suit up go outside and wait until o2 runs out, and so on, and so on, apparently I have done this several times in less than 6 hours of total gameplay over the course of 12 months. Now it's a year after the release date. they're advertising their 6th alpha which is already less than they previously stated and unless they offer an incredible amount of content in their next release they're offering a game that will let your base be built and let the residents lock them selves out and suffocate to death over the course of about an hour and a half.So yeah, save your money, go to the cinema, for once it's better value for money.

												Do not buy this game.When it was in early access, a lot of features were promised early on. A few months into it, however, things changed. Their unfinished game was not selling like it was the next Minecraft so they decided to cut and run. The features of the game were unceremoniously pared down and a date was given for ""1.0"". There is almost nothing to this game. Don't go into this expecting any sort of depth. You can build a dozen or so different rooms and pirates or derelicts will enter the area every so often. Sometimes your citizens will get angry and go on a rampage. That's about the extent of the interaction in the game. This game once had promise but because it didn't sell while UNRELEASED and UNFINISHED every drop of potential was sucked out of it and it was pushed out the door with some bug fixes and a tutorial.

												A side-project by the venerable Double Fine, Spacebase DF-9 had ambitions of being “Dwarf Fortress but in SPACE!”. It’s in space, that part they finished pretty early on. The entire everything else part, the parts that involve managing a large, complex and interrelated system of many smaller systems all working together and against each other, that part they didn’t quite finish. Much of what was promised for Spacebase DF-9 was dropped just before release (the game had been in Early Access for about a year now). The game was given a half-decent tutorial, opened up so users could modify and “finish” the game themselves, and a few meta-goals were added to give the experience a bit of structure.So what you’re left with is something that so painfully looks like the start of something great but then never actually goes there.  You can build your base, take on space immigrants, juggle their needs and desires, fend off raiders and explore derelicts that may appear. But it all feels pointless, unless you chase the arbitrary goals the team shoved in at the last minute, like “have a base with X amount of denizens”. It’s a pity the game didn’t get more support in Early Access, as a lack of interest from consumers is why Double Fine claims to have dropped the project.			"

Once they reached a certain financial threshold they have shamelessly closed the project and skipped from alpha to a final release. However, I will be looking forward for independent modders to turn this frozen 'work-in-progress' into a true masterpiece.			"

												This ""game"" is not worth your time.  The developer and publisher could not be bothered to complete it.  Labelling a game 1.0 does not make it so.  It would be inappropriate for me to speculate where the money that was donated to funding the project went to or what it was actually used for but if the state of the game is an indication it wasn't allocated where it should have been.The only reason you might consider paying money for this is if you are a skilled modder and want to prove your ability to the gaming industry.  It would be very impressive if you could create a release worthy program out of this monument to mediocrity.  Can you accomplish what $400k+ and a bevy of yesterday's news hipsters could not? "

Early Access Review
								Don't buy this.....yet.I figured it would be alpha as in full of bugs. Turns out it's a mostly bug free extremely short demo.There is some promise here. If this turns out to be Dwarf Fortress in space that would be fantastic but it's feeling more like a theme park game at this point. Babby mode easy and when it is ""hard"" it's because your sims are pants-on-head ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and can't follow a basic command.I'm hoping against hope that is actually a bug but I get the feeling it's going to be one of those games where you are infuriated with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sims not doing the most basic task and you have no direct controll over them so you're just stuck yelling at the screen.Just wait. I don't plan to play it again until it's finished. Gameplay issues aside there is almost no content here. I'm not going to boot it up again every time they add a new sprite.			"

												Purchased during Early Access/Beta period as I'm a fan of Double Fine/Tim Schafer and this looked set to be a promising (but not genre-defining) Sims-y colony management game, with a chunky, retro Theme Hospital aesthetic.I wasn't after a lot, just a bit of a casual management game to pass the time when I'm not in the mood for something with a little more meat on it's bones.Entertaining to start off, but gets quite boring, quite quickly once you're fully established; resources and food no longer become a problem. It could, at this point; open up into a Sims-style social management game rather than a resource-gathering and base building game, a switch of pace would have been an interesting way to remove the monotony.However, the devs just up and left the project.It's nowhere near finished. It's an intro to a game that could have been, an early alpha concept piece.Avoid like the Space Plague - unless you're planning on making a video on abandoned games or something, as it really ain't worth it.

												I purchased this game, dispite reviews that suggested it had a lot of bugs and work ahead of it, with the assumption that the game would grow and upgrade as it slowly made its way out of greenlight. Well, that's not the case. Double Fine decides they can't keep working on the game and they leave it filled with bugs and glitches. This is the type of behavior that destroys developers and wrecks the credibility of steam greenlight. I'm so disappointed, this game HAD a lot of potential. I'd only buy completed games now from this developer.			"

The game is unfinished after having the support from gamers to get it started, I really feel like they should give us our money back. Don't waste your time with this game or your money.

Early Access Review
								From the first day up until weeks before the end I was assured that my apprehension about this game was unwarranted. Doublefine has quickly gained a reputation for not satisfying the end consumer and creating products that are merely designed to appear flashy and draw sales and this game is no exception. Billed as Dwarf Fortress in space, with the lofty promises of away team missions and much much more. This game is now being released with barely any content and over a year spent making it barely playable and none of the interesting promises of the roadmap. On top of that they managed to cash in on it not once, not twice but three times. With the Amnesia Fortnight Bundle people actually paid money for the concept to be developed. Then with the kickstarter, people paid the money for the game to be developed. And with early access on steam, people actually paid for these devs to lead extravangant lifestyles. They're software designers in San Fransisco. THey are geniuses. You've gotta tease that genius out with sweet tens of thousands of dollars. It isn't their fauilt the money dried up, and besides they are needed more elswhere. On the next flashy soon to flop Double Fine project. Look out for it!			"

The price hasn't gone up or anything? I guess that's a pro, but maybe the reverse should be a con instead.Cons: A whole lot of other stuff. Paid for but never delivered. You might even say that there's a certain ""artistry"" to the cons, if you take my meaning. I mean, you ""might say that,"" although I would never say that, lest someone take it for slander.

												This game had incredible promise.. but in the continuing saga of Early Access and Kickstarter, it's another confirmation that developers just can't be trusted to deliver on their promises. They've figured out how to sell half-baked demos as full priced games.This is a demo... an interesting demo... but not a finished game. Along with Broken Age, I think that Double Fine has successfully burnt all of their credit with the people that have followed them for years.

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR ANY MONEY. Just read all the reviews others have given it.This game, given another year in development, could have been good. But the alpha version you get here is really frustrating to play:- Only one saved game at a time, and auto save only. So if anything goes wrong, that's all your time wasted.- Quite often when raiding a derelict (which should be a fun thing to do), oxygen levels will drop for no reason and kill all your guys.- A single raider can easily kill way too many of your experienced guys. Even in areas that are meant to have low threat levels and even when your guys are firing back (and because of AI bugs, sometimes they don't).- I've not noticed any difference in the threat level of the main map, because I can get raided once in an hour in a high area, and almost once a minute in a low area. It makes no sense and feels like the map rating wasn't connected to anything.- The AI has serious flaws, the most irritating of which is where your security team WILL JUST STAND there and get killed. Even 10 highly trained guys will stand right next to a raider and let themselves all be killed. There is also a bug where they get confused and refused to enter the base to regain oxygen, eventually dying.- You can't tell your guys to leave an area, which means that once you own a derelict it becomes a magnate for guys and raiders which is no end of trouble. For instance, When raiders retake a derelict, technicians and doctors will all float over and get killed. I know an emergency switch is used for this, but derelicts don't come with any.- You can't pan when in the building menu, which means you have to start all over again if the camera isn't perfect.- You can view oxygen levels, but not power levels, and is seems power units need to be close enough to power things. So you have to guess where power is going.- Oxygen leaks are impossible to spot sometimes if a ****ing raider blows out a wall that's not in an obvious spot. The O2 overlay needs to show leak spots.- Sometime when building a new base, oxygen recyclers don't work.There's enough game here that would be worth checking out if it were free. BUT, because this isn't on early access I can't recommend spending any money on it. There's just WAY too many game breaking flaws that end up ruining your time. The fact Double Fine thought it was OK to continue to charge money for such a broken game, and with no plans to fix any of it, they get a BIG F.U from me. Seriously, I would never trust anything from them ever again (especially their kick starters).			"

								devs announced they are gona finish it soon with 1.0 and that's it. I guess games go from Alpha to finished game now, no Beta needed :P No new stuff, no nothing.. horrable.. complete waste of money.Instead of making the game better, after finishing the engine and ironing the whole game out, you were supposed to start adding lots more content. They just said it's up to modding community to add new stuff from now on and that's it..But they should have improved it and added more content to draw in more players, especially ones that were undecided before they saw this scamm.. It had potential to be a really good game and would have become more popular with a bigger fan base and more money, but devs decided to be jerks..they even changed the dev plan they had on their website, you can compare them here:promising and cool plan - http://web.archive.org/web/20131018054131/http://spacebasedf9.com/devplanscheaty scamming money grab plan they made last minute - http://spacebasedf9.com/devplansI can't recommend spending money on this..

												UPDATE: So Double Fine finally pushed the '1.0 launch' and at least props to them for trying to repair some goodwill damage by offering up Hack N Slash (their recently launched game) for free to previous supporters (prior to 1.0) of this game. It takes a bit of the sting away though unfortunately I still wouldn't recommend this game at it's current price of 20 bucks.In summary, Double Fine made a lot of faithful customers lose a lot of trust in them and I strongly advise anyone to carefully re-consider throwing money towards Double Fine for any of their future Early Access games.ORIGINAL REVIEW: DO NOT buy this game and DO NOT buy from Double Fine until they can prove that they aren't an immature developer that renege on promises made by exploiting the community's goodwill.You don't just go to v1.0 after sparse alpha updates and lack of any real content. Terrible planning, terrible cop out, and terrible damage to their reputation. I would rather recommend buying a $1 dollar completed Flash game 20 times instead of buying this.			"

												Under normal circumstances this game would have been cancelled in mid production when the devs realised it was not going to be any good. Unfortunately, because it was released as an ALPHA and people paid money for it and the devs can no longer cancel the project without refunding users a LOT of money. This is one of the pitfalls of ""Early Access"" games. If a company realises the game is fundamentaly flawed they can't just pull the plug and cut their loses. Instead, what we are left with is an unfinished game that doesn't know what sort of game it is supposed to be and is completely uninteresting after the first half-hour of play.			"

A game simply doesn't go from ""Alpha 6"" to ""♥♥♥♥ you we got your money it's finished"".On top of that the AI are all as stupid as ♥♥♥♥! They will build and repair oxygen tanks LAST and destroy them when unhappy therefore killing themselfs. There is no easy way to calm down an angry person apart from killing them... Or is it just me that does that? Sure there is mod support but no steam workshop so mods aren't as easily avalible. Anyone who bought this game during early access is propably weeping in pain, writing a negative review or playing this game along with it bugs. Don't get me wrong, it's a good game that will get you 30+ hours of play time but it's no longer worth the price tag.EDIT 1: Revisited the game several months later to notice how the already stupid A.I. WILLINGLY sufficate themselves to death as I have zero percent control.EDIT 2: Did the same as above again, played the game for a few hours, then 38 pirates arrive in multiple ships all at the same time (Not one after another) and completly demolished everyone before suffocating themselves to death.

This is incredibly disappointing from what I thought was a very reputable/trustworthy/good development studio. It doesn't take a brain surgeon to load up the game and see that some very key features are missing. This game has no endgame, seriously, none. I genuinely was not following development because I never expected something like this to happen, but it very clearly shows the flaws in early access and I regret purchasing this title.-Full of bugs, still. No matter what the patch notes say there are tons.-Has that annoying as ♥♥♥♥ trend where early access games cost MORE than the final release. Really? I am paying you MORE to test your game for you? Why? Whose idea was that?Just don't buy it. Doublefine has to realize that ♥♥♥♥ like this is not okay and good reputations are easily sullied.  "

												I got Spacebase DF-9 a while back when it was in Early Access.  My hopes were high, as I've enjoyed some of Double Fine's previous games quite a lot, and the game's website gave the impression that the completed product would be rich with gameplay and features.  I suppose it was foolish of me to believe what I read/watched.  As you probably have already heard, the game was not, and will not be finished.  The released game doesn't come even remotely close to what the website claimed was in production.  I'm actually a little surprised that Double Fine is even releasing what is essentially a demo for sale to the public, rather than just sending its funders an apology letter and a credit for a free game.It is shameful for Double Fine to call this a finished product, and the fact that they did so says a lot about their business practices as well as their apparent lack of commitment to quality.

												Previously I would've recommended it, until the developer announced that they were dropping the game so soon.I was a backer since the start. Although it had been left in a playable state, with the code made open source for the community to develop on, it's still a kick in the nuts that the game is left at only a fraction of what they promised Spacebase DF-9 was going to be.Everything works you see, but there are issues:-----> AI are still dumb at times. I've seen people stand in a corridor when a meteor shower hits the base, or people outside the airlock suffocate because they're waiting in line and their suits run out of oxygen.> Limited gameplay. Once you've built a self-sustaining base thats it. You're done. No more challenge outside of the occassional random events or purposely putting yourself into a situation.> Limited reply value. You get one save file and one base, unless you manually switch them out in folders. Every replay is building the same base again until you come up with an efficient design that always works - its more of a time waster.> No more official development. You'll recieve support, but any further addons are now in the hands of the community.-----If you're looking for a time waster with simple space-base building mechanics, then maybe this is for you. Its quick to load, with enough advanced features to keep things interesting while you don't have to micro-manage everything.If you're looking for a game to compare to Space Engineers however? I'd suggest saving that money. You'll likely make one base or two, learn the mechanics, develop a strategy to quickly 'win' everytime and then get bored quickly.Its a damn shame this game didn't make enough money so was dropped.

								Never thought I'd not recommend a product from Double Fine Productions. Spacebase DF-9 has  a very interesting concept behind it. Even in Early Access I had my fun, besides some very screwy bugs. But that's to be expected. Lots of features weren'timplemented, so it only could get better!But, no big monthly updates as promised. And now suddenly they pull the plug and willjust slap 1.0 on it and 'yeah!' a release has been born!Which is really a kick in the nuts for every one showing faith in them to give money alreadyin Early Access stage. Early Access isn't supposed to be a risk and isn't supposed to be funding model at all. But it was used by DF that way. Gambled and lost. Investors got money back.We are left behind with an empty shell of a game.So nope, don't bother with this game at all.			"

Early Access Review
								It was once a very promising pre-release title, great goals, great plans, sadly, thanks to the developer paying himself more than any normal developer earns (significantly more) and the typical miss-management that DoubleFine has become famous for the game ended up being far from what it could have achieved...The promise was a Dwarf Fortress meets Startopia, a Dungeon Keeper in space with the ""fun to fail"" attitude that Dwarf Fortress brought to the building genre. What we got was a good and entertaining simulation that grows boring after a few hours, repetetive and chaotic. With too many downsides to really enjoy the game.Simple things like not being able to rotate items, or not being able to place specific items on two of the four walls (either due to the inability to rotate, the lack of graphics for the other two walls or other design failures are not known). Or like not having a better control over what is done well...If you like games like this, play Prison Architect instead, it already contains easily three times as much, and their developer is doing a great job. And it costs less... this game would be a nice game for ten bucks, and if it's on sale, pick it up. But for how much they want... hands off.			"

												Unfortunately, the game is being released WAY before it's ready.The worst part is DoubleFine is playing it off like it's such a wonderful thing, and aren't we all so lucky. Why not just tell us ""Sorry, we didn't get enough money to continue development, but here's what we'll do - giant bugfix/polish patch, release sourcecode. We hope you guys can make the game we couldn't afford to!"" That would at least have had the respect for the players and Early Access supporters that seems ""right"" to me. Deleting the old ""roadmap"" seems particularly dishonest at this point as well.However, that's just me with my silly morals and standards and respect and honesty. I don't have to run a business and make decisions like ""let's pretend this is great when it's actually crap."" Sorry, DoubleFine, but you've managed to massively damage my opinion of you with the way you're handling this. I know you're just publishing GangBeasts, but there's now NO WAY I'm putting money into that until it's actually finished. And if too many people feel that way, will it stagnate and suffer the same fate as DF-9?-----I'll try to make an update to this review once the so-called-1.0 version comes out, and see if it's actually some working skeleton of a game.As it is now, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME AT ANY PRICE.It simply does not work as a game. Stuff happens and your base will die, and there's nothing you can do about it. Just after the latest patch version, I lost an entire base to one raider, because the security team was either standing around and getting shot, or running away (and getting shot). None of them ever bothered to attack the intruder. Not even once. Your base will catch fire from asteroid impacts and your inhabitants will gleefully panic-run right into the flames and die, instead of grabbing the fire extinguishers you've placed across the base and actually doing something constructive. Someone will decide that they absolutely need to do floor pushups right in your airlock door, and then everybody will suffocate to death.These things are quite forgivable in an alpha game. Frustrating, but understandable. It's alpha, I get it. Things might be broken or unfinished. I'm fine with that. But if ANY of this crap manages to slip into the 1.0 release? That's just garbage.(Edit: Apparently The S-Word is too raunchy for a review. Sigh.)----1.01 UpdateIt has improved nothing at all.No. I absolutely do not recommend. It continues to just not work. I started two bases today after the 1.01 patch, the one designed to ""finish"" the game. I see no significant improvements. Build orders are randomly followed, regardless of importance. Citizens start ""running away"" for no obvious reason. Random station boarding parties still utterly annihilate you base regardless of the number of security personnell you have assigned. Security teams clearing derelicts still seem to think that actually shooting the hostiles is a silly concept.But hey, at least now there's a tutorial! A rather unnecessary one, since the game mechanics are not at all complicated, and I felt were very obviously conveyed through normal play. The problem isn't the players misunderstanding the game mechanics - it's that the game simply doesn't f-ing work.----Final Final recommendation:DO NOT PURCHASE THIS. EVER.Secondary recommendation:Never trust DoubleFine again. Only buy a product once it has been actually released, and you've tried it, and it actually works, and the community is being treated well. Do not give support (either financial or social) to companies that make bad decisions. And especially not companies that make bad decisions, then try to tell you how great their decisions actually were.			"

												It has many bugs and not a lot of content. If you don't have high expectations, there is some fun to be had, but be prepared for potentially game-breaking bugs. For example, in my first 1.0 base, one of my first colonists got sucked out of the airlock because it opened for someone else after he had taken his suit off. That left me down a person and made the early game much more difficult. In my second base, the seed pod didn't spawn and one of my colonists spawned stuck in part of an asteroid. I decided to just restart at that point. My third base is going better, but the AI doesn't work very well even when it isn't bugging out completely. My builders will often stand around chatting or working out even though they have a bunch of stuff to do.Ultimately, it just doesn't feel like a proper release. I can see building a few more bases, but there's just not enough content to keep me coming back.			"

												After playing for several hours, all I can conclude about this game is that it's excessively frustrating.First off, the tutorial lacks a lot of important information.  No mention that you have to build aesthetic stuff all over to keep up morale, no proper explanation of what most of the structures/objects do or why you should care about them.  I lost three bases to everyone flipping out on each other before I pulled up the (terribly-made) wiki and a starter's guide said to scatter cosmetic stuff everywhere to keep people happy.The interface, while thematically good at first, gets very old very fast.  Every UI element is oversized, and everything flickers like an old TV set with every interaction, and everything has horizontal lines through it like an old computer monitor.  It gets grating and hard on the eyes rather quickly.  Event warnings on the right side of the screen can be minimized (usually), but not dismissed, even for minor alerts, or ones that no longer apply.You have no direct control over the citizens of your station, which is fine, but it means that when they're all ignoring your orders - which happens fairly often - you can't do anything about it.  The closest you can get to controlling anyone is setting people to the ""security"" job and setting a beacon  - they'll jog over and stand near the beacon, but that's all you can do.  You can't prioritize commands, or set a ""do this first"" type thing on anything, so if you need a room built NOW, you have to go across the entire map and cancel every other build/dismantle task.  If things fall into disrepair, technicians take FOREVER to fix them - each time they work on something, they only improve it by a few percentage points, and then wander off again.  You also can't set anyone to do more than one task - a guy can build things, or repair things, but not both unless you constantly toggle his settings in the roster screen.Raiders and derelict ships spawn far too often and too regularly - it's not at all random.  If you don't get ""security"" to respond in time to raiders, your citizens will just wander through and drop one by one.  Seriously, multiple times I've lost almost my entire station's population to single raiders because nobody has the sense to run away when they're being shot at, or security gets there one at a time and just drops.A known bug (I'd say it's a bug, anyway) with derelict ships is that sometimes they'll just ""drift away"" with your people still on-board.  What this means is that the derelict despawns - taking your people with it.  This means you have to very quickly ""claim"" every part of the derelict to prevent that, at which point it's treated like part of your base - including constant alerts that it's not connected to the power grid, and citizens will wander over to it and just hang about, making it impossible to safely dismantle.  This also includes warnings about rooms on the ship not being tended to properly, even if you've already flagged everything to be dismantled for materials.  Heaven forbid you don't tend the garden on that ship you plan to scrap (by the way, it mentions this only in passing in the tutorial, but you NEED a garden - it provides food that doesn't eat through your resources like the food-dispenser does.  And you need a bar with full facilities to serve/store that food properly - also only hinted at).Researching new technologies/illnesses isn't discussed at all in the tutorial, nor does it say how gardens work, or what to do with incapacitated-but-alive raiders.  It doesn't talk about building a brig, or whether you can ever do anything with these raiders - you only find out on third-party guides that EVENTUALLY these raiders can convert to citizens if they're confined long enough.  And your own citizens will freely wander through the brig, even if occupied, and get injured/killed by captured raiders.""Passing ships"" also happen like clockwork, and get spammy.  The sense of humor in all the dialogue is great and everything, but it wears thin after the 200th ship in a 2-hour session, especially since most of the somewhat-limited encounter types seem to play out the exact same way every single time - either they give you more citizens, or they send raiders.  If you tell them to go away, they either go away, send citizens anyway, or send raiders anyway.  And you almost always know exactly what it'll be the moment it pops up.  Passing ships also turn off timelapse - you'll be going along at 4x speed to get something built, then it pops back to 1x so you can tell some guy to bugger off because you have no more room for more people.  And he may still send more citizens, in which case you have to quickly build beds/rooms for them to stay in or they'll start throwing tantrums and send station morale into the toilet.I'm sure there are other issues I've forgotten to mention, but I think this gives a decent idea of how obnoxious this game is to play in general.

Early Access Review
								I feel like I am jumping on a bandwagon, but whatever. The devs just bailed on the game, leaving me with mixed feelings. Releasing the source code is kind of nice, and at the same time is quite useless in itself.This is a game which was ""prototyped"" in a fortnight. Which meant it was written on a language enabling quick prototyping. In this particular case, Lua, which I don't think is precisely the best programming language to develop a project so ambitious as this one was sold to us as being. What sold me the early alpha back in October 2013 was the vision. If I knew the vision was backed by that, ehm, questionable technological foundations, well, certainly my scepticism about the whole enterprise would have been higher.On the other hand, the writing was on the wall for all of us to see. The development team promised monthly major updates and a continuous stream of bug fixes between updates. That development wasn't going quite right for this title was obvious when those updates started to lack regularity, at some point after February 2014, right after the ""Amnesia Fortnight"". Indeed, Double Fine seemed to forget about this one, since the fortnight turned out to be a couple months. Since then there have been ""major updates"", but to be honest, I am not sure that the new features added since May are that interesting, well thought out or functional, as the ""backbone"" of the game. Which I now reckon hadn't changed much between February 2013 and February 2014.I'll look forward to the source code release. It will be good to see how things were implemented, and probably will inspire others to take up the concept. It will also, to be blunt, allow to rewrite the f*cking thing using tools actually meant for this kind of job (say Unity and C#, or Unreal/Cry Engines and C++). In that sense, hats off to the devs of Spacebase DF-9 and to Double Fine for putting this into the public domain. Of course, this last paragraph will only make sense to people like me, who understand and appreciate the real hackers' ethics. What I don't appreciate at all is that this comes out of the blue, without saying a ""we're sorry but the early access revenue wasn't enough to support development"". Which would have been a very a straight way to approach the community, without giving excuse to people to think that they have been duped. I also see some astroturfing going on: it seems like some community management person is trying very hard to spray a giant smiling emoji on top this. And failures like this one are sad.So I'd say that Double Fine doesn't deserve a sale of this title unless  You appreciate the release of the source code to the public domain as an inherently good thing. You look forward to someone to take up the torch and actually take this ball all the way to the touchdown line.If you're just interested in a game that you can play now and you can get value for money, just stay away, and look out for that rewrite I mention above.DISCLAIMER: if the source code turns out to come out with a very restrictive license, i.e. one that prevents people from doing what I suggest above, then I'll be sure to come back to this review and use very different terms.

Put out a dev post that states that updates are going to improve;4. Run a 50% Steam sale to judge further interest;5. Dump unfinished, incomplete game as a ""1.0"", state modders can take it from there when sale evidently doesn't make you enough cash;6. Prove your studio is an undirected ship running onto rocks, dump all over the EA model, ensure that I will never buy a DF game again.7. DO NOT PROFIT!!!edit: And now 1.0 is released.  Guess what?  It's still basically a tech demo in terms of content, and is still buggy as all get-out.  You ripped off a lot of people, Double Fine.So you like games that do what SB-DF9 couldn't be bothered to do?  If you don't mind older graphics, you will likely enjoy:- StarTopia: very similar in scope to DF9, but miles better- Space Colony HD: leans more toward ""The Sims"" in peep interaction, but still a worthy effortYou can buy both of these cheap over at www.gog.com.

 Overview  Spacebase DF-9 is a survival game in the wide-reaching void of, you guessed it, space. Your mission is work with a trio of astronauts and build the most sophisticated, comprehensive and long-lasting space station anyone has ever seen. That sounds amazing on paper, and being developed from the veterans over at Double Fine Productions, you’d almost be assured a great game. However, the product falls short and development has long since died for this title, leaving an ugly mess in its wake. In space, nobody can hear you complain.The game opens up with an interesting concept at first – a map laid out with all the locations in the galaxy, letting you pick where you want to start and factoring in variables like meteor showers, derelict ships, traffic for earning more crew members [good and bad] and resources. Once your base is selected, you’re launched into space with three crew members, a space pod for power and oddly, no spaceship; the game starts you out in the dead of space with limited oxygen, limited supplies and a very short time span before your whole crew perishes from asphyxiation. From a logical standpoint, the start of the game makes absolutely no sense and it only gets worse from there.You must quickly build a functioning center with enough life support for your crew. You’ll gather material from nearby asteroids that oddly resemble play-doh, which you will ingeniously craft into oxygen recyclers and stations for power with nothing but a blowtorch and your wits. As the base grows, you’re able to expand, making different rooms that can be retrofitted into housing, laboratories, pubs, infirmaries and more. I like the aspect of building a base to my own liking, but Double Fine really chokes the life out of personalizing it as you see fit: limited items to use, each room can only use furniture from one list of items [I.E. only residential furniture in a residence] which forces you to build a lot of unnecessary rooms for no reason at all. However, my biggest complaint is being in space and not being able to build along the Z axis; you can only build outward, not vertically, which seems like a huge oversight since you’re not hindered by the laws of gravity.As you continue playing, you’ll encounter hazards that you must overcome, such as illness, resource management [marginally], machine repairs, raiders [space pirates] and meteor showers. Most obstacles aren’t all that exciting: meteor showers are not impressive and barely noticeable if the game didn’t tell you it was happening, space pirates have terrible AI capabilities and can easily be killed with a few well-placed defense turrets and most ailments can be cured by simply sending them to the doctor, curing them nearly instantly. Oddly, some of the ailments have auto-cures, such as when I was afflicted with “Space Blindness”, which I was promptly told there was already a cure so I didn’t have to do anything.The real gem to this travesty is the writing, or the lack of a proper writer. Here’s an example of the type of “communications” you’ll received while in space:

I felt secondhand embarrassment just reading it. The writing is dreadful, out of place and just downright terrible. Couple that with other gems like my dead astronaut having a “kinda happy” job satisfaction while simultaneously being dead, but the real winner is that her location is “space”:

Yes, everything in this game has ""space"" attached to it. Your location, beds are called ""space beds"" and even rugs are called ""space rugs"" because your typical Ikea rug is not suitable for the vacuum of space apparently.I could go on and on with all the issues with this game, but in the end it has been abandoned completely by Double Fine and is left at the hands of 3rd party modders if they feel like investing their time in such a project. Much like my crew member Nashira Corrino, this game is dead, asphyxiated by its own mediocrity.  Pros   There are none. Cons  
 The entire game is a con. There are too many to list. The game has been abandoned. Stay away.Overall, Spacebase DF-9 is an absolute mess with broken AI, poor graphics, terrible UI and even worse sound effects. There is literally no reason for you to play this unless you’re punishing yourself and even less reason to buy it unless you’re sending it to someone in hopes of terminating a friendship.			"

Early Access Review
								Plenty of people have already said this, but more voices never hurt: do not buy this game. It has been pushed from an ALPHA build to 1.0 in ONE UPDATE because the developers ran out of money. The game is mediocre at best - I managed to get almost thirty hours of fun out of it, but I really love this genre. It feels like a hamburger without cheese. You can enjoy it, but the entire time you feel like something essential is missing. Paying 25 dollars for a less than half-finished management game that still suffers from issues it had in the first build ever released (people forgetting to get out of their spacesuit in an airlock and suffocating, panicking when there's low oxygen and running until they choke instead of building more oxygen generators, trying to stomp out fires when there are extinguishers nearby) is a joke. Spend your money on the unfortunately-named RimWorld instead.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS UNFINISHED GAME - Well, I can say that I will never ever buy a single double fine game again ever.  This is the biggest INTENTIONAL slap in the face to a fanbase that I've ever seen a video game company do.  Move over EA you've got competition for biggest scumbag video game company now.  As someone who bought into the 'early access' scam they were doing for this game, I can't even begin to tell you how far off the 1.0 'release' is from what we were promised a year ago.  To simply say that they're not going to follow through on their development promises because it's not cost effective?  That's sickening.  They had a lot of people give them money based on their development plan.  Are those people getting refunds since they aren't getting the promised product or anything even remotely close to it?As to reviewing the actual game, it's got the great bones for a game.  It is what it is...  an ALPHA build for an unfinished game.  DO NOT BUY.			"

												My review will look similar to what most other people have probably written, but at any rate the developers for this do not deserve your money.I bought the game when it was still in Early Access. It had some cool functions to it, was fairly simple, and felt almost like a simplified, more accessible Dwarf Fortress in space. I wasn't too concerned with the lack of available features or amount of glitches, as most of what I wanted was to be released anyway through updates leading up to the final release.Well, as you probably already know, the developers essentially shredded up their list of short/medium/long term goals in one night, and suddenly the game ""went gold"". It was a very disappointing turn of events, to see a title with such promise basically wind up as a hollow shell of what it could have been (and should have been, based on what was promised the gamer base by the makers of the game originally). Basically, don't waste your money - you'll get maybe a couple short, bugged-out playthroughs of the game but it's just lacking any amount of depth to really get you playing up to even half your money's worth.

Early Access Review
								It's probably best to avoid this. The game was apparently reliant on early access funding and didn't sell enough copies to continue development past an extremely barebones set of features. Not sure why Double Fine decided on an extremely risky business model.It's worth noting that I haven't been able to play for more than about an hour without some kind of show-stopping bug as of the patch before they call the game complete. The AI is dreadful and has a habit of doing the worst thing possible, like suffocating when there's a working airlock and oxygen generators. It's not very likely that all of the issues will be tidied up in the month or so they had left on development.It's a genuinely great idea and with another year or so of dev time I could really see it shaping up to be worth the money. For now it's not worth the money, and likely won't be once it leaves early access.			"

												Fact is, this game is not complete.That aside it is amusing/fun for a while (2-4 hours) then it just becomes frustrating. There are so many bugs in this game it begins to get on your nerves. On top of that, crew members regularly go on a rampage killing multiple people making it rather difficult to keep your base running. On my last playthrough a week or so ago, walls kept randomly disapearing. This wasn't caused by some random event, they just left, gone never to be seen again. When this happens to both your airlocks at the same time, GAME OVER.			"

												Vaporware isn't even the word for this. It went from alpha to released, unfinished, and the devs are censoring the discussion threads because of how people critisize their obvious idiocy. I'm never even touching another double-fine game in my life because of this. Plus, it was an obvious abuse of the early access system to get money.

												Stay far away from this game. It is totally unfinished and was just named 1.0 to gather a few more sales. It didnt make enough money and thus was abandoned by Double Fine. This is especially ""great"" after they expressively stated that they are ""not some kind of fly-by-night developer"" who would just abandon a game in early access. Well this is exactly what they did. The game itself is quite buggy and unfinished. DF relased the sourcecode and just left it up to the fans to fix it.

												Another in the recent series of mismanaged games that ran out of budget. Between Hack n Slash being a major disappointment and Broken Age being mysteriously broken in half and the entire budget being blown on the first half, I'm really beginning to doubt Double Fine's ability to publish games these days. I got this for free. FREE. From Double Fine. They sent owners of Hack-n-Slash this game, and the other way 'round, as some sort of twisted joke.The game itself has been abandoned and the lengthy list of features that would possibly make this into a compelling and enjoyable game was scrapped. It's not even to what I'd call a true beta stage yet (i.e. feature complete, only fixing bugs) and they just slapped a 1.0 on it and left everyone who paid full price holding the bill.At this rate, I'm seriously concerned about them being able to pull of the HD remake of Grim Fandango.

												I want to like this game, I really do. But I just can't.There are basic bugs and glitches with the AI and a failed priority system for tasks that add up to more frustration than progress - long before you get to the core balance issues. The biggest flaw if I need to point at any is a seemingly over-complicated mood system that is dependant on too many factors that lets it easily sway too far too fast. Early expansion is a difficult grind struggling with a  crew that doesn't work into that mid to what I think is later game starts to drag on far too easily as it gets harder to manage even basic needs with the limited resources income.I admit it does sound nice, and can have promise - but it just doesn't seem to have enough behind it at the moment to get it there, or at least in the direction the game wants to go without doing something of a major overhault to some key aspects to smoothen the gameplay.Try it out maybe on a cheap sale, but this is definetly not one I'd be willing to reccomend at a higher price.

												Dissapointing....  Back when the game was in early development I fell victim to its ""appeal"".  I saw a game with potential and I was all and all hopeful.  In those ealier days the game was riddled with bugs and glitches, and when I found out they were dropping the game and rushing development, I was hopeful they would eliminate those bugs and glitches in the game.  So as a review of the official release of version 1.06 here is the breakdown.  I'll have a simple review and more in depth... or in this game... anger driven review...----- Simple ----The game is crap... It had so much potential but since it got the axe and a speedy release... it has so many issues.  I honestly tried to play the game again... but yet I wasn't able to play longer than 10 minues.  I would not recommend this game to anybody unless it's less than a dollar or given to you free.  It's buggy... rough to control, and just honestly crap.----- Angered Version -----Graphics:As this is not a ""Highly graphical"" game I wouls say they are acceptable.  The sprites perform actions that is befiting, and nothing to standoutish.  However in aspect of gameplay the ""isometric"" angle makes the game difficult to know exactly what is going on.  In the typical fashion the walls disappear in a way to allow you to see in the rooms, however being able to roatate the camera would be nice.Gameplay:This is where the game loses me.  Although the controls aren't ""hard"" they are difficult in there own way.  I've played many builder games, and most games play similarily with minor adjustments to the controls.  In more recent terms since the era of shooter games almost every game depends upon the W-A-S-D model.  This game doesn't stray too far fram that idea and it feels comfortable... at least until you start building.  At that point the game takes a turn for the worst.  Edge scrolling doesn't feel like it's in existence, so your dependant upon the WASD model, but once you open the construction menu, foul language fills the mouth as when you click with your mouse to select the item and press ""D"" to move your contruction item changes.  As soon as that construction menu comes up the game shifts from a comfortable WASD model to a point and click model.  This wouldn't be a problem if they didn't establish you could use the WASD in the first place....   So that is annoying.  Then it gets worse.  As you play you decide to speed up the game, and most games using some button near the WASD (tab, 123, something) changes the game speed, but in comes the mouse model, and you have to click the speed options.  Now I wouldn't have an issue with this, if it wasn't for the fact that when any ship arrived or any notification appears the game switches back to speed 1.... and DOES NOT RETURN.....I find it quite annoying because I'll be in the middle of waiting for my characters to build a room... then all the sudden a message... then the question, ""Why are my guys moving so slow""... then oh gotta click that speed... then the game goes NOPE... and another message.  It just continually pesteres you until you get so angry that you give up.AI:I don't normally judge AI as it's always an issue with all games.  It is always about finding that right balance between what the computer needs to process and what the character prioritizes.... unfortunately it appears that this game said, ""F*$k it... have the guys do whatever.""  And like loyal programs they do whatever.  You have absolutely no control over the individual character, so when your trying to finish that bed... your have to wait until the game decides... ""know what I think I should build that bed.""  But at that point your characters are now falling over because they are so tired... that they have no energy... then get depressed and not want to work... so now that bed will never get done.... it annoying the bleeping crap out of me as I was just trying to enjoy the game.Glitches and Bugs:Yes I'm bringing it up... as a ""fully"" released game you would expect most of the bugs and glitches to be taken care of... in fact thats what most of the follow up forums established... but know what.... turns out that your characters get stuck (dumb AI) and because you can't do that they sufficate.... yeah... so just started finished the basic build... airlock... air... and such... but oh no... two of my guys just sat there... doing... NOTHING... could it be AI? probably... but to me that's a bug.   But it's not the worst oh no... in my honest to goodness no opinion try I got ""invaded"" another ship attached itself to me, and I was assulted.  After killing the AI I noticed, Hey there is a gun outside...  Then I slowly watched one of my security guards go out to take care of it.... two shots later dead.... ok..... so what does the AI do?  ""Well he's dead... probably should take care of that... but naa....""  Guess where my miners had to go to get resources?  Right in the line of fire.... so there goes two of my miners...  Well maybe I can control a security... oh wait can't control the guys so whoops... maybe set a security point for them.... nope... dead... dead and dead.....  I'm happy they incorperated the guns for defences... but when a gun is established as enemy and even if you took over everything it appears that that guns still acts hostile....  My frustrations knows no bounds.Overall the game is fine.... just fine.... not great... not good... just fine.... if you want something new to distract you for 10 minutes... here is the perfect game for you... but don't buy unless it's on uber sale.... and by uber sale like... I dunno $0.99 per copy... or heck maybe if the company pays you to play... becuase honestly this game isn't worth anything more.			"

												As of 1.01 This game is a buggy mess*. You can't say still, because prior to 1.0 it was an alpha build. So: alpha -> release. This ""release"" is just a giant finger for the backers, a disgrace for DF, a disservice to Early Access and alltogether shouldn't even be allowed on Steam. It certainly would not have been greenlit if it had tried.Besides the buggyness, there are a lot of design-issues which would have needed to be ironed out before release (no building priority, crew-AI, control over security, ridicoulus menus...).The idea was good and the prototype (not the alpha) fun to play. It is still, more so than this game.tl/dr: Please don't buy it.*To give some examples:-pathing is bugged, making at times airlocks not functional, killing all your crew currently in space-hostiles appear frequently with mostly no time for you to prepare, decimating 3 out of 4 attampted bases of mine in 5 minutes after start-builders pop out of their space suits randomly, ending up in rooms connected to nowhere, slowly starving-bad seed-generation, starts you out with your crew and/or seed-pod encased in astroids and nothing you can do about it			"

 This game is a scam. Do not touch this game. It has been rushed to ""completion"" after the developer failed to deliver promised monthly updates and supposedly ran out of cash. They returned their original investor's cash mind you, but they banked on using gamer's (Early Access) cash to subsidize the development, greatly overestimating the monthly sales for an unfinished piece of garbage. Maybe if they had kept up with updates it would have sold better, that seems to have been key in most other successful Early Access titles.The greatness of the game's concept (found at http://web.archive.org/web/20131018054131/http://spacebasedf9.com/devplans) pales in comparison to the terrible nature in which this games development and budgeting was handled. Avoid at  all  costs, developers should receive no incentive to pull these types of moves on fans and consumers.This game is unfinished, awful, and I'm ashamed to have supported it in any way. The pride with which they present this abysmal product that cashed in on their own fan equity completely turns my stomach. ""We’ve learned a lot and are proud of what we managed to accomplish, and it’s all thanks to your support."" Double Fine, I think a lot of your fans can also say they learned something during this escapade and I doubt you'll like what effect that's going to have on future support for any titles bearing your now tainted brand.TL;DR / What should I play instead? - Don't buy this unless coerced through physical violence.

												This is a post-release review.  Previously I had recommended it while it was in early Alpha.  In early Alpha, I did recommend it because it showed great promise and looked like it was going to be improved greatly as development continued.  As it was Double Fine - I had high hopes.  Admittedly, I probably shouldn't have gotten my hopes up for any game that is early access.  I highly encourage you to buyer beware for any early access games you may wish to fund in the future.A note on the current status of Spacebase DF-9: It is considered, by the developers, to be complete enough for a full release.  Currently they're bug squashing and finishing some other small details on their development list.  That's it.  They're done after that.  There will be no future development done to this game for the foreseeable future, according to the developers.  They may not get back to it for at least 2 years, at minimum.  Buyer beware.On to the review:I have only played it for about 2 hours since it's official release.  While it still retains the charm and brutal difficulty as most games of this genre (ala Dwarf Fortress), there hasn't been that much added since the last builds of the early access Alpha.  The graphics are passable, the sounds are passable, the text and artwork definitely has the Double Fine touch that many love and enjoy.  The actual game play and game design is a hollow shell, crying for more.  Should you survive for at least an hour to hour and a half, you will have built everything that is needed.  The rest of the game is simply adding more space for more crew members, taking care of their needs, fighting off the occasional raider/parasite, researching the lack-luster tech tree, and preparing for the “end game” fight with the raider mega-fleet (which also completes the game; I believe).  I'm unsure if the raider mega-fleet actually ends the game or just scores you as I simply got too bored waiting for the mega-fleet to show up.  I built everything I wanted, I raided derelicts for tasty materials, and I threw the troublemakers in my station in a brig or two.  Not to mention dealt with some of my own bugs that are still hanging around since the Alpha builds.Amongst some of the issues with the game: No varied save slots for more than one base at a time, vague tutorial, unrealized or fully implemented concepts, inability to clean up blood stains (at least no way I have found out), questionable fairness (random spikes in difficulty or events that have no lead up; bad things just happen and they're absolutely devastating), and AI having no way to prioritize important tasks (so they just stand around building the room while they suffocate instead of building the single oxygen recycler they need to survive).Elaborating on the unrealized/fully implemented concepts: There are a great deal of the beginnings of production chains, rooms, etc. - But they're just lacking.  All those things you would normally build in other games to fully flesh-out a production chain just aren't there.  You just build a room and get the end product immediately.  For example, instead of building a whole bunch of different machines and making an actual factory that takes raw ore, crushes it, purifies it, refines it, and then makes it into usable construction components – You just get a single shot “matter” resource that you use for everything.  The developers didn't want the game to be too bogged down in these systems, but you never need more than one type of room with their setup.  There's not enough décor for the rest of your base, so you're just stuck with single blocked out rooms at a minimum size to hold just what you want and that's it.  It just leads to boring designs and an uninteresting base to look at.  It's visually boring.If you're dying for another Dwarf Fortress game, set in space – I highly recommend checking out Rimworld or even looking into Gnomoria for your Dwarf Fortress needs.  Let this derelict game drift away.			"

												Could have been a great game, but was abandoned by the developers. This is not hyperbole or butthurt exaggeration, the developers saw their sales for the game slow down and just threw their hands up, declaring the game completed. Do not buy it. This is one of the games that caused me to abandon purchasing any more Early Access games on Steam (thank you Doublefine -- I hope you're satisfied with the reputation you're purchasing for yourselves. The free ""I'm sorry"" shovelware game you gave us early access supporters sucks too, by the way). Do not buy this game.Awesome graphics and sound are ruined by the crippled AI -- your citizens will literally charge past a fire extinguisher hanging on a wall to stomp on a huge room-sized fire to promptly catch on fire and burn to death. Technicians will do pushups in front of a failing oxygen scrubber, then their air will run out and they'll panic and die. Everyone on your station is mind numbingly stupid, but there's no way to directly control them -- you'll just watch them helplessly as their lack of regard for their own safety causes them to die in a variety of ridiculously preventable ways. At first it's funny, for a short time. Then it's annoying. Then it's frustrating. Then it becomes infuriating.Do not buy this game. I'm somewhat convinced that it is not actually a game, but an elaborate psychological experiment to determine frustration thresholds. Do not buy it.			"

								I bought this game hopeing there would be more features that would make this game fun. Yet, with the upcoming release of the ""final"" game, the impression i'm getting is that they have given up on this pet project. Their inability to release a final product has crushed all hope i have in any future Early Access games.			"

												I'm going to focus on the AI aspect here. In the beginning, there was Early Access. In its Alpha build, DF9 AI was rudamentary. It made bad, often comically bad decisions, and it was like watching a child grow and interact with a world we knew it would adapt to. Like parents, we told our friends the marginally interesting tales of how the children stopped to chit-chat about Moonbeef and whatever while oxygen recyclers caught fire and firefights happened around them. And it was funny because we assumed that it would improve with time, development, and attention.Then DF noticed. They thought this is where the charm of the game came from, and they pulled the plug. Our AI children stopped growing, and were now going to stay stupid. ""You enjoyed the stupid AI"", they say, ""and now that's where we decided to leave it."" We enjoyed the AI because it was temporary and had some amusing quirks in its broken state. Being forced to deal with the game in the shape that it's in is not fun. Building a base for inhabitants who don't know how to live in it is not a sim, it's an exercise in futility.			"

												No, no, no. At the moment this game is unplayable, AI is broken. This game was abandoned by it's studio. It was at a state of early beta, but they decided to release it as full game and fire all it's developers. They refused to sell rights to it because there are community updates and game will be playable in the future perhaps, so they are just waiting for that moment. If anyone wants to play this I recommend to pirate it, otherwise it's not worth it. They don't deserve money for the work of the community. Sadly, I bought this from the BYOB on Humble Store so I can't refund it, as if I could, it would be an instant refund.			"

Early Access Review
								This game was the most feature-bare, bug ridden alpha of an early access game I've ever purchased. Over a year later the updates have been lackluster and far below the minimum standard I'd expect from any early access game. Now the game is being written off, the plug is being pulled, they're taking the money and running. They can call it 1.0, but that's just not true. It'll be Alpha 7, and that will be the final version of this game.I own dozens of early access games, I love them dearly. This has been my first and only ""huge disappointment"" out of early access, I straight up feel scammed. Not only does this hurt the reputation of Double Fine, but early access as a whole.Don't buy this, and don't trust Double Fine with your early access or kickstarter money.			"

												This game had a lot of potential. While not a deep as initially promised, there was still a good amount of things to do, and I could imagine just maintaining a large base over an extended period of time would keep me pleasantly occupied. Sadly, the final release is riddled with bugs and is not balanced very well, making it impossible to play beyond the initial stages of the game. The developers have said they will provide patches for the game, but thus far their updates have done little to improve the faults with the game and seem to have spawned new bugs. It is hard to imagine that they will have the time to actually fix the game properly given their claim to have run out of funding and their stated desire to wrap up support within a couple of weeks. At this point, avoid this game.UPDATE: It's now February and support for this game including bug fixes is officially over. Update 1.6 was DoubleFine's last patch, and they have stated on their own forums that no one is working on patches anymore. The above review applies to patch 1.6. This game has too many bugs and balance issues to warrant purchase.			"

Early Access Review
								You too Double Fine? An Early Access game falls short again but this time it is a pretty well known developer that decides to under deliver.  DF stated that it simply wasn't making enough money to warrant continued development and from a gamer's perspective, there's not much of a game to warrant purchasing, especially at the $25 price range. What we have here is a stalemate in which both parties lose. Gamer's lose money and the developer loses face.As it stands, Spacebase DF-9 does let you create a base and manage some resources, it does have some random events to throw at a player so that the game isn't completely boring however, there are no end game type things to work towards, no objectives to ultimately strive towards.  In five hours, a player can pretty much run into everything the game offers and after that, the game will just keep repeating itself.The lack of gameplay issue is compounded by the fact that the beta phase of game testing is being skipped over entirely.  DF is going to tack on a tutorial, wrap up some issues and then release the code in hopes that modders will run with their..un-game and make it better.What was supposed to be a game that was to be in continuous development over the next five years with gameplay tweaks and additions is now kicked out the door in its current shape. I guess in space, no one can hear you break promises.			"

												This game is lacking tons of content. Which is understandable for an early access title. During early access they rarely put out new content. Plus rumor has it that they want to go straight from Alpha 6 to version ""1.0"" and release it as complete. Which is more than a little odd. They even stripped their roadmap page of planned features to go with this.Edit 28th October 2014: Double Fine started giving out free copies of their other game ""Hack 'n' Slash"" to owners of Space Base DF-9, as some sort of apology I would assume. That doesn't change my opinion that this game is unfinished, but at least they did something to appease their customers.			"

It developed and developed and developed, and then all the coal of the development train was dumped out into the engineers' pockets, and they ran off, leaving us passengers screwed over on a train that was stopped halfway to its destination.The engineers reach the nearest town, and, without changing their names or the name of their train company, start advertising a brand new train ride.

												*I recommend this game only if it goes on sale or gets a serious update*As of right now I've put about 30+ hours into the game. (Offline play, that's why the hours don't match up.)I purchased this game very early on at a reduced price around $10 or so and at that time it seemed tottally worth it. What was promised seemed awesome and backed by a developer I actually liked how could it go wrong? Well it sorta did and didn't. The game had serious bugs like:Being wiped out within 1-10 minutes by a parasiteBeing wiped out within 1-10 minutes by raidersSave files being deletedGame crashingOverall difficultyPoor performanceNo direction/Story/LoreNo basic tutorial (now in game)Promised missing core featuresNo really settingsWhile I won't get into specifics a simple google search can easily confirm every one of these points. While some of the perforamce issues have been fixed, gameplay ""bugs"" still remain. It is incredibly frustrating to spend hours building a large base when within seconds, Because of derpy AI or crazy strong raiders/parasites/space debri, everything you built is gone with no real feeling of acomplishment and a feeling of being cheated by the game. Right now $20 is a crazy high price to sell this game at, especially when starting a new game could last a handfull of minutes to several hours after being cheated and killed. I really hope this game gets some serious gameplay options and core function updates soon. When the game changes significantly I'll update this review to hopefully something more positive.But seriously Double Fine? $20?!			"

												Full Review:Big discussions arose about the Early Access programm and kickstarted games. Leaving that aside I wanna focus purely on the game, that I got bundled in a Humble Bundle when it was still Alpha and played several times until its current version.The premise and style of the game seemed enticing to me: Build and manage a space station with room for crew and their needs. I like space and sci-fi settings, plus the whole base-management had a Theme Hospital-like feel to it, which was also a great and creative game.So I started out in space and began building. The game doesn’t offer a campaign, you basically free-build and manage your base from scratch. After a few basic rooms for living quarters, refining asteroids and oxygen supply your base begins to take shape. An intercom window pops up: other space drifters saw my station and want to join my effort. Randomized events like this keep things interesting and challenging. Not all encounters are friendly and you need to be ready for intruders - or pay the costs.The building and managing is fun and keeps me entertained: There are some fun ideas in Spacebase DF-9 that I really like. Your base-dwellers for example post about their wants and needs in their social media “Spaceface”, where you can read how they feel and if they are happy with their occupation. The rooms and objects have good ideas that tie into each other: Plants can not only produce food but also oxygen. The food you produce can be brought into the pub for cooking. When fire breaks out you can not only use fire extinguishers but you can also cut off the oxygen supply to a room - though this usually takes longer and damages your equipment.All these ideas and concept sound fun - on paper. In the game however they can get buggy and very frustrating. The power management for example can get very messy as the only data I have is a bunch of colorful lines across your base. I don’t see how much reach a generator has and how much power is being drawn. New derelicts appear out of nowhere that are so close to my base that my building plans are screwed. And several times my crewmembers kill themselves by simply staying in space until their oxygen runs out or not fleeing a empty vessel that runs out of oxygen. This is very frustrating and something that doesn’t feel like its the players fault. The build-queue is also not very clear as my crew builds rooms but just doesn’t make time to build the door that would connect them - ordering them useless.All in all Spacebase DF-9 is a game that had great promise but will never live up to it because bugs ruin the experience. I tried, I spent the time to build a big base and train my crew to fight back an alien invasion - but when the same men later just suffocate by standing in an room without oxygen, I just feel like its not my fault, its the games. And I don’t want to play it any more.			"

												This game has about 1-2 hours of content. Build some items and that's that. There is next to nothing to actually build, no progress tree whatsoever and to counter the lack of content they have just increased the rate of events. Raids or aid arrives basically all the damn time and there is nothing to actually do at all beyond building a few turrets so you're immune to raids. Almost nothing to achieve at all, so you will built at least one of each item the game contains within half an hour. The research is useless, you will be fed up with the game by the time you have researched two or three items, which you cannot even manufacture, they just ""are"". Complete vaporware, do not touch. It looks fancy and has a lot of potential, but don't spend a penny on this until they've actually made a real game out of it. I've played demos that have more content than this. Hell, sneak peeks have more content than this.			"

												I quite loved the potential for this game, but in practise it is horribly disapponting!My first playthrough went fine, pretty basic management fare but then a raider showed up and I discovered that the 'security' crew assignments I'd made meant people couldn't last two seconds against the lone raider..Alright then, it was the first go and in tutorial so I can accept an hours play lost and decided to start a new game.First realisation, there was no ""this will erase your data"" or ""do you want to save"" warning. Surprising and not great, but as said, I hadn't planned to anyway so I went ahead with a new real start.My hopes for the game returned, I enjoyed starting anew and building up the base and this time I had a plan for raiders!My plan... reassign every crewmen to security and overwhelm in numbers! XDNot great I know.. but it worked, though highly tiresome to have to remember and reassign everyone back to their old jobs as you can't assign saved positions to default back to.Then of course, things went bad again...I find a derelict ship, so badly laid out it could've been a rushed post-battle vessel from Galaxy Truckers.So of course, I decide to tear everything out as salvage materials.Unknown to me, one crew decided to remove the ships oxegen generator and then the door of another room from the inside.. leaving him stuck and likely gormless, as there was no notification of him being stuck.I'll admit a possibly mistake on my part: Not painstakingly watching and assigning each item removed one at a time, but when I tried that previously the crew had a habit of just heading off to bed or returning to my base for a minute to build some shelves I'd requested another builder to build, before coming back.. which is why this time I just left them to it.Anyway, I found Mr.Gormless and got him to let himself out of the room but before he got any further the oxegen in the ship got too low and it turns out people panic when they realise the oxegen is low (fair enough I'm sure).Unfortunately, this panic was apparently too much to allow the builder to obey my orders to rebuild an oxegen generator.Close to frustration I see my second builder heading over in a space suit to save the day..Unfortunately, Gormlessness is clearly contagious as our superhero stepped out of the airlock, went into a panic himself, rushed back into the airlock and flushed himself into space...So yea, there you have it. My adventures in Spacebase DF-9. I advise you against having any of your own.			"

												This game has so much potential.  Unfortunately, that is all it has.  If I had spent money on this game I would be uspet, however it kind of just ""showed up"" in my inventory one day.  There are several small that are annoying, but the biggest, most game breaking part of the game for me is what happens after about 30 minutes of gameplay; total destruction by bandits.  Regardless of where I build my base or how many defences I have in place, my base is always destroyed by several waves of raiders.  A single wave would be manageable, however, the game seems to think that I have played long enough and sends endless waves, ensuring that nothing can live for more than a few moments after arriving.   This by itself makes the game unbearable.My final thoughts on this game are that this game is dissapointing and someone somewhere should be ashamed.			"

												Its clear this game was never finished. The tutorial just stops giving you instructions before it explains what is needed to keep your crew alive. As such you have no clue what is the endgame to make a good station other to stay alive till the next pirate boards your station and wipes out your crew.Then theres the horrible bugs like crew just randomly walking thru the stations walls to die in space...

Early Access Review
								Bearing in mind the game is still early access, DF9 has some great idea's, interesting mechanics and the possibility of becoming something very fun to play. However, it's current lack of depth combined with the developers lack of updates make this a difficult purchase to warrant. I personally feel like the latest updates have ripped idea's directly from Rimworld as well. Nevertheless, it may be one to watch, as there are plenty of interesting ways the game could go. As it stands, it's not worth buying right now, you will get perhaps 1-2 hours of content, and even that is very basic.			"

												Supposed to be like ""DF in space"", instead you'll get a very simplestic game that you'll be done with after a few hours. It had potential and was only an alpha, but they've announced that this is all there is to it and they're releasing as version 1.0 soon.There is no game here. There is an incomplete tech demo. Avoid it. Unless you enjoy the feeling of regret and buyer's remorse, don't buy or gift this.And to the people who thought they could finance a game entirely on early access sales. You're a bunch of fools. But hey, if you believed that would work I have shares to a banana plantation at Antarctica I can sell you, just send me a message!Edit: Yep. Early access is gone. This is now the full versionIt's nothing. Don't bother.			"

												For shame, Double Fine. After Psychonauts I was thrilled to see this release. But after your decision to take your money and tell us all 'Oh-well, so sad'... That was some truly cutthroat business. Sadly, your managers will probably go on to make similar decisions, but it's your name they dragged through the mud, and I will never purchase another Double Fine title.The game had promise, but the bugs make it practically unplayable. There's no real way to stop rampaging citizens, as the jail system doesnt seem to do anything about their attitudes. Wounded people will lie around on the ground because the Medics cant be directed to go to them and will instead carry on about their daily lives, meanwhile everyone takes a morale hit. Would have been fun, but as you can see from the nosedive in reputation the game has taken, ""would have been"" doesnt sell games.			"

												This game concept sounded awesome and the graphics look nice enough to rope me into paying $20 when it was in alpha. It was pretty bad and lacked a ton of features. Now that they have moved out of the alpha stage this game is still really hard to play and lackes most of the features that made it interesting.  Not being able to control a persons queue is agravating to no end. The AI is horrible. Normally what happens is I play for 2 hours until everyone in my base gets locked up some how. Either an incopasitated bartender cant serve a security officer and technitian waiting at the bar and those people are stuck their forever. Then a raider comes in and kills everyone while my maininary is slowly destroyed. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. IT IS NOT FINISHED AND NEVER WILL BE.			"

Early Access Review
								Perhaps, half a prototype.I'm not upset that I spent the money on this, and I feel I payed for an adequate amount for playing what content there was to play--but I wouldn't recommend the game with the content that is going to be called a 1.0 release. Putting aside what was promised that didn't make it into the game, what's currently there will only get you a few hours in, before you're wondering what there is left to do.It has a few clever ideas in there, and there is a very lovely amount of polish to the product--which is why it seems like such a waste.I wish DoubleFine the best of luck for their other projects.

												The project was abandoned and partial scripting made accessible for players to finish the game themselves in a limited fashion. Make sure not to buy early access from these devs on future titles, since they abandoned this one to toss out another one. Its hard to believe the same company made Psychonauts, but that was a decade ago so it might be all new people working there or new ownership. This game looked like it would be pretty cool, so I bought it early on. They scraped together a few last minute patches when everyone was complaining, but they didn't implement any of the missing features.			"

												This game is fun, I really enjoy it. This game also has a large amount of game-breaking bugs, which are not fun and will kill everyone in your base. Sadly now that it is officially released these will probably not be fixed.Things to enjoy: SPAAAAAAAACE. Also base building, planning, and generally keeping everybody happy, fed, and safe.Things to hate: Terrible AI. This includes having all your technicians/Miners/Scientists/etc go to a raider ship to pick up an item they want... and then being killed by raiders. It's like watching lemmings. Speaking of raiders, they have a tendency to outmatch even the toughest of 5v1 battles with your security forces. Other things to look out for are Builders bothering to install some more flooring, taking a break, and then suffocating to death because they forgot to build some air recyclers before taking said break.What this game needs: Able to queue up actions, or prioritize building. Being able to tell your citizens to STAY AWAY from scary people in scary spaceships. Or fires. Or vacuums. Theres a lot of room for both necessary, and quality of life AI improvements. Theres a lot of work put into this game, and I happen to think it's fun, but it is clearly not finished yet.			"

												This game had huge potential until Double Fine cut it loose and ran off with the money from the early access. It was a decent start to what could've been a great game, but the devs decided to run off with the money and leave us with a half finished pile of garbage. They keep releasing ""patches"" that barely fix any of the problems, lied about all of the insanely cool sounding features that were supposed to be added, and then have the gall to charge $20 for a game that's got about $5 worth of content in it.This game could've been another colossal hit for DF, but instead it turned into a colossal mess. Don't buy it. Pirate a copy if you have to play it, but don't bother buying it. DF doesn't deserve another cent for this train wreck.			"

I got the shweet Humble Bundle deal, and this game was at the top of the list. Looking back, the other five (unknown and unrated) games show better quality than Double-Fine wishes to attempt. The amount of bugs, flaws, and outright dumb features leave the player wondering if they're actually playing a game, or watching a bad episode of Star Trek: Deep Space-Nine.If it's on another humble-bundle sale, think about asking someone with a lot of money to buy if for you.But not for $20.

												Unfinished, abandoned game. Devs did a quick cash grab by putting the game on sale a week before announcing they would stop production and release the game as was. Which was an alpha 6 stage. They went from alpha to release and never even patched it again. They actually expected the game to be fully funded on Early Access alone and tried to treat it like a normal release. Meaning they had an overhead of thousands of dollars. A completely unrealistic way of making and funding a game, by a developer that really does not care about their customers.I will NEVER buy Double Fine games again. They are the lowest of the low when it comes to money hungry developers.Update: Turns out I eventually did buy another DF game: Massive Chalice. DF seems to have learned from their past indiscretions and I am not someone to pass up a good game just because reasons. They also patched Iron Brigade as soon as they regained control from Microsoft who was apparently hogging the game. DF is making some steps that are actually restoring my faith in the company, a bit. It's something.This is not to say you should ever buy Spacebace|DF9 because this one is beyond repair. ;)			"

												To me, somewhat enjoyable I play it from time to time when I am extremely bored. However there are lots of fustrating issues with it. Prioritization of work is non-existant (ex. running out of air, so I put plans on building more air recyclers, but builders instead were chatting, eating, and sleeping and did not get to it for a LONG time). Combat/action pretty boring and worthless, takes security like 10 shots (mostly missing) to kill a raider. Bugs everywhere. Base location unbalanced (basically, some locations have lots of matter to harvest, or barely anything. Nonstop citizen ships/raiders practically everywhere. Just a few examples). AI pretty pathetic. Basically, a lot more Cons than Pros. I wish that the devs would improve on these issues to make a more enjoyable and exciting game, but it seems that they washed their hands on this product. This could be an amazing game if they get updating and fixing it.			"

												This game had a lot of promise and I bought this game elsewhere cheaper with the thought and impression that as a early-access game that this game would become finished at a later date. Despite its enjoyment and yes it does have a few hours worth of game play but after 10 hours you will have played through everything and have done everything possible within this game. I will still from time to time come onto this game to pass the time and play on it for a few hours but despite having it as an early access game they decided that they would cease production of the game and keep it out on Steam and ask for a high price despite it hardly being finished. To make it look more appealing they dropped the game by a few bucks but in all honesty this game is worth about £4.00/$6.00 max if that!. This review is aimed at informing you all that this game is no where near finished, has many bugs to it and won't get finished as the developers ceased production and said ""we will leave it to the modding community"". Was a huge disappointment for me as this had so much potential and after the first two weeks that i got this game and played it a lot they announce on Steam that they are ceasing production of this game. 4/10. Unfinished, infested with bugs and not worth its current price by far. Either lower it significantly or remove it from the Steam store. I would like compensation for the disappointment that this game has caused, especially when it could have been an amazing game!.			"

												09/11/14 OK. 1.05 and the developers are finally beginning to listen to their customers and are soncentrating on bug fixing. Unfortunately AI continues to be the cripple point that can turn a thriving colony into a pirate laden junkyard. I am very close to giving this game a positive review if they can stop crew from running off to derilicts and asphixiating.04/11/14: With the release of 1.03 this has fixed up the lack of PROC and the game is now functional. Gameplay is now the issue and the AI acts in ways that will destroy you finely crafted society in minutes (like wandering of to a low oxygen area and dying). Hopefully they will now be able to refine and eliminate these problems. I stil hold out hope for the game, but those who are frustrated by AI stupidity may want to avoid this game.01/11/14: Those who remember fondly Space Colony will also be fond of this game; at least until the subtle and confusing ""bugs"" start appearing. In this, the game presently plays like a beta. Playable, but with niggling issues. An example is a continual warning that some sections lack power, yet my base is entirely connected and reactor areas report low energy usage of X/Y. I currently am playing v1.02 and ships (increasing population) just stop coming at about mid game so ending the game at midpoint. Also there is no save games listing: it's one game and perma-death. Hopefully they will address these issues with bug fixes or better in game help. Unfortunately, according to the annoucement by Double-Fine (http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/10/29/sad-space-party-spacebase-df-9-leaves-early-access/), they spend too much money on this game and have ceased development and opened it to the community. There will be some critical bug fixes (like ships that stop coming, I hope) but no more content or systems (like changing resolution or rotating isometric view). Perhaps the Steam community can save this game where the developers failed. I'd like to see the game succeed, but it is not fully playable just yet. If they can get the ship arrivals bug fixed they might have something here.			"

												This game has cute points, but overall it is too shallow to be worth the price. Some examples: You mine ""Matter"" which you use to build stuff. There are no different types or ores, or complex manufacturing steps. You have two basic paths to feed your colonists: Matter replicators to start with, or a mini-production chain with botanists growing plants which are served by bartenders. A simplistic research chain. There are several types of rooms, but each has just a few types of furnishings. The whole thing is just --- I guess superficial is the word I am looking for.I started playing during Alpha-3, and through it had a promising beginning. Unfortunately, what I thought was a concept outline which would have a lot more stuff added to it turned out to be it. Space-sim lite. Not an awful game, but no where near worth the asking price.

I simply cannot trust a company who creates only a shell of a game and then declares it 'done'.			"

												The game has a cool concept but it simply is not a complete game, it has been abandoned by its creators and left it to rot in the corner.A group of moders took on the games source code and improved it, but even with their 1.08 version is buggy as hell and just makes the game not fun. The AI and pathing really suck, making you frustrated as you try and make your people do things.My advice skip this, and look for a better space station building sim. "

												I can't believe Steam is still listing this. It's a buggy, incomplete game. I bought it when it was on sale for $0.99, out of curiosity, so I don't feel too upset about it.  You might see some comments about mods that can fix up the game, but in my experience these were just as buggy as the actual game.  The fact this game is still listed just shows how Steam is the Wild Wild West and you need to be very careful about what you buy.			"

												Game is not finished, its one of those abandoned early access games that went way over budget and then was never finished. This is of course always a risk with early access games and fair enough; however it is beyond med how it can now be sold as a finished game. Im very disapointed that I bought what was sold as a completed product only to  realise its abandonware in alpha. It should have some kind of big warning stickers on the store page or something. Of course it feels a bit worse due to the huge potential of the game. It feels like the beginnings on a really good, modern take on old classics and I really want to love it. But it really does need a LOT more polishing and bugfixing to be called a full game. TLDR; Its a scam - alpha game sold as finished product.			"

Almost like it was designed to be pay to play... but they forgot to add anything to pay for to make it fun.Although this has promise and I got it free I would not recommend it at all.It's as though nobody on the dev team st Double Fine actually played this game for more than 30mins. After the first few minutes it just becomes frustrating and annoying. Examples: - 7 botanists, all in one small Garden zone totally ignoring two other large zones. Game tells me I need more botanists. - 15 technicians (meant to repair stuff), EVERYTHING is sparking blowing up and not getting fully repaired. The only way to fix this is the reclaim the damaged equipment and build it again. This is totally STUPID. Game tells me I need more Technicians. - Sometimes people flip out which is fine, but assigning security to them, trying to cuff them, nothing works. They will destroy half your base, kill as many crew as they can and then eventually hopefully be subdued but some passing person as your whole security team run around them doing nothing. - Invincible aliens that wipe out your crew, eventually your security team turn up one by one and get killed off. Restart game. - Space debris damages a reactor and take out the power, nobody repairs it, builders take ages to get to it to reclaim it, will not build a new one as they are freaking out about oxygen. Restart game. - 7 member security team wiped out down to the last man by raiders. All 5 stars. - More raiders straight away. Restart game. - Give the hell up and go back to a decent game.Play this if you want a lesson in total frustration and how to never ""finish"" a game.			"

								Stay away at all cost. This game is now set to release in October 2014, going from alpha 6e to full release. This is the prime example of why you should think twice before throwing your money away at early access games. There is hardly anything to do in the game other than mine asteroids, build a few room types and research a few things. There is no mid-game and no end-game. Definitely not worth the asking price.

												I bougth Spacebase DF-9 because it looked very similar to a cool yet repetitive game called Space Colony that I enjoyed playing, but I was however disappointed. I was hoping for an elaborate technology tree, more interesting characters and a cool space-adventure feeling.Although I haven't played very long, Spacebase is a game that feels somewhat empty from the very beginning and graphicly very neutral. You would think a game with alien creatures could be much more funky as Back to the Futures' 2015 vision. There were good ideas put into this game, but it's definitely not finished.			"

Not to mention the game is horribly boring after about 40 mins.From beta: This company is greedy and dishonest, they will start multiple early access games and not completely finish any of them and blame it on ""lack of funds"" while updating the games once every 2 months. Your lack of funds comes from paying people to not do work! I will never support Double fine ever again.			"

												I purchased during the very early days after it was released on Steam and I did truly enjoy the game back then even with its terrible game breaking bugs. Every update added new features that made it both easier to play and easier to get everyone on your entire base dead within minutes.  I still see a single raider take out 5 of my level 3+ security staff and also win several matches of fisticuffs with civvies... what the F..? Also, the AI is strange... SO stange! And possibly sociopathic... with not so subtle rage issues... and a long line of family mental health problems... Someone will freak over something, probably quickly, and go around smashing half of the base until someone else smashes them in the face enough times that they pass out.  If your unlucky, which you usually are, they will have trashed your oxygen recyclers and no one will repair them before the levels get low enough that everyone runs around like chickens with their heads cut off until they asphyxiate instead of solving the issue like a boss.  Sorry, that got dark.Unfortunately in its broken, unfinished, never to be finished state I cannot recommend this game.  If it goes on sale for $1 or something similar depending on your region it may be nice to pick up to see how good the game could have been eventually, when it was properly finished, but that is just about it.

												Before I start. Isn't it a bit disgusting that Double Fine is the curator for their own project? Anyway it's a bare bones Space Building game in the vane of Dungeon Keeper, Theme Hospital and Startopia. You build stuff and people rather stupidly suffocate in Space because you can't give people a slight nudge in the right direction to avoid their terrible deaths. The AI is very stupid, and the Building is a very bare. Worse yet is how much DF are asking for, while it's not quite the price of a AAA title, it's by no means cheap either which is yet again is another reason to be critical because what you're buying doesn't add up to £20/$30 worth of content. And to add salt to a fatal wound? DF have decided to just straight up ignore Beta stage and release the game into 1.0, that's right a full version from Alpha where there's been a startling lack of updates throughout it's year of development. Poor show.After the jump into V1.0, my impressions are still disappointing. The game is not fun to play, the citizens now know how to not suffocate stupidly but their prioties are extremely messed up. The UI is counter intuitive and really clumsy and hideous as a result, the game is unimpressive visually and you'll find that the game doesn't do enough to hold your attention. This is further signs that money should not be given to DoubleFine, a company who do not deliver on their promises.			"

												Game is incomplete and devs ditched it. They wanted to do the Minecraft-style development where they keep improving the game and people keep buying it as they add more and more, but they had a barely-functioning skeleton of the game, not enough people bought it to justify them continuing, so they shut it down. That's just pathetic behaviour. Small indie studios get crucified for that kind of thing, let alone a bigger established studio like DoubleFine. As a bonus they put it on a big steam sale a week before announcing the end of development, just so new buyers felt extra shafted. They tried to buy some goodwill back by giving purchasers a free copy of Hack n Slash, as well as by putting out tools for modders and asking the community to finish the game for them(!), but buyer beware. This game was halted a brief way into development and never even remotely came close to being a releasable product. If Broken Age's double-kickstarter shenanigans weren't enough, this is proof that DF cannot be trusted with early access. Just stay well away.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is kind of like Dwarf Fortress in space, a little simulator where you design rooms and manage the roster for your space station.  You don't control the citizens directly, but instead you put down work orders, and the citizens will handle it on their own.  You sketch out rooms and order furniture and so on and your citizens place it.The first few mintues of the game were a lot of fun for me.  You're kicked out of your life support pod drifting in deep space and have to build a little self sustaining environment with an airlock and some life support systems before your citizens run out of air (about 5 mins).  This was an encouraging first glance for me, because it's pretty hard and will probably require a few resets if you don't know what you're doing, and the systems seemed interesting and complex.  Eventually, though, I figured it out and started branching out, putting up a refinery to allow my miners to mine nearby asteroids, using the materials to build a residence and a bar and a garden and a lab and stock it with furniture.And then the game ended.I don't mean it dumped me to a ""game over"" screen or anything, there just wasn't anything left to do.  Once you've got a half dozen rooms down and functioning, which takes maybe an hour, there's nothing else you can do except wait for your science team to sloooooowly research some unnesescary upgrades, or maybe have your security team scrap with some raiders (note that this isn't an RTS, combat in this game is just a matter of setting a point for your security team to defend and maybe they will if they're not on break or hungry or tired or sad).  Sometimes a derelict will show up and you can... well, tear it down, nothing else to do with them really.If you've ever played Dwarf Fortress, basically imagine that game but with no workshops.  You can make rooms and designate areas and place furniture, but there's no crafting system, no economy, no trade, resources are all boiled down to a single currency which is used to buy everything from walls to furniture.  The game just has no depth at all, and it's competing with some of the most complex and deepest simulations on the market right now.The devs seem to have responded to this by ramping up the challenge, which makes things a bit frustrating.  Colonies can die from parasites before you get a doctor, waves of raiders can annihilate an underequipped security force, and once things start to fail, it's pretty much a chain reaction to an abandoned base.  Colonists freak out and refuse to do their jobs so vital equipment isn't maintained or repaired so colonists freak out even harder and things just spiral downward.  For example, if the air supply gets low, colonists will freak out rather than do their jobs, so if the area with the life support systems has air problems, you can't ever fix it because whoever goes in there is going to panic instead of fixing the air generator, and the problems get worse.  And this doesn't really do much to fix the problem with the game being short, because once you've got whatever it is you need to counter them, then they're not that big a deal.  The 1.0 update added a lot of nice features, but the game still has serious issues with longevity.  There are still occasional glitches with draw order and some AI issues, but the game works pretty well mostly.  I've only played a bit, but pathing does seem improved and the interface does make things clearer now.I don't want to sound excessively negative, this isn't the worst game ever.  I had a lot of fun with it.  It's just really short, and the asking price is kind of high.  On sale, for $5, I'd say this is a good deal.  At full price, I don't think it's worth it.  I'd recommend looking at something like Startopia or Space Colony or grabbing something like Gnomoria or Dwarf Fortress if you're not in love with the sci-fi aesthetic.  All of these games are cheaper, deeper, and more fun in the long term than DF-9.			"

								Unplayably buggy. The life support device says it can support 3 dudes, but after building it, my 3 dudes went into ""running for cover"" mode and somehow depleted all the oxygen and died.

												Look, I love this game, it's very unique, and I'm still giving it a thumbs down, here's why;1. AI occasionally breaks, leaves the game unplayable2. Buggy3. There is only like 20-30 placables from start, and to unlock more you have to research which takes forever, and can be expensive4. When citizens die they drop stuff on the ground, and that stuff, almost never disappears or is picked up.5. Devastating to lose everything (Just save A LOT to avoid this.)So there ya have it. Those are my top five reasons I'm leaving this dislike, I love this game. Love it. It will always have a special place in my heart, BUT unless you're willing to put up with these, like I was,  then this is a no buy. Or if its on sale, its a great buy to play for a couple of hour, but I don't think I'll ever reach 48+ hours on this game.			"

												This game is probably the most notorious vaporware game in Steam history. The developers at Doublefine were on a roll with a great game, and out of nowhere cancelled the project without finishing the game due to funding issues. Not to mention they didn't even open up Steam workshop support so Steam users could finish it for them. The worst part is that it was a fun game a couple versions before Doublefine abandoned the project. However, when they abandoned the project they released a final patch that sends swarms of raiders to attack your base so frequently you can't build, and your citizens are constantly sad or angry. It's unplayable now because you can't send your citizens outside your base to build,mine,explore,etc without them being killed. And I'll point out that this is in the Extremely Low threat areas of the galaxy map. To me this seems like a final insult to all of the people who paid good money for what was a good game. I for one will never purchase anything from Doublefine again, and I can't see how this could fix their ""funding"" issues because the PR nightmare of this game has killed their reputation. My recommendation to Doublefine is to reopen this project and satisfy their customers, as it's the only way they will save their company. My recommendation to anyone thinking of purchasing this game in it's current state, is don't!			"

								This game has stopped development and is released as-is.   Demo or watch some gameplays to make sure you are cool with what's here, cause it won't get any better.That means no end-game, no final balancing, no additional content.It's a pretty and pretty fun game right now... for the first couple phases of genre.

Spacebase DF-9 is a casual building sim-tycoon game. You are put in charge of a few colonists to build, maintain and protect your own space station.Pros: The game is easy to pick up on: you start with a power source, minerals and a handful of colonists whose first priority is to build a modest space station with oxygen supplies, and expand to a small variety of room types while mining and refining minerals. As your crew grows and time passes, additional needs will surface, needs that you must address or risk your crew to lose its temper. Derelict ships and additional travelers will want to join, some whether you like it or not, and you must deal with meteor showers, raiders and other threats, all the while researching better equipment.Cons: There is a severe lack of variety in every way: Only a couple of room types with very little content or options, while general furniture offers a scarce selection. Travelers will often discard your rejection, and you quickly become over-populated. You barely have any control over crew morale. The game become repetitive as you are constantly facing the same issues: need more resource or oxygen/power, raiders come over to kill some of your crew, crew member goes berserk, rinse & repeat. Even tech research is rather limited.Verdict: ★★☆☆☆ - Forget itSpacebase DF-9 drops the ball. While not a bad game, it had the potential of being the next Space Colony, but doesn't come even close. Games of this genre require variety to make it interesting to build and grow, and this game doesn't have what it takes to give it the replay value it would need.P.S.: I do not recommend this game as it is offered on Steam. There is, however, a dedicated team of developers at http://spacebasehub.net who have taken it upon themselves to enhance the game and its content. There is still a long way to go, but should the game's potential actually come to fruition, my opinion of the game could change.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

The game is unfinished. When it didn't get enough money up front, the developers have apparently abandoned it in its unfinished state and said ""whelp, guess its out of early access now.""Avoid this game.

												Ignore the part of this game being unfinished and abandoned, despite that it was fun.Now, there is a game breaking bug, where airlocks are awful. Sometimes, when a person steps near an airlock then can break it essentially and whoever was trying to get in will slowly die to asphyxiation, THEN you have lazy builders not finishing the airlock so you'll die before you even got started. I restarted five times, and nothing, nothing works.I don't know what they did, but after the last 'major' update they broke the game, when I tried using my old base, everything was broken, my reactors, my production, everything.This was my first base builder game and I loved it, then, double fine did something wrong and broke it, I don't know what they did, but they broke it.This game needs a way to revert back to an older version so I can play this again, the only thing you got out of this game if you got it early on was a free crappy game to go with your payed game that was broken.Don't let this discourage you from buying other doublefine games. This one in particular however, was something good, before they broke it.			"

Early Access Review
								This game was billed as Dwarf Fortress in space. It might have been just that, had it not been developed by Double Fine.Unfortunately, Tim Schafer thinks that Early Access exists to test the waters rather than to operate as a platform for developers without solid capital. They honestly wanted to develop this game for 5 years. 5 years. And Tim says since the game isn't bringing in enough money on early access that they're going to have to push it out as 1.0 with most of the features on the devplan unfinished.So Tim honestly thought that they were going to make profit on an unfinished game for five years. That, ladies and gentlemen, is the CEO of Double Fine. That's the man that couldn't finish a point and click adventure for 3.3 million.I've got some advice for you, Tim. And it comes from Gabe Newell.""Do not focus on anyone but your customers. Your reputation will follow you forever so always be fair to your customers, and certainly one thing you need to always remember is that your customers are not going to be fooled. Some people think they can get away with something and just hope people won't see through the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The internet is way smarter than any of us.""You've been exchanging your reputation as a game developer in for cash, and given your recent default on Spacebase DF-9 it is with regret that I must inform you that we, the gaming community and responsible consumers, can no longer extend your line of credit.The next time you want to build a game, like oh, say, Dear Leader, don't come to the community with your hand stuck out and nothing for collateral but promises.I feel bad for the people who worked on this game. Who wanted it to be something more only to have its legs cut out from under it because it wasn't a profitable Early Access game. To be honest, the updates were too far apart. Of course no one was buying it. It took too long to see progress, and your behavior and glibness on Twitter and other formats has been intolerable.Sorry, Tim. You can't ride the success of Psychonauts, Day of the Tentacle, and Full Throttle forever. You could have been one of the greats, but instead you're going to end up like John Romero. Only John only screwed his fanbase over once, while you seem determined to make it the remainder of your career.Do not purchase this game. Do not purchase Dear Leader, an Amnesia Fortnight winner like Spacebase DF-9. Do not buy Costume Quest 2. If Tim Schafer comes onto Kickstarter and is like, ""Hey, Psychonauts 2 - I need cash."" Do not give him money. Double Fine cannot manage its finances, and has abused a system that was put here to help unestablished developers as a way to decide whether they should bother to finish a game based upon its profitability before launch.

												Okay, I got this in a Humble Bundle or bundled Steam sale or something. Gave it a try last night.It's not that it's a bad game. It's that it's... disappointing. There are clever mechanics and clever concepts going on, art I found charming, but it's clear that it's just unfinished. I don't know the whole history with this game. I see other reviews talking about a Kickstarter and broken promises from Double Fine. I don't know about all that. What I can tell you is that this game has SO MUCH potential but never lives up to it. So many little things about this game hint at a larger story, at a more in-depth gameplay, at a game that could be but isn't. If someone could take the concepts of this game, with a living crew to manage and a procedural storytelling system and an expansive sandboxy space construction system, and actually FINISH it, it could easily be one of my favorite games.I want to like this game. I really do. But it's just not finished, and from what I'm reading in other reviews, never will be.Sad I will never get the Star Trek Deep Space Nine simulator that I was hoping for.			"

								When I bought the game I figured I'd love the vast base-building. I'd hoped it would resemble something like Prison Architect, and to an extent; Banished. But it seems more appropriate to say it's like Age Of Empires, as, with limited build time, I'm forced to hapazardly prepare for an attack from raiders, parasites, or one of my own crew. Taking into account this was in the easiest area of the game I could find.After multiple restarts (I've barely played a single playthrough for more than 30 minutes), I gave up. This kind of game could steal hundreds of hours from me, but with the trouble I'm having constructing a fuctioning populace, and a decent-looking spacebase, that's not going to happen.			"

												Do not buy this game.I bought into it early on, trusting and respecting Double Fine as I enjoyed many previous games from them and I enjoy games like this so I decided to support the project.It was developed reasonably well from that point, up until recently. See they did not finish it.  Nor will they.  They decided to abandon the game in an unfinished state and push the code out and hope some modders are awesome enough to finish it for them.Not only did this ruin the potential I felt this game had but it has ruined me on double fine.  I will no longer make purchases if it has their name attached. This game is a very early state, it is unfinished but they are calling it version 1 and walking away.Do not buy under any circumstances. Sorry double fine, but your handling of this has just poisoned you in my eyes.  I used to love your stuff but I refuse to let this pass.  Maybe in future if I catch wind of you updating this game in major ways like you were meant to I will give it another chance since I already own it but as it stands you guys lost a customer.

What a load of crap... i heard there were so many promises for this game.. so much potential...and yet the developers dumped it off on the community to finish the game...the whole source code comes with this..which is kind of cool if you know what your doing with LUA.

												Stay away from this game!I purchased it when it was in Early Access and thought it showed promise.  I would revisit it ever 6 months to a year to see if anything had been updated.  For the first year or so there were updates to mechanics but not many bug fixes.  After that progress started to slow and I held off on playing till they got more of the major playability issues taken care of.  I downloaded it again recently only to find that the developers had put a rush patch out a couple years ago and called the game done.  The game by no means is done.  It is in almost the same state as when I purchased it years and years ago.  Their website and Wiki are the only pages left up as well.  The Blog and Wiki seem to have been deleted entirely which suggests Double Fine are trying to bury this.  The sad thing is they still have my money.			"

												I bought this game a few years ago for $30 when it was still in early access. Thirty dollars might as well have been burned. Don't get me wrong, I like this game, and I think it could have been so much more than what it is. In terms of gameplay, it's decent. There's lots of options for zoning, wacky randomly generated names, and a unique art style. But it's obvious that the game's been abandoned by double fine. There hasn't been a major update (or even an update at all, correct me if I'm wrong) in who knows how long. Then there's balance. When I first played this, I was extremely frustrated with the raiding and pirating system. There was really no correlation between base level and defense systems and the difficulty of any enemies. Seriously, you know no effort has been put into balance when you have 2 entirely unrelated raider boarding parties entering your base when you're barely 10 minutes into the game.In terms of replay value, I struggle to find any.In conclusion, I think this game is a bit of a lost cause. It had potential, but it was thwarted by bugs, balance, and lazy devs. It's a shame, really. I recommend taking a look at Prison Architect if you still want a game similar to this, but far more in depth and absolutely worth the price.			"

												Lets see, the first time i loaded up the game i decided to run the tutorial. I was greated by roughly 100 frames of intro (please keep in mind these 100 frames were spread over 20 seconds or so). So i turn my graphics setting all the way down, ditch the second monitor and lower my screen resolution as low and the game allows. Well I can now move fairly unhindered. Go through the tutorial up until I have to fight 10 ish enemies. imediately my frames drop to 10 or so. I have a mid range PC that runs pretty much every game i have in at least a playable fashion (IE ARK and Squad), however this unoptomized POS can barely pull 10 frames?F**K it, me and some friends already have bought and installed the POS so lets try it out. After about 15 minutes of loading screens were finally into the game, well 3 out of the 4 of us. So another 10 minutes go by while they restart and load into our game. Alright lets rock n roll! To be fair the gameplay is pretty decent and it definitely is what i was expecting. That being said there's a solid chance your gonna get dropped from the game mid session, or want to play with some weapons that were in the beta but removed from the actual release for umm idk a reason i guess. The game has so many glitches i can't even recall them all. Our favorite of which is when you interface with a door and afterwards cant use any of your buttons besides movement. This can be solved by running(you know without actually running cause the sprint button doesn't work) over to a door and interacting with it again. Some times it seemed to just happen randomly. Once we were running two auto Cannons and both just happen to get glitched for no apparent reason what so ever. Pretty legit.All in all not that bad if you enjoy 5 frames, of unoptomized graphics from the 90's, a second while not being able to use your weapons after spending 15-20 minutes of time in loadings screens. But hey its a 40k game!The emporer protect anyone who buys this.			"

												Started playing this game, having startopia and other similar games in mind… it could have been a great game but it somehow misses the motivational part. If you enjoy building something next to an angry toddler who destroys all your work randomly… then this mightbe a game for you. I've played it some hours now and found it quite frustrating. Even in the supposedly easier parts of the galaxy you can barely construct a base, at one point the game starts to throws masive waves of raiders - way more than the population of your base - against you. Just after you barely survived a couple of killerbots arrive. This might be something to handle and to enjoy if the games worked as intended. But you only have one ""security"" beacon (but probably about 6 differend intrusin locations) and if you are lucky the citizens respect the emergency alarms and the security comes to the beacon. one by one. to get slaughtered. But about half of the time they don't do anything when they arrive at the beacon. There are construction bugs and fire extinguishing things as well.After all, it is hard to actually have fun playing this game.			"

 I want to rate this game well I really do but I simply can't at the moment  I have had it before where I have made a great base and all has ended well and that feels great but its getting to that point that makes me want to scream in frustration. The AI in this game to put it simply is suicidal. In my latest playthrough a raider has calmly floated outside my base and shot my miners. I think wait I put a beacon on him why did my security force do nothing? They got stuck in the airlock. They were in there so long I had to build a second airlock in order to save a small building team I had working outside. On numerous occasions I have had builders who were working on unfinished rooms in space simply take off their space suit and die from a lack of oxygen. Normally in a game like this I think well its an early access game give it the benefit of the doubt it will be fixed it may even turn out to be as good a prison architect  'Double Fine Productions is releasing a final version of Spacebase DF-9 next month, the studio announced last week. The decision brings an end to the studio's plan to continuously expand the game over a few years' Yep the devs at Double Fine abandoned it.

 GeneralFor what little it is now worth, I did enjoy playing the game and exploring the changes in each new Alpha update. This game had a lot of potential and was very exciting. With gorgeous artwork, a decent attempt at UI design, atmospheric music, and an absolutely delightful sense of humour, all of which contributed to an interesting universe of different species and way of life. But the fact remains that this game was abandoned, never finished properly, and at the time of writing can not be considered a complete game.They did go in and include a tutorial for the game, and I was very impressed with the tutorial until it suddenly ended. Although it felt like it ended abruptly and too soon, I can see why they did limit the information provided. If they don’t leave you to figure out the other rooms and the way the spacebase generally functions then you would have played all there is to play of this game in the tutorial. Ultimately the tutorial just seems to highlight the lack of depth to the game.Spacebase has a rocky history so far, and I feel I really must include a discussion of this so that you can make an informed decision. However, as you will see with the format of my reviews, there are plenty of sections which allow me to consider the game for itself regardless of the surrounding drama.In the interests of full disclosure: I was an early access purchaser, and yeah, I did get burned with this game. My experience with Spacebase truly set my mind to never buy an early access game ever again, no matter how wonderful it looks and tempting it seems. Nothing is a sure bet, and I will only be spending my money on finished products from now on. I can accept that I took a risk by purchasing an EA game and that it did not pan out in this case, but the end result is still a bad experience with Spacebase and Double Fine by extension. Things did get very dramatic, but I don’t think the company did a very good job of handling things. I’m not going to go on about it, so suffice it to say that I’m not an admirer of Double Fine any more. If you want more information regarding the drama I refer to, please check out TotalBiscuit’s discussion on the subject.GameplayThis is a base building game. You build a space station from basic building blocks (floors and walls) and zone different rooms. You fill those rooms with things like oxygen tanks, plants, beds, exercise equipment, tables, food, defence turrets, fire extinguishers, science labs, and matter converters. Mine asteroids to refine into matter, the basic building block/currency of the game in order to build everything else.There isn’t exactly a tech tree to this game, and there aren’t any crafting recipes (although there is scientific research). It seems to be more about the simulation of how people interact with one another, but there are so many characters that join your base that it’s impossible to really follow many interactions in a very meaningful way. So I end up concentrating on building the base and trying to see just how big I can make it. Once you get a vast crew though, things start lagging up and the bugs start to get obvious. Ultimately you will find that there is an imposed limit on how big a base you can create and keep running not by design, but because (I'm afraid I must repeat) this game wasn't really completed.I really desperately wish that there was a blueprint function (like in prison architect) so that one could plan their base out before starting construction.ControlsAlthough you can use the mouse to do everything, there are thankfully plenty of hotkeys. Some of them aren’t as intuitive as I might like, but I got used to them over the course of many hours of play. I found the camera controls to be fairly good, with my most appreciated camera functionality being the ability to pan around. It’s also always a plus to have a simple pause/start button to hit, which is good old spacebar.StorylineI can’t say there is much of a storyline. I think the original intention for the game was to immerse yourself in the lives of the different people on the base and sort of imagine your own story. However, there isn’t sufficient depth and breadth to the rest of the game to allow you to direct any sort of imaginary storyline. It was an interesting concept which didn’t really get developed or thought through well enough.SoundI really like the sound in this game. The music is quite atmospheric (appropriate to the universe they created) and interesting to listen to. It may get repetitive after a while, but it is more like it fades into the background of your awareness rather than becoming irritating. Meanwhile, the sound effects are pretty much functional, nothing much to warrant remark.GraphicsThe artwork in this game is really very good. It’s certainly got a specific style to it, however that style is stuck to throughout and that consistency helps to establish a weird and wonderful universe. I really only have good things to say about the graphics, it’s a shame that all this creative work is now trapped in the wrapper of the rest of the game. Alas.Pros+ huge potential, great concept+ easy to read and navigate the UI+ gorgeous artwork+ interesting universeCons- EA = Early Abandonment- an unfinished game- no real end goal- not enough depth to make it a decent sandbox- still rather buggyHelp Me Help YouIf you did not find this review helpful, I would really appreciate your constructive criticism - tell me why it wasn’t helpful for you.

Early Access Review
								Full disclosure: I had fun in the ~30 hours I spent on various Alpha builds, but it is by no means a complete game. It's pretty, and looks promising, but is ultimately shallow and lacks replayability.With Doublefine's decision to go straight from Alpha 6 to 1.0, I don't think I can recommend this game to anyone at it's current pricepoint. Save your money and wait for a 90% off sale if you're at all interested in it. $2.50 is about the right price for the features this game will ship with.			"

												This game was utterly a complete disappointment. Had they just continued updating and working on the game, I'm sure I would have eventually recommended this game but alas, this company took our money and said ♥♥♥♥ you. But that is the gamble we all take with early-access games, you pay for an incomplete version of the game with no guarentee that they finish it. This game had potential, this game had promise...but this game did not have a good developer.I would not recommend buying this game nor any game from this company.			"

								Spacebase DF-9 is a fun little rogue-like Dwarf-Fortress-ish game where you build and control a base in space, while fighting off potential invaders. It is a good-looking game filled with potential that is never quite realized and, in the end, it eventually feels very shallow.It's easy to recommend Spacebase as an amusing little distraction, but not as an in-depth game of strategy or exploration. Unfortunately, it is in a price-range that demands far more of it. I can not recommend this game at or anywhere near its full price of $25 USD. There are numerous similar titles out there that are only a few bucks or even completely free that accomplish far more.Pretty, but empty. "

												If this game was ever finished, it would be fantastic. It promised to fill the StarTopia-shaped hole in my heart that wanted a space station construction/management citybuilder.Unfortunately, the game has been completely abandoned and will never be finished, and I wish I hadn't spent the money on it in Early Access.As I write this review, the game is on sale for $0.99. Get it at that price if you feel like it -- I easily got that much entertainment out of it.  But if you do purchase the game, know that it is broken and unfinished and you will eventually get bored or too frustrated to continue.Given that it is abandonware and really should be on sale at superdiscount ALL the time, or better yet not on sale at all, I can't recommend this game, even though it had a lot of potential.

												SDF9 is not very amazing at all. In the past I've held Double Fine in somewhat of a high regard, but this game just isn't very good at all, for a multitude of reasons.Namely, it is unfinished. It is abandonware. And yet DF have the gall to keep selling it. On top of this, there are people making mods in order to fix the game. This should not be necessary, and sends red flags from the get go.Playing some of the game you immediately see that it has a very unfinished feel:The controls are rather clunky, and there are quite a few problems with the graphics. I can't find out how to rotate the display, which means [as it's in an isometric view], lots of stuff are hidden and can't be easily accessed. Many of the elements end up 'overlaying' themselves on each other, evidence of problems in the graphics engine itself.The gameplay is rather boring, frankly, and the game lacks flow. You're just dropped in without any real explanation of what the point is. Every now an then a passer by might interact with you with some, well, 'odd' dialogue is probably the nicest way to put it.The sound design in this game is probably the best part, honestly. It has some nice background music.Just to TL;DR, Don't buy it, its a shambles.			"

								Since the original Early Access, barely any features have been added, and updates were months apart. The game is far from complete (and even further from what was promised), even though DoubleFine seems to think it will be from just adding a tutorial, wrap up the major bugs, and calling it ""1.0"".DF continues to look highly mismanaged, especially financially. E.g. Broken Age was supposed to work with $400k funding. They got six times that and still they ""ran out of money"" and had to release what they had as ""Act 1"" (i.e. ""Incomplete game, part 1"").This was the last time I trusted DF to make a good game with my money. The only time DF is getting any money from me is if they've actually released the game with all its features, and even then I'll think twice if there's nothing better I can do with my money. Like lighting it on fire. I get more enjoyment out of watching a brief flame than playing this husk of a dream of a game.			"

Also the puddle is full of dirty street water. And the puddle evaporates after 10 minutes.The fun abrudtly halts when you've completed everything the game has to offer after only a couple hours of play. At that time you've constructed every building and have staff working every job to the happiness of your citizens. Your little humanoids run around your base with a dozen different statistics being tracked that you quickly discover are largely completely meaningless. You are attacked by the same copy paste RNG enemies over and over. It is quite frankly boring and extremely unrewarding.			"

												Do not buy this game. Although the release is technically 1.06, this is actually a facade to disguise the fact that Double Fine added a tutorial and some bugfixes following the release of Alpha 6D. There was never a beta, so the already content-sparce game was never very well optimized or balanced, which becomes extremely clear after a playthrough or two. The artstyle is very interesting and arguably beautiful, reminding me of wonderful games like Bastion, but a pretty paintjob doesn't mask the unfinished nature of the Spacebae DF-9. If you like the look and concept of this game, a group of settlers colonizing  a scifi environment, I reccomed a look at Rimworld by Tynan Sylvester. It is very similar, but obviously has a lot more work put into it. In the interest of full disclosure, I do not have a financial interest in either of these games. The modders with which Double Fine entrusted the game played it and then realized that Rimworld is a (subjectively) better game, which is why I can not find a single mod for DF-9 and the modding community for Rimworld is thriving. But the music is nice.			"

								This game will never-ever be worth the full price now that DF have announced that they're abandoning development. It MIGHT be worth a quater of the price IF the community gets into modding it to fix serious issues and add much needed content.MIGHTIF---I guess i should update this review now that the game has been released and has been updated to 1.05.I still play this game, and at the time of the edit to this review, i've invested about 70 hours into countless new games. The updates have helped a whole lot, but the game still has some playability issues: Doctors will often ignore corpses, which leads to bad morale, which leads to violence which leads to drastic crew loss.Raider events are too randomised, and can often lead to base failure in the very early game, or general drastic crew loss.The added raider mega-fleet event is a good idea in principal, but is vastly over-powered.Construction crew often take huge detors to the next block to be built when in space, which can lead to a new base failing, or causing unrecoverable crew loss in the very early game.Even with my reasonable system spec and the relative simplicity of the game, it tends to lag-out far too much.Generally; Base failure seems to be down to chance rather than skill.There are positives, howeverThere are mods appearing now, which is great. The community is addressing balence issues and adding reaseatch and similar. Workshop support is still very much missing, sadly.Overall:Has the potential to be a reasonable casual game, but really isn't worth the full price at all. Perhaps at a quater the price, it woulnd't be so bad.			"

Early Access Review
								DF9 was a disaster waiting to happen. And now it has done just that.I was surprised by how ""polished"" this game looked back when I first played it in one of the first alphas. The graphics and animations looked a lot more ""expensive"" than in similar games (mostly because they seem to be using 3D for everything while other games just use simple 2D sprites often with barely any animation), even the UI felt a bit overengineered.At the same time the releases rarely addressed game-breaking bugs (e.g. airlocks being death traps) and frequently added seemingly arbitrary features that didn't really improve the gameplay other than giving players more bugs to worry about. I guess the project could be described as ambitious, but then again the same would be true for games like Prison Architect and Rimworld, both of which have been able to maintain some level of consistent narrative over a large number of releases (without needing to re-release every single version several times to provide hotfixes).Some reviewers have said DF made the mistake of treating a supposedly indie, crowd-funded project as if it were another big team big publisher triple-A title. I don't think anyone but the DF9 team can answer that, but it seems telling that a game that was already funded with half a million dollars within the first weeks of the open alpha and that was intended to be entirely financed by pre-release purchases/""backers"" has managed to drain its entire budget within only six major releases. If the game needs more than this kind of cash just to make it to 1.0-as-intended, maybe DF shouldn't have attempted to follow through with this idea. If you're burning money, either find a potent investor who doesn't care, or cut down your development costs to a level where you can bootstrap the project without making f-you money.To quote Robot Unicorn Attack: ""Your dreams did not come true.""

												Look at my game hours and you can easily see how much testing I did for the game in EA.  I also enjoyed the game even with all its bugs.  Then the Dev's supposivly ran out of money since they Dev out of San Fransico.  IKR, it sounds like an excuse from some teenager and that is the maturity level I think Tim Schafer is working on.  Dont get me wrong, I love his creativity just not his business practices.That type of Game Developer behavior cannot be supported as it is running amuck here on Steam's EA.  Therefore I recommed everyone to run for the hills from Spacebase DF-9.  I personally no longer support any games developed by Doublefine due to their missleading remarks before pulling the plug.  I dont even tolerate this type of manipulation in person let alone from a business.I not suggesteing you do the same unless you have also been burned by them and your eyes are now open.  I apply the same principles in RL when I am burned by a buisness or person, they get blacklisted in my book as well as possibly my friends.  Most of my friends are smart enough to heed my warning or at the very least causiously aproach and use that business.   I know some people still enjoy many other Doublefine games and thats fine for them but I hold people around me to a high standard and company's I support I hold even higher.This is one company I have blacklisted among many other new moneygrabbing Dev's I have found on steam in the past 2-3 years.  I whole heartedly love the premise behind EA and how it could help the little new Dev but all these other Steam EA abuses have near ruined my outlook on most if not all EA listed games here on Steam.Below I am linking a Steam Watchdog Group for Develpers we have Identified as problematic either for Forum Censorship or other unethical business practices similar to Doublefines abandonment of Spacebase DF-9.[Dissenters Anonymous]http://steamcommunity.com/groups/dissenters-anonymous "

												This game is fun, and as a space-themed strategy game about building a base in the middle of nowhere.  That part is fine.  What is not fine however, is how the devs abandoned this game part way through development.  Good thing I bought this on a really great sale when it was around the first few versions.  I cannot recommend this game unfortunately, even though I do actually like the game itself.  Wait for a sale if you want to buy it.  Anyway, here are some pros and cons.Pros:+ The game is fun, if you are patient.+ The community for this game is releasing unofficial updates to the game.+ Can actually present an occasional challenge.Cons:-The devs abandoned this at the side of the road like an unwanted child.- Might be a bit TOO challenging at times- $9.99 is a bit steep of a tag for a game that was abandoned in alpha.Summary:  Buy this game if you like space strategy games, and dear god, please don't buy it at full price, wait for a sale.

												I do not reccomend this game in the slightest, this is a disgrace to the early access system, it has a few good features but this is now a 1.0 released game, it's bull ♥♥♥♥ that it was even allowed to be cancelled like this, it was a rushed game and they know it, if you like rushed games with lots of bugs, go for it, within a few minutes of playing you're most likely going to ssee a bunch of bugs, such as people getting stuck in your seed pod on startup, a couple graphical issues, etc.I know it seems like I'm just bagging on the game because it was rushed and blatantly obvious, but I'm not, I tried to like this game, I erally did, but I was unable to with all the bugs and that it was very obviously rushed, I don't blame I developers in the slightest, I blame the ♥♥♥ holes that forced it to be released early, but it is still a decent game none the less, if it goes on sale for 6-10$ around Christmas, then I highly reccomend picking it up, or if it goes on sale like it is now for $12.00 (as of 10/27/2014).

												A real shame.This game had some real potential. I love playing it but without finishing the game properly you run into the same issue with every play.You build, you research, and you run out of things to do. By the time you have researched all functional upgrades your space base is sprawling and you spend your time reassigning all staff to security detail when the multiple raider attacks start happening and then reassigning them back to their positions after the attack.Eventually you cannot look in all places at all times and ""questionable"" things begin occurring when your not looking in an  aggravating attempt to ""fake"" difficulty ala' MarioKart.The game itself is really not much more completed than what I played when I first purchased the Early Access version.The AI is shoddy, the dialogue feels very much like placeholder dialogue, and there are items to construct that seem to have no real bearing on game play (can anybody tell me what exactly reactors do or why my turrets don't shoot raider ships out of the sky before they board?).Feels bad to give this game a negative review, but it's earned it.

Something was changed that caused this,  I filed a bug report, and it's still not fixed. This game is incomplete, has a buggy game core that no mod will fix, and DF has dropped all support for it.

												I have to say from day ONE I had very high hopes and expectations for this game.  I looked forward to updates and a continual developing of the dynamics of the game play.Then one day comes the message that I didn't expect from Double Fine, ""We're done, but here is a tiny door to mods.""I enjoyed and still do enjoy the game play, but this and a couple other Early Access games burned me. Left me unwilling to contribute to an uncertain future.From here on out I will not suggest Early Access to anyone and will not be envolved with any other future products till they are finalized.

												TL;DR Don't bother, it doesn't follow it's own rules.What a steaming load.  I bought this for 99 cents and I still fell ripped off. sure, it looks okay, sure, it has it's atmosphere but the game doesn't understand what a ""low chance of being raided"" means. I played one game for ~4 hours today and I was actually starting to have fun. theeeen raider after raider after raider, waves of the scrublords killed my workers, so I had to assign people who were not workers.. they were murdered, eventually my security was killed off and everything fell to pot. This isn't a strategy game, this is an exercise in futility and it desperately needs fixing. (but its not being  developed any more, ohnooes) And if you think I'm just being salty over this, I moused over the galaxy and found the most ideal spot I could. (which is near the galactic center) I was looking for the easiest of easy modes to get my feet  wet before I tried any of the other areas. And it was decently easy! uuuntil the game decided to start throwing raiders at me like they were party favors. seriously, I couldn't even keep up with  the info box because it was all ""hey, raiders. look, raiders. oh hey, guess what? raiders!"" Maybe there's some sort of infinite loop, maybe there's some sort of size threshold that this happens at but I never even got my population to 40. On top of all of this I was unable to do any research, medical or tech related. I couldn't assign anyone to do anything like that even though I had a huge research bay with 16 or so research tables and at the peak, 4 scientists.  And can we talk about unhappiness? nothing  I did seemed to help them, they'd just go off and sulk and get into fights n stuff. All in all,  not as bad as Kirk Cameron's Saving Xmas, nor is it anywhere as awful as Depression Quest, but it has some serious coding and feature-related issues that really need to be looked at (if not by DF, then by allowing 3rd party patches to fix it.)

												Double Fine got the ball rolling for crowdfunding because it was of their use of it for Broken Age that got the media talking about it and it ushered in an explosion of new games that wouldn't have been otherwise, which was awesome,  but after the Broken Age fiasco and now with Double Fine quitting on Spacebase DF-9,  they're pretty much undoing all of that awesomeness by crapping all over it. WTG!Even after all the sluggish updates that seemed to cause more problems than they fixed, and with all the features that never came to pass, Double Fine is washing its hands of this game and are moving on.  I cannot recommend this game because it's being released unfinished.Do not buy Double Fine early access titles!!  The risk is too great that they'll pull the plug like they've done with Spacebase DF-9.  Your money will be left in the hands of Tim Schafer, probably the worst businessman in game development today.DO NOT BUY!			"

I really don't like Early Access and this game painfully reminded me why.This version is an alpha, broken, unfinished, plagued by bugs and glitches. Nothing wrong with that, it's an alpha right?Well, not anymore. The whole business plan of DF-9 was to finance it on the way over the whole development process and it bombed. The alpha is now the full version and if you want a full version you have to do it yourself or hope for someone else to do it for free, this is a joke.Do not support this kind of business, spend your money somewhere else.

								I have been a fan of DF for a long time and bought into this early (alpha 2 i believe).  I watched as the patches (slowly) came out and with each patch the game gained content and improved.  Despite the slow improvement the game still has a LONG way to go both in bug fixes and additional content.... and this is why I am writing a negative review.  They just announced version 1.0, this implies there wont be any more content.  Even if EVERY bug in this game is fixed i cant recomend it as the game simply does not have enough contet to be considered a compleate game.This game is simply proof that DF cant be trusted with our money.  Broken age was only 1/2 a game despite gatting WAY more money than they said they needed and now there is this...			"

												Do not waste your money on this developer. Tim Shafer is a bloody twit who cannot manage finances properly, and basically left this game barely even out of alpha, despite being a kickstarted game.The game literally went from something like Version 0.3 to 1.0 overnight, and then he basically said ""We can't afford this, modders can do the rest.""Yeah, let modders make 85% of the game, that's a good way to get the community together, innit?

												Today I thought I would write a somewhat higher quality review for this game.Gameplay is utterly horrible. The interface is very clunky and you will be lucky if you actualy do get a base up to specs. To begin with the game is so full of game killing bugs that 9 out of 11 games I played were ended NOT because of a disaster, but because of  a major game killing bug.  I even had to restart the game 6 times in a row one time just because there was a bug that was killing it shortly after launching.. Moving on we now go to the general aspects of the game itself: Support 0/10This game was released in an unfinished state and is abandoned yet sold on here for $20 (at the time of posting) I can not give a game in this condition or state any kind of rating at all.  Moving on, the devs are not freindly at all and have banned people for expressing their opinions that the game was a piece of vaporware.  You can take a look at the discussion forums for yourself on this and get a good idea of just how much censorship that is going on and make up your own minds on this . Graphics 5/10I am really not impressed with the graphics.  They are not impressive at all and were somewhat below average. Sounds and Music 1/10This is an area that is bare bones.  Obvioiusly this area of the game also did not get fnished.  What little music and sounds that there are  annoying as it is repetitous. Gameplay 1/10I tried. No really I tried and I got 1 decent game out of 30+ hours which yielded  constant frustration from game killing bugs.  So I give gameplay a 1 because it was fun until the game was killed by a bug. Fun 2/10What time I did play that was not killed by a game killing bug was fun so I give it a 2 in this area. Price:  due to the bugs, unfinished state, and unfrinedly devs it is my opinion that this is one game that definitely NOT worth more than a few pennies. Bugs and Execution:  The interface sucks, the game is full of game crushing bugs. I hope this review has been helpful to anyone looking for a new game. Feel free to comment.Overall :  This game is not just an epic failure but truly IS  vaporware.			"

Nothing has changed its still buggy and no where near as complete as it should be. No new updates and no fixes at all. Not fun after a few hours esspecially when you're in a place where nothing should be attacking you but you get attacked one after another.

												I had high hopes for this game. It had promise, it had decent enough gameplay, and it was fun to see how your colony gets destroyed. Shame that Double Fine's decision to abandon the game isn't as fun. I loved Psychonauts, so giving the middle finger to them is agonising. I'm sorry, but I can't excuse you for this.Seriously, spend your money elsewhere. Like feeding starving children.			"

												Had this game for almost as long as its been out. Haven't played it for about a year so I decided I'd try it again and see if anything changed. Answer is NO. Nothing has changed its still buggy and no where near as complete as it should be. No new updates and no fixes at all. Not fun after a few hours esspecially when you're in a place where nothing should be attacking you but you get attacked one after another. Had fun for a few hours but for its price I'd only ever get it if it were massively on sale. Maybe it would be worth a dollar but I can't for sure say.			"

								Sadly, no. I can't recommend it. Probably you've already seen all the info related to the ""from alpha to release scandal"". Probably you'll see some discussions about ""the risk of Early Access"" and things like that. Point is: If you pay 25 bucks, you want a full game. Period. It's not a 25-dollar bet, or a 25-dollar donation. We expected good communication. We expected one update a month. Amnesia Fortnight was made public to tell Double Fine which games we wanted. Spacebase came out second on the voting. It seems that wasn't enough.In short, we feel betrayed. Not the end of the world, okay. We'll move on eventually. But we won't forget. Now we can see Double Fine taking money from Sony to make a remastered version of a 16-year old graphic adventure. That's their line of thought now. Well, they can keep it to themselves.			"

Early Access Review
								Early access brings the unfortunate risk of being burned and this game is the first one to have burned me badly enough to write a negative review. First of all, this is practically a demo that absolutely does not capture what makes this genre ""fun"". Generally the interesting thing about base building games is not about how you can create a utopia where nothing goes wrong, but how your base will eventually come to its inevitable end. Spacebase DF-9 fails to spark any continued enjoyment because of how quickly one can create a stable base without having to worry about anything bad ever happening. One playthrough was all it took to figure out all the kinks for the next time, where it is entirely possible to reach a state where everything simply balances itself out. This can be attributed to the fact that the game has a very short list of features.The short list of rooms have an incredibly short list of items one can add to it, so constructing a base on the second playthrough provides almost the exact same experience. It is not surprising how shallow this game feels compared to other games from the genre, even before you are hit by the realization that the learning curve is really just a horizontal line.The random events and the citizens ""dynamic"" behavior do not add a lot of variety, which is something that also quickly realized as you build your base. Understanding the patterns of the short list of events the game throws at you does not take a lot of figuring out, which is not surprising given the fact that you can count these on one hand. To make things even worse, any negative event that can happen is easily preventable with the aforementioned short list of items at your disposal. The only challenging element this game presents, is the incredibly stupid AI that is set on destroying itself as early as building the very first airlock for the base. God help them if they are apart of your mining crew and there happens to be two airlocks to your base, because they are more likely to asphyxiate in space than they are picking which one is closer so they do not die.Again, all these negative aspects can be attributed due to the fact that this title is feature INCOMPLETE and will probably remain so, unless it builds a decent modding community (which is incredibly unlikely to happen given the current state). The keyword here is short, as in the feature list, the amount of time this game was given development time until its ""full"" release, and any enjoyment you can get out of it.I would be lying if I said I had never been so disappointed by a game before, but certainly not with a game that I was so excited to see completed. In the end I, and several other hopefuls lost out on $20-25 on a game that will never be finished. And while they did not lie to us about ""silently pulling the plug"", but they certainly lied about delivering us a ""complete"" game. With them violating my trust, I will never be purchasing another early access title or Double Fine game ever again.			"

												I brought a game in Early Access because it had a promissing development plan and I wished to support the development, unfortunately I got a game full of bugs and incomplete. They removed the early access information, but the game is far from complete and now the only hope of balance and changes are in the hands of modders.The company gave up in order to stop spending money in the development.Thank god someone stored the old devplan and is possible to compare the promisses and the real deal.http://web.archive.org/web/20131018054131/http://spacebasedf9.com/devplansThere are better games like gnomoria, kenshi, etc.			"

												Ok, so this is painful for me, but it needs to be said. I got this game in early access, thinking it would be awesome. I didn't just throw money at it, I read everything they wanted to put in, watched a few videos, and then got it to help support the game... and now I don't think I'm going to do early access again.DF-9 is a basic space station building game that doesn't have any long lasting gameplay. It looks great, it sounds great, it has the base to be great, but as of this review they have stated that Double Fine will not be doing any further updates. That simple statement moves the game from something that can be great to being mediocre at best. If this changes I will take another look at change my review, but as of now, don’t get it, not worth it.			"

												I would not recomend this game, go play Rimworld instead. I got this game on sale just after a new update, I though, it's about time to check this really cool game out! And 2 weeks later they abandoned the project. Should have known it was a bit too good to be true, a DF-like with this kind of graphics would mean that the developers are really meaning serious business, thats what i thought. My guess is that the choice of artstyle is what both got them an early success but then a faliure because its so much work representing all these little details that a game like Dwarf Fortress has. If you're not in it for the long haul, don't do early access. The way I see early access is that you let people play a game while youre making it, meaning you are invested/committed in finishing it since you're selling it to real people for real money. Failing to deliver on that will ♥♥♥♥ people off and lose you some credibility/trust. Even if you're in early access you shouldnt be relying 100% on that to be able to complete the game if you're selling it for real money.			"

												Very promising idea, however, the game is unfinished. It has so many glitches, that it is bound to break after some time of gameplay.To be honest: I'm sick an tired of constantly being the alpha- or beta-tester!The game lacks the very basics. You can only save your game by quitting. If you accidentally click on ""how to play"" or ""New Base"" you lose everything regardless if you have saved previously or not. You are not even asked ""are you sure?"" or be warned the your current game will be lost.In terms of gameplay:It is quiet unbalanced. Constant attacks don't give you much time to breath if you have not found the right area in the galaxy for building your base.Sometimes ships dock at your station and there is nothing you can do about it. If these ships happen to have exterior turrets you might as well start from scratch. Because these turret will tear your crew apart and you won't have a chance to disable or even destroy them.Again. Haven't the developers even played the game? Other players keep having the same problem. There seems to be no answer accoring to the double fine board.You have to start over several times in the beginning until you have figured out what to do. There is a tutorial, but everything it does is presenting you a half finished base. There is nothing that explains the building items, what to take care of or the basics of managing the station.Sometimes some of your citizens just stop doing their duties and telling you they are bored. You send security to a place where pirates tried to break into your ship and they just keep patroling the base. On occation citizens refuse to enter a room and do maintainance... which results in suffocation of all citizens on your station.So, what do you do against those pirates raiding your base? You build some turrets of your own. Then one of your scientists goes mad, usually you would stop him and throw him into the brig until he stops acting up... but the turret has a better idea: it shoots him.Conclusion:Under no circumstance is this game in a ""release""-state! Beta at most. I feel violated as an alpha-tester again by a company which obviously did not even bother to try and play their own f***ing game! It reminds me a lot of the initial problems of X-Rebirth. But this company does not even show effort in fixing these issues.			"

This game is the biggest example of why not to buy games in Early Access: it's unfinished, buggy and borderline unplayable. It's also become the reason why in future I'll be avoiding Double FIne games. The fact it's still being sold on Steam for $20 is just thievery. Of course, I'm not expecting this review to stay up very long- in a move guaranteed of course to even further please the irate buyers of this game, negative reviews of it are being deleted by the thousands.

												Still unfinished, San Francisco has to be too expensive for game development. If you want something similar I suggest Dwarf Fortress(free), Prison Architect, Space Station 13(free) and RimWorld. When I first played Dwarf Fortress I remember the wiki telling me that it's fun to lose.  The two bases I built in my 2 hours of playing had very similar ends, where some creature would enter my station and defeat my officer and I'd be essentially defenseless. It's been a while since I last played but that's what I remember. DoubleFine would do itself well to become a subsidiary of a real publisher, hopefully then Tim's coke addiction could be maintained long enough to make a finished, solid game.			"

Because of  the list of features that they  ""hoped"" to implement, I would jump on every time I saw they had another patch. After a few hours, I'd log off frustrated by repeated raid in a ""low threat"" area or constant meteors where none should be or a dead guy blocking my airlock. Every patch the game got a little better, but nowhere near what it could have been or what DF implied we were investing in. I understand that they need to make money, but bailing on a game that people invested thier time and money into won't get them any repeat costumers. Not this one anyway.			"

												Bought this expecting a company with a good reputation like Double Fine to deliver a decent game when it was finished. Sadly it never was and what we are left with is a a practically unplayable mess of a game mainly thanks to awful AI and the player having no direct control over their citizens.Technicians will happily run over dead comrades into a battle zone to fix a door damaged by raiders. A doctor will then happily charge in to recover the technicians dead body. Builders will think it is a good idea to tear down derelicts to recover materials from the inside so when they demolish an external wall they suck themselves out into space and die.The raiders are equally stupid as claiming a derelict as your own will often lead to them landing a raiding ship on in where they will demolish the airlock doors and the power and air purifiers trapping themselves inside until they suffocate.Practically unplayable and with no sort of campaign or any sort of end goal to aim for there is no motivation to try and play working around these issues. Avoid.			"

								Kickstarter taught Double Fine an unfortunate lesson. You don't have to actually finish video games to sell them.Thanks for nothing, Tim.  I never thought I'd find myself agreeing with Bobby Kotick. But now instead of only the publishers having to deal  with your incompetence with budgets and meeting milestones, you're cutting out the middleman and squandering the good will of your fans directly. Being an independant developer is great, isn't it?			"

								There are dozens of posts explaining their blunder. Poor money choices, they desperately need an accountant. And if they have one, dude should be fired and his degree sent back to whatever cracker jack box he ""earned"" it from.... That, and this should be proof that more developers on a project DOES NOT mean more success.... just more failure. GG guys, GG. If a game has Double Fine on it, I'll be skipping it from now on. Your rep is not great or even good at all, the days of Monkey Island and Day of the Tentacle are long lost, and I'm saddened by this - Like you were paid to prove these sorts of games AREN'T successful, when I have seen a lot of success in them. FTL is amazing, just to name one. And it is recent. And indy built. DF isn't indy... They just aren't professional anymore. I'd scale them with the wierd uncle who claims he could do all this great stuff, but when he shows you, claims he isn't in his prime anymore when he falls on his face. Repeatedly. Because he doesn't get that then and now are two different times, and his pride won't let him stop. But people want to keep seeing him try in hopes that he can do what he used to do. And we spend hours over the dinner table listening to ""back in the day, I used to..."" But what now? He's old and worn, and can't get back to his proper feet anymore. And it saddens us, because he used to be the cool uncle, now he's just the weird one.			"

They shipped an incomplete title. They are professionals and this is a not a professional way of doing things.  You cannot commit to a early access and then take the money and run.

												Don't buy this game. I bought in alpha with all the promises and new features and bug fixes. The game left beta without fixing the bugs. There is also no support for fixing the new bugs that appeared. It has so much bugs to the point to be unplayable. For a veteran that was able to keep up a nice base in a ""very low threat sector"", there are too much raiders coming, and if you go to change some jobs while being invaded, sometimes more raiders come. I've come across 5 raiders at once. Ah, and not great news too, the support/bugfixing stopped. My guess is there are so many bugs that it is not worth to realocate a team to fix them.Check for yourself:http://www.doublefine.com/forums/viewreply/369949/ "

								The developers of this game have effectively abandoned this project. The next and last update will take this game from the alpha stage it is currently in, skip the beta entirely and become version 1.0. The developers stated that they are giving the game over to the modding community. I will back the sentiment of one the reviews below, this game only has a few hours of gameplay until you run out of things to do. A huge amount of features promised will now not make it into the final release. Do not buy this product unless you do not mind having an unfinished game. Perhaps the modding community will make something wonderful out of this, but until that happens, I strongly recommend you stay away. Stay away from DoubleFine(the developer of the game) altogether as this is not the first crowd funded project they have abandoned.			"

								just as they promised not to, this fly by night dev, has rather loudly pulled the plug on Spacebase. It has been disastrous to their reputationand it has killed the games fanbase emotionally.This game is Early Access AbandonWareIt is DEADIf I were in Double Fine position, id drop the price to $5 and see if that could help generate sales. BUTThis is why you shouldnt buy this game.NOW as for why you shouldnt even play it. Its undercooked and unfinished and will never be finished,the core gameplay that is here is lacking, and there are much bettermanagement sims available than this, go play SimCity instead, The worst thing is, whats here isnt bad, its a fun game ( not £18.99 fun however) and there clearly was a lot of promise here, but it lacks a cohesive and complete designa victim of the early access nature of the game, very basic systems were in place herewith no real central mechanics, while it is noticably graphically superior to the amnesia fortnight prototype, mechanically it is almost just as under developed andafter 18 months of development, a lot of promised features are completely missing.While I understand Double Fine has a passion and a penchant for making unique andinteresting games, they absolutely shouldnt not start making a game that they cannot gauruntee to finish. Spacebase DF-9 should have never been greenlit, I love the idea butthe project completely failed, and Double Fine didnt gamble their own money on this, or even their investors money on this, they gambled OUR money on Spacebase. The game made its initial investment back pretty quickly, but due to a high price and lack of featuresonly a small subset of dedicated fans jumped in. Early Access is supposed to be a tool for devs to make a little extra money before a game is finished. The game should be planned and financially secure for completion before coming to Early Access and in spite of it. It absolutely should NOT be the primary form of financial resource for a game, ESPECIALLY for a professional studio like Double Fine that is located in a city like San Francisco that has a high cost of living. This game shouldnt even existand poor management has cost me and many others about £19 and it has cost Double Finemy trust and future trade.Im Sorry JP LeBreton, I really wanted Spacebase DF-9 to succeed, but you gambledwith my trust and now Double Fine has lost it.

Early Access Review
								Developer Double Fine has posted that the final release of the game will be version 1.0 and that no more versions will be released.  This comes at a time when the game is still in alpha and lacks considerable depth.  Be warned, if you are buying this game after 9/18/2014 you are potentially buying a dead game.  You can plow through what little content is there in an hour and from Double Fine's last post it seems unlikely much content will be added for the ""final"" 1.0.--Spacebase DF-9 is an interesting play on the Dwarf Fortress formula.  Instead of carving out a kingdom from rock you are inversely adding a ""kingdom"" to the vacuum of space.  Similar to Dwarf Fortress you are given little control over your citizens.  Instead you play the role of macromanager, assigning citizens to tasks and watching them go about their day.  Certain events will trigger at random times forcing you to deal with raiders, parasites, killbots, and meteorites.While all of this sounds fun in theory the problem is that Spacebase DF9 is competing with 10 years of Dwarf Fortress development.  As of Alpha version 6 there is still relatively little to do.  You can speed run through an hour of gameplay and basically see all that Double Fine has to offer, afterwards the game offers little reason to continue playing.  Unlike Dwarf Fortress, Spacebase misses the boat on simulated empire building.Don't let my number of in-game hours sway you, 40 of those hours are from idling the game while I did work.			"

								A few months ago I likely would have recommended this game. While development was fairly slow, they were making progress and the game was getting better. I was hopeful for the future as the game had, in my opinion, a very solid foundation.With the news that this game is now only getting one more major patch; I can no longer in good faith recommend it to anybody. This game was initially touted as a 'Sci-Fi Dwarf Fortress,"" but make no mistake, it offers nowehere near the complexity or longevity, The feature list is incredibly underwhelming for a sim game of it's type, and you will very quickly lose interest in the little this game has to offer. After a few hours you will have experienced absolutely everything. They could have done so much more with the concept, (and planned to,) but nothing in this game will strike you as particularly unique or groundbreaking. The fact of the matter is this game seriously underdeliverd on the features that were going to distinguish it from other games in the genre. You can go back and look at the archived dev plans to get an idea.Of course, this was always the danger of early access. There's no guarantee that the game you fund will make it to it's fully realized state. If a game becomes unprofitable; they'll ship it in it's current state regardless of planned features. As far as I know, this is the highest profile early access game that has seriously underdelivered. Let it serve you as a warning when buying other early access titles. After this I don't think I'll be putting money behind any more games that have a chance to be released so woefully unfinished.			"

								At first glance this game had much potential, asking for a small amount of money on kickstarter the developers recieved 8 and a half time of what they asked for. And everything seemed pretty good so far, they released an alpha version to play and test with, and as it is with alpha versions there were some bugs. But suddenly their money ran out and now they're releasing a game without the hundreds of features they promissed their supporters and in it's currently unfinished alpha stage, presenting it as if it was a full on game. That is a no. Do not buy from double fine. Bad reputation will be worse than doing a little over time, and they have to learn that			"

												Is this game finished? I decided to wait until this game came out of early access before playing, but to me it feels like maybe it should still be. I have played a couple hours already and am already running into bugs left and right. Some times my worker get caught in a loop and will pace back and forth and won't build something even though theres a clear path.There's also features that I find really annoying. Some times your workers just refuse to work, for what seems like no reason at all. A big complaint is when your people running for cover, or running out of oxygen or in any panic state, they will do NOTHING to rectify the situation, no matter how much your order them to. If the situation is dire, they will probably die instead of fixing the problem.Game is boring and feels unfinished.			"

												Brütal Legend was the last good thing that came out of Double Fine's production. And that was 7 years ago.Space Base DF-9 is not only an abandoned game, but devs won't even apologize for this ♥♥♥♥-up. And look what are they after now? A remastered remakes of old quests like Day Of the Tentacle and Grim Fandango. Looking at how things are going for Double Fine I wonder if Tim Schafer has anything to to with previous games success at all. Looks like the brain and soul of games we liked was staying in shadow.

Early Access Review
								Unfortunately the final release of this game is not an improvement on the earliest alpha at all. Throughout the alpha the gameplay did not change at all. Instead each alpha update added some tacked on crap that contributed very little to the game. GoodThe characters you construct a base for seem to have depth. They have feelings and thoughts and you can read about them and so on. The basic gameplay elements for a base builder are there and function.BadThe game seems to be caught somewhere between Dungeon Keeper and the Sims. Unfortunately, the emphasis seems to be on Sims gameplay. The station inhabitants have clearly had more effort put into them than the actual gameplay. This could have been a positive thing, as it is in the Sims which is a great game, except without a base and proper neccessities all your inhabitants will die. So you find yourself in a panic to build a base early, made all the harder by the fact that your workers spend more time socializing and posting to their ""spacebook"" than building things essential to survival. This is made even more frustrating by the single most terrible UI I've seen in a modern game ever. In conclusion, the game isn't finished. The gameplay in Spacebase is incredibly underdeveloped and clunky. There isn't even anything to do. You build a small base and then there's nothing. You could make a bigger base, but there's no reason to. There's no challenge. Despite a year and a half of development this still plays like a terrible demo.			"

												Spacebase DF-9 had high hopes and dreams that were crushed when it was abruptly moved to release due to the game not making enough money to sustain development.  If that's not a kick in the balls then I don't know what is.In addition, Studio Head Tim Schafer has proved his pig-headedness once more at the Game Developers Conference of 2015, where he flat-out denied the existance of the women and minority gamers who have been calling for improvement in gaming journalism-- so if you fall in one of those two groups (or both), then you should probably think twice about buying any game made by Tim Schafer.  Otherwise you're just fueling the ego of a man who, quite literally, sock-puppets.

												Whilst the game itself is very buggy, when you use the unofficial patch (http://www.spacebasehub.net/download/) the game runs perfectly fine. So my review is based purely on the game with the patch, as it is thoroughly enjoyable. Also, 69p for a game wthat you have to use a community made patch to be enjoyable is totally fine by me.			"

												Spacebase DF-9 is a testament of what happens when a group of people have really great ideas but the managment does not have any business sense or know how to budget themselves. This game had so much potential, it could have been one of the best out there, instead it will be forever known as one of the reasons why you don't buy in Early Access. It's utterly incomplete, you can do and see everything there is to do in the game within 4 hours easily, and even that might be stretching it. Do not waste your money, do not get this game.The biggest crime this game did though? It made the internet agree with Bobby Kodick.			"

												I started with DF-9 very early on, the updates were consistent and beefy enough that it kept my attention and I didn't feel I wasted too much time with a few new stations every build. New problems would of course pop up every Alpha release, but that is to be expected and for the most party they were ignored, yet underlying and game breaking issues never seemed to get fixed that made the end game for the most part pointless while cosmetic and uneeded areas were implemented. The game is playable for the most part but feels to have been abandoned after being pushed into release after it seems it ran out of money. I would have even recomended the game had the Devs fixed what is there, I could have forgiven the game missing many of the promised features but as it stands now until it gets some much needed attention the review is going to remain negative and I can't in good faith recommend it to anyone which really is disappointing as it had such promise and I did enjoy it despite being broken and unplayable past certain points.

Perhaps some should tell Double Fine a Tutorial stage is supposed to be easy?The Tutorial stage is actually quite difficult for a newcomer - the 'area' the tutorial station is placed in has a 'high threat' level, and any time I tried to expand my station by adding a new feature, I found myself swarmed with raiders so that any residents I had out in space suits were inevitably killed. I cannot count the number of times my space station found istelf down to a tiny crew due to the rest being killed off. You will have much more satisfaction with the 'New Base' option.This is a game with  basis, but too many frustrating points. What would help:- the ability to 'jump' to a location on the map when a message is given, ie, a derelict has appeared, so-and-so is under attack, etc- the ability to 'jump' to a resident from the roster- a clearer indication of residents' moods and wants- more options for decor/entertainment- a help menu that lists the different features and what they do, instead of a too-difficult tutorial- more features!!!!On the whole, I know I will keep playing for the construction aspect, which is why I bought it, but I cannot honestly recommend it to anyone yet. Perhaps Double Fine will come back to it at some point; in light of the negative reviews it's getting, though, I rather doubt it.			"

Early Access Review
								If it wasnt for bad optimization on the Pathfinding and other core parts of the game, you would be through with it in aprox. 10 hours max. Comparing the current price (~20 €-ish) with what you would pay for an Alien Isolation key and the tense action and story telling, well lets just say go for A:I. To make this review more helpful, I will shortly tell you what is currently in the game: Build a base with oxygen-generators, a simple airlock and some rooms. Create a food source. Mine Asteroids around you and enlarge your base. Upgrade food source and build living and recreation areas. Research stuff. This, all the while you are defending against Pirate raids, that wouldnt be a problem, if not for the bad Pathfinding and AI in general, that paralyzes your security officer on duty, unable to shoot at the invaders. PLEASE dont buy this game as it is Vaporware and clearly was ment to be a cash scam all along. Though I see little hope, I will try my luck with a refund for my money, as many people here have been scammed into this product. If you dont believe, just watch the forums here. Thanks			"

At the moment, it's little more than say Minecraft in it's first early stages, however this product will never recieve the follow-up that is needed to take a game from what essentially is it's alpha/early beta to the stage of a fully fleshed out game. It's sad to see a company as well respected as Double Fine give up on a highly anticipated project like this. However I've learned my lesson, do not purchase games from Steam Early Access as there is no guarantee of quality on any level.			"

												Update - Since writing this. Owners of this or HacknSlash got given the other game (We got given HacknSlash. HacknSlash owners got given DF9) as a peace offering it seems. No. I feel like we are still being cheated.This is one of the few times i feel like ive been stung by Double Fine and their lack of understanding. They threw themselves head first into this and a lot of us believed we were going to get a full game. The long list of features were what attracted us to the product and we simply wont get that. Double Fine have dumped this game, going from Alpha to 1.0 out of no-where. This game has been left in a state that makes it the most pointless state. It upsets me to even think that i trusted them to do this. If you want a very VERY bare-bones sim game that you have to expect the community to mod into a game worthy of playing? go for it. Me? I'm going to go play Clockwork Empire.			"

												i highly encourage everyone to give this game the tag ""abandonware"" becuase thats what it truely is, shame on your doublefine, SHAME ON YOU!Update, i was just mysteriously gifted DF's other game hack'n'slash. Regardless of weather this is a attempted bribery or a limp wristed apology, it does not excuse or make up for DF's false sale of goods on what was to me the most interesting of the three of DF's recently developed titles. If DF wants to retain me as a loyal costumer they need to follow through on their orginal obejctives & goals for their titles and not continue to make poor financial decisions such as giving away titles to offended customers in an ill fated attempt to appease offended gamers and curry pulbic favor. 4-star builder stringer bell will continue to live on in my heart.

												Despite a promising start, it's unfortunately impossible to recommend SpaceBase when Double Fine has left the game incomplete. There are good base mechanics in place, but after about an hour you will have seen everything the game has to offer. If this type of game sounds interesting to you, I'd pick up RimWorld instead.

								This game is not finished, and it has come out that it never will be.  There are a handful of hours that are enjoyable, but not in the way you think.  It seems to be building up to something.  You gather resources and put together a station, and at no time is your progress ever really threatened.  Then, you have everything built up, you've put lasers on the walls and have a small army of security and... nothing ever happens.  There are no truly challenging random events, there are no barriers that you have to work around to build your base, there's never any challenge at all.  And then there's no kind of endgame after this, you can just keep expanding and staring at your stable, boring base (that is in itself neither complex nor complicated, with no tough systems to learn or figure out) for eternity.  And Double Fine has come out and said that this is all that there ever will be.Don't buy this game.  It's all build-up, no climax.  No challenges.  Even the resource gathering and base/population management isn't difficult because it's too simple and easy.			"

								I purchased that game because I liked the concept. But I don't like how it is coming to end by ""Let's jump from alpha 6 to release 1.0 and finish it as it is."" ... I feel like I am cheated, betrayed. I found that game on youtube in a video and I saw the potential where the game may develop. I read stuff on their web with long list of planned features and I liked it despite the fact there wasn't much to do in the game itself. I purchased it because of ""early"" alpha state with only 6 bigger versions and huge planned features list. It indicated it will be still in progress and had much more content ahead, so I decided I will support them. Not too long from that day, they want to release the game which is still more ""prototype"" than full game. If I knew about that earlier, I didn't purchase it. It's not worth 22.99€, heck 10€ would be still too expensive.			"

Please consider this before buying.This game is a little tricky to recommend, the idea and the way the game plays is good, but it's quite buggy.For example, one of my ''citizens'' was stuck in the door of the airlock that lead to space, and he died because of suffocation.TL;DR, this is a good game, but it's buggy.

								Since everyone's reviews are solely their views on Double Fine's recent announcement, I'll go ahead and take a look at the game in its current state.As it is right now, Spacebase DF-9 shouldn't be called anywhere near completed.  I mean, the game works and all but there are a lot of glaring problems with it.  After a few runs through the game, I couldn't help but notice that every space sector you play in has almost zero differences between them.  The astro density determines how much asteroid is in your area to mine from, which is appreciated, but it hardly makes up for everything else.  The threat level has very little difference, as it apparently suggests how often your base gets showered on by meteors and debris, while warpgate proximity indicates how often you get potential new residents passing by.  What is evidently missing is where Raider occurrences would be placed, since they happen fairly regularly.The Raiders themselves are stupendously overpowered.  The raiding parties vary between one and three Raiders that *will* decimate your population, no matter how well-trained your Security staff is.  The reason for this is because they tank damage like it's nothing while killing a majority (if not all) of your residents in less than five shots each.  The defensive turrets don't offer much by way of defense.  As the camera is locked to only one perspective, you only have the option to face the turrets downward (i.e. towards the bottom of the map) to either the left or right directions.  Seriously, you can't really use them to shoot at the approaching vessels since they have to be *inside* the base.The base amenities are also a joke as follows:- Despite having oxygen capacity for X number of people, the second I fill the base to capacity, the oxygen recyclers eventually fail as if I was overbooked (despite each recycler to be working perfectly at roughly 80-85% durability).  This caused my residents to panic and run around, abandoning all jobs and waiting until they either starved to death (because they used up all of the matter in stock) or waited until the next Raider party exterminated them all.- The bar doesn't offer much, since it's the only thing that works in the Pub zone.  I have seen neither the fridge nor stove used at all so they're essentially useless.- I set up a Reserch Zone and set a tech to research but my Scientist was busy doing everything else while on duty rather than actually research anything.Overall, the game pretty much sucks since each playthrough is just the same thing: see how big your base can get before Raiders kill them all.  And given how Double Fine's treating the game now, I'd have to agree with everyone else.  The developers are basically dropping the project and turning the rest of the game's development over to the community after announcing that they're releasing the source code for the scripts and pushing the game out the door with a 1.0 full release version.  Avoid this game and pick up somthing better instead, like the classic StarTopia or even Prison Architect (which I also have). Spacebase DF-9 is simply a waste of time and money.			"

								I hate writing such short reviews but I simply wish to express my opinion after many hours of gameplay (I do get to give a post 36 hour review, regardless):Post 18 hour review summary (terminated as of release information until 1.0): I would STRONGLY recommend not purchasing this project until you see what comes in at 1.0 release. The ship has sailed, so to speak, on spacebase DF-9. The money brought in for DF-9 was considered insufficient to continue the project and the developers are going to ship the product as is.  You are welcome to receive a product that, with slight and fully justified speculation, will remain permanently as an alpha (it never reached beta) in support of double fine but I would be cautious.I do recommend to all early access payers, however, to recognize how frequently we receive products that are not even identified as ""alpha or beta"" and to be kind to double fine. I would suggest most players refer to many battlefield and call of duty releases to see how beta's can be pushed out as ""final projects"". Double fine has to begin to regain some form of capital from this project and the only way they can is by releasing the game. I commend the team for being open and honest about their decision, as hard as it is. Positives:+ Double Fine was open and honest+ Graphics are well managed+ Concept well thought out and fun+ Obvious love and commitment put into the projectNegative-Game is being accelerated to final state with obvious, often game ending, bugs-From the developer: ""Spacebase DF9 is still a fun, clever, hilarious, beautiful and complete game.""

												UPDATE: The game is basically ""Beta"" now. From the release of 1.0 there were no new features added. They finally fixed the 3FPS that plagued linux/mac OS, but the game now randomly crashes.  The AI when building will get stuck in walls regularly. Have to close and re-open to fix. This hasn't been fixed from alpha 6. Two months ago. The tutorial is complete crap. There is no audio queues and it is VERY uniformitive. All they did was have text on the bottom and hope the random event generator triggers what to do next. Crew members will walk back and forth until they die - refusing to either fix/build oxygen supplies.  There is  no way to keep track of power usage.  Just build until you run out of power. THAT WAY when something breaks you'll be completely screwed.Proximity to the warpgate things don't make any difference on how much spam you have to put up with for people constantly trying to join your base. Everything I listed has been a problem since alpha 5/6. No fix. All they did was just plop on some text call it a tutorial and fix the 3FPS issue for linux/mac.Don't buy. Complete scam.Below is my original review.Early access linux backer. (Same review would thereby apply to Mac to some degree)Game is in last Alpha stage. They are moving to have it be labled as ""1.0"", aka finished. However. The game is completely unplayable in linux and barely works (from what I understand) in mac. There is no support here for it, and the developer is just claiming ""modders will fix it"", and we have to rely on the developer to test the game themselves, when, after this lastest aplha stage, TWO platforms that are supposed to be supported do not work. Do not buy this game. It is completely unfinished, and will likely not even work on your system due to lack of testing in development. They have completely skipped beta stage of development.			"

Perhaps some should tell Double Fine a Tutorial stage is supposed to be easy?The Tutorial stage is actually quite difficult for a newcomer - the 'area' the tutorial station is placed in has a 'high threat' level, and any time I tried to expand my station by adding a new feature, I found myself swarmed with raiders so that any residents I had out in space suits were inevitably killed. I cannot count the number of times my space station found istelf down to a tiny crew due to the rest being killed off. You will have much more satisfaction with the 'New Base' option.This is a game with  basis, but too many frustrating points. What would help:- the ability to 'jump' to a location on the map when a message is given, ie, a derelict has appeared, so-and-so is under attack, etc- the ability to 'jump' to a resident from the roster- a clearer indication of residents' moods and wants- more options for decor/entertainment- a help menu that lists the different features and what they do, instead of a too-difficult tutorial- more features!!!!On the whole, I know I will keep playing for the construction aspect, which is why I bought it, but I cannot honestly recommend it to anyone yet. Perhaps Double Fine will come back to it at some point; in light of the negative reviews it's getting, though, I rather doubt it.			"

								If it wasnt for bad optimization on the Pathfinding and other core parts of the game, you would be through with it in aprox. 10 hours max. Comparing the current price (~20 €-ish) with what you would pay for an Alien Isolation key and the tense action and story telling, well lets just say go for A:I. To make this review more helpful, I will shortly tell you what is currently in the game: Build a base with oxygen-generators, a simple airlock and some rooms. Create a food source. Mine Asteroids around you and enlarge your base. Upgrade food source and build living and recreation areas. Research stuff. This, all the while you are defending against Pirate raids, that wouldnt be a problem, if not for the bad Pathfinding and AI in general, that paralyzes your security officer on duty, unable to shoot at the invaders. PLEASE dont buy this game as it is Vaporware and clearly was ment to be a cash scam all along. Though I see little hope, I will try my luck with a refund for my money, as many people here have been scammed into this product. If you dont believe, just watch the forums here. Thanks			"

								DO NOT BUY.Investment in an Early Access game may carry some measure of risk, sure. But from an established studio like Double Fine, there's a reasonable expectation of not only a certain level of quality, but of a completed product. With Spacebase DF9, we're getting neither of those.Deciding that pre-release sales aren't up to their expectations, Double Fine has opted to cancel further development of DF9, label the next version 1.0, and abandon it. Sure, we'll get some bug fixes in 1.0, but the game isn't nearly ready for release. Between miners who refuse to stop working and suffocate before reaching the airlock, doctors who can't be bothered to retrieve dead bodies, construction items that builders ignore, and a notable lack of features and variety, DF9 is an incomplete and sometimes outright broken product. That never bothered me much because I kept telling myself, ""It's still alpha. It'll get better.""That Double Fine is using sales of an alpha to determine the game isn't promising enough to finish is astonishing. The lack of commitment to invested fans is even more so. Of course it's not selling well; it's not a good product yet. This almost makes one miss the old days, when games didn't sell at all before release. Then no one could complain, ""it didn't sell well enough before we finished it.""This is the kind of thing we've come to expect from no-name, fly-by-night indie devs, but from a studio like Double Fine it's all the more shocking, if not more shameful.

								This game is completely unfinished and is going into full release without being even close to completion, which is just an attempt to squeeze some money out of an abandoned game.They also promoted the game on Steam to try and lure people to buy it just before they dumped all the promised features and abandoned development, which in my eyes is sneaky and deceptive and best, and borderline criminal at worst.After trying repeatedly to start building the base. Just *start* the base that is, I encountered a series of bugs and issues which meant that my crew didn't go into the base I had built, died for no real reason etc etc. There is no guidance to indicate what is wrong, so it is hard to tell when it is a bug or you have made a mistake. The answer is probably both.Avoid avoid avoid.			"

								Such a shame that this game never lived up to its potential. Jumping from Alpha 0.6 to release because Double Fine ran out of funding was a massive shock, and means a lot of features are not being implemented and the game is rife with bugs. I would not recommend buying the game in the state they've decided to release it in (even with promised bug fixes) as it is quite limited in terms of features and gameplay. Personally I would not call this a 'complete' game, and people should be aware of this before buying the final version for a staggering £18.99. "

								The game is a broken mess right now, and incomplete, and production has been stopped by DoubleFine because it's losing money for them. Which is a good reason, but it doesn't give everyone thir money back, and it doesn't make this a finished product.Don't buy this. You'll have fun for thirty minutes before the broken ♥♥♥♥ makes you want to stop playing.I'd also recommend you never again buy a DoubleFine product, despite their history of putting out good games, because this is an insulting turn of affairs and a slap to the face for their supporters, but that decision is up to you. I know I won't be buying any DoubleFine products ever again.			"

								I sank nearly 50 hours into this shambling mess of a game that had potential to be fun and interesting.I even tactily believed a team of 4 people could handle developing the game, because the reputation of Double Fine and the People on the team backed up by a firm development timeline, making good but not exceptional progress.Since my purchase in Alpha 4, a handful of small changes have made it seem to be a good overall investment and a likely turnaround. I even helped other people on the steam forums and DF forums.And yet, i was hesitant recommending DF9, because Early Access isn't the same as buying a released game, it's not even kickstarter, you can't get a refund or the money back if it fails, you have to accept a shining pile of ♥♥♥♥ and hope the developer has the stomach to make it better over time when you buy a game through Early Access, That's the primary condition Steam sets for you. That all changed on the 19th September, 2014 when they abandoned the game, saying there was no more money in development. If you're going to get this game, wait for a humble bundle and pay $2, that's a little high for what it's worth, definitely  not the $30 i paid to test out a failed experiment.♥♥♥♥ you Tim Schafer. ♥♥♥♥ you.

								DF-9 is a warning against early access.  Priced as a full price game while being a barely functioning early alpha - and when the high price for little content and even less functioning content failed to bring interest and money the project is dropped.  This game is a lot like your initial crew members, suffocated before they had a chance, and their corpses pitifully floating around as a reminder of your failure.			"

												Being a fan of the old “Tycoon” games and “Theme Hospital” I was really excited about Space Base DF-9. I thought for sure reviewers were being too hard on it, so as soon as I saw it pop up in a Humble Bundle I was ecstatic… But, all of my excitement was for naught. Almost 6 hours wasted and I can pretty well guarantee I will never touch this title again.TL;DR There is a ton of promise here. When the game is running smooth there’s not a lot to complain about (except maybe lack of construction options), but eventually that smooth ride will be over and you’ll realize nothing works like it should, if at all. So while playable you’ll hit a point where the effort to advance isn’t worth it. If you still think you want to punish yourself by playing this game make sure you check out http://www.spacebasehub.net/ for the unofficial patch, the mechanics are still broken but everything else has been improved.In-depth ReviewOverall Gameplay: The basic construction and management section of the game is fairly well done. It’s very similar to “Theme Hospital”, but with a slightly improved interface. That’s where the positives end. So many things are broken that it becomes unnecessarily difficult, and not in a fun, challenging way but in a “oh there’s another thing that doesn’t work right” kind of way. Here are just a few examples of things you’ll see characters do:- Die of suffocation despite being surrounded by rooms with oxygen and having access to an airlock with space suits, - Become incapacitated (not dead, just lying around uselessly) indefinitely. If they’re Raiders they actually might be back up and start killing people!- Be marked for the brig or infirmary but never go there- Scientists not researching (despite being assigned research and having a research station).- Ignore the 3 fire extinguishers near the fire, and instead stomp on it until they catch on fire, then run around the base being ignored by everyone else until they burn to death… Actually that might’ve been the most entertaining part of the game!Presentation: The user interface is easy to navigate but overly simple. You only have 1 save slot and the game auto saves by default, so if you’re not careful it’s quite easy to erase a save game by clicking on the wrong thing and not exiting before it overwrites your game.The graphics are fine. They’re quite obviously a throwback to “Theme Hospital” (how many times can I name dop?). It works well for the genre, and they’re fairly sharp. The sound is outright boring, the music is nothing impressive and off the top of my head I honestly don’t remember any sounds other than that and the chirping alarm if you zoom in far enough.Summary:This game could be so good, but as in so many cases now it looks like the developer took their money and ran. In my love/hate relationship with Early Access this is why the hate portion exists. I’d give it a 3/10, it’s playable and as long as things work right it’s quite enjoyable, but the unpredictable and frustrating broken mechanics make it another EA Trash title. Pick it up in a bundle with some good games or for $1 or less and get a couple hours of fun… But DO NOT, under any circumstances pay any more for it than that. Especially when you could get the vastly superior Theme Hospital and forget this all together.			"

It severely lacks content and has some major UI and pathing issues. While it likely had much potential, it's 'absolutely not worth it in it's final version, not even on sale.If you like the genre, take a look at planetbase instead.			"

It is very sad to see that authors decided to forfeit further development of the game. It is not yet finished and should NOT be considered as a full release. It was a good attempt at ""space dwarf fortress"", but I guess as soon as money came in & people who actually care about the product came in, the devs decided that it's time to move on onto another money-making project (that will, most likely, not be finished either).Do I recommend? if you're a connoisseur you might get some joy in playing it through. It should last for two evenings, not more. I still would consider just checking YouTube videos of the product instead of buying it, as paying developers for their unfinished and abandoned work (in such a disgraceful way) would be a shot in the leg. if you're looking for another simulation / survival / base building title but in space (aka dwar fortress in space) you should consider another title. This one is bugged and not ready to be played, and will get you (sad / depressed /-r money wasted). "

												Got this game for free all of the sudden today. So I said, ""why not""? Ive played many isometric strat type games like this and this one is pretty horrible. Right away glitches with people in space suits, glitches with building, glitches glitches glitches. So naturaly I head right to the bugs report / forum for this early access title to report it. Come to find out, its NOT early access. This is it, this is what ""shipped"". I'm going to give it another try just to make sure I wasn't too far off the mark. But ya, it's pretty horrible. Building anything is a chore, rosters are a nice idea but the UI leaves something lacking, te game ""feels"" like a poorly made reboot of an old game I ued to play in the late 90's. (It's actually 90%+ desgined like that game, just poorly executed.) In short: If you get this for free, try it so you know what you wont like in a game. If you paid money for this, i'm sorry.

								Can't really recomend at this stage of develpment. Too little to do right now, you just build a larger and larger base until something goes wrong.

												Lets leave aside the fact that the game isn't finished, shall we? Double fine decided its done, so lets look at this as a finished productSpacebase DF-9 is The Sims, but in space. I know what youre thinking, I was hyped too. You can assign different jobs to different citizens and theyll like it a certain amount. Your citizens will scurry around and converse with each other about inane things like space mudcrabs. You can select asteroids to be mined, which works kinda. You can get other people to come by and ask to join your space-hovel, and supposedly they might even try to do other things, but that never happened in my playthrough. You can send you citizens to go and explore derelict ships, and they will find things. You can build rooms, and put things in those rooms, and your citizen will use them. You can give those rooms different named functions, and your citizen will use them for those functions. Spacebase DF-9 is The Sims, but in space.Pros:-Aesthetic: If you can count on Double Fine for anything, its that their stuff always looks good. The semi-retro looks of the interface and the hand drawn aliens look nice and stylized. Sending your citizens off to investigate a derelict ship is always a harrowing affair, as the ship is completely dark, with red warning lights flashing ominously through the hallways. Even if you have no idea whats coming, the atmosphere of the ship makes you anticipate losing a few citizens. One fult is that the play space looks very flat, even though your citizens, while in space suits, can go under your space-hovel, which was very confusing the first few times.-Sound: The soundtrack is short but nice. Ambient trance music has a soft spot in my ear canal, but I found the music very nice, even though it will be seen as repetitive to some. If you dont like, it, you can always mute it and play Eminem, or what have you.-Core gameplay: The game mechanics I described above are very good, and makes the base of a great sim game. I'll elaborate more on this in the negatives.-Fun alien designs: I like the designs of the aliens. I didnt see two aliens who looked exactly alike in my playthrough, besides the two humans I started with. Reminds me of Star Wars!Negatives:-It isn't Psychonauts. Lets all face facts, the main reason we all buy Double Fine games is in hopes of another wacky, fun game like Psychonauts. It doesnt need to be a Psychonauts game, it just needs to have the same spirit (Although, I'm still holding out hope that if I keep buying DF games, they'll eventually make Psychonauts 2). The plain fact of the matter is that this has none of that spirit. Spacebase DF-9 is as sterile a gaming experience as there is to be found. The most funny thing I did was purposefully suffocate my citizens in the bar. Forshame, Double Fine.-The gameplay is completely flat. As in grossly, sadly, boringly flat. If you have played 30 minutes of DF-9, you have played 30 hours of DF-9. With the exeption of the rare derlict ships, I spent most of my game watching netflix on the other monitor. Even the derelict ships suck in a way, since even with their mystery, it takes too much time and resource to explore and kill the monsters inside for it to be worth it, since all your citizens will be terrible at fighting. In other games, like the Sims 4, this could be remedied with patches and DLC, but Double Fine has no intention to patch or make DLC for this game, and so were tuck with the husk of a potentially great game.Ending score: 4/10. A passable game that works just fine but because of its pedigree should be a while lot better than it is. If you really need your fix of a Space Station simulation game, try Space Colony on GOG, if you need a Sims-esque game, just go back to the Sims. If you want a fun Double Fine game, just play Psychonauts or Brutal Legend again.			"

												The problem with games that follow the lead of unfinished freeware games with incredibly good ideas is that when the original lacks a definitive purpose, the derivatives tend to as well. As the name suggests, Spacebase DF-9 is derivative of Dwarf Fortress, a city-building ASCII title that has absolutely no purpose outside of building your base and keeping it afloat until that sudden, inevitable downward spiral that brings your civilization to ruins.It's a decent idea, for sure. I picked this game up as soon as it was available because I'd tried the Amnesia Fortnight prototype and desperately wished that it would be expanded into something great. The premise has a lot of potential, after all, with space being as vast as it is. Unfortunately, DF-9 left Early Access far less than what I'm sure a lot of people hoped it would be.Spacebase DF-9 is a fairly simplistic base-builder sim. You pick a spot on a big galactic map and then build your fortune on it. Starting with only three people and some meager resources, it's your job to thrive in your little sector, mine up asteroids for more building material, and balance out the health and well-being of all the space grifters you pick up along the way. Sometimes you're attacked by bandits, or a bit of wrecked ship will float by for the taking. Sometimes you'll come across a particularly pushy visitor who insists on joining your roster. Sometimes you'll be stricken by a space disease and need to research the cure before it kills off your crew. That's about it.The problem I've noticed is that there is really nothing in the way of depth. It's fine to be tossed into the wilds and learn the ways of the land by yourself, but once you've built one of everything you're pretty much done.  The happiness graphs and space social networking tabs might promise more to the individual psychological needs of your people, but there seems to be little to no chance of even the most dour, reclusive person on your base succumbing to space madness and striking out in a hilariously deadly rage. So that's one of my secret space fantasies rendered undoable.If you want to build a space-base with a little more depth, I'd recommend Startopia. If you want to Dwarf Fortress, just play Dwarf Fortress. Unfortunately, Spacebase DF-9 is relegated to the Horrors of Early Access bin, which is a shame considering all that potential.			"

												The problem with this game is that it often throws too much at you in too short a time that you can never recover or make progress. I oftentimes wonder what the point of having people set as Security when a boarding party comes and kills 3 people all the while the Security people are sleeping and eating. Even with emergency alarms in every room I feel like the guys just stand around and do nothing.  Technicians rarely seem to repair anything, constantly getting messages telling me that my machines are in poor condition. Even with guys that it shows love the job and have a high star rating I don't seem to ever be able to keep up. It a shame really because this is just the kind of game I could sink hours upon hours in. A simulation game in space. Essentially The Sims in space where you build rooms and expand your station. Early on it was so much fun, I really enjoyed it but the bugs and problems mentioned above just suck all that fun right out into space. I hope that the game continues to get updates to make it more playable and allow for the inhabitants to actually feel useful.  Until then it is hard to recommend this title to anyone.			"

												This game could be so much fun but it needs rebalanced and tweaked a bit.  Raiders attack far too often and are too hard to kill before they decimate your base.  Then after one or two such raider attacks all of the citizens fall into a deep depression from having their friends killed that they go on a rampage and make a bad situation even worse.  When this happens the only solution is to abandon the game and start over again.I have tried building a decent base 7 or 8 times at varying locations in space and become equally frustrated each and every time.  I'm done playing this game unless a future update makes it more enjoyable.  Perhaps allow doctors to double as psychiatrists or something.			"

Im sad to say i cant recommend this game it has its charm but thats about it, build every room and see people work only take a few hours then your stuck in booredom.Dont buy this game, i just hope that other developers that see this project will auctully make a game like it thats finished and more polished then this crap. 3/10 + Theme park feel for a bit+ building system with Air and vacum+ stupid npc trying to turn them self on fire our jump out of an airlock.. or my favorite get stucked in a door.Rest of the 7 points is just a angry rant sorry. I dont get why people think its ok to get players dreams up and then blow it out of the airlock as this game did, shame on you.			"

												Unfinished, not worth the time. Disgusting money grab by developer.			"

												Not worth the money it's sold at. Seems unfinished. Get it on sale for 5$ or less if you do buy it. It's pretty addicting, but buggy and once you stop dying there isn't anything interesting to do.			"

												This game had so much potential, if they finished it I could imagine it being awesome. 6/10			"

												This game has so much potential, sadly it doesn't even come close to reaching it. Issues I have:* Controls are not intuitive* Balance and pacing are way off* Far too little control over your people* All sorts of hidden mechanics that should be visible* Help and tutorial woefully inadequate. * Combat is just not fun.

												It's just unfinished and never will be. I know early access is a gamble, but I thought a company like Double Fine would be a safe bet. The fact that this is still available on steam is almost a sick joke. If you want a fun game to scratch that Dwarf Fortress itch, but with graphics, try Gnomoria, it's much more deep and fun.			"

												Doublefine ran out of money, and basically gave the game to modders and said ""Do as you please""And everyone felt backstabbedThen they gave us all a free game as a way of saying sorry, But that is not enough as the game was never finished and was incredibly barebones for something I was personally looking forward too			"

												This game was a great idea in concept and was really coming along nicely.  Then the developer dropped it like a bag of dirt and moved on without warning.  A true cash grab plain and simple and a real slap in the face to those of us that supported it.  I haven't purchased a Doublefine game since and likely won't.			"
