												As a throwback to the original Carnivores games, this does that series great justice in improving the graphics and overall game mechanics. However, if you're going to compare this game to theHunter: Primal, which most people will do, then there are some things in this game done better and some things done worse. That will always be the case. This game plays MUCH easier than theHunter: Primal since you're not scavenging for weapons and ammo and not being eaten by an OP t.rex after 5 hours of playing. You can literally jump right in and start hunting - taking down dinosaurs with as little as a single hit. Arcade-like feel? The perks you can upgrade are much more limited than in Primal, but satisfyingly easy to get.As far as graphics are concerned, this has a lot better shaders than I thought it would have had (from early screenshots and video), though the textures and models of dinosaurs and the terrain do need to be polished... a lot. Still not as bad as the stuff  you see in a game like Beasts of Prey though. I also love the fact that you can visit different islands and areas to get different terrain, for example visiting a calm beach or a dense forest.Overall, when it costs as little as it does compared to similar dinosaur hunting titles, you'll have fun with it.

												Man, this game shocked me. Being a big and supporting fan of the carnivores series, ive played all the carnivores games, except this one for the PS3. I never saw this one, but wanted it sooooo badly. I had no idea what it was like, but then this appeared on steam and i was shocked. This game is brilliant, the great AI, superb optimization, stunning graphics and amazing models, sound effects and maps make this game the best carnivores game so far.Pros- Dinosaurs Optimization is too good to be true Great Graphics Amazing Maps Sound effects are great Wind, Sound, Smell, Sight for all Dinosaurs Great Dino models and animationsCons- Not many Dinosaurs Not many weaponsAll in all, this game is stunning. All that i can say right now is more weapons should be added, along side more dinos, like raptors and large pterosaurs. And one more thing i forgot to metion, is carnivores ice age, still in the carnivores series, so i played it and loved it, so please, please make a Carnivores: Ice Age Hunter Reborn!9/10 "

												Quick a dirty breakdown:Pros-Followed suite with many of the characteristics of the original game. Very nostalgic.Smooth gameplay, very little fps stutter.Great gameplay mechanics as well as gunplay.Very immerise and is more than capable of getting your adrenaline going.Open world (while limited) leaves the player to make their own choices.Cons-Periodical crashes, could be simply on my end.Rather unoptimized, can be difficult to run for lower end computers. Not many graphic options.Rather few choices considering  gunplay. You either roll with an OP snper rifle or enjoy challening yourself.Conclusion:I love this game. Absolutely reccomend to anybody who enjoyed previous installments in the series. I would love to see the addition of more dinosaurs (There's only 6 you can hunt in regards to a trophy. Kind of dissapoitning) and more weapons. Would absolutely spend more money to aquire that. It's sad that it was rather difficult to find a gem like this, as it deserves much more attention than it's given!			"

												A great remake to a classic game.Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn, does most things right, and only a few wrong.Pros:Wide Variety of maps.Easy to pick up. Fun if you like dinosaurs.Cons:Wish there were more dinosaurs, there are a few, but there could be more...Game gets a little tedious at times, but not too bad.Overall:A great remake of one of my favorite games. I'd even by DLC for more dinosaurs/maps/etc. (I rarely do this with most games)I recommend this game completely.			"

												What can I say about Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn? Well having come from playing the first Carnivores back in 1998 a lot has changed.The game looks great! The animations are well done, even though minimal, and the levels are vast open worlds with bits of lakes here or there that dinos like to hang around. Sometimes you find a mutated dino and it looks cool! That’s about it for the pros.As for the cons of the game, let’s just start with the AI mapping. Seriously the dinos running away from you when you get spotted is hilarious! Not in a good way mind you. The dinos constantly running into trees and rock and random bits of debris can cause the hunting to slow down and it doesn’t happen just once. All the time. Especially when you are hunting the Mighty and Fierce T-REX!!! This would be scary if he didn’t bump into all the trees, rocks, and random bits of debris everywhere. You can also just jump on a rock, call in the T-rex, and snipe him with the .50 Cal. This is another problem I have. The weaponry. How is a crossbow more powerful than a .50 caliber rifle? How come when I max out the .50 Cal for max damage and hit a T-rex, or most dinosaurs for that part, in the heart they don’t always collapse instantly? How come I can’t hit the dino in the head and cause severe brain damage? Maybe I’m being too nitpicky here. Moving on. The Mutant Dinosaurs was a cool idea, but I feel it should have been implemented as a different level of danger and appearance. I shouldn’t look through my binoculars and not get a reading of what it is, because it looks slightly different. I shouldn’t call for it and it not respond to my call.Let’s talk about the lack of content. Can we please get some different weapons? Can we please get more dinos? Can we please get more levels and not just 3 levels with different lighting and fog. If anything make the level with RNG fog and different times of the day or even let you pick when to start the hunt. What about a challenge mode? Anything to draw out the life of the game!I think the game could have been so much more, but I honestly enjoy the first game way more. It was a challenge. T-rex could only be killed with a shot to the eye. And if you missed you didn’t get another chance. That is why they called it the big hunt. I also remember sitting forever calling in dinos getting them to come within sight and they would just run off if they caught your scent. That doesn’t happen in this game.Working with what we have I would rate this game a 5/10. The elements are there, but needs a lot better execution.			"

												Carnivores 2 and Carnivores: Ice Age was the first games I got on my PC back in the day, and I played them to death. I even got my original copies somewhere...I even got mobile versions of both games on my android phone and play them from time to time. Those versions are actually superior to PC, since they both run extremely well and got some new creatures thrown in for free (18 in mobile version as of time of writing this review compared to PCs 9).So how does this hold up?P.S. For short version, see TL;DR/ Conclusion at the endP.P.S. Many people will probably compare this to theHunter: Primal, but I haven't played that so only comprarison you'll see here will be with previous games in Carnivores series. Starting with positives:  1.  Even though it's a port of PS3 version, it runs well on PC. I tried it on both a hi tech Alienware PC at my friends house and my 6 year old scrapheap, and didn't experience anything wrong with this game whatsoever. Settings are a little bit limited, but decreasing LOD and turning off advanced grass will make it run even on laptop without any hickups. 2.  Graphics, while nothing amazing like Skyrim or Witcher, still look pretty well, even on lower settings. There are some neat effects here and there, and if you're observant you can even track a dino by following his footsteps and blood trails, which is awesome.  3.  Sound design is pretty good. There are some great ambient sounds and one time, I almost started swatting at a fly which I thought was flying close to my ear even though it was in game. Believe me, it was that realistic.Dinos also make different growls and sounds and even though Stegosaurus sounds like a bear, which I personally find a little bit silly, it works when you are trying to locate a specific dino by sound.  4.  Animations on dinosaurs are pretty good and their movement feels natural. Watching Ankylosaurus in his defensive position, stomping and hitting his tail club on the ground was extremely awesome.  5.  Speaking of dinosaurs, they look way better and are more ""up to date"" compared to mobile and and prequel counterparts. Don't get me wrong, those dinos weren't plain bad, but a lot of things has changed in the field of paleontology and some things like size and looks are a bit outdated. Ceratosaurus for example, is bigger than Spinosaurus, which is just plain wrong.Devs probably didn't do their research properly or got something of it wrong, but they sure did it right this time, and it shows. 6.  There is a ""progression"" system of sorts, where you can spend diamonds on upgrading your guns, player and Gadget. I say ""progression"" since upgrades are not permanent, and points can be taken away from one upgrade and be used on something else instead at any time or liking. 7.  Shooting mechanics have been improved, and now, if you're skilled or lucky enough you can one shot dinosaurs if you aim at their weak spots, which will award you with more diamonds and better rating. Weak spots vary but with a little practice or with a help of one specific perk, you'll be be on top of things very quickly. 8.  This game is also pretty cheap, NOT in early access, and support with more dinosaurs is already planned which is always nice. Unfortunately this is where the positives end and facepalming begins:  1.  First things first, there are only 6 dinosaurs to hunt...Yes, you read it right, 6 dinosaurs. That was the biggest disappointment IMHO since, as I said before, mobile version has 18(!) completely different dinos to hunt. They really couldn't add more dinos?  2.  There is also fewer weapons this time around.Previous games had 6 (Pistol, 2 types of stotguns, 2 types of Rifles and Xbow) but this game only has 3 (4 counting Revolver sidearm perk). You could also carry all 6 if you could afford it, so why isn't it possible here? Your could go for a ""realism"" argument, but personally, I would like the option to be at least available. 3.  AI on dinosaurs is pretty random as well, and feels like a downgrade compared to prequels.When it works it looks great and all that, times when they manage to get stuck between  2 trees and rocks, are just... bad. One time, this Stegosaurus I was hunting got stuck in a rock and when I got closer, managed to go through it and with some struggle, out on the other side. While I watched this ""rebirth"" my lower jaw almost hit the floor.Sure, it doesn't happen too often, but when it does, it kinda ruins the immersion... COMPLETELY. 4.  Their reaction to gunfire is also pretty random.In prequels herbivores ran away like maniacs when they heard gunshots while carnivores looked at it like a dinner bell running up to you and chewing your face.In this game however, Herbivores usually don't care if their mate is shot in front of them or close by, unless shot themselves. Carnivores are a little bit less relentless, which is a little bit disappointing. 5.  Levels themselves while big, are still smaller and less varied compared to prequels. Some of them are also covered in this weird fog, which in turn makes hunting dinosaurs more frustrating than everything else, since you can't see them 90% of the time.One thing that I also found annoying personally was that some maps doesn't feature all dinosaurs. For example, default map only features Stegosaurus and Ankylosaurus and nothing else. Want to hunt ALL dinosaurs on your favourite map? Can't do that! Must choose last map available!My only questing to this is WHY?! In previous games you could hunt any dinosaur on any map, so why this feature is unavailable in this game is just bizarre. TL;DR and/or conclusion: Recommending this game is hard. With every step it takes in the right direction, it also takes a step back and if feels disappointing. I like the new visuals, updated dinosaurs, sounds, upgrades and other new features but unfortunately, mobile version has 3 times the dinosaurs, double the weapons and environments are more varied and interesting.I was really looking forward to this release of the game, but after 6-7 hours in this game, I had basically unlocked and upgraded everything this game had on offer and hunted all the dinosaurs, which is kinda disappointing compared to amount of hours I used on completing mobile versions.I'll probably recommend this games to the long time fans of the series, but new arrivals will probably be disappointed and bored fairly quickly with the amount of content available at the moment.I'll update this review as the game gets updated with more content etc.			"

												This is the return of Carnivores I always wanted to see. With great graphics, well done dinosaurs and a retooling of their credit/gadget system with new found upgrades. You're going to have an awesome time traversing their lush and expansive maps looking to fill your tags.Having played Carnivores 1 and 2 religiously back in the day this game is childhood bliss. It doesn't have near as many huntable dinos as 2, so it's a lot closer to the first installment but a great return nonetheless.My only gripes are a few bugs and some of the dinos don't sound as authentic as they once did, but what they've done right outshines those negatives for me.

												First off...this review caters to only a specific and special crowd of people. The Sim Hunters. An Interesting and rare breed we are.Having said that if you are looking for the next action packed, no holds barred, intense Oculus Rift driven FPS shooter of the year then move along because I can guarantee that you will not enjoy this game.Who will enjoy this? The methodical, patience and slow sim hunting enthusiast. The hardcore Sim Hunter may not enjoy it as some will but I will touch on that.This for all intensive purpose is a remake or reimagining of the wonderful and classic 1998 Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter. If you ever fell in love with the original or its many expansion packs then this gem may have a special place reserved in your heart. Well enough rambling, time to talk about the game.What is it? Simply put it is a Dinosaur hunting game set in a distant future where you the hunter are scuttled about to numerous mysterious Islands of some unknown planet. There are a fair amount of set pieces to visit and each location is fairly large and varied with different themes and observable distances. Some may have heavy fog which can reduce and limit your viewable distance or some may be clear as day with a variety of Dinos to hunt down and add to your trophy room.Before each outing you have the chance to modify and tailor your hunting gear a bit. In the beginning you are limited to a few locations, weapons, gear and Dinosaur types. As you confirm your kills and return back to ""base"" you earn two different types of in game currency, Gems and Score. Gems are rewarded for confirming a kill; these are the basic currency for upgrading your player, weapon and gear. Gems also unlock addition gear and weapons. Score is rewarded based on many factors. Kill distance, number of shots, size and tonnage of the Dino and Dino type as well. Score allows you to unlock the different map variants as you progress.Once you suit up and pick a location a dropship plops you down on a fairly random section of the selected map. From here your senses are your only allies. Using a device called the M.I.S.T, this digital pda will allow you to observe a topographical map and can be upgraded to make your life a little easier. It also acts as a rangefinder and can be used to zoom in and scout around for nearby Dinos. Now it is up to you to locate, stalk and down your first Dino! Once you have confirmed your first kill (and maybe even added it to the trophy room if you purchased the corresponding hunting license) time to use the M.I.S.T to call for a pick up. This is the basics of the game.So now that you have a very basic idea of how it works let’s talk about the good, the bad and the ugly.GOOD-Dinosaurs ""act"" like Dinosaurs. They themselves will seek out food and water, call out, sleep and move throughout the world as realistic as we could ever imagine.-The hunting grounds look pretty solid and give a great sense of being on an alien world. Unknown planets lurk in the skyline, Volcanoes erupt, winds bellow and the world feels fairly alive.-The weapons and gear feel great and offer players a small variety of options. Do I invest in more weapon power to down the T-rex or will I forgo damage for some scent masking options and maybe that camo vest?-The thrill of the hunt! In later maps the hunter can easily become the hunted. Noise, wind direction and concealment all come into play. BAD-The current selection of 9 maps are but a few variations of each other. Some are midday, another may be the same map but at dusk with more Carnivores lurking about. The lack of day/night cycles and changing weather could have really changed the way the game was meant to be played.-Small amount of gear and weapons. A larger variety would have been appreciated. Some of the gear can really take the challenge out of the game.-Graphics: To me this is a none issue, I think the game looks great. However it is a bit bland in some spots. Once you see all of the Dinos and Island variations you pretty much have seen it all.-The Dinosaur diversity is really low. Only 6 main Dinos to hunt and collect. The maps are littered with smaller stuff running around but they cannot be collected and do not act as a threat. A larger pool of huntable Dinos would have really benefited this game.-Once you get a swing of things the game can become really easy unless you are constantly hunting the higher threat Carnivores while handicapping yourself on gear selection.-The Sim aspect is not as hardcore as some Sim hunters would like. This game rides a fine line between casual and mid-sim range.UGLY-Chances of seeing a sequel are slim to none.-Updates have stopped and the devs are in limbo or dissolved.-Many users report crashes and graphical issues (I have not)-Dinosaurs can be downright stupid sometimes, they will sometimes get caught on the terrain while trying to escape…totally killing the feeling of immersion.-Mutant Dinosaurs: Apparently they are out there but I have yet to encounter one. Not sure what is so different about them.All in all a very enjoyable shout out to the Classic Carnivores. While fun it is a bit flawed but defiantly worth picking up if any of this sounds cool, it just doesn’t have the depth of some of the more hardcore hunting games that will keep drawing you back in for hundreds if not thousands of hours. Pick it up if on sale for sure! Thanks for reading!			"

YouTube™ Video: Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn [Game Review] 

			Views: 1,028		

			My review of ""Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn"", a first-person dinosaur hunting simulator developed and published by Digital Dreams Entertainment LLC.		

Game: Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter RebornGenre: First-person hunting simulatorDeveloper: Digital Dreams Entertainment LLC Publisher: Digital Dreams Entertainment LLC Copy supplied by developerCarnivores: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn is a first-person dinosaur hunting simulator and a sequel/remake of the 2010 game Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter, developed and published by Digital Dreams Entertainment LLC.GRAPHICSThe game doesn't look particularly great: while the environments are big and full of plants, there isn't anything that hugely makes them different, and the draw distance isn't all that great even on high settings, and there is some noticable texture pop-in if you look carefully.GAMEPLAYYou must buy a license to kill and capture as trophies 9 different dinosaurs in multiple areas. While the game has some nice features like the Shooting Range and upgrades for both your character and weapons, the game is really boring: the dinosaurs are few and far between, the AI isn't really all that smart and some upgrades really don't matter that much. The variety is also very little, and if you don't like this type of games you will get bored real fast.CHALLENGETrying to avoid being detected by a dinosaur and achieving an headshot is hard but satisfying. Some of the bigger and meaner dinosaurs are hard to kill, and you will spend a lot of time killing smaller animals to get better weapons and upgrades.SOUNDThe sound is lacklustre, the music is good and the noises of the animals are okay. You will mostly hear the sound of you running from one point of the map to the other.REPLAYABILITYThere are four weapons to buy, nine dinosaurs to hunt and various upgrades to get, as well as 12 achievements that will keep completionists hooked for some hours.If you like hunting simulators, this franchise or the prospect of running from one point of the map to the other just to find a dinosaur to kill, then this game is for you. Otherwise, you won't have a good time.Story: n/aGraphics: 7Gameplay: 7.5Challenge: 8Sound: 6.5Replayability: 7ENJOYMENT: 7FRUSTRATION: 5Follow me on Twitter: @nickygra97Subscribe to my channelLike on Facebook{LINK REMOVED}Check my official websiteJoin my Steam group "

												I've bought just about every dinosaur game ever released, and none have ever quite acheived the holy grail of immersion splendour and terror that theJurrasic Park/ time travelling concept promises. However I've always retained a soft spot for the original Carnivores; prehistoric reptile-hunting pared down to the bare minimum, and without the tedious weight of plot, or survival aspects to get in the way. I was disappointed over the years to find that Carnivores would no longer run on newer versions of Windows, so when I saw this my heart leapt a beat. I have to say I'm just an hour or so in, but I'm liking it for all the same reasons as before.The graphics have improved over the first outing (given its been nearly 15 years)  but the feel is the same whacky future hunting scenario as before. As everyone else has commented it could defintely do with a few more species (hopefully some potential DLC?). The game size is tiny (less than a Gig) and I'd love to see this game format used in a big full budget environment like Cry engines latest 'Dino Island revisited' tech demo.Conclusion-Pleasingly pared down gameplay and solid immersion, the graphics are good but far from spectacular. Devs - More dinos and a hi-res texture map set please.9/10 (1 point for nostalgia's sake!)			"

												I highly recommend this game! I love the remake, I really do hope they do add more dinosaurs and area's to it though for I grinded it and basically have everything past this point. Never the less it's still enjoyable to hop on and shoot a couple things and get off. The AI is a little bad on some dinosaurs like the t rex for instance, it hasn't even charged me once yet, I've killed it multiple times and it literally is the easiest dino in the game. That's not how it should be in my opinion. I really hope they continue to update this game and bring more stuff with our supporting purchases because I'd LOVE to see the Allosaurus and Velociraptor and maybe 2 more zones! Really happy I made the purchase			"

												As a fan of all the old ones (aside from Carnivores 3) this is a good game. For some reason the graphics and gameplay look better and play cleaner on the PS3 version I already played and beat of this game. I have a very high end system and with advanced grass on the game lag was unplayable. That needs to be fixed right away. I can max out more intensive games than this so hope that gets resolved. The graphics are not as good as the PS3 version overall which is kind of a surprise since one of the dev's said they would be better on PC.  Oh and on the cover photo why is there a brachiosaurus and I think a diplodocus but none in the game? Raptors? And why are the 2 smaller dinos and the pteranadon not trophy worthy? that bird was a lucky shot :)Even though the kickstarted I tried to help fund failed I hope they add more lands and dinos. That along with the graphics fixes would make this a killer game for any Dino fan or hunting fan appreciate. There are good's and bad's with this one verses The Hunter: Primal but worth it while we wait for updates. Just keep FOV down a little or turn off advanced grass..			"

												While the graphics are gorgeous and the gameplay is pretty simple, is the game really worth the $15? Well... No; but why not?First and foremost, it's important to say that I grew up playing the original Carnivores games. I was five when I got the first one, and I've been playing them for almost two decades. That should tell you of the love and dedication I feel towards this series. It should also tell you of the excitement I felt when I learned of this remake; I bought it immediately, without even considering the pros or cons. All I knew, and all I cared about, was that it was Carnivores. I ended up regretting that blind loyalty.Let's talk about some pros, first. As I mentioned earlier, the graphics are gorgeous. They're a vast improvement over the original games and while the experience in the originals isn't by any means unpleasant, you can never escape the feeling of playing a game. The graphics are pixely at best and a mess at worst. In this remake, however, the graphics have been stunningly updated and the experience can quickly turn into one where you feel a part of the game and get lost in the scenery.The gameplay, while not necessarily better, is definitely not hard to get a handle on. It took me a few minutes to get it, but when I did, the game became much easier; they also don't thrust new mechanics on you halfway through a hunt. Once you've got everything, you've got it, and you can go on your merry way.Now... on to the cons.While the originals didn't have a crazy variety of dinosaurs to choose from, they certainly had more than this game. Yes, the dinosaurs are probably harder and take longer to produce, but there could have been patches or expansions that added more animals, and there haven't been. It gets boring hunting the same animals over and over, and unlike the originals, you can't mix and match what you hunt and where. There's a set list on each map, and once you've done it all, there's nothing left to do.There are very few maps, as well. The originals had many more options, and they were all fun to explore, as each one had secrets and easter eggs to find. Reborn, while the graphics are beautiful, has very little variety in the way of locations. There are three overall, with separate options for Dawn and Fog, giving you the feeling of more while actually giving you less. Despite the wonderful graphics, they do not make up for the lack of options in this game.If you're here for nostalgia, which there's a good chance you are, you will not find it here. This game is nothing like the originals. The dinosaurs are overall better, with significant improvements to their looks and AI, but the maps are nothing like the maps they were named after (for example, in the original Carnivores, Basmachee Rocks was not a desert). The gameplay, while easy to master much like the original, is nothing like the original gameplay and is not necessarily smooth.Overall, Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn does not feel like a remake or even an ode to the original Carnivores series. It comes across as a half-baked product that was shoved out at the peak of the Jurassic World hype and was then abandoned shortly after. In the year+ it's been out, it's received two patches (and only within the first few months of its release), no updates, and no expansions or added content. If you want to spend $15 on Carnivores, buy the mobile version, as it's identical to Carnivores 2, has more dinosaur options, more weapon options, and more map options; and it's only $7.			"

 Disclaimer - I have been gifted a free key for this game for review purposes, however my review will be kept as truthful as possible, since I am meant to help developers and buyers/gamers.  Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn review  TL;DR Carnivores:DH is a simulator that lets you, the player, hunt dinosaurs on a world which is an Earth replica but in a very early time period of dinosaurs. This is a dream to many people, including mine. Dinosaurs are cool, this game has them. The game also has weapons, although very limited in amount, you can get them all for playing the game. You can also upgrade your weapons, upgrade your character, upgrade your M.I.S.T (phone device which has many uses for tracking down dinosaurs), explore many different maps and much more. After you have killed or tranquilized a large dino, if you have the liscence for it (purchaseable with gems which you get for killing any dinosaur or tranquilizing it) you can then go up to it to confirm the kill and even get the dinosaur as a trophy. That was sure a breathfull of activites. GraphicsThe graphics are poorly optimized or my PC is just not good enough. I have tried to turn on Advanced Grass, which seems like the best option to put into any game, made the grass look better and also reduced my fps to a very low, just the surface of double-digit frames per second. However graphics are still worthy of being on this review as the dinosaurs are from a long range most of the time, so they look HD. However this is still something which will improve to get itself at least Skyrim-like graphics with some 2K-4K resolution mods. After noticing whhat I said didn't make any sense, graphics right now are pretty from a long range, but will improve. There are many different graphical options. Dinosaurs look very realistic, and the models definitely have some work that was put into them. The weapons look badass too, just imagine being this character in real life, handling a crossbow, shooting down dino's in the sky, a bit of a dark though but sounds awesome. Pros and Cons Pros:DinosaursRealistic gameplay (the AI isn't that smart, though)Will be improvedQuite a few mapsCons:Graphically speaking, it's not that geat, but there is tons of room for improvement Final Rating This game deserves its rating of an okay-ish 7/10 - I will improve this review once it gets a ton better.  I have been gifted the key by the kind developers of the game. They make my review about games like this possible.

												Let me begin by saying that Carnivores and Carnivores 2 were my all time favorite games as a kid. I spent an irresponsible amount of time playing those games.I saw yesterday that there was a remake of the game on Steam and almost fell over from excitement. I was disappointed for the most part after putting seriously hundreds of hours into Carnivores 1 and 2. Pros- I respect that they kept a lot of the features from the original games. The weird hovercrafts that take you to and from the game, the trophy room, even the map names.- The upgradability of your weapons and character is neat, but the pursuit of upgrades seems to be the only driving force of the game. Cons- The graphics are very cartoony, I'd honestly prefer the original graphics- The frame rate is capped somewhere between 30 and 50. I shouldn't be getting 40fps on a gtx1080. It stomps on the immersiveness of the game.- The dinosaurs are laughably huge. So large in fact that the smallest dinosaur cannot easily run away from you in the woods because it's colliding with too much of the foliage.- They cut the number of weapons in half- The number of huntable dinosaurs was also cut in half. Which is a huge deal breaker.- Gameplay feels like it should be a mobile gameI really wanted to love this game. And I'll continue playing it until I've unlocked all of the maps and all of the upgrades, but I'm going to stop immediately after that. Why? because there's no incentive to play after that. I am forecasting a lonely 4 hours of collective gameplay to finish. For the price, that isn't that bad. But it does not live up to the original games.			"

												THANKS TO THE DEVS WHO DID THIS REBOOT!  You brought back a classic from extinction for me :)   Back in the day I purchased the original Carnivores.  As a dino lover I was intrigued but didn't expect much.  But this became one of my most cherished hunting games of all time. Went on to get Carnivores 2 and Ice Age.  Now the reboot is out and I'm happy to say that all the wonder and awe from the when I played the original are back.  Beautiful and open hunting locations with freedom to roam around and hunt how you want.    Great sound design and graphics.  As you wander the lush jungle of the first few hunting locations you'll find a lush green hunting zone with scattered rock outcroppings (which you can climb for a good view).  Shadows of lazy flying dinos criss cross the ground below.  On a distant island an active volcano rumbles.   You'll hear the mournful moan of a herbivore as you walk or the growl of a meat eater who just sniffed out your scent.  It all adds up to a great immersive environment to explore.      GOOD: Great graphics especially for a ""budget priced"" title.Great sound designIf you bought the tag when you kill a dino you can put it in your ""living"" trophy room (and similar species of dinos will scale depending on their weight so that 3 ton stegosaur will look pretty big next to your 2 ton one).Great reboot of a classicBAD:A few bugs here and there.Sound of evac ship getting stuck in a loop on one expedition and drowned out all other sounds.  (only happened once in 4 hours of play time)Deleting trophies from my trophy room seems buggy.  Maybe I'm doing it wrong but when I try to delete one nothing happens and then after several attempts then I lost 3 trophies.   Hmmmm like I said might be doing it wrong but if that's the case then boy is it not an easy task.  All in all it's a great title and great price for what you get.  If you're a fan of the original I don't think you'll be disappointed.  I'd LOVE to see Carnivores 2 and Ice Age updated or added into this one as DLC :D			"

												Loved the original games - Dinosaur Hunter, Ice Age and Cityscape (which I hope will be remade as well - fingers crossed!!).Was an insta-buy for me. Greatly improved graphics since the originals, big open world. Game is a little too easy so far with the occasional dinosaur glitching about everywhere, but so far I'm having great fun. You'll be walking about and then hear a roar, you'll be like what the ♥♥♥♥ was that, darting about everywhere trying to find it.  You gotta take your time and be stealthy when tracking your chosen dinos. This means avoiding to walk downwind, keeping silent, keeping out of sight. I haven't got to the meat eaters yet but I can tell its gonna be fun, all those memories of my childhood running the hell away from the T-Rex's who were trying to eat me - good times.All in all - it's a good remake of the original.Right now stop distracting me from playing this game!

												I really enjoy playing this game.  I would like to eventually see is the dinosaurs interacting with other dinosaurs, and of course more carnivores. As of right now there are only 2, which is a little disappointing. Even if no changes are made to this game I would still recommend it to others. It brings back fond memories of playing Carnivores 2 when I was a kid.  "

												Good arcadish shooter, not as frustrating as theHunter Primal, but not nearly as challenging or satisfying.  This is a more kick back and enjoy blasting some dino's game.  The Hunter Primal is better if you have the patience for it.  I would love to see this game enable mods.  That would knock it way up in my book.   "

												Amazing. I have wanted a proper Dinosaur hunting game for two decades now, and this is it. Dinosaurs can hear and smell you, both of which are affected by the current wind direction and speed. You need to move quietly and shoot each dinosaur's weak spot if you wish to take him down in one shot (for maximum points). You get binoculars, a map, a gun, and then you are tossed onto a dinosaur-infested island. Different times of day and varying weather affect your hunting strategy as well. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes dinosaurs. This is a great game.			"

												PROSNostalgia is a huge pro for me as I played the original.Lots of replayability with new weapons, items, and maps to unlock as you progress through the game. Tutorial is a definite plus for new players who didn't play the original. CONSGraphics engine needs definite optimization. I know its DX9 but i can't max out LOD on my 290X with an i7-4790K without getting lag spikes in certain parts of some maps.  With that said graphics options are severely limited. Only FOV and LOD are configurable (excluding resolution). Hopefully some mods correct this in the future. Once you unlock everything I don't see anything else to do other than beat your high scores. Hoping for multiplayer feature sometime in the future now that the game is on steam, as of now there is none. OTHER THOUGHTSGame overall is a bargain of a remake for only 15$. Buy it if you want a good game to kill time with. Hope the developers add more maps, weapons, and dinosaurs in the future to update the game or as DLC.			"

												Excellent remake of the original Carnivores game. Graphics and AI could be a little better. I hope the DLC will be worth it. More dino species would be great, like velociraptor hunting in pack at night only... baryonyx in the swamps... A valley full of iguanodons, hadrosaurus, Corythosaurus and Maiasaura resting peacefully around a nesting area (even baby dinosaurs? why not)...  giant apatosaurus or brachiosaurus whipping small dinosaurs / player with theirs tail ... Pachycephalosaurus charging as soon as they see you... maybe some compsognatus that try to bite your arm (like the snakes of far cry 3/4) and making noises revealing your position to the closest dinosaurs. If they could interact with each others it could be really cool to watch some raptors jump from the bushes, take down a large herbivore and steal your kill right in front of you...			"

												First up I'll admit a bias I'm not at all a fan of hunting games. I bought this one because I used to have Carnivores 2 and Ice Age, which I enjoyed quite a bit. This game however was quite boring and very limited so I'd recommend watching some gameplay videos before you decide.Pros:Hunting dinosaurs! Same as others but it's a pretty epic concept and of course dangerous when hunting carniverous ones.Good graphics.Cons:Limited dinosaurs to hunt.Only a few weapons to use to hunt.Of the upgrades or perks or whatever most of them reduce your score when using. It makes sense for things like radar but why would you hunt anything without camo or cover scent, but both those remove 5% of your score each.Inconsistant AI, shooting some dinosaurs and they won't even recognise. Shoot a carnivore once and it runs away for a bit, yet most of the time shrugs it off. Also when running they get stuck on rocks and such and end up running in place.Minor personal complaints:Stupid freaking ship drops you upwind from everything 90% of the time.Crouching seems to just be for noise reduction as they see me just as easily as if I were standing.Getting the Gem things for unlocks feels grindy.

This is definitely a refreshing blast from the past and the minute I started the game up I felt like I was back there.  It has many improvements and many additions, the graphics are superb and the world very lifelike.  Only negative I can say is that some of the dino's seem to act a little weird from time to time.If you loved the original, 2 or Ice Age then I HIGHLY reocmmend you trying this one, I'm sure you'll love it!

												★★★☆☆Hmmmmm took me a while to decide whether to give this game a positive or negative review, it all boiled down to did I enjoy myself? That I did, so I decided to give it a positive review simply because after all the annoyances it was a fun game. Now to elaborate on what I said previously, the game was fun, but only once you reach the last area up and till that point I had to farm for points by killing all the pteranodons flying around, because to get any equipment or upgrades worth getting you need a big load of gems which will take forever if you farm for it from the land walking dinosaurs. But after I had obtained all the equipment I wanted and did the last area I felt like I was a bit over powered XD do don't go farming as badly as I did, just go with the flow and enjoy the game. Hmmmmm I'll rate this game a 3/5, it's a little bit good once you look past the phone-game like progression design and weird graphical errors.Also I'm glad I got it from a bundle because the game only took me 4 and a half hours to finish so wouldn't be worth its full price.

												Long ago in the early 2000's, my friend had a disc with a demo of Carnivores 2 and I remember really liking that game. For the longest time I wanted a full Carnivores game to play, but the old games are very hard to come by. This is why I was thrilled when I saw Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn on Steam.Having played the game now, I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed my time with it, but I feel it's a bit lacking in content. You can unlock most of it in the span of a couple of hours. The selection things you can hunt and hunt with is rather limited, only having 6 large dinosaurs and 3 different islands with slight variations to the environment (time of day and fog).The game itself is a bit strange at times with dinosaurs often getting stuck on small rocks on the ground or going through large boulders.Graphics in the game are good, the environments and dinosaurs look really nice, but the options are a bit lacking, only allowing you to adjust your FOV, toggle advanced grass and adjusting LOD distance.Controls are good, I especially liked how the game fused both the ""press toggle"" and ""hold down"" methods for crouching and aiming, more games should do that.Overall, I think the game is a lot of fun, but the price is a bit steep for what the game offers. Still, if you want a dinosaur hunting game, this will definitely quench that thirst for a while.			"

												Not sure how to feel about this one. For comparison, been playing a lot of The Hunter: Primal, to which this game is slightly similar to. There aren't that many dinosaurs to hunt, granted, but the guns feel very good and the scenery is downright gorgeous. The worst thing is how long it takes to walk around the environment and how hard it is to find ammo and how easy it is to die even after you've got good gear. It's rather unforgiving at times.So with that said, Carnivores: DHR, has a little more on offer in my opinion. It's a more arcadey type of game, with cartoony art and a UI that looks like it was made for smart phones (because former versions were developed for iOS and Andriod in mind) for very casual gamers in mind. So far I have been having fun with it. There doesn't seem to be much consequence for dying and there isn't really much to lose.Has way more dinosaur types than Primal does, though less guns, however there are attachments you can buy to improve your guns which outnumber the ones you can get in Primal. The gun handling itself also feels very arcadey.Carnivores is also sadly SP only, while Primal you can hunt online with friends or strangers.Arcade vs Realism isn't exactly bad, it's just a different feel. I'm not sure I can rate one game over the other even if they are similar. Carnivores is almost too easy though, so you don't really feel much risk as you do in Primal. It's a far more casual experience.So to sum it up, TL;DR:  Category TH: Primal Carnivores: DHR   Weapons: More Realistic, Better Feel, More Variety (11 types), Limited Upgrades (May be able to attach a scope on some weapons) More Arcadey, Less Variety (4 types), More Upgrades (3-4 per weapon, though not visual)   Scenery: Very realistic, detailed, one very large map, very pretty More cartoony, detailed, several moderately sized maps, nice to look at   Dinosaurs: Very limited variety (5 species), mostly carnivores Larger variety, (9 species) carnivores and herbivores   Difficulty: Challenging Casual   Modes: Singleplayer and Multiplayer (PvE & PvP) Singleplayer Only   Price: $29.99 $14.99 It's rather a very good game for what it is.

												A nice remake of the original Carnivores game. People who are fans of dinosaur hunting games should definitely give this a try. No doubt there are some bugs and glitches, but you will be too busy hunting T-rexes to notice them.			"

												Before going on about how I think this game is great I need to go over the negitives so your informed. I have only put in 65 minutes of gameplay and have crashed 2 times and had to sign out of my computer, plus my framrate never goes above 15 while hunting, but I still think it's fantasic. While there is not much right now in the game (6 dinosaurs to hunt, 4 weapons to use, and around a dozen upgrades) I still think it's worth the 15$, but I would wait for a sale just to be safe. It's a loyal recreation of the original games which I have fantasic memory's of, and I think it's good other then the crashing problems and framrate problems, which if you can get past, you can enjoy a fanatic if unpolished dinosaur hunting game, that is loyal to the originals.

												Well, would like the game if it stopped crashing all the time!And when I get it working, I just can't stop laughing at the stupid AI of the dinosaurs. They keep getting stuck on rocks/trees so you can just get behind and kill!The visuals aren't too bad, for an indie game. The sounds could be much better... I mean, hearing a bear sound for a dinosaur? Really?The fact that it is only three maps, recycled with a few variations, lacks variety. The three weapons is a major disappointment too! And how could the crossbow deal more damage than say, the .50 caliber?Game seemed promising but I can't recommend something I didn't liked nor had a good experience with.Save yourself some money and get something else... or if you wanna risk it, get only in a sale!

												A great remake to my favorite game : Carnivores 2Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn, is a great gameI only wish they were more features because I like it so muchIn my opinion the game need a few things to be the perfect Carnivores game- Needs a few more dinosaurs (cause everyone loves variety)- Needs more customisation (like choosing which dinosaurs to hunt were, it would give the maps more versatility, so for example: T-rex hunters could choose from more maps )- Could use more weapon types but that's not a critical thingWhat is great about that game ?- Its easy to learn how to play- It lauches you right into the action no waiting- The hunting mechanics are perfect- There is several map to choose from - The Ai of the dinosaurs are good- The graphics are amasing- Its a Very Fun game if you like hunting dinosaurs.I recommend this game completely.

												Fun briefly but once you realize how limited in scope this game is odds are good you will put it down and never pick it up again.Graphics are pleasant and the idea of hunting dinosaurs is an exciting one. First couple hunts you are tracking and sneaking through the jungle and thinking you may have stumbled on quite a gem of a game. The limitations quickly reveal themselves. 3 guns in total and about 8 dinosaurs. The worlds feel off like there just isnt nearly enough variety of creatures in them. Exploring the maps feels meaningless, I have not found a single interesting location or point anywhere. Map variety means little other than visibility limitations on certain locations that always work against your favor.If this had some serious effort put into it or was open to the steam workshop there would be some real potential here. If you got this in a bundle, give it a play, it may be entertaining for 1-4 hours. Paying for this game is not recommended.			"

												The bad:CartoonishConsole-quality texturesMore arcade than simJungle environments don't feel like actual junglesNo multiplayerNeed to buy a license to collect different dinos (why??)Somewhat limited choice of weaponry, all hidden behind unlocksQuestionable AI at times: I saw a flying dino literally stop and fly backwards, then forwards again, without turningDinos glitch through rocksInescapable kill animation if you get too close to a dinoThe good:$15Better environment variety than Hunter PrimalDino collection/extraction mechanics are visually satisfyingNice dino varietyEasy to kill flying dinosEasy to learn control schemeThe ok:Ambient dinosWeapon/gear upgradesOverall: Recommended but only for people who really love dino hunting games. Casuals shouldn't bother. This will probably not replace Hunter: Primal for you unless you can get past the cartoonish visuals and arcade-like sessions. If you can, though, it's a decent enough game to play until Ark hits.			"

												A really nice and fun game. Its very cheap for what it gives. The unlocks system is addictive.It nicely fills a gap in the hunter games that already exist.Many maps and dinosaurs to hunt  and the weapons is more than enough (better than many redundant weapons that only change the 3D model or skin, like many other hunt sims).I like it much and recommend to someone that like to hunt dinosaurs!!!

												I used to like Carnivores. Not to love 'em or something but still like it. Now on Steam Sales there was this and I couldn't resist. After playing for like 2 hours, I can give my thoughts about the game. The game offers us a trip to a planet inhabited by dinosaurs provided by a fictional hunting firm DinoHunt. Our job is simple. We get one of the available weapons (those are pretty limited to 3 kinds), get additional equipment like a camouflage and we are thrown into a prehistoric landscape. We have to stalk through jungle to hunt like 7 or 8 kinds of dinosaurs, including ferocious T-rex. Every kill is awarded with gems and score (depends on how many shots we took to take down the beast, what was the distance and stuff), which is a somewhat a currency in the game for opening new levels. With gems we pay for our equipment, weapons and license for a particular species of a dinosaur. We can hunt freely for every type we encounter, but only licensed dinosaurs will be in our thropy room. And that's pretty much it. We get the score quite fast so sooner or later we get access to new levels until we get it all and then the game loses it's replay value. That's pretty much all in terms of gameplay.The graphics are nice but compared to other games it looks really decent. The dinosaurs are quite well detailed but I've seen better. Also beware to not turn on the advanced grass. It will slow ur  PC to a calculator mode from the stone age era. Next thing is the sound. We get a simple, forgetable music in the background and the enviroment sounds which are mostly re-used stock sounds like crickets, wind sound and typical jungle uproars. In case of dinosaurs, we get really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stock sounds, took from cartoons I guess. Really, in old carnivores games, there were better sounds than in this one.Overall I would give the game 6/10. It's an good game for a dinosaur maniacs, but people who are not used to stalk'n kill games and are not into dinosaurs at all, should look for another game. I would highly recommend for the devs to add more dinosaur species (really? Only 2 carnivores? No Velociraptor? No Allosaurus? Shame...) and a larger variety of weapons. That way this game would have at least some replay value. At this point, it's just a decent dino-shooter.			"

												This game is BA!I still own the orignal Carnivores for windows 98/95.... Yeah, that's right I'm a true fan. That game scared me a lot. When the T-Rex chased you, it was over. It would grab you and swing you around in its mouth and slam you against the ground... Awesome! The raptors just ran you over then ate you while you were shaking and screaming... lol! Anyways this game is a little more what I wanted back in the day but wished it had more blood and guts. You could also swim in the old game.I will always love this game. Nothing better than killing dinosaurs!I own it on every device I have. It's really fun on my tablet and phone.You should buy it too!			"

												This game is what I hoped TheHunter:Primal would be.  Where TheHunter had you collecting stuff before you could really hunt anything, in this game, they drop you off on an island ready to go.  There is a money system, 'gems', that you use to buy upgrades in the game.  It does get a bit grindy when you are mostly just killing things to get enough gems to progress, but this is to be expected.  Who wants to have all the best stuff right out of the gate?  So you start off hunting with no 'toys' and a standard gun.  At some point you'll be able to buy a crossbow, which is better at taking down wampuses but has a lot of drop after you fire it.  So you have to look at your distance to figure out where to shoot.  Not too much after that I was able to buy the sniper rifle, which is pretty much where you aim you hit.  There are only a handful of dinosaurs, but the ones they picked are very well done.  The one people might miss would be a Velociraptor, although there is a medium sized carnivore that chases you around to make up for that.  The environments are really well done.  There are some islands in fog where you can't see where the dinos are very well, and this really adds to the tension.  The final island is a big, rocky place where you can see the dinosaurs from far away and is maybe a bit too easy, but at this point you'll mostly be cleaning up the achievements you haven't got, so I thought that was OK.Oh, and there's also 'mutant' dinosaurs, which are rare and give you another thing to go after.  They are supposed to be extra dangerous I guess, but I never noticed much difference.  I think I got this in a bundle.  I would say it's worth the $15 regular price though.  As you can see, I've got over 13 hours on it to get all the achievements and pretty much do everything in the game once.  There may not be a whole lot to it, but if you're after a dinosaur hunting game, this does that really well and is fun, and that's what matters!  I'll probably play it again sometime down the road.

												The Carnivores series has always been special to me, and with no surprise, Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn brings just what the game is known for, Hunting, and earning points, nothing more, nothing less, which is perfect.Back when I played Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter on the PSP/PS3, let's be honest, the game looked like crap, but it was the type of game that was special, regardless of the graphics. Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn drastically changes that, making the game much more realistic.If your new to the game, let me tell you what this game is all about. As the title says, your a hunter, you kill Dinosaurs and you get points, you can also capture the dinosaur and display it in your trophy room. With the points you earn, you can get upgrades for the player, weapons, or just anything really. That's literally it, as small as it sounds, the replay value for this game is huge! PROS: -The game sticks to what it was known for-The graphics are pretty good-There are achievements to keep you entertained once you earned everything CONS: -The optimization could be better, but overall it's not that bad-The developers could have taken the chance to add new dinosaurs-There is hardly any weapons, compared to the other games in the seriesOverall, even though there are ups and downs with this game, It's a thrilling experience to hunt dino's then to see other dino's on the map, heading your way to eat you. If you like dinosaurs and feel like killing some, then get this game! Final Score: 10/10			"

I remember in Carnivores 1 & 2 they would evengo as far as to swim after you, it was frightening. As if all that other stuff was not bad enough the selection of maps guns and dinos is much to small.

												This game generally doesn't have much good about it to be honest as the graphics are probably the best thing about this game - at least compared to the original Carnivores dinosaur hunter games. It might seem quite exciting at first especially during the first 2 levels but after that it starts to get very slow and tedious. The gem system plagues the game as it requires players to hunt dinosaurs that don't offer players a challenge as they should attack you but just run into shrubbery where they are hard to hit. Dinosaurs should be all over the place but it makes them feel like rare animals as they were as common as any animal today.It just gets boring with nothing to engage you with.			"

												This game is a fantastic remake of the Action Forms classic. The graphics are gorgeous and the AI is good, and the variety in individual dinosaurs even from the same species in terms of size, mutated colors, and behavior is very refreshing. The environments are gorgeous and the weather very immersive. Even with only five dinosaurs currently licensed the replayability is practically endless. It's a great value for the money and the devs have left further improvement and features open for addition and improvement. I highly recommend it, as both an avid player and longtime fan of the Carnivores series!			"

												If you remember the old Carnivores series about dinosaur hunting... Well, this is it! :) It brings back the good memories, but be warned that it doesn't bring phenomenal graphics or too many innovations.Even without them though, it is fun to play and it kept me surprisingly allerted and entertained. Trying to bag as many dinosaurs with as little bullets and actually living to tell the tale is still a blast.For someone who never played the series and doesn't feel that nostalgic drive to get it again, it might be too expensive for what it REALLY is, but I higly recommend it during some kind of sale.

												I love this game. It is a great remake of the original classic carnivores.Pros~>Amazing graphics>Amazing maps>Love the dinosaurs>A good amount of weapons>You get to go observe the dinosaursNow, You may be thinking ""this is the best game ever!"" But.... It has some cons to.Cons~>Low amount of weapons>Low amount of dinosaurs>Bigger map sizes (I got around the entire island within 5 minutes)>Less complicated to use the crossbow plzThe overall is really good. But here are some recommendations for new dinosaurs. Spinosaurus, Utahraptor, Brachiosaurus , Iguanadon. Think about it now. Buy the game! :D			"

												Steam really needs a neutral optionThis game has a few very good points, but it is let down by some quite bad points (in my opinion ofc). The bad side of the game consists of average physics such as dino's getting stuck on trees and rocks etc, no real replayability, lack of weapon variety, only 4 maps (with a few variations such as think fog, dusk and clear sky), direction of sounds (sounds seem to come from the wrong direction) and last of all is the amount of dinosaurs you can actually hunt........its 6.........Stegosaurus, Triceratops, Parasaurolophus, Ankylosaurus, Ceratosaurus and last but not least the T-Rex. There are also 3 other dinosaurs that you can shoot in the face but sadly these cant be collected. For a dinosaur hunting game it really doesnt make sense that there are only 6 to hunt and collect, as many others may have thought when buying the game.The good points of this game, for me, just about make it neutral. The 6 dino's you hunt all have their own personalities, with the T-Rex being the dominant force......until you arrive. Each dinosaur can be seen eating, calling and running away each in its own distinct way. The noises the dinosaurs make are fantastic, eating, calling, roaring at you, all add to the feel of this game. These sounds really come alive when you're on one of the maps thats blanketed  by thick fog, when you hear the calls in the distance, while not being able to see them, creates a great sense that you're actually there in real life. This thick fog can be a menace however, with it being so think mixed in with the poor direction of the noises it can often be a nightmare trying to find the dinosaur. Once you have either killed or tranquilised the dino you can then store it in a sort of show room with 17 spaces. If there had been more dinosaurs to collect it would have made a huge difference. The maps on this game are well designed and pretty big which may be good or bad depending or your point of view i guess, i liked them. Graphics are decent, ive seen far worse. The final good point is that there are mutant versions of the 6 dinosaurs, however these versions are only cosmetic, they still look quite cool though! Overal this game has to be called neutral, siding towards negative. It just feels a bit to much like an app game rather than a full blown £10 game. The good areas are great but the bad ones really let it down, mainly the small ammount of dinosaurs, if the developers made dlc which added more maps and dinosaurs that would at least be somethig but they havent sadly. In my opinion only buy this when its on sale, if you love shooting a T-Rex in the face or if you're like me a love gaining the achievements on games!			"

												This game is really fun. When it works. I have tried to play it many times, and it only worked once for about a half an hour or so. While it was working I had a blast. It reminded me of Cabella's games with dinosaurs. It was really good. Unfortunately, I will have to not recommend this game due to the fact that for every minute I spent playing I spent 2 trying to get the game to work. I tried sending a message to the support email, and I just keep getting a message that says my message was delayed.			"

It dies not knowing what killed it.Your shots attracted a different predator.A Ceratosaurus, it rushes you before you could reload,You yell an explative as you only have two bullets.You don't need two though as your first shot pierces its heart.You look at the bleeding corpse of the primeval predator and yell,""I am the baddest predator on this island.""

												The only fhuking dinasour game on steam that hasn't got terrible animations, Broken AI, super scaled world properties making your mouse even on highest settings feel like your aiming and moving it at 5 fps and last but not least an average player ping of edleast 120 (cough cough im looking at you ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ark online)Can't beleive i wasted so much money on bloody disanour games.Most of these titles are so bad they are disrespectful to the gaming community.Similarly so to the zombie survavlist developers (oh man if only i could have one them in a room for 30 minutes.... just me, them and my bowie knife)If i could have my way I'd put all those other developers of dinasour games (orion, ark, primal carnage ect) in a cage of rats in a river somewhere in vietnam on a dry day.Ofcourse I would make sure the water level has bearly left enough space for them to breathe.Maybe I'd feed them some mouldy cheese every few days out of compassion.Maybe not?Oh and btw this game did live up to the original. 9/10 for a hunting game.If anything they made this game better, however the maps in this game aren't as good as the original game, something i would like to see change.  The size of these maps is a tad smaller if i recall aswell.			"

												This game is great if you like to kill the same 2 Dinosaurs over and over again for hours and hours before actually ranking up.  You run out of ammo quickly and have to teleport out of the Dino Zone to get more ammo.  I guess this game could be cool and maybe I'll play it again soon and have deja vu.  The Premise is actually stolen from Bill Murray's GroundHog Day movie which is outstanding and I'd highly recommend it if you haven't seen it yet.  the game itself reminds me of the Great Extinction Hunt of Teddy Roosevelt back in 1904, the Rough Riders set out to kill as many endangered species as they possibly could.  Turns out they thankfully forgot Manatees, those poor cute sea cow things.  Now the motor boats just scar them or take them out accidentally, the creatures cannot buy a break!The Dinosaur game does have a GPS unit that Teddy and The Rough Riders didn't have available due to the lack of technology.  The Regulators from Young Guns were said to have been the original developers of the 1st GPS because of the incoming forces constantly trying to acquire Mr. Tunstels Estate.  Charlie Sheen's character died trying to fight Billy the Kid over the rights to hunt Dinosaurs on the Prairie.  Dirty Steve took over as King Regulator, the Master of all Slayers.The GPS used in this game is basically the same device but it tracks Dinos, Rush Limbaugh's Pharmacy script receipts, and Sarah Silverman's tour schedule. Thanks to the developer for making a great game, I'll probably give it another 0.4 hours before changing my opinion but for now I'm going with Positive review just to prove that I'm not a Troll.  Mr.Z knows from prior communication that I'd never dream of writing a Bogus review.  I'm all Heart and Balls. This game is really worth a shot for 20 buckeroos.  the graphics are OK but you'll probably be ok to run to the bathroom whenever you want without hitting the pause button...and likely miss nothing.  This concept reminded me of the last time I did exterior painting and stood there watching the drywall absorb the paint.  I was inside when this happened because Drywall is seldomly found outdoors.In case you do come across a time when you need a professional painting contractor, my buddy Brett aka 'Muscles Marinara' is outstanding and YES he is for hire			"

												I fell in love with Carnivores, the original, when it first came out fifteen or so years ago. However long it was. But this game is far less impressive than that old gem of a game. Fewer dinosaurs. And horrible issues. My computer requirements are more than enough for this game yet it wouldn't play. It kept crashing and bullet registration was next to nothing. It worked fine shooting the targets in the shooting range. But out in the hunt. Nothing seemed to happen when shooting the dinosaurs. Pretty graphics, much better than the original ofcourse. But pretty graphics is not what a game makes. I requested a refund not even forty minutes into 'game play' because half of that time was dealing with it not opening or working. It's a shame that I have to say to save your money and maybe visit this game a long time from now after more fixes or patches have occured.			"

												Very fun, just like the original but with significantly improved graphics. I wish we would have been able to hunt Velociraptors but it's fine. Hopefully in the future they will remake Carnivores: Ice Age which will include the extra creatures that were in the mobile version. This is also the best hunting game i have ever played in my life and would recommend to any one who enjoys hunting games. This game however is not for people who rage at games that don't include realistic dinosaurs.			"

												The game's novelty wears off really fast. I've never played any of the other ones from this series but if they are anything like this, I don't know how people keep from getting bored. It turns into an arcade grind fest. And there seems to only be 5-6 dinosaurs that you can ""actually"" hunt. I'm not counting the random Pterodactyls you can shoot down for extra crystals. On the plus side, I will say the dinosaurs look good. Their AI is really buggy sometimes but that makes for some really funny hunting moments. My recommendation is that you wait till a big Steam sale (aka the incoming 2015 Summer Sale).			"

Less weapons, worse controls, and a very odd points system. This one however plays like an IOS mobile game. For example they award gems for dino kills, it has the stink of a micro transaction all over it. I was expecting a blast from the past, but i ended up with a mediocre IOS to PC port.

I own Carnivore, Carnivores 2, and Carnivores: Ice Age. So I was really excited to play a brand new Carnivores game!The graphics are amazing and very much improved with a spectacular environment having lots of trees rocks etc. giving you many areas to hide! The gameplay is very similar to the original, being dropped on an island hunting dinosaurs.You start by only able to hunt one species, and gain gems depending on the size and accuracy of the dinosaurs.These gems are then used to unlock new locations, new deadlier dinosaurs, and upgrade your gear weapons and person attributes.The amount of gems you need to unlock the new dinosaurs is kind of ridiculous but that's what keeps you playing.There are a few things different compared to the original series.First of all the dinosaurs you hunt are 50 times bigger! Way more threatening and more crucial to hide.Sadly there aren't as many dinosaurs to hunt including the Velociraptors. Which were super tiny, fast and hard to hunt without being seen/killed first.The death scene isn't to interesting, in the originalyou saw your dead body while the dinosaur ate you or the T-Rex flinging you around. While this game just has the dinosaur opening his jaws in slow motion and ending the game.Very enjoyable, and it's a great game just like it's predecessors!10/10 "

												While I was incredibly excited to play an updated version of my childhood game, I was severely disappointed for many of the old key features that I loved were simply not in the game or rather stupidly hard to get. It's a game that's slow, all Carnivores games are, although this game in particular, is too slow. Carnivores 2, the game I was interested in and played so many years ago, moved at a faster pace, right off the bat the player held the ability to hunt a carnivore in a new area with a pistol if they so choose, in this, it was simply too slow to be an enjoyable experience.This game had some issues with optimization as well, as much as I would love a new Carnivores game, this simply could not deliver the dose of nostalgia I wanted from Carnivores 2. Rather I went to a website to get old games and got Carnivores 2, a game which I immediately had more fun playing because of the sheer amount of content in it.			"

												As much as I wanted to recommend this because the originals were childhood favorites of mine, there's just so little content in this game, 5 dinosaurs and 4 weapons if I can remember correctly. Also it looks like it was ported straight off the PS3 (I'm pretty sure it was, it was released on PSN as an arcade game), and that's not a huge issue, I just hate ugly UI's. The gameplay isn't bad, just sprinting around an island until you find a dinosaur, but the AI isn't the smartest, they'll get stuck in trees/rocks/spin in circles a lot. I'd wait to see if they patch, or update this. If anything, you should go check out Carnivores 2. It's waaaaaay outdated graphically, but a much better game, more maps, dinosaurs, weapons, ect.			"

YouTube™ Video: Carnivors: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn Review in 30 seconds 

			Views: 563		

			Everybody loved disonaurs when they were a kid. So this game has a lot of nostalgic value and just the words “Dinosaur Hunter” are cool enough to get you excited.		

Everybody loved disonaurs when they were a kid. So this game has a lot of nostalgic value and just the words “Dinosaur Hunter” are cool enough to get you excited. Unfortunately, all the potential this game had just made us feel disappointed. It could have been so much more.You hunt dinosaurs for sport with either a rifle, a crossbow or a sniper rifle. It sounds limited at first, but you can upgrade weapons (and your GPS) through gems you get for each kill. These upgrades usually go around making you more deadly and stealthy.Tracking with hunting techniques is a cool concept, since you must follow footprints and awareness of wind direction is important so the dinosurs don’t catch your smell. The GPS radar will be your most trusty ally however, since it will help you find your prey through the games different areas (jungle, forests, deserts, etc.)But this is where it starts going downhill. Nothing in the environment reacts to your presence or actions. It’s just there, being all static like a wall. And not a pretty wall, even. You don’t leave footprints, you don’t brush against bushes, and you don’t break branches you pass through. It’s like the game is constantly slapping you in the face to remind you that it is, in fact, just a game.And we know that every game has its limitations but the star of the game, the dinosaurs, are just not up to the task of making this a cool experience. First of all, there’s only 5 species to hunt. But the worst thing is the AI. They either run right towards you, making them an easy target or, even worse, get stuck on the map itself. And when they do kill you… oh boy… the animation is just awful.That being said, it did manage to be fun for a couple of hours. So we gave it a 4/10.			"

												*For best results, view ""Shia LaBeouf"" Live - Rob Cantor on YouTube before reading this review.You're walking in the woods. There's no one around. And your phone is dead. Out of the corner of your eye you spot him.  Ceratosaurus  He's following you about 30 feet back. He gets down on all fours and breaks into a sprint. He's gaining on you.  Ceratosaurus   Running for your life (from  Ceratosaurus ) He's got sharp teeth (it's  Ceratosaurus ) Lurking in the shadows extremely dangerous  Ceratosaurus Now with that out of the way, here's my verdict. It's a solid 7/10 game that had a lot of potential but ultimately falls short in a few areas. You can read/hear more about that in other reviews. All I can say is that I played the previous Carnivores games and enjoyed them. Although this new installment has some issues, it's not bad. Once the nostalgia wears off, you'll realize the previous games weren't much better. At least this one is easier to get running on a modern system.			"

												TL;DR As of 30.05.15 game heavily lacks of content. Wait for the developers to add some (will they?) and then buy it. Regardless of that game looks, feels and plays great.And now the details:Pros:+A great remake of good ol' Carnivores 2 with all the original mechanics and a couple of new ones.+Looks great (a bit blury but you get used to it)+Feels great. Nowadays indie games are common to be really 'creaky' and not very responsible. Good thing this is not one of them. +Pretty optimized.Cons:-Lack of content. Not just new one but content in general.  3 maps (plus their variations like fog or dusk), 4 weapons, 6 huntable dinosaurs and a dozen of equipment is all this game has for now.-Dinosaurs AI. Seems to be unchagned since 1999. Carnivores are not dangerous at all as long as you're on top of some rock. Herbivorous are likely to stuck (or even go inside) in rocks while trying to run away.Overall:As it is now game is just for a single night. Hope it's going to get some deveoplment cause potential is really big.			"

A short writeup of the most important points of the video:+First Person game with FOV Slider~Gameplay is quite ok.~Variety is lackluster(3 weapons, 9 maps, 6 dinos to hunt), but not the worst thing on earth-Performance: Incredibly bad performance due to minimalistic options menu and poor optimisation-Graphics: Textures are simply upresed from the PS3 version.

												Feels like bargain bin trash. No story, you just spawn on this wide open, samey looking empty island with like 15 bullets. At first theres no way to find dinosaurs besides walking around, hoping to run into one. Before you have any upgrades this means pumping 6-7 rounds into them. That means with the tiny ammo you're given you get to kill 2 guys, then you have to quit the level and respawn. Wanting to hunt more dinosaurs costs large amounts of gems. Getting ANY gun upgrades or new weapons requires 200-300 gems EACH, yet you net around 30 or so per hunt. Yes this means a single damage or ammo upgrade requires 10 runs of killing the same 2-3 dinosaurs and repeating. Then you get that SINGLE upgrade and have to do it all over again a bunch of times. Theres more islands with more dinosaurs, but the catch 22 is you can't go because they are too dangerous, meaning more grinding the same level with the same 2-3 dinosaurs endless times. If you accidentally run into a carnivorous dinosaur over a hill you had no idea was there, or if the dinosaur you are hunting that you have to get right next to (bc of tiny ""weak spots"" that are usually on the front side or under some armor) desides to attack you, you auto die. 1 hit kills you and theres no running or escaping. If this happens you lose all progress of that run, leading to even more repetition and mindless grinding. I honestly can't believe such terrible design decisions were made with the upgrade system, hitboxes, lack of gun and enemy variety, the boring repetitive empty islands. Buy Turok from 1996, may look worse but is better in every way. 3/10.			"

												I was just looking for a fun Hunting game what brought me to this conclusion was the fun I was having in the very limited experience offered in GTA 5 Hunting with Trevor, Ironically you get a HECK of a lot more weapons options in GTA 5 Hunting than in Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn.... I have never really played any hunting games before but came to the conclusion of buying this one. Took me less than 24hrs to completely finish the game...All Weapons... All Upgrades, except for the Decoy Upgrades because they seem to be bugged, Decoy/Retrieve is the same key so I must sacrifice one for the other, if I have Decoy than I cannot retrieve, if I want to retrieve then I cannot have Decoy...LIMITATIONS:3 maps.3 Weapons. 2 Predators.The thrill is fun when you spot a Carnivore and stalk it even more when it notices you and you need to go into emergency mode or get killed. All in all a simple and very fun game for the first day or 2 but because of lack of content it becomes stale swiftly. Seriously Lacks depth though.			"

												100% spot on game. The originals I played as a kid are played homage to and elements are improved. The atmosphere is scary, particularly when you hunt your first carnivore, and everything fits into place. You really do feel as if you're in the hunters shoes while stalking your prey.However, it must be said that the lack of content is truly astounding. Hopefully the devs don't leave us hanging with the pitiful amount of dinos the game offers to hunt. In all honestly I finished the game in under 2 days, with truthfully minimal playtime. In those two days I was able to go from basic rifle hunting Stegos, to sniper rifle hunting T-Rex. My perks/supplies were limited, but with an additional 6 hours of farming T-Rex, I had the ability to upgrade everything and use every perk on every map hunting every dino. I must give this game a 7/10. The game is truly immersive and fun, with definite props going towards the honoring of the original games. However the lack of content is largely a disappointment.			"

I say, if you add more graphic options, and multiplayer (who doesn't want to hunt dinosaurs with friends???) then you'll have a great profit margin. Hopefully I spelled everything close to correct and i used propper-ish grammar, and good day. All in all, It's a fantastic game, if only you could lower the fanciness of the graphics.			"

												There's no reason for there to be this much unfulfilling grinding in a singleplayer hunting game. They have few unlocks and only a handful of species of dinosaurs to hunt, so they stretch them out and make the progression system slow and boring in order to make it seem like the game has more content than it does. But in the end the game is only wasting your time.You'll experience just about everything this game has to offer in the first 30 minutes. There are only 1 or 2 unlocks worth having, and all of the unlockable dinosaurs are just more of the same.This game might be worth picking up if you catch it on sale, but at full price it just doesn't have enough content to be worth it.

												I'm going to start of this review by saying that this is in no wise a bad game, but this review will contain both positive and negative points to this game.On the positive side, this game really draws upon the feeling of the original Carnivores series. Nothing quite like stalking dinosaurs through the various settings trying to put down a T-rex at 400 meters. The guns are different and actually add tactical choices for the different terrain and dinosaurs. And there are plenty of upgrades for weapons, tracking, and personal use.The downside. There really are two few dinosaurs to hunt, and the different locations get cycled with fog and dusk. It would have been nice for some night hunts as well, and a few more locations wouldn't hurt. Also it would be nice to hunt some raptors... or spinosaurus... or any number of additional predatory dinosaurs. But that's really the only thing I'd have to say against the game.			"

Could be my setup? :)Guns 10/10 Like all does not need a machine gun lol :) like in original this aint COD! get me!!!Options 9/10 Lots to upgrade and choose your setup before your huntMusic 10/10 When dino is near it changes, cool love that addition to the hunt :) Replay 10/10 Yes love it :) I still have all the other Carnivores games :)Cost 10/10 £10.99 worth it :)My score -Yes like others wish for more updates :( so options score 9Just wish i could hunt T-rex in thunder & lightning storm lots of rain in the forest.Wish Carnivores Reborn had game intro like in store page, the music it plays is ace.

												WARNING: This game is absurdly addicting. I grew up on the old school arcade shooters that tried to give the ""big game hunt"" feel, but ultimately failed due to horrible mechanics and lack of variety. We had this game originally for Windows 98, and the remastered version is fantastic. Great mechanics, fun customizations, and pretty intense moments make for an exciting game with a classic feel to it. The achievements for this game are a lot of fun and pretty tough to get at times.

												Hopped right in expecting some good nostalgia, got poop instead. No graphics options. 30 fps while looking at the forest, 100+ fps when looking at some water, also the mouse sensitivity changes dramatically during these fps fluxuations. Game looks and feels like very little time went into this.			"

												Not much time in game yet BUT my first impressions are that it's an awesome game. The tutorial was informative enough to get started and have an idea of what to do, but it didn't feel over bearing either. One thing I had to do was turn up the brightness when I got in game, but that's a total nonissue. Game play is smooth, and as expected slow. But the slowness is what makes the hunts satisfying in my opinion after finally getting a kill, even more after getting it in one shot. Things such as wind direction, sound, movement speed all play a roll in how the hunt goes, so this game defiantly favors the patient player. There's no resupply points in game, or at least any that I've come across, so you have a limited number of rounds. If I remember right it's 15 until you purchase one of the perks. I think that this was a good idea on the park of the devs as this forces players to make each shot count if they plan on having a long hunt. In addition to the hunting mode, the game offers an observation mode that allows players to watch how their targets behave. I personally haven't used this feature yet, but I do plan to. You start out with a bolt action rifle with no scope, and at first I thought that would be a sever limitation; I'm happy to say I was wrong. The starting weapon feels balanced enough to get started, although I feel that 500 gems to unlock the sniper rifle feels a little much at this point in the game, but I may change my mind on that. The game also offers a firing range to try out weapons, and targets will show the locations of vitals. I found this to be a very good idea, as this at least lets you get a working idea of where to aim on your target when you get into the field. The AI is satisfying at this point, although the dinosaurs that I've hunted SO FAR have sounded like bears. Dinosaurs that I've encounter so far have acted pretty much how I would expect that species to act. One thing I did notice was that one of the little ambient dinosaurs would appear to almost clip when taking a turn while running around, but this didn't break immersion for me. The coolest thing, I think, is when the ship comes to pick up kills. The ship picks you up in the same way when you decide that it's time to leave the arena, an idea that I thought was awesome. There seems to be a decent selection of dinosaurs to hunt at this time, but from what I've read there are plans to add two more to the game. Overall the game is very good, probably a few things that could be polished a little bit more, but nothing that makes the game unplayable or anything that is super distracting. With a $15 price tag it's worth picking up.			"

												Not a bad dinosaur hunting game considering the price. The islands are a nice size, not too big but big enough to hide your prey so hunting requires patience and alertness. Limited ammo is a pain but this just makes you try and shoot better.  A nice range of dinosaurs to hunt (or be hunted by) and good looking environments.I recommend this for anyone who doesn't get upset by harming dinosaurs and likes the Jurassic park films.			"

												Great job at honoring the original game, Graphics are nice and the weapons work well. any fan of the original Carnivores should pick this one up.Only negative things for me was the death animations, I miss the quick and violent deaths that could come out of no where in the original games, the deaths in this game lose all of the fear factor. I also would have liked the environment to be a more authentic mesozoic ecosystem, though its better than almost any other dinosaur game so its hardly worth mentioning. I also would like to have seen some interactions between the Dinosaurs. thus far I have not seen a predator hunting anything but me, and it would be neat to see the animals behave in more social ways.All in all though its a great Dinosaur game for a great price.

												While primarily for fans of the original Carnivores, there is plenty here to give a few hours of fun to anyone. There is a gradual climb up the various forms of points allowing you to configure yourself prior to a hunt as well as unlocking new levels and targets to bring down.However this game is mostly a remake and suffers for it. While Dinosaur AI is improved, it's still nothing particularly interesting. Herbivores don't gather for protection nor do they listen to the cries of their fellow Dinosaurs. The maps used to feel huge and while they're not small by any means you'll eventually be making a circle or two and it feels more like the game spawns enemies near you as opposed to having missed a dinosaur.Still, fun.

												 An excellent hunting game on its own. Really captures the atmosphere of the original Carnivores series if you've played them before. There are a few issues, such as the small roster of dinosaurs and the ai occasionally getting stuck on the environment, but it really is impressive for a kickstarter game that didn't even reach its goal. I genuinely wish the best of luck for this game on Steam and hope to see future DLC for it.			"

												I loved the game on IOS and I love it even more on steam except for a few things. 1. There is no slider for quality, shadows, details, GRASS Seemed to be a big issue for me. 2. Not as many guns and dinosaurs as the IOS Version. 4. I hit dinosaurs in the head and it feels like it doesn't do extra damage. 5. There is no more survival mode. 6. Still no multiplayer. That is all and here a few suggestions on what to add. More guns. More Dinos. More maps. Multiplayer with easy ""create game"" and then just shift+tab and right click on friend and click ""join game"". Sliders for Details especially grass as I feel it is not needed as much as shadows and other details. Over all I love it and will still be playing more of it and please don't ignore us we need you to listen so we know you are working on the game and fixing issues. Also I know it came out 1 day ago (As I post this) But as of now since there are not many guns and dinos. 8/10. P.S I have an AlienWare 17 R2 so you know I have not got a bad PC.			"

												Waited a long time for this game. Throughout my childhood I indulged myself in the unique experience of being able to go hunting for extinct lizards on a distant planet thanks to the original games. Felt like I was role playing Terra Nova or Jurassic Park. This game is strikingly similar to its original counterpart by allowing the same starting menu that allows for certain perks to be equipped prior to each hunt and allowing for as many ""Kills"" as you have ammo to store. If you are less for killing something that exists purely within imagination, than you can enjoy this games beautifully preserved observer mode and you could play assumingly like David Attenbrough would. Carnivores maintains the original gameplay with improved graphics and mechanics and provokes a sense of nostalgia that was otherwise forgotten.10/10			"

												This is straight forward dinosaur hunting.  There is no survival aspect or any of that stuff.  They just drop you off on an island and you hunt dinsosaurs, which you display in your space age trophy room.I wanted a dinosaur title, I've loved dinosaurs since I was a kid in grammar school back during the Cuban Missile Crisis, but I didn't want a lot of complications.  I just wanted to hunt them.  This is just the ticket.The graphics are beautiful, and the game runs just fine with all the eye candy maxed out on my AMD 1090T 3.2 GHz 6-core, ATI Radeon R9 280X-DC2 TOP, 16 GB DDR3 RAM machine.You may find warnings about AMD/ATI systems on this title, but you don't have to worry.  Simply set all your graphics options in game, including AA and AF, and then add the game to your Catalyst Control Center and set everything to ""Use Application Settings"".  You won't have any problems.If you're looking for just straight forward, uncomplcated dinosaur hunting with beautiful graphics, this will do it.Highly Recommended.			"

												100% spot on game. The originals I played as a kid are played homage to and elements are improved. The atmosphere is scary, particularly when you hunt your first carnivore, and everything fits into place. You really do feel as if you're in the hunters shoes while stalking your prey.However, it must be said that the lack of content is truly astounding. Hopefully the devs don't leave us hanging with the pitiful amount of dinos the game offers to hunt. In all honestly I finished the game in under 2 days, with truthfully minimal playtime. In those two days I was able to go from basic rifle hunting Stegos, to sniper rifle hunting T-Rex. My perks/supplies were limited, but with an additional 6 hours of farming T-Rex, I had the ability to upgrade everything and use every perk on every map hunting every dino. I must give this game a 7/10. The game is truly immersive and fun, with definite props going towards the honoring of the original games. However the lack of content is largely a disappointment.			"

												WARNING: This game is absurdly addicting. I grew up on the old school arcade shooters that tried to give the ""big game hunt"" feel, but ultimately failed due to horrible mechanics and lack of variety. We had this game originally for Windows 98, and the remastered version is fantastic. Great mechanics, fun customizations, and pretty intense moments make for an exciting game with a classic feel to it. The achievements for this game are a lot of fun and pretty tough to get at times.

												Oh! what a  shame Carivores Reborn the devs could not complete fully what they wanted to do with this game, they had lots of plans but funding the project did fail so i gather :( What???? the game is done but they wanted to do more.This game is awsome and yes few Dino`s did not make it to the game, I too did check the install foulder and yes other dino`s listed only 6 dino`s to hunt but do not be put off by this, they did plan 9-12 dinos in the game but funding ran out.As it is true to the feel of the Carnivores and Carnivores 2 original games, but wow! with fantastic gfx and new look blew me away looks beautiful and i want more :) so i keep playing 43 hrs so far and love it.If you like dino`s you need this game in your library.My score +Gfx 10/10 Stunning all set to max :)Sfx 9.9/10 Would give 10 but last map sound of wind stops and starts, it cuts out. Could be my setup? :)Guns 10/10 Like all does not need a machine gun lol :) like in original this aint COD! get me!!!Options 9/10 Lots to upgrade and choose your setup before your huntMusic 10/10 When dino is near it changes, cool love that addition to the hunt :) Replay 10/10 Yes love it :) I still have all the other Carnivores games :)Cost 10/10 £10.99 worth it :)My score -Yes like others wish for more updates :( so options score 9Just wish i could hunt T-rex in thunder & lightning storm lots of rain in the forest.Wish Carnivores Reborn had game intro like in store page, the music it plays is ace.

What this game is :A time fillerA fun little game for dino fansNot great to look atNot optimised for PCNot very realisticNowhere near a hunting simulationWithin 10 hours you'll have seen and done everything this game has to offer and you'll likely not bother returning to it after that. There's not enough weapons to keep you interested, there's not enough dinosaurs, there's not enough variety in gameplay between levels. Find a rock, get yourself as high as possible and pick off the dino's. That's it really, you don't notice any difference when upgrading your characters loadout. Once you get that sniper rifle you'll breeze through the rest of the game. BUT IT WAS FUN WHILE IT LASTED.			"

												I'm not gonna make this too long, so lets get to it!I played the original Carnivores games to death, loved them, loved the challenge, and above all .. dinos! This is pretty much the same formula. You start off easy, with a rifle and a map to be dropped in. Over time, you hunt dinos, earning gems and score points to advance, get better gear, collect more dinos as trophies etc.My biggest gripe with the game is, and keep in mind I'm comparing to the original game, that it's a bit too easy. After only over 7hrs of playtime, I have enough gems and score to play the last map, with hunting license for all dinos, using the sniper rifle fully upgraded, with all equipment .. if I'd want so. To retain some challenge I don't use anything that wouldn't be possible in real life. As example the radar that shows you dino position. But it still gets a bit easy. But with that said, lets do a quick pro/con:Pros:+ Decent graphics+ Runs well+ Nostalgic trip for players of originals+ Dinos+ Plenty of upgrades/equipment to get+ Fun gameplayCons:- A little too easy compared to originals- Could use more dinos, 6 huntable species so far. Missing the Raptors and Allosaurus from the original (Possibly coming in a future update/DLC according to devs)- Few weapons (also, possible addition via future update/DLC)But all in all, I'm having a blast, and despite having unlocked everything in a pretty short period of time, I still see myself playing this one quite a bit more, dropping in and out for a few good hunts, trying to inch my way further up the leaderboards, collecting trophies.At $15 (at the time of this review), it's a really fun game for a bargain :)			"

												I recommend this game if you really just want to shoot some dinosaurs; it's totally not worth $15 though.This game is fun but its more like a mini-game than a full-title. There are only 4 weapons (pistol, rifle, crossbow, sniper rifle), 5 small maps, and 6 dinosaurs.PROTIP: to one-shot a T-Rex, you need a sniper rifle, be within 150 yrds (unless you have the effective-range/damage upgrades, then its ~300 yrds) and you have to shoot it in the mouth (NOT the lungs/heart). If it has its mouth open, shoot near the throat/tongue. If its mouth is closed, you have to shoot it from the SIDE, not the front, near its teeth.			"

												The firts installment ""Carnivores: Dino Hunter HD for ios"" was amazing, me and my brother loved the game. so when we found out this game was coming out, we were totally hyped! We could hardly wait. We bought it when it came out, didnt read any comments over the game, just so it wouldnt ruin the true experience. So, $15 goes toward the developers, while I was in the loading screen. I loaded a game, so far, the game looked amazing. Thats when the game loaded up, and my words i just spoke, fell to the ground like a rock. 20-30 fps on a fricken GTX 970. This game has very poor optimisation, also very little to adjust the video settings, like one little slider named ""High Quality Grass""... (*&% me. Its not even in early access!No content whatsoever, i can find more enjoyment watching a Michael Bay movie.  DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!			"

												I really enjoyed this game- it was a favorite way back when, and is a favorite now... but it's lacking in many ways. You can play through it in a relatively short time, winning all the achievements and getting a fairly nice trophy room too. This could be improved SO easily, if they offered a few DLC packs with new game (a few more big dinos and a few small ones) as well as a TON more achievements, which would be SO easy to add... that would give more goals even with the current setup! ....also, a new map or two might be nice, as after a while you get used to the few they have. Some of those options are the same map with different weather/light conditions (like dusk or dawn) so it's too few maps in my opinion. Really, this game desperately needs more content. Someone give it more content!			"

												Dolled up nostalgia. Anyone who played any of the Carnivores Dinosaur Hunter games will enjoy this chance to head back into the jungle with an X-bow in hand.This takes everyone right back to that and with some massive improvements, the most obvious one being the graphics but including some really improved gameplay elements.For those who remember Carnivores fondly and are wondering what all has changed (+ for positive, - for negative, = for neither good nor bad, all of these IMO)++++++The graphics. It's very pretty now.+They hybridized the vitals mechanic from carnivores 1 with the health mechanic of 2. Now the dinosaurs have health, which you can only effectively damage by hitting their heart or lungs. You usually have to guess at them, but you can pick up a tool that highlights them whenever you zoom in.+You now confirm all kills by getting up close to them with your GPS. While it seems like it would be annoying, it actually feels rewarding and adds a hint of challenge - if there's a ceratosaur next to your trophy and you're out of ammo, you'll be challenged to sneak over to it or evac without those points. You also get more points if you use fewer shots to take down yoru quarry.+The evac and trophy retrieval has been revamped. To collect a trophy, you take out your map tool and click while next to a downed animal. A ship will come to pick up and take 20 seconds or so. When you want to leave, you have to call on that same ship - it takes 10 seconds to arrive and then you have 30 seconds to get into a vacuum beam - and you can't start the call while the ship is busy picking up a dinosaur. In the earlier carnivores games, all trophies were automatically collected for you and to leave, you requested the ship and waited 10 seconds before magically being 'teleported' out (possibly magically avoiding a mid-pounce velociraptor). Now there's an added element of strategy - is that trophy worth risking the time to collect? Can you get to the escape updraft in time to escape the charging dino? Is the ship in a place you can safely get to or do you need to sneak off to call it elsewhere?-Tranqs now have no real difference between lethal ammo. In previous games, you traded your right to keep trophies for higher score values so you could move on to better dinosaurs and better guns. Now, the only thing tranquilizers seem to change is the position the dinosaur falls to. There's no change in reward and you still get to collect dinos that you down and keep them as trophies. It doesn't even affect the health mechanic - while gameplay-wise I think this is fine, it does make you kind of wonder why you need to hit the heart or lungs when the dart should only go a few inches under the skin at most....-The dinosaur count is way down: now there's only Stegosaur, Ankylosaur, Parasaurolophus, Ceratosaur, Triceratops, and T-Rex. That's sadly only two carnivores in a game *called* carnivores. However, Parasaurolophus is the only one that isn't at least a little bit dangerous now, so that does add back to the challenge a little. I'm hoping they'll make updates or allow the steam workshop to add in their own goodies soon.-There are now only three main guns you can choose from, and you can only have one at a time, plus the pistol. The classic favorite X-bow is still there, at least, but it does leave wanting for more. Again, hopefully they'll add more or let the steam workshop add some.For all its fun, you can still do everything this game has to offer in about 20 hours, but after that it's still fun and a good, quick rush like solitaire. Still, with the price and the nostalgia, if you've played any of the previous Carnivores games and have fond memories, it is very much worth picking up. "

												This game has a huge dose of nostalgia for me. As a kid, I remember playing the original PC version of this game which was just called ""Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter"" and it was released back when Windows 98 was still a thing. But I have a huge amount of respect for this game, and I'm glad that it was chosen for a remake. :)			"

												This (the reboot) is fairly new. what I have played i enjoyed, aside from the way-too-advanced graphics that have no way of being toned down unless you make your resolition to the point you cant see 2 feet in front of you. I say, if you add more graphic options, and multiplayer (who doesn't want to hunt dinosaurs with friends???) then you'll have a great profit margin. Hopefully I spelled everything close to correct and i used propper-ish grammar, and good day. All in all, It's a fantastic game, if only you could lower the fanciness of the graphics.			"

												I'm not going to say it was a waste of my money... but I wasted my freakin' money. There are games SOOO much better than this out there. I played the old Carnivores games from good ol' '98 and they were fun! Man have things changed since then... Holy ♥♥♥♥. The movements of the dinosaurs are terrible, the weapons are terribly balanced in damage, and there is no challenge at all once you figure out their flee patterns. The AI is just so stupid that it can't figure out to run AWAY from me when I'm shooting at it. Instead I'm going to zig zag for a second... run at you... then run away from you. Then run circles around this tree over here... You seriously have to be terrible at shooting in games to miss these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.			"

												I'm going to start of this review by saying that this is in no wise a bad game, but this review will contain both positive and negative points to this game.On the positive side, this game really draws upon the feeling of the original Carnivores series. Nothing quite like stalking dinosaurs through the various settings trying to put down a T-rex at 400 meters. The guns are different and actually add tactical choices for the different terrain and dinosaurs. And there are plenty of upgrades for weapons, tracking, and personal use.The downside. There really are two few dinosaurs to hunt, and the different locations get cycled with fog and dusk. It would have been nice for some night hunts as well, and a few more locations wouldn't hurt. Also it would be nice to hunt some raptors... or spinosaurus... or any number of additional predatory dinosaurs. But that's really the only thing I'd have to say against the game.			"

												There's no reason for there to be this much unfulfilling grinding in a singleplayer hunting game. They have few unlocks and only a handful of species of dinosaurs to hunt, so they stretch them out and make the progression system slow and boring in order to make it seem like the game has more content than it does. But in the end the game is only wasting your time.You'll experience just about everything this game has to offer in the first 30 minutes. There are only 1 or 2 unlocks worth having, and all of the unlockable dinosaurs are just more of the same.This game might be worth picking up if you catch it on sale, but at full price it just doesn't have enough content to be worth it.

												Realistic Open Areas Ceratosaurs Eating Your Face?. What More Could You Want?. The Amount Of Work Put Into This Game Is Breathtaking For Me, At Least. It Gives The Player A Gun, A Gadget And Whatever Else He/she Chooses, Then Your Left To Hunt. I Think A Great Step For Carnivores is Adding Online Multiplayer So There Would Be Endless Dinosaurs To Hunt And You Can Compete For Who Can Take Down The Most Dinosaurs, Just A Suggestion So Don't Rush Anything Or Something Like That, Release It When Its Done Or When You Want To. Overall I Haven't Played The Game Much But Its Great,, Lags A bit But I have A Regular Laptop Sooooo..... Yeah8/10Keep Up The Great Work			"

												Really kinda lame. You can only bring one Primary weapon and a secondary weapon. In other carnivores games, you can bring up to 7. Graphics are okayish but dinosaur movement is just pathetic. It's almost as if the game is lagging when the dinosaurs move, but it's not. Also, dinosaurs often become frozen when shot/startled and don't move well. Sometimes, when they turn around, they literally stay fixed in one spot, while they rotate, without moving a single muscle, and then begin moving again. Overall disapointed with this game compared to the other great carnivores games I've played. 3/5 stars.			"

												Amazing game based off the old Carnivores games. Back when I got my first Win 98 PC I got Carnivores: Ice Age at a garage sale and played the hell out of it and later played the rest of the series. If you played the series you'll probably like this game. Pros:- Visuals are amazing and the simulation really feels realistic.- The M.I.S.T. tracking hud was done perfect and has a great amount of options.- Dino's look really good and their animations/sounds are perfect even down to the Dino dying the Dino will stagger.- Lots of upgrades and a good amount of different places to visit.- Aiming feels solid and how much damage or hit area a Dino can take feels realistic too.- FPS is always really good for my gaming laptop.Cons:- Most Dino's are passive and will just run away when shot like a deer. To me this is more realistic, but some people wanting exact gameplay like the original Carnivores series might be disappointed.- No nightvision. This is something that was a let down for me coming back from the old games. This is something that would have been easy to add to the game at later maps against aggressive Dino's for more excitement. - Dino's will run into terrain every once in a while and get stuck on trees. This isn't something that happens a lot, but when it does it ruins the immersion.- There is one error I get every once in a while that crashes the game. Its happened 2 times to me, but only happens right when starting a new hunt so no progress is lost so its not a big deal to me. - Only 3 primary weapons in the game. While the amount of customization is good there's only 3 primary weapons you can get which is kind of disappointing. The gun you start out with will most likely become your favorite since it seems to be the best balanced. 9/10Btw something to be weary of is that this game seems to always auto start in low process for me and I have to switch it higher. Another thing is make sure its using your best graphics card if you have a hybrid graphics card.			"

Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn Is the latest release in the Carnivores Franchise, essentially an update of Carnivores HD. And it's an okay game for a reboot of the franchise.I am very neutral to the game, as I find it to be a lot of fun, but not without feeling that this game squandered most of its potential. This is where my neutrality plays its part, as I have a balanced like and dislike toward this.Pro's and Con'sTo get down to it, the game is set on the series titular planet, UMM-UV32, evidenced by returning locations which only share their names with their original counterparts. Maps: The maps are very lackluster and lack anything of interest, save pretty scenery in the Great Forest map, and the Basmachee Rocks map (my favorite in the game.) If you were expecting a wide variety of locations complete with their own unique fauna, Dino's and Ambiance, then you'll have better luck with a mod for Carnivores 2.Maps are rehashed multiple times, with there being dusk and fog variant maps. In total there are three maps, but they have variations, boring and thoughtless variations with a few new dinos and a surprise one you wouldn't know was in it until you actually went looking. I would have loved a night-time map, or maybe something other than the same locations over and over again. An aviary or an old DinoHunt Corp facility would have been nice.Dinosaurs: Essentially the butter to the games bread, the Dinosaurs in this game are anatomically correct, unlike Carn 1 and 2 (they were more artistic,) beautiful to look at, and they sound wonderful, except the Ankylosaurus, I didn't much like their roar.They move wonderfully, shifting their weight and behaving with majestic splendour, and they sound lovely too.That's about all the good I can say about them though. We get a roster of six Dino's, guess how many are carnivores... TWO!!! The T.Rex and the Ceratosaurus are terrifying in this game, but only when you don't expect them, and encounters with them can be especially damning in the foggy map variants, but these are the only carnivores in the whole game, and it's really a shame they couldn't add Velociraptor, Spinosaurus, Coelophysis or many of the classics.In my time playing this game over the past four days, I have taken time to admire the Dinosaurs, as well as occasionally revile them for some cheap deaths and loss of progress they can cause to the unwary. Their pathfinding could have used some work, especially since the Dino's needed more life. They sleep, they eat, they drink, the predators look for you, which can be scary, but that's all really, but they never really feel mindless.I am disapointed at the lack of variety, they try to spruce things up with mutant Dino's but it's honestly very disappointing to encounter them, save the Rex though, fear the Rex.Weapons: No complaints here, this is an actual Pro. They take a bit of time to get used to, there's no crosshair, so you have to rely on the reticle on the barrel, or rely on a scope, they don't hold your hand. This game isn't a shooter so don't expect to go in guns ablazing. There are lots of returning weapons, the X-bow, the Magnum and the Sniper Rifle are some (there's only four weapons.) M.I.S.T: Essentially your lifeline, it's a device that you can use to keep track of Dinosaurs, call them, use as a telescope, call in evac, and claim trophy's, useful, and it makes playing a little more challanging as you can't have it up at the same time as holding gun.Unlockables: These require gems, you get gems for knocking down Dino's and confirming the kill, these can be used to purchase hunting gear, player and M.I.S.T upgrades, as well as two of the three main weapons.Final Thoughts Calling this a neutral review is a stretch but my complaints are sound, and relatable to anyone who has played the game and thought the way I do. This game is fun, I have a lot of fun with this game, but it's missing a lot of things to make it fantastic.It lacks a proper selection of Dinosaurs (six isn't much) and it gets boring with the options available after a few hunts. I feel that there was more planned, but the budget just wasn't in it. Maps feel lifeless, atleast in the older games there were ambient Dinosaurs, this game has none of that which takes a lot out of the game. I would'v elove to listen to Brachs singing in the distance, or something other than utter silence. And I'm not saying there should be music either.Some of the things I would have done if I was lwad devloper, would add ambient sounds, more map selections, more weapons, and deffinitly more Dinosaurs. I'd've also added something memorable to each of the maps, something to make exploring worth while. Seems that wasn't on the table.To conclude, this game, for me personally, is a lot of fun, I enjoy this game very much, despite every issue I have with it. This game lacks updates, DLC and mod support. This game could benefit from a modding community and it's a shame that's not currently possible. I reccomend this game, it's fun for a while, but with Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter (or Carnivores 2, same game with more content) on the horizon, Reborn will be left obsolete in favor of one of its predecessors. I just recently bought the original Carnivores 2 from 1999 so I'll be having fun with that till the new Steam release.Okay game, I think it's fun, has a lot of issues and lacking in noteworthy content. I reccomend it if you're interested in Carnivores, this game is a good place to start, but ultimately, the originals are better. But I'll have a soft spot for this one for getting me hooked on the series.			"
