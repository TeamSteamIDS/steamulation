Early Access Review
								I'm writing this review because I don't want people to waste their $24.99 like I did. I can't recommend this game in its current form. It has the *potential* to be something interesting, but you can get the full current gameplay experience by watching the 8:32 video in the description. THERE'S NOTHING ELSE TO DO YET.TL;DR it's currently a tech demo for the ""convert smooth terrain to blocks"" idea. Which is, admittedly, a pretty neat idea. But that's not a game. Keep an eye on Cubic for when actual game-like features appear...Other thoughts:* the walk speed is SLOOOOOOOOOW. We're talking ""20 seconds to walk across your 'lair'"" slow. Holding down Shift to run makes the speed tolerable, but then you get a continuous loop of heavy breathing after about 10 seconds.* the fabricator GUI *desperately* needs better camera controls. This becomes obvious in the tutorial, when you have to stick a button on the back of the door you've just created. Good luck panning, rotating & zooming until you finally get UNDER the object.* thin circular bands of light in the lair: can you say ALIASING, kids? Unless ""dancing jaggies"" is actually the decor, this is gross - and totally voluntary. I can understand that the engine is still being tweaked, but what about just not *doing* things that look terrible?* meaningless placeholder content is annoying. As far as I can tell, the different ""elements"" in the fabricator don't DO anything different. Most of them don't even have block icons. And then there's the black-text-on-dark-grey UX.* speaking of meaningless, let's talk about the ""embarcation level"". It may do something someday, but all it does now is add clicks + animation cycles to getting into and out of the lair. Oh, and sometimes you get stuck UNDER the elevator and get to reset the game...			"

								Cubic is a voxel sandbox game. From the trailer, it seems very much like Minecraft and, to some extent, it is. That's mostly at the moment because Cubic is very early alpha (0.0.2.9 in this review) and contains breaking, placing, jumping, crafting and storage. From what Cubic promises though, it has the potential to be much more than any voxel sandbox game.In particular, there is a ""building fabricator"" which I originally thought was a remake of Minecraft's crafting recipes. In reality, the building fabricator promises to be a powerful crafting set-up to create a variety of interactive objects. At the moment, Cubic offers a button and a hinge which you can use to create your own doors in any shape or size. In the future (and I cannot express enough ""in the future""), Cubic promises to add a variety of materials (which I assume will have different properties) and different components (like potentially levers, wheels or pistons). Don't get me wrong though - in 0.0.2.9, none of these have been added just yet.The game is also clearly going to be more adventure-based. In the tutorial, you are assisted by a flying companion named Corban which gives you the tutorial via story-based lessons. Later, there's a story quest involving Corban. For starters, I liked the voice-acting of Corban but he could've talked less. Cubic looks to be planning more quests which opens opportunities for other NPCs, monsters, weapons, vehicles, worlds, modding opportunities, trading or side quests! Again though, Cubic has none of these just yet.In brief though, the sandbox, features, quests, block types and others are very limited due to the early alpha build + there are a lot of bugs. Would I recommend it currently for $25 USD? No. Could it be worth it in the future? Yes, and it's worth following its development.			"

								This is a great game with great potential! Its something that most voxel games dont have... a purpose. there is a story behind this game, which makes it fun because it still is an open sandbox. The crafting is a lot more intricate than other games and thats also adds a lot of character to the gameplay.I definitley encourage people to check it out, but keep in mind its still early access and has its share of bugs when signing up for this, but like I said earlier, definitely a lot of potential!

								A decent showcase of what you're going to try to do. It's not a game, it's a test, though, keep that in mind.PROS===1. An EXTREMELY promising idea.2. A suprisingly good execution (I thought the whole cube HUB thing was cool).3.  Terrain generation was overall good. Needs tweaks, however.CONS===1. Buggy in it's current state. The tutorial felt broken from the start, and I feel like I skipped important parts.2. Player animations NEED WORK, BADLY.3. Though he's a creative touch and really nice to have around, the AI in the beginning can get annoying kinda quickly with his constant rambling.4. I feel as if the lore of this game is a bit confusing.EDIT: Huh, they actually REMOVED the HUD, and I'm not crazy.			"

								Right off the bat, excited to see such a nice intro on an early access, alpha state game. Nicely done. Secondly, I admire the innovation on the player menu (tab). As far as similarity to minecraft; You can steal blocks from anything (4), trees are much easier to take down, you start with a gun (5), and the crafting system seems much more complex and customizable. The graphics are by far superior and I'm impressed by their ability to translate that into modular crafting.This game is indeed in alpha state, there are many glitches and I actually found them rather excited. I play many styles of games and frankly find little to be surprising these days. However, I was very surprised and even thrilled when I glitched into the bottom of a lake, climbed my way out by removing blocks, and discovered the interesting way in which they simulate being under water. I probably would have never jumped into the lake right off the bat, had that not happened.All in all, I'm excited to see where this games goes and how the developers evolve their wonderful ideas. I plan to play more at my soonest convience.			"

								This game is really early and need alot of hours/days maybe years until truly be able to enjoy fully. Right now it lags and closes off and when you do something wrong in the tutorial you need to restart the game and so on. I just started the game but happening so much so im not finish even with the first steps. This is early ""minecraft"" and all you know what it became out of that little game. A big great game that has mods and everything you can think about in it. I belive with some love to this game it can become so great. I get angry on it yes but i love it too. Beacuse it hide something and i want to see it when it appears.Sorry for my awful english..			"

								Things you already know:Cubic is a voxel based game. Voxels are pretty hot right now, nod to Notch, but this has the capacity to become something much much more.Cubic is currently PRE-ALPHA (0.0.2.9), so it's still an infant, but a beautiful one. Still has a few bugs but look at the dev activity on the forums.  (Just saw in the forum that there's an update coming tomorrow!) Basically, right now, there's a PLAYABLE INTRO and sandbox mode. (Fingers crossed for next update!) I'm more of a multiplayer kind of guy myself, and the devs said that is also coming soon!The thing I am most excited about is the fabrication aspect of it. This is going to be fantastic, there's just so much potential. And there's a ton of cool ideas that folks have been mentioning on the forums that have really gotten me excited. Catapults, mech-suits, all types of vehicles, big-ole swords, the possibilities are literally endless. (The devs mentioned that multiple worlds are comingâ€¦ Does that mean that we can make spaceships??) (or a stargate!?!?) ...I just started sweating. I want Cubic to get popular because there really is a ton of cool innovations that I hope are soon realized.Of course, all early access games are somewhat of a risk. Will this ever get off the ground?      From the forums, I've learned that: This has been the devs baby for two years.They have answered EVERY post on the forums.Update coming soon. And they've said they hope to keep cranking them out.Should I buy this game?Ultimately, yes.If you're squeamish of anything in pre-alpha, you COULD wait it out.But for every early adopter, there's a higher likelihood that we'll get everything we want from this game.Either way, you should at the very least follow it.Cubic is so full of POTENTIAL. You might consider being part of it's realization. The Many would be pleased.			"

								At the time of this review this is a fresh game on steam.Keep in mind this is an early access game. This is not AAA polished ready to go game. If you do not like the early access theme, supporting devolopment, contributing to the community. Then this probably isn't for you. If you do like supporting the develpoment and contributing to the community I urge you friend take a look at this game it's going to be a wild ride.""Give me the place to stand, and I shall move the earth.""The building fabricator, I have a feeling many hours will be spent in here. My first project was going to be a walker. You can have hinges, activated by buttons. I figured I'd hinge up 4 legs. Put 4 buttons spread out on a few blocks.( Call that a control panel son ). I had it in such a way it would've walked sideways..Fear the crab people...Little did I know how this story would soon end. So I ran out into a clearing, I remember this all too well. The moon was out big and bright.. Like it had a front row seat to watch what was about to happen. I set the ClayWalker2 that I had carefully crafted on the ground in the bright moonlight. Walked to the back and jumped in the cockpit I had made. Smiled looking onto 4 red buttons my control panel is awesome. Pushing the first button that is all that was needed. I was sent into the air at super high speeeeeeeeed! The devs are active on the forums with community and ready to answer any questions you have.I am also working on a guide covering the basic fabricator functions.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=320847616 "

								Like any other EA game, Metaverse/Cubic is pretty much fraught with bugs, many of them plain gamebreaking, and filled with potential.However, unlike other EA games, the developers have confirmed they've put development on hiatus to pursue another project named 'XLR' that is supposed to allow them to integrate VR functionality.So, despite the posibiliies of the game, I have to give this negative review because it's just not a good risk to purchase/support Metaverse when the Developers aren't even working on it but are instead putting their time, money (from selling Metaverse, mind you), and resources into what is basically very expensive controller support that not all their players can or will utilize.

								This voxel sandbox is a very good game and is worth the $14.99 and with the four pack you can't go wrong. This game has already become better then most sandbox games in my opinion. I look forward to the many feature updates to come but as is, the game is worth the money. People tend to forget that this is a early access game and they expect it to be a finished product ( which it is not). Early Access games are more for the hardcore gamer and developers that like to see the game evolve and the most important part of that is playing the game as is and letting the developers of the game know what you would like to see or about a bug/glitch that is unfound and needs to be addressed to make the game better. If you want a game that is finished then just stick to minecraft untill this is finished but expect to pay more for the finished game, I love early access games and this one is at the top of my list due to the many features that i already see in game that are being developed. For being soo early access as this game is it has very little bugs and FPS is fairly constant. I highly recommend this game for all serious developers and gameres alike.			"

								So you pulled the slot machine on the 'ol Casino Simulator that is Early Access and lost your bet.It is not uncommon for Early Access Games nowdays, with so many finding an easy way to make a quick buck then run off and start a new.The game is a bad rewrite of Steve Miller Band's Take the Money and Run.Save your money and put it to better use, the game is Abandoned and blately lied about being a ""full time project, not an on-the-nights-and-weekends project!""I think it is long past due for all of us to stop buying from any developers/publishers whom practice this sort of development behavior. I personally will not be supporting Metaware Limited, LLC nor ANY projects they attempt to create no matter how ground breaking a game they come up with.And before someone points out my playtime, I am not reviewing gameplay (although it only took a few minutes to realize it was very incomplete). I bought the game on Mar 7, 2015 and like many others I did so to support it in hopes that at some point I would come back to find a finished product that I could enjoy at some point in time.Came back to check up on it and to my surprise it was another promise from a game dev broken.

								I like this game, it's fun how it is right now with the building aspects but I can't wait for what the final result of this game will be. The description for it is very interesting. Anyway, here are my pros and cons to it.Pros------------- - The tutorial was helpful, from what I've seen it covers what's currently in the game. - I liked the fabrication area and though it took me a bit to figure it out controls for navigating around when creating objects I liked the bar at the bottom which had the ""pan, zoom, rotate"" down there until I learned the controls. - I enjoyed the idea of going out to collect things such as dirt, stone, etc.. then de-composing it into different ingredients and such. ------Cons---------------- - The sprint speed was a good normal speed, but the walk speed was so slow. Besides this it would be perfect. - I found a weird glitch with 'climbing' things... for example the giant mountain you find somewhere around the end of the tut that you should go and climb... you can just hit space a whole bunch of times and if you hit it's surface you can keep jumping. Same thing happens if you dig a hole straight down into the ground. - Since there is currently no menu at all I'm not going to say much about it as I'm assuming it's still in development. But, some things I'd like on it is for the tutorial. Currently, the tutorial although perfectly good (as said above), if you miss something he says that you're supposed to do, you lost it, and have to reset the whole thing. I know you can completely exit the game and re-open it, and it will take you to the last checkpoint.. I did this while inside the fabricator machine making the first door because I missed what I was supposed to do.. closed down the game and re-opened, and did it. It didn't keep my backpack in that one area in the lair though, so I couldn't move the door into it.----------------Can't wait to see how this game turns out!			"

								Is it just me or is this game practically unplayable? I know it's alpha but damn...talk about glitchy. Here's a breakdown of my first 30 minutes. The intro repeated itself 3 times before it recognized that it should probably start the game up. Once started...1. Movement is extremely choppy. When I'm walking the screen is shaking violently.2. Only about 80% of the environment renders in view. 3. Pressing action buttons hardly work on the first try. Found myself pressing E to pick stuff up 6-7 times before it would actually perform the correct function. 4. The scavenging portion of the game is functional however the building portion is extremely difficult to use since the movement is so choppy and positioning of objects is buggy.Overall, this game in it's fully functional form is worth the $20, the potential is obviously there. As of now, don't expect to find too much enjoyment because this game needs a lot of work from development.			"

								Seems like it has a good potenetial but there are a few problems.  1:  Tutorial gives a loose explanation of the mechanics and what types of things you could create.  2:  Lots of unnecessary lag.  This game NEVER runs at a good framerate for me, even though my graphics card has a GTX750ti and 2 Gb of VRAM. The game has a fairly short render distance, yet still lags this hard.  Not to mention the only graphics setting which can be adjusted is the game resolution.The main level or your base in Cubic is a very cool idea which I like a lot.  The whole method of refining blocks, creating recipes and fabricating blocks to use is an interesting and satisfying process.There are 2 things this needs to add to be worth playing:1:  Multiplayer.  If I can't play with my friends, I might aswell just play minecraft, as it is more advanced.  I can imagine having a lot of fun on this game with my friends, but playing it solo would be about as rewarding as playing a flash game.2:  The world of Cubic requires some additional depth, litterally and figuratively.  The caves in this game arae more like holes in the ground, which once you get into, you don't discover anything cool or interesting, and immediately turn to the exit again.  Some additional world elements besides normals blocks and tree blocks would be needed to make this interesting.  Advanced functional blocks and possibly machines would make this a very cool game.Please rate this review to let the developers either know that this information is correct, or if im just a nit picker.

								Please don't buy right now, it has not been updated in 8 months and currently is very bare with the meme minimum to even be able to call itself a game and not a demo of a game.			"

								My game has repeatedly crashed on opening or after only a few minutes of gameplay and has caused major issues bug wise. I can't recommend the game until they're able to fix up some large problems.			"

								Just got this game and can't play because they have decided to take the HUD out . Spent a while playing tutorial thinking it would give me HUD but no........ Get this sorted please or you have an unplayable game . I DO NOT RECOMEND this game  at this timeEdit: Thanks Vox , I will wait for HUD then I will comment againHUD is back but it doesn't do anything or show anything  , needs a better tutorial , Game is complete waste of a good idea at the moment come on DEVS give a decent tutorial and a better hud that shows something NOT WORTH THE MONEYEdited on 12/5/15Thought I would try this game again after update and still I can only say DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY . This game is no where near being worth the price basically a building game with lots of blocks made out of diffrent materials and very boring map to build onEdited on 26/08/15Just played with new update . Terrain is looking better in fact everything looks better but that doesn't make up for the fact that there is nothing to do because they have basically gone backwords and you can't do anything in the game apart from walk around build a few blocks and dig . Let's wait for next update .Edited on 03/06/2016 DO NOT BUY THIS GAME A COMPLETE RIPOFF . No updates for months , updates go backwards and make game worse , graphics are garbage , gamplay is garbage a dead game with no future			"

								The game has lots of potential.  Dev's are friendly , eager and working hard to keep the updates comming. They listen to and quicky responded to my feedback. That's something not all dev's do, sadly.I can't expect much, the game has only been in Aplha stage a month or two.  Game is somewhat stable. Little laggy, Sometimes fall through the world. Holes in the ground that show sky.  Block placement needs a little tweeking. Refining can be a little buggy if you attempt to move blocks in que.  Multiplayer isn't functional for me yet (on Mac?). Jumping up from block to block needs a little work. Tutorial is disabled, story line disabled. Not much you can ""currently"" do at this time, except dig, refine, shoot  and build. I can't wait to play it in it's final release.			"

								Okay so I don't purchase many early-access games for the sake of them being horribly broken, or so bad you just wish you could abolish it from your steam library... This is an exception of my rules. Metaverse honestly is a fun idea, it truly is. Being someone that loves exploring quantum mechanics and quantum mathematics this game brings theory to life in a virtual essence. Granted it is still very early in its devlopment cycle but I'm expecting quite amazing things from it!Yes there is bugs, and yes sometimes the gameplay feels clunky... But despite that, this game has potentional!			"

								I can't even play the game...When I open it the ""intro"" runs, then my computer goes to the dekstop.then my friend explained to me ""you have to click restart in sandbox mode to get to the game""so I did that. half way through the loading screen game goes to desktop.WHY IS THERE NO WINDOWEDWHY IS THERE NO HUDWHY ARE THERE NO SETTINGS OTHER THAN RESOLUTIONwhen these things are fixed I may be able to play the game and give it an actual review, my friend seems to run it fine and says it's a great game but until this game is optimized or adds a lower graphics setting I will not be able to play.Edit: I have decided to make the review positive because even though my game does not work, the customer service is some of the best I have ever seen. The staff respond very fast and give helpful advice.			"

								I picked up this game in the 2014 Winter auction. I might be able to recommend it later, but not yet.Yes, it's another not-Minecraft.Cons- I couldn't even finish the tutorial. I tried twice. It hung up somewhere after getting coloring ingredients, and then I had no idea what the tutorial wanted. Sometimes there were quest waypointa and next steps, sometimes not.- There's a miniature CAD program inside. That's cool, because someday that's a huge customization opportunity. But the internal  CAD program completely sucks right now. Come on, this is very early access; just write an importer from Sketchup or Solidworks.- Graphics performance is horrible. I have a mid-range machine, but even so, the frame rate is just a slog.- The rendering algorithm uses a standard rendering-distance-to-object measure, and so giant trees just pop into view. I climbed up on one of the giant bluffs in the tutorial map. It was a nice view, insofar as it went, which was hardly at all. The horizon line was there, but  my direct view ended in a nice spherical intersection with the desert floor. (Hint: convolve the view of distant objects with a Gaussian blur and cache. You don't need to recalculate if the angle doesn't change much, which it doesn't if you're far away.)- Why couldn't I harvest the trees? Point gauntlet, click, nothing. or rather ofter something behind the tree.			"

								They're not updating anymore - the dev team repeatedly has a history of starting games in early access then dropping them - they did this first with metaverse - and again with XLR. do NOT buy!			"
