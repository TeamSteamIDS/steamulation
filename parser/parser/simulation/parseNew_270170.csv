												This is a free text based experience that just has you clicking hyperlinks as you would a webpage. I can't really call it a game since I don't think the point is to entertain you. It was originally a website and this is just the web-kit version of the site put on Steam. I'm not sure it will help anyone with depression, so much as it lets people with depression think, no you are not alone (the player, not the character 'You'). Other people feel the way you do.The basic gameplay in Depression Quest is that you will read through things (You is the player character that you will play) and then make a choice of what to do (click a hyperlink).It sets a story and gives you background information on things. You have everything going for you, a significant other, a circle of friends, a day job. Your girlfriend, Alex is supportive of who you are and understands you. That's more than some people have in real life, but it illustrates you can have everything and yet depression still affects you. At least the characters in the game are supportive of you and not questioning why you have depression or does depression exist or are you just lazy? Its almost like everyone accepts you, but you are the one with a problem that doesn't accept yourself. Its all inward in this experience. You make enough money to support yourself, so money isn't the issue, but money is never a discussion or a reason to the depression, its just all you.Below each life choice, Depression Quest bluntly tells you that you are not in therapy, nor taking medication for depression, you are just dealing with it. The 'happy' or 'logical' choices are always crossed out forcing you to select the sad choices such as, 'watch TV, work on a project (Depression Quest) or crawl into bed.'The big thing that I take away from this is everyone around you (the player character) really cares about you. It also seems like there's no way out. Maybe there would be a way out to happiness with diet, less beer, soaking up some sun so your body can make vitamin D or a life change, but that's never explored, you are just suffering from depression and forced to live that way. Depression Quest brings up minor what ifs, such as going back to school or finding a better job might help... but well there's risk. Those statements are never followed up. You have no choice to change things in your life (the character's).You see the character get worse and worse with no help in sight. Almost as if the entire point of this is to make you the player depressed (which is different than depression). Crossing out logical happy choices for depressing ones. This is a quick experience that finishes after maybe 2 dozen pages of text. I quickly played through it three times and it felt like while there are multiple endings, it didn't feel like I wanted to take the time to see them all. Like reading and carefully selecting my choices leads to more reading to endings that I didn't feel were satisfying. It was too quick of an experience to feel nothing more than a brief diversion. Someone did write me on how to get to the 'good ending' where you are allowed to get help, but with so many choices and endings, I found it difficult to even get the good ending with someone telling me how to achieve it. Again, the happy ending just didn't feel good or satisfying. Maybe that's depression in a nutshell or maybe that's poor writing.To anyone suffering from depression, there is always help. There are always people willing to help and you are never alone. *hug*			"

												As someone who has been diagnosed with clinical depression at the age of 17 (now 22), as well as living with a diagnosed manic depressive older brother and formerly suicidal sister, I felt like this game, Depression Quest, could help me gain stability in parts of my life where I lack.As it turns out, it is nothing short of insulting. Depression Quest takes the impossible  weight and drain of simply feeling /bad/, and reduces it to a rather whiney, irritating and self-absorbed narrative. It /then/ takes the raging emotional battles and incredible fears cloud rational thought and displays them as so many single-line responses. I KNOW WHAT TO DO. I KNOW A SEEING THERAPIST IS THE CORRECT CHOICE. I KNOW LYING BACK IN BED IS THE WRONG CHOICE. It's not about what you should do, it's about how in the heck to conquor all that negativity and emotional drag to get anywhere. It's about how to consciously break those cycles of self-hating thoughts and stop those feelings before they happen. Bear in mind these are only my objections to the depiction of depression as a disorder.Depression Quest as a game? I have literally read popup books that were more interactive, and I use the term correctly. The 1996 classic Wishbone and the Amazing Odyssey was 100 times the game this one could ever hope to be, and it had a neato dog. I tried to think of games that came close to being as frustrating to play, aside from personally offensive, and I counted to None! None games! Ah ah aaaahhh!			"

												Point blank: I think this game fails at what it set out to do. It doesn't make the user understand depression at all. In fact, it's just the story of some overpriviledged guy too stuck in his head. Nothing awful actually happens to the character. The player isn't made to sympathize with him in any way. Instead it just comes off as ""Make the right decision and get moderately better"". Actual depression is nothing like that. It just fails on all levels to capture just how dreary and dreadful the world actually looks when you've got depression. There's no sense of hopelessness or despair. The name itself ""Depression Quest"" is utterly uncreative and unimaginative as well.			"

												I got this game a while ago, as you see I didn't spend very long in it, but it was long enough. I don't know anything about the whole controversy seeing as how I tend to stay away from BS, but this game is bad.I have actual PTSD, from being in the military and from having witnessed murder of my brother at a very young age and I can tell you that Depression is absolutely nothing like this. This game is terrible at depicting depression. If you want to know what actual depression is like, just imagine being in a deep hole and not having the strength and will power to climb out as you're having dirt shoveled onto you and being buried alive. That's the easiest way I can describe it, but even that does no real justice. This game did the very thing that is almost impossible to do, offend me. It offends me, because of how terribly it misrepresents actual suicidal depression. That's coming from a suicide attempt survivor.P.S No one cares about your special snowflake syndrome.			"

												First of all, I hold no grudge against any group, this is merely how I truely think of this program.Depression Quest is a program that focuses on what appears to be chronic depression and more specifically from a female mindset. Keeping in mind that this is dubbed ""an interactive fiction game"" with almost no gameplay, I would like to think of this program as more of a webpage story. The writing in this program is at a level of articulation and description that I would expect from a middle school student. Personally, I was disapointed in the level of writing most of all, with this program being a text-based program.I'd like to make a note for anyone coming here thinking that suicide is a theme here. Chronic depression rarely results in suicide. On the other hand, major depression is typically what actually can result suicide.I find this program cringe-worthy and I am personally embarrassed to have this associated with depression. I would recomend this to anyone who enjoyed Gone Home, anyone without strong emotional intelligence, and anyone with depression looking for a good laugh with friends with depression.			"

												Regardless of my views of the developer, I decided to play and review Depression Quest honestly. And while it tries to be an interesting interactive fiction game, it suffers from several misteps that ultimately made me feeling like DQ was poorly done and pointless to play.The first thing was the music. I understand something upbeat and jazzy may not have been appropriate, but the same three or so bars of minor chord piano music just got annoying far too quickly. I would have liked an option to turn it off.As for the gameplay, it's completely told through text with decisions at the bottom, like Choose Your Own Adventure books. The writer was of average quality. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't exactly Virginia Wolfe either. The choices frustrated me, however, by having you frequently unable to select more positive choices over more negative ones. I get that this was to simulate the 'it will never get better' feelings of depression, but there is a difference between feeling it will never improve and actively being unable to make a positive choice in your life, even ones like seeing a therapist. When I was depressed, they couldn't make me NOT see one.On the bottom of your screen, you have boxes that discuss your condition in regards to depression, if you're in therapy, and whether you take medication or not. It seemed to me, though, that no matter how well the little box said you were doing, the story never reflected that through a brighter outcome (until the ending at least) or by letting you make more positive choices. I understand depression is a struggle, but I never felt any sort of real sense of progression beyond the game occasionally telling me I was with a token pat on the back.I also question whether this game belongs on Steam. I know it used to be a browser game, but it still looks and plays exactly like a browser game. Why does Steam have to be involved? In the end, I would not have played this game if it wasn't free.4/10			"

												I'm not even sure what to say about this thing. It's just boring and is entirely all reading. Depression Quest is a very, very basic wall of text formatted into several linear paths about depression. Literally, wall of text after wall of text without any visuals other than grainy photographs at the top and a really depressing audio (similar to Minecraft's music). The story is written in a way that makes you feel like you're living a dead-end life without any motivation to go on. A bad event comes after bad event. Think of the game like a text-based version of The Walking Dead.Don't even bother trying this ""game."" If you really wanted to read up on depression, you can do so online with an easy Bing search. They even have a controls page. Don't know why anyone would ever use that, but they do. Obligatory Score: Steam asks ""Do you recommend this game?"" Is this a game? Can I review it? Is this real life? N/A. According to Zoe Quinn, it's ""award winning.""			"

												Depression Trigger Quest.I've never had any intention of giving something on steam a negative review and I've played some terrible games, but don't take this as a negative review, take it as a warning.If you suffer from or have ever suffered from depression STAY AWAY from this. Go load up a game in your library that you get enjoyment out of, and just like anyone who tells you to ""man up"" or ""get over it"" DELETE them from your life or in this case library, and get help! Depression is not your fault!http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/Pages/mental-health-helplines.aspxA quick look on a search engine will find you help in your country too.<3			"

												I know this is free and all, but does that mean crashing it twice in the time I have played this make it even worth reading all of this text? It is a text adveture for crying out loud. Also, music, way too loud.On a side note to the depression at hand. I see how a person can get this depressed. I don't, I am depressed often, but that comes and goes. I don't see a shrink, I don't take meds. I don't normally think about kiling myself. You just have to find your inner child, that for me is in gaming.The case of this non-fictional character is an extreme case. And in case of extreme, go get help. I would.EDIT: Since review only shows played in hours: I have played this game for 23 minutes, or 2 times game crashing on me.			"

												i realy cant think of anything to say about this game, or short novel, but this ""IF U ARE DEPRESSED DONT PLAY THIS"" it is what it is a quest to survive depression more like overcome it but the thing is that its realy one sided i mean if its meant to be relatable for people with depression but it takes it a little to far cause all one needs is the will to do things and blocking some of the options on decision making is stupid simply because, well let me put it this way ur trying to help someone overcome depression right or at least help in understanding hence u cant just deny someone an option just because he/she is depressive i mean it only took me less than half an hour to complete this and understanding its so called ""purpouse"" but seriusly the idea is to hlep people not telling them another sad story about a guy that cant make simple decision's just because he/she is depressed, realy i se no logic in this and im realy dissapointed about it, as a story ""might"" be kind of good, as a method to help understand depression not good, it felt more like a cry for help from the protagonist of this game for being stuck and his shamefull reality. i could go on and on about it but it be pointless.

												As someone with depression, this game was almost like a slap in the face. Each person deals with depression differently; when I feel it come on, I know to get out and do something to feel better. To have those options in the game scratched out makes the game seem biased to what most people think is depression; lazy, defeated, unhappy for months on end. Really, it was getting hard to play this game. There were problems in how depression was put out in this game. This isn't a game to play if you have experienced depression; this is sort of a mockery to ways of dealing with depression and posting this negative view of people with depression.Lastly, I'd like to add that this isn't a quest. Depression isn't a quest that someone goes through. It's a real life problem that many people suffer with. This game makes it out that there is nothing you can do to make things better, which is even worse to read. I would not recommend this game. Not even to someone who is studying depression or personality, mood disorders. It's simply just not good.			"

												I rarely write reviews for anything.But this struck a raw nerve for me. This is neither a good game, text based adventure, nor information about depression. I felt patronised by the characterisation, insulted by the terrible use of imagery and the occasional jarring use (and often misuse) of ""complicated"" words. At times I wonder whether the developer is a native speaker of English, this is a direct quote from the game:""... your boss approaches you to tell you that it's dead and you can go home early...""What is dead? Time is dead? Your job motivation is dead? Your computer? Oh wait, no - it's my immersion that is completely dead.This ""game"" screams of faux intellectualism and lacks any clear reason for existing.I wish this would just go away.			"

												I've been depressed, I don't like talking about it, and I don't like reliving it much less playing a game about it. However, this game fails to deliver by outright not letting you pick activities which you know should pick you up. Because when you are depressed you can choose to do nice things, but those nice things have no effect on your mood whatsover.This game is unrealistic. What is portrayed is an fake depression which speaks of a lack of self-control and giving up rather than genuine depression. It starts with the stereotype that depressed people lack motivation and works from there. This is wrong. Because depression has nothing to do with what sort of activities you do, and if depression were so simple as that then it would not be a problem.This is not a good insight into depressed people and I wouldn't recommend it.

												My heart goes out to all those who suffer from depression. To you I say: You are so much more important to others than you realize, and there is no shame in needing and getting help. In fact, it is quite heroic of you to be able to admit your weakness to others and to seek to better your situation.And to those who are depressed, this ""game"" will do absolutely nothing for you. Please go get professional help.To those who are NOT depressed, you would be better of looking at your group of friends and looking for signs of depression yourself. Skip this ""game"" entirely. It is a waste of time.Here are (some) warning signs of Depression and/or Suicide. •Always talking or thinking about death•Clinical depression -- deep sadness, loss of interest, trouble sleeping and eating -- that gets worse•Having a ""death wish,"" tempting fate by taking risks that could lead to death, such as driving fast or running red lights•Losing interest in things one used to care about•Making comments about being hopeless, helpless, or worthless•Putting affairs in order, tying up loose ends, changing a will•Saying things like ""it would be better if I wasn't here"" or ""I want out""•Sudden, unexpected switch from being very sad to being very calm or appearing to be happy•Talking about suicide or killing one's self•Visiting or calling people to say goodbyeIf you notice that somebody you know or love exhibits some, any, or all of these symptoms, make sure you say something to them. Offer them your support. Tell somebody else about it, whether it be your high school or college councellor, this person's parents, lover, doctor, etc. Encourage this person to seek professional help. Do NOT expect them to get better on their own, and do NOT take depression lightly.Thank you to all of you who care about your fellow human beings and are willing to make the small effort it takes to make a big difference.

												*TRIGGER WARNING.* No. This is a serious review, I'm♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and I'm serious. I've been suffering from depression since ten years old and I can't let some game make it look like you'e just ""lazy."" No ♥♥♥♥ you. You're not just ""lazy."" You're depressed. Depression is not as simple as an emotion. Depression is a location. That location is the end of the road, a gun to your head and screams. When your mother and father get divorced. When your mother beats you so badly child protective services has to get involved. When a ten year old child has to see his own brother accuse his non biological father after his original father killed himself. The man who raised him when he was a six. The one who did all this. And he accuses the ten year old boy's father of beating him when he was young. When it turns out the mother was cheating on the father. When you realize the garage door opening at five in the morning at night was the boy's mother going to the gym to cheat on the father. Depression is watching your whole entire world fall apart. This game just makes it look like you smoked a bit of weed and are lazy and sleepy. This game has nothing special other than depression. I don't believe anyone on that team had ever experienced depression. Because the real thing about depression is. There is no escape. It will follow you around and whenever you're having a happy moment you remember the bad moments, you always do. Even when I had no will to live, when I just wanted to end it all. I still soldiered on, I hated myself. I thought I was♥♥♥♥♥♥ like everything was my fault. I soldiered on because people cared about me, people loved me. People talked to me. They taught me how to love myself, they taught me how to be myself again. Talking in this game doesn't help, it doesn't solve anything and it doesn't help your character which is a total and utter lie. So at the end of third grade the boy was depressed. By fifth grade the boy was happy. And by sixth grade the boy was loved. From one depression survivor from another, don't kill yourself. You might think nobody cares about you, but really all you had to do all along was open your eyes and experience the good. Therapists are overrated, talk to a dog and or cat. They're much better listeners. I love all of you in a brotherly way survivors and sufferers. Don't give up. Let age knock at your door, not a stool and rope.			"

												As someone who's had depression for 5 years and counting, this game/novel is atrocious. The game purposely crosses out options that allow you to fight depression which is stupid in this game's ""choose your own adventure style"". I want to help my character get better like I should in real life, not ""you can't do option 1 because you're depressed"". The character you're thrown into is cliche and like a 15 year old Tumblr teen's vision of depression. If you're depressed or not, don't play this at all. Don't waste your time.  "

												I stopped playing after three minutes. It was so boring. The screen is a boring shade of white, there are tiny, mundane images at the the top of the screen, and the character didn't feel fleshed out. And the first opportunity I had to make a choice, one of my choices was crossed out. Why the ♥♥♥♥ was it there?! I couldn't select it, so why include it? And then it happened again. And then again. Then I turned it off. It felt like one of those choose your own adventure books, except without the fun. And from some of the reviews I've seen from people who completed it, it looks like you can't kill yourself. I'm not the type of person who would intentionally make the character kill themself, but this is a story about depression. Many people with depression commit suicide. The fact that if I made certain choices, the character would kill themself would give me an incentive to play it so that they wouldn't kill themself. I feel like this would work better if it were a dating sim style game (I think they're called interactive novels), where you're the friend or family member of someone with depression, and you have to spend time with them to make them feel better, or they could kill themself. If you can't lose, why play? Not fun at all. Please, remove this from Steam. This isn't a quality ""game"" (it isn't a game), and I was given no reason to give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the character.UPDATE: I tried it again. Still found it terrible. And, yet again, I didn't finish it, but I got further this time. The fact that you are prevented from selecting certain choices is still infuriating. It was like a carrot on a stick. I don't have depression, but the fact that you can't even make an attempt to help yourself is absolutely frustrating. I had a few friends in school who did have depression, and they weren't like this at all. They were able to come to school, and have an enjoyable time with their friends, even if they were depressed. The main character just seems to shut down. Many people are still able to function with depression.Since the first time I reviewed this, I have played a few other visual novels, and found myself really enjoying the genre. This one still remains incredibly boring. The scenes weren't long enough, or descriptive enough to let me connect with any of the characters. The scenes were basically ""X shows up and starts talking to you. They point out that you don't seem like your normal self. Here's some choices. The ones that will help you can't be selected, so you lie to them or brush it off. They make another point about you being strange, and the scene ends."" This isn't good writing, it's lazy.Since the last time I played this, I learned who developer Zoe Quinn was. I greatly dislike this person, and her unprofessional attitude. Most of the positive reviews of this game I read were just someone joking about her reputation of sleeping with reviewers to get good reviews on this piece of garbage. That isn't a good sign.			"

												Firstly, I'd like to say that for the amount of content found in this 'game', there is not enough to justify it being a downloadable file. This is the kind of thing that I imagine as a flash game, somewhere on Kongregate or Armor Games where you don't have to keep it on your computer for the fact that it's just about clicking on links and expecting that you chose the right option.The music I'd have to say is something I that I myself did not enjoy. The piano was slow, and as far as I could tell it was just a few second loop. The party music would have to be the same in regards to it just being a loop as well. Anyone who is seriously considering trying Depression Quest out, I recommend listening to something on youtube. ""Under the Sea"" from The Little Mermaid made playing this game a fun experience but if you don't like that song, ""Hakuna Matata"" from The Lion King is a good substitute.The story itself is something that I personally could not get into. I think it was something to do with being depressed and having a girlfriend named Alex and yeah ... Couldn't get into it.The fact that certain visable options aren't available in Depression Quest is quite annoying - but I guess that was what was intended when it was being developed. The choices when in your first reading were quite obvious to make, the train of thought that I had was ""Choose the options that make the most sense. Don't focus on work? Hell no. Ignore girlfriend? Hell no. Go to party? Hell YEAH (the most exciting thing that happens until you find out that you're socially awkward even though you HAVE a girlfriend who tries to be intimate with you)""Thinking that you clicked the wrong button and then backtracking to try a different selection of options probably made my experience a drool. Also the fact that choosing different options didn't really change the story all that much was also a bummer, for as short an experience as Depression Quest is, it does seem rushed, and if not rushed then not thought out a lot.Although this review in my opinion was not well thought out and was just me typing out things about Depression Quest that came into my head, I'd have to say that this isn't a fun or interesting experience. If you want to have fun with it, try listening to music that doesn't come from Depression Quest itself and don't get your hopes high when you see options that require you to be in any way social as they probably won't be selectable no matter what you try.Note: I avoided trying to call Depression Quest a game for a reason, the reason being because it doesn't take long at all to finish. Seriously though, not a long experience, I read it over a decent number of times just to see how fun I could make the experience with whatever I could find around me at the time.I recommend trying a 'Doctor Who Choose Your Destiny' book if you want to make choices in a story that directly impact how it plays out and haven't tried a interactive story before.

												This game is very rude towards people like me who deal with depression. I could only sit through 12 minutes of the game before I just shook my head and turned it off to write this review. This character you play as isn't even depressed. They just have no personality. I mean I understand that the creator wants YOU as the player to experience what it's like to go through life and make every day choices while dealing with depression, but this is far from accurate. Maybe it IS like this for some people in worst case scenarios, but still, even depressed people have a personality of some sort. Also, the music was very boring, slow, annoyingly repetitive, and just made me even less interested in playing more of the game. This also applies to the visuals. If I could, I'd rather continue to read it as a visual novel instead. Maybe it gets better the further you play, but until then, I wouldn't recommend playing this game if you have depression. It'll just make you angry at the creator. Even if you don't have depression the overall game so far is very boring.			"

												All you have to do is not be a dumb ♥♥♥♥.I mean it isn't badly made, but playing as the main character all you have to do is not ♥♥♥♥ anything up.I can't recommend this, because it is very short and it seems the choices are specifically made for people with depression (or had) because all the choices revolve around the whole ""I don't want to bother other people"" sort of mindset which makes me hate MC. Just choose the smart choice and not be a♥♥♥♥♥♥to your girlfriend and boom you ""win"". I guess I went through this game with the wrong mental disorder because getting out of depression in this game is too easy. (By the way after getting the ""good"" ending I tried to go and make MC commit suicide. For people who care, it isn't a thing in this game :c ).			"

												I've been diagnosed as clinically depressed for over ten years now. I thought this game would offer some kind of insight or something I could identify with. I should have immediately seen the name ""Zoe Quinn"" and deleted the game, but I tried to give it an objective playthrough.While it does begin with the caveat that all experiences are not the same...this isn't even close to what many of us have experienced. This should be called ""Late 20's Male Depression Quest"" as it is just a small window into a male in (what I'm assuming) his late 20's and how his relationship falls apart with his girlfriend.It makes my stomach churn that when they were writing this they probably imagined all the tumblrettes jumping for joy that, ""Finally, our disease has an interactive experience!"" Eugh.If you really want to know something about mental disorders I suggest you play a game like The Cat Lady, Downfall, Masochisia, or any number of horror titles available on Steam. While they are a bit more fantastical in nature - they are a hell of a lot more real when it comes to how a mental disorder can affect one's life.Seriously, why...for anyone who has played this and ISN'T depressed, it makes it seem like, ""Hey now I can go to my friend and help him and/or her by just lending an ear! Teehee!"" Yeah...depression isn't that easily fixed.0/10. I legitimately tried to identify with it.			"

												I'll say this - if Depression Quest helps one person better understand his or her own issues, good on it. However, as a game, DQ is sorely lacking. There's no gameplay to speak of, just a choose-your-own-adventure wall of text. There's only a single story, meaning all options are exhausted quickly, and the quality of writing is fairly shoddy. The choices presented are transparent, making it easy to see which ones will lead to a ""good"" and ""bad"" ending. DQ would have been better served with A) multiple story scenarios to give the player variety (and prolong its own replay value, which sits at exactly zero), B) less ""telling"" in the form of excruciatingly long setups and more ""showing"" how the player is feeling, and C) an editor for the mediocre story.

												An absolutely atrocious, hopelessly bleak look into depression. As someone who has struggled with depression for years myself, the game offers nothing but negativity in the form of a poorly-written self-indulgent exercise in tedium. Anything positive, anything sensible anybody with half a brain would do and should do in these absurd situations are all blocked out to tease you, as if in an attempt to say ""Because I have depression, I can not do this"" -- which can not be further from the truth. The game attempts to showcase the mental disorder in an understandable standpoint, but fails terribly, instead taking it as some kind of given. It makes no attempt to show any glimmer of hope or actual realism in logical solutions, and instead wallows in its own idiotic sense of loathing. I held off on reviewing this because so many others with similar experiences have said in full-detail explaining exactly why this game is a failure, but I felt drawn to simply add my thoughts also because it is a representation of part of what my life largely consisted of. Horrible, horrible ""game.""			"

												Understandably, this ""game"" was designed with the purpose of promoting awareness for depression. While the story is completely plausible and relatable to people with/recovered from depression, those with no personal experience (no, it is not personal experience if it is your friend/family suffering from depression) with the condition would quite likely be bored/frustrated by this so-called simulated experience, or worse, believe they actually understand the suffering. Alas, I would not call this a successful attempt in raising awareness for depression.For those who complained about not being able to commit suicide despite choosing the worst possible choices in this game, people with severe depression are in reality often too exhausted to do anything, including taking steps to end their lives (any form of suicide takes action, unless you count starving to death as an option). That is why there is an associated increase in suicidal risk at the beginning of therapy, when they begin to become motivated again. If you want to see the protagonist commit suicide in a game, I'd recommend going for open-world games, which we have an overflowing abundance of.			"

												I didn't really care to get caught up in the hullabaloo that is ""The Five Guys Scandal"" in which the lead , Zoe Quinn, was accused by her boyfriend of sleeping with game journalists to leave an artifically large review. Perhaps they just used this to insult her more.Jesus was I wrong.This game is completly misrepresenting the subject material of depression by giving the correct answer and a couple of wrong answers. Then they cross out more correct answers (that you could never use) and give more wrong ones if you do something non active. If you attempt anything social or active you get less things crossed out. Then it does this bull about ""This game doesn't end because depression doesn't end"" and expects that to hide that its just a bad ending.  STORY:          Nonexistent/10 The background audio is one of the most annoying things I've heard. It starts off as pseudo-smooth jazz and adds in random chatter and mechanical keyboard clicks.  AUDIO:          Annoying/5 The entire thing runs as a bad text game with jpeggy pictures of copywritten material.     GRAPHICS:          Plagerised JPG/100 Overall, you're better off with real depression than this piece of crap.

												So. Depression Quest. Let me start out by saying that I have had depression. This ""Game"" is not accurate to what depression is like. I say ""game"" because it's not a game. You can't win nor lose. There is no challenge, it's an interactive story. The player has no reason to be depressed, and there is no conflict. There's no rising action, no climax, not even an actual ending. There is no structure. You're just told that you are depressed. The big problem is that the more depressed you get the more limited you are in your choises. My first play I got the worst ending possible for making choices I would realisticly make (or choises I was forced to make). Second play I chose all the good options and nothing really changed. All that happened was that I was less depressed. Nothing major to the story changed. It's less of a story and more of a series of events that sort of connect. The players depression is not realistic whatsoever. You just are depressed for no reason. The problem is that depression is a unique experience for everyone. The basics are the same but the way you deal with it is entirely up to what works for you. I personally shut myself out of the world and worked on writing short stories. I saw a therapist once and hated it. Hated the drugs too. This game makes it too black and white in solutions when really it's all grey. All the player can do to feel better is seek help from others. No way to feel good on your own. Depression for me was not wanting to do anything because it all seems dull. Here it's not wanting to do anything because you're scared. Depression is different for everyone, but here, it just looks silly. No reason is given for anything. It makes me feel diconnected from the story. The writing is really the biggest flaw. It just isn't what I would do. It isn't how I would act or how I feel with depression. It makes it boring and I just feel uninterested. There's just nothing here. You want to learn about depression? Ask someone who has/had it. Don't play this thing.			"

												I played Depression Quest during a time of shortly after having experienced an agonizing break-up. I’m not sure if I was just dealing with grief or if I genuinely was depressed, but I played it hoping I could get an answer. My views are personal as a result.I found the options for what I could do to be more restricting as the game went on, unnecessarily so to the point where I found it harder to feel immersed in not even being able to try to do some of the things I’d like. Considering I did get medicine and psychiatric help after the devastating end to my long-distance 5 year relationship, I’d have like to know where I would have been for pursuing the same type of help in the game. Some choices in general, particularly the ones that didn’t allow me to talk about my problems, created a greater disconnect between my feelings and the protagonist. In particular, moments where I would simply “choose” not to allow my girlfriend Alex to understand my gnawing feelings that she may to be with someone else--uncannily like my own situation--were extraordinarily frustrating. The fact that the game was becoming linear at the moment I began to actually identify wit the protagonist made this feel like a lost opportunity to me.Either I’m too wrapped up in my own thoughts to truly empathize with the protagonist, or the developers failed to get a reliably feasible representation of what it means to feel depressed. If it’s the latter, it definitely comes in part from the emphasis on feeling doubtful for anything rather than the actual struggle it takes to pull-through with wanting to save yourself from yourself, which would have made the game give more agency to the player as well as accurately portray how depression is a behemoth of a challenge to feel you can overcome, not a parasite that forces you to make choices you don’t want to.While the atmosphere left me ready to cry some more, the game wasn’t immersive enough to make the experience feel well-executed. If the game had more focus on allowing choices that are difficult rather than simply disallowing the best options, I would feel completely in the place of this miserable protagonist. In short, the game has potential, but definitely needs refinement before it truly becomes what it sets itself out to be.			"

												This is more of an interactive text experience than a game, and I could liken it some of the old interactive Animorph, Goosebumps and Doctor Who books. Not a lot can be said for it in terms of originality, aside from the fact that nobody to my knowledge, has had the nerve to attempt to make depression into an interactive experience. I can't help but feel, as much as the supposed intentions of the author as stated at the beggining of the game are all fine and good, that this game comes from a somewhat self centered place. Many of those, and I include myself, who have suffered depression, can often tend to allow their experience to inspire their art and the results can be very satisfying. When I listen to, watch or observe such art, as much as it comes off as sad, it makes me feel joy. This is simply not the case with this game. The author has clearly taken their own experiences and their output has been to make a game that attempts to make other people feel depressed (and I'll place emphasis on the word 'attempt'), rather than to create art and other things that instead express and explore the feeling. It flimsily attempts to impose the feeling upon the viewer rather than present the feeling for the viewer to explore and gain something out of. This gives the game a very self indulgent tone. Self indulgence emanating from any piece of art is not necessarily a bad thing but in this case it feels as though it was completely unchecked by the author, and puts a very bad taste in my mouth. There really isn't much to speak about in terms of art assets aside from it's sound track, which in my opinion sounds rather tacky and contrived, like the sound track to a depression ad campaign. I must actually say that I feel that the lack of art assets is one of this game's only wise decisions. It's white background and plain text don't overstate the feelings of depression the game is supposed to be imposing on you, which may even compensate for the horrible cheasy music I just mentioned. I can only imagine the overused contrasty pictures and grain effects that could have been chosen to give the game an 'edgy' and 'dark' appearance, and this makes me cringe. If I could say one other good thing about the game, it would be in the effectiveness of the way in which it makes the player feel hopelessly as though their choices won't matter. Although as stated above, I can't say I appreciate this game's over all approach, and so this slightly impressive mechanic does not even begin to remove the bad taste from my mouth. It should also be mentioned that as a trade off this causes your play through to have little variation as your choices make little difference. No matter what, you tend to wind up back on the same path of the story no matter what choices you make. This only makes a story that is already dull, unoriginal and boring, even less worth while and gives it very little replayability.In short, I feel that this is a misguided and self indulgent exercise running behind the pretence of being an attempt to reach out to people. It lacks both subtlety and substance, and as an experimental indie game it is dwarved by hundreds of text adventures, point and click adventures and experimental games that have come before it on the levels of creativity, originality, taste and righteous intent, and I can't say it deserves the greenlight it has received.

												Depression Quest as described by their website is an “interactive fiction game where you play as someone living with depression. You are given a series of everyday life events and have to attempt to manage your illness, relationships, job, and possible treatment. This game aims to show other sufferers of depression that they are not alone in their feelings, and to illustrate to people who may not understand the illness the depths of what it can do to people.“Let’s talk about the code behind it… The game is written entirely in web-based languages, such as CSS, HTML, JS etc. It uses a node.js webkit browser to display said pages. There’s no problem with this, but it gave me a bit of a surprise as it doesn’t seem to be too suited to the task at hand. This also gave me a bit of trouble recording the game as I normally use DXTory but it didn’t pick the ‘browser game’ up. In my opinion it would be better coded in a different language as it didn’t even make use of any HTML5 features or any features to access websites which is kind of a waste.Let’s talk about the game itself, it starts out with some story that didn’t explain why the character was depressed at all, it just seemed to drop you into something you knew nothing about with unfamiliar characters. It asks you some questions on what you would like to do and you can answer, 1, 2, 3 or 4. Except 1 is crossed out for no apparent reason other than to provay the story and lock it down to a more linearised path.Suddenly after I clicked answer 1 to do work, I am very depressed for no reason other than to tell a story. Next my girlfriend calls me, Alex. It gives me a boring wall of text and 3 options. 1 is of course, as always crossed out because it is the most sensible option of them all - go hang out with your girlfriend and be happy, because that would be way too easy. Now we’re at a party, boring wall of text… and of course, option 1 is crossed off, which is the most sensible with ‘Enthusiastically socialize’. It really confuses me why the most sensible options are crossed off, I thought this story was Depression Quest and not ‘Let’s Try and be as Sad for No Reason and Silly as we can Quest.’Now we’re back home and our mother has come over for a surprise visit, except we can’t choose the most sensible option again, which is tell her how sad we are, I’ll choose the similar option, number 2.Sidenote: For some reason the crossed out options and the one just below them are nearly identical… This game is strange…So, I decide to take up this offer with this person to get a cat as the other options to take the cat but enthusiastically were crossed out..Anyway, the next scene is the character and their GF talking about some stuff I skipped because it was too long and didn’t seem too relevant to the plot when I speed-read it, anyway, you have options:1. Tell her how awesome she is, explained with lots of words.2. Tell her how awesome she is, explained with fewer amount of words.3. Ask if she is happy with the relationship.4. Do nothing.I have decided to chose 3 as it seemed the most sensible. You know I’ve found a pattern; the highest available one seems the most sensible one to choose but usually ends up making you more depressed for no apparent reason.Anyway, this carries on for some time. Eventually it just becomes “NEXT”, “PICK OPTION 6 AS IT’S THE ONLY ONE”.Apparently playing with cats makes you depressed these days. I ended up after trying several times I managed to unlock the therapist and I talked to some guy called Attic who doesn’t actually live in my roof.I skipped forward because I was starting to get more and more bored by the planck time. Infact the boredom turned into depression it was that lackluster and dull (in a boring way). Anyway, its now Christmas and this is where the game ends.TL;DRBORING QUESTIONS, PRETTY LINEAR STORY WITH FEW ACTUAL CHOICES, AND A STORY THAT MADE NO SENSE.Overall: 1/10. Would NOT recommend.			"

												Do I recommend this ""game"" (more like a choose your own adventure book) to people who have never experienced depression and want to know what it's like? Yes. Absolutely. This is right on point with what depression is like, even the noise on the status. You want to understand a friend or family member with depression, absolutely download this game. This is just plain clinical depression though. When you wanna mix in other types of depression or things like manic depressive or bipolar it is a whole new territory. Just use this as a baseline for regular clinical depression depression. Do I recommend this as a game? No. I like the sound track but there are very limited choices in which to live your depressed life and you don't get much insight on things. You don't even get a technical/medical aspect of depression. I'd like some customization, a more in-depth game. Turn it from a choose your own adventure to more like Kudos, where you can pick who you are, what you do, what kind of friends you have, and then fight depression by cutting out toxic people, going to a therapist, support group, seeing friends, petting cute animals, meds, or even just forcing yourself to get out there with both good and bad consequences. Perhaps even include different types of depresison or personality disorders. It could show you what its like in a wider scope and show you how to beat it. Now that's a game worth playing! Of course, this game is free and supported on donation. So perhaps that's unreasonable. But I'd pay for Depression Quest 2 if they kick it up to this level.			"

												This game. In my opinion is... Ok. I'll simply list what i like, and disliked.Dislikes, starting off is the most glaring issue for me, the pretentiousness. The language, and tone just is so pretentious, there's a special way to write things seriously, and this game did not do it right, it just comes off as pretentious. (Sorry for saying pretentious so many times!)  Secondly, this isn't that bad for me atleast but i think the developers wouldn't appreciate this comment, it seems more like a... Pet game. I can't put myslef in the main character's shoes. (even though i have had suicidal deppresion.) It justs seemes like, im nudging around this sad little creature. Last, i really couldn't sypathise for the main character. the deppresion was very sappy, and cheesy, there really weren't any reasons for him/her to be depressed, he/she just was. and the existing reasons were terrible. the deppresion just seemed like a petty teenager overeacting to life.I also would have liked to be able to controll this person more. If this is susposed to be me, then i shouldn't be able to just make trivial nudges. Also, the ""What do i do?"" thing, was stupid. the options were so limited, and i got to choose so few things, the main character got to make important decisions without me even consenting!LIkes, I got a very good sense of... Satisfaction when i ""beat"" the game. I felt like i had helped my little pet make the right choices, and actually was touched by the ending, i found myslef smiling, becuase i had this felling that i had made my little pet happy. As i have had depresion the red corss over the best answer was good. if you're deppresed there are times when you want to, you know you should, but you jsut can't.All in all, i wouldn't recommend playing. It shows a very melodramatic, unrealistic view on depresion.4/10 stars, a passable game.Edit: I also have learned the ""reputation"" of the person that made this game, and I honestly don't care.What I care about is that this is called an ""Interactive Fiction"" Yes It's FICTION, this is a FICTITIOUS story, at best it's realistic fiction. But this isn't even a game, I'm a fan of interactive fiction, this isn't interactive fiction, this is a choose-you-own-adventure book, with a bad plot.			"

												Don't play it, as it really does no good for your psyche. It claims to open up your eyes to a depressed person's view, and yet, I've had these same thoughts as the main character and snapped myself out of it before. It only seems to be as much of a mental illness as you let it be, and I just don't think this game sends the right message. In reality, a lot of people have overcame mental illnesses on their own through willpower and getting over themselves. Wish the character in this game could do that too.			"

												I've played this a few times few at this point, attempted to compare different endings, but as an interactive fiction/visual novel, the cons outweigh the pros unfortunately.I appreciate what this game attempts to do for the awareness of depression, but it fails to do so effectively.At first opening the game, the music tipped me off with the thought, “oh hey, that’s nice. It’s kind of sad. This may help put me in the mood and let me understand what depression is for some.”I’ve dealt with depression in the past, and no, it’s not fun. It’s tiresome and… depressing (Lol, kind of like this review). But depression is a bit different from one person to another, so knowing how it was like for myself and some other people I’ve been close to, I was curious about how this game would portray it.First and foremost, the writing is decent. Fortunately for the player, there aren’t any serious flaws that derail the story completely. BUT, there definitely could’ve been more elaboration on the character’s past(s) or relationships with others. There was no real detail about the player’s workplace, or even their boss. Having that relationship explored more could’ve greatly helped the story, even if it was for a short moment. Halfway through the game, I just stopped caring about the outcome. Which is weird for me, since I’ve trudged through some pretty boring interactive fictions in the past, including those old school text adventures very few people would ever want to play (unless you’re into that sort of thing like me).Technically, I found this game irritatingly lazy. There’s no save function. I know this seems trivial, but even with the most homebrew of interactive fictions through platforms like Gargoyle or the InfoCom reader, there’s usually a save function. If you find yourself bored wanting to quit to carry on later… YOU CAN’T. You have no other choice but to start from the beginning.The “branching” story is misleading in the description above. This game is marketed as an interactive fiction with decent options to change the ending, but in reality, there isn’t. Most people aren’t going to play this more than once to realize this, but there is only one ending. Sure a couple words and things may be switched around or replaced, but it’s a lie. Sure your “stats” may be a little better or worse, but it doesn’t change the context of the game greatly enough to be considered truly interactive.And yes, I understand the crossed out options are options that would be available if you weren’t depressed, but since you’re given so little options, the variance is negligible. Therefore, replay value is at an all-time low. And even though I didn’t want to, I replayed this sucker more than I wanted to. I even went with the worst options available to me, singling me out to depressing options (no pun intended), to see if I would have a super terrible ending… it never came.From personal experience with depression, I faced myself at the edge of a bridge considering suicide since I’m a terrible swimmer. The choice of suicide never came in this game.I know this sounds absolutely terrible and I apologize to anybody that may be offended, but when you think the world is better off without you in it, you only drag the people around you down, that God has either forsaken you or isn’t even there, or if you killed yourself the world wouldn’t skip a beat, then yes… suicide, regardless of the stigma, is a viable option to somebody that is depressed, regardless of how terrible of a choice it may be.An option for this could’ve been suicide, then showing the aftermath of what it would do to the family and friends of the player.Unfortunately if this choice was made into the game, you never get acquainted well enough with your family and girlfriend enough to actually care. They overall seemed paper thin in character, and sure this detail may be thrown aside as a viewpoint of somebody that's depressed. I get that. But if you want to really grind at the readers views and heart, you need to connect them to the characters and their feelings, including the supporting characters. This may seem pretty basic, but the supporting characters are just as important as the main. And no matter how crappy this sounds, suicide could’ve opened up another heartbreaker end game scenario in the fact that your new kitten would die of starvation because you killed yourself and nobody knew about it for, I dunno... let's throw out some arbitrary numbers: 4-5 days to a week at most.So yes, I found this game lazy in mechanic and programming. From the lack of options, lack of ending, and lack of a save function. I felt like it always ended with a sigh with no resolution. Which is funny, since the writers at the end of the game thank you for playing stating, “there’s no real end to depression.” Which may be true, but I just found lazy. For a good story, there could still of been a resolution of what happened, even if it’s, “Oh, nothing happened. You stayed depressed and went into a deeper spiral of darkness. Lost your job, and found yourself homeless.” Or, “Your girlfriend Alex, wanting to help you, excorted you to go see a therapist.” Or, “Your family, admitted you to a psyche ward, because they realized your depression got so bad, you weren’t able to function in day to day tasks.” OR, “Your IM friend Attic, realized you didn’t go see the therapist, attempted to get you help in person. You denied. So he called a Suicide help line.” OR, “ANYTHING beyond the same thing, nearly every time.”The music was okay at first… then it got annoying. And in the end it seemed to actually add to the boredom I found with this game. It definitely didn’t help the more times I played through it. Luckily there’s a mute function in the menu, or you can always just mute your computer audio.BUT here are the pros…I appreciate what the game attempts to do.The pictures getting fuzzier and turning black and white was a nice touch.The music getting a little distorted the more you get depressed was kind of a nice touch.I found no typos (unlike this review)Final verdict:This game should be Pong and Forgotten.3.7/10 – Not worth your time unless you’re really curious. OR, you’re a diehard interactive fiction novel gamer and want a taste of everything at some point, despite whether or not you’d like it or not. Which unfortunately for me, I fell under this category.P.S. I'll probably make a video review of this on my YouTube Channel. I know this is shameless advertising, but idc. It'll probably get me some views and subs because of the whole gamergate crap. Also, It'll knock off anybody thinking that I plagerized my own material since my Youtube name doesn't have the underscore. lol			"

												My main gripe with the game, other than that it shouldn't be on steam to begin with, is that it presents itself in a way that the character just seems sad, not depressed, but it might just be a different form of a depression cycle. I am someone who was diagnosed with clinical depression, before I started to take medication (Taking mood stabalizers, not anti-depressents, my psychiatrist is a smart dude.) everything didn't seem gloomy and sad like people tend to think of it as, I saw the world exactly the same, the sun shining and the people smiling and♥♥♥♥♥♥like everyone else does, but I was disconnected from it making me happy because my brain chemistry didn't have the pre-requisites to MAKE me happy. Maybe people feel depression in a completely different fashion than I do, but the character is written to feel that he should be doing more, he just isn't. For me, I just didn't care, I didn't see a point to, why strive for anything? I often sat outside of the classroom in a ball because first off I couldn't see a ♥♥♥♥ing point in striving to do any of the work, and then furthermore the frustration that you can't do that and you know it's not normal or healthy drives you even further. It's a continous spiral I feel, and I feel like the character was just in a slump. It doesn't represent my depression, but it might represent less severe cases, so I can't really say ""NO THIS IS WRONG"", but I feel that someone playing this game couldn't learn about how my own depression has affected my life, and I feel it chips away at the integrity of the game in that instance, because it's trying to represent an actual perseption.

												I tried this game and realised that the disclaimer at the beginning was correct, this isn't a game. This ""choose your own adventure: Tumblr edition."" I keep hearing the DQ as the short form of title in the reviews and quite honestly keep thinking of Dairy Queen, which I can recall can offer delicious if not fattening solutions to many woes. But while it cannot cure depression it can possibly cure the depression that you will come down with when you attempt this game. I would say don't get it but it's free and you will feel tempted to try it. But word of caution the music can be pretty unsettling to listen to at times especially since it kept making me think something scary or disturbing would happen which actually might temporarily stave off any boredom you will experience. This in turn can be quickly averted with a snack ""buff"" courtesy of Dairy Queen:)			"

												only installed and played it now to write a bad review at first, how mature of me.ive played it before, maybe some months ago, maybe more, and that online, since i heard about it on some imageboards, how its well made and the real deal. wasnt remotely impressed at that point, but gave it some credit for being some gimmicky flash/webgame just like any other.gave it another shot, maybe they changed somethingdid not in all that timesadly it feels plastic and forced, like someone read up on depression in a textbook, watched a documentary and later decided to make a game out of that then. while i can understand that some may experience their depression like its portrayed i highly doubt that it reflects the experience of the majority of people.game is short as hell, the time displayed, is the time i needed to play it to the end and writing this entire review while it remained opened, and the review took the most time since i suck♥♥♥♥♥at writing reviews.a huge flaw was that already after about 4 questions it restricted my freedom of choice to mostly one or just two possible answers, usually the one of the path even further down, which kinda negates the whole decision system doesnt it, also i had the problem that at some later point of the game none of the possible answers were really pick-worthy or relateable at all, especially when it came to social interaction with loved ones or being a decent human being towards them(alex, internet dude), not involving them in things that they shouldnt have to endure.i dont know if it comes of as a compliment but this comes close to depression as much as need for speed does to driving.the consumerbase is there tho, with the aid of all these self-diagnosing snowflakes on tumblr or those ""corrupt game journalists""			"

												As an avid reader, I was curious to play this ""game"". However, when I got into it, it wasn't fully what I was expecting. It does have a decent amount of replayability, if you want to go back and make different choices, however, one questions if that is something that most people would even really want to do. Most of the choices seemed geared more towards keeping you in that depressive state, and all of the 'good' choices were unavailable to you. At the same time, only one side of depression was expressed, with a lot of things about the disorder being left out. This could have easily been fixed by lengthening the story and adding more to the characters in it. I felt like I wasn't really connected to the characters. It did, however, do an excellent job expressing the fact that depression is something that can effect anyone, no matter what you have in life. This is the one really great thing that I hope people will take away from this game. The music created a nice ambiance for whatever part you were at in the story as well. Which adds slightly to the mood of the story.All in all, it wasn't a terrible game, but I do think that there are ways they could have made the experience better.			"

												-Clear that the dev has no idea what real depression is like-Poor representation, downright disrespectful to the clinically depressed, painting them as lazy, moping people with no motivation to change their lives-All the decisions that can change your depression are cancelled out (wtf?) possibly to show that the depressed ""have no way out"" which is a load of horse sh*t-Soundtrack is repetitive and lame. Turn sound off.-It's clear what Quinn was trying to do, but it's also obvious she didn't do her research. She expects you to empathize with a character with no character, and seriously f*ck the ending of this game. Lazy as sh*t			"

												If you like reading, this is not the game for you. If you like games, this is not the game for you. This is a text based ""adventure"" and if extreme boredom is a sign of depression it reaches it's goal. It seems like a good idea to make a game about depression and the feelings asociated, but this just misses the target. It's poorly writen and gives the impresion of being a ""blog"" (personal, yes, but unprofesional, and painfull to read). The music is repetitive and the sound effects anoying. You'll notice this since the ""game""/diary/blog takes ages to go trough, is not that long, but feels eternal.If you want a better depression experience, you just need to play your favorite ""sad"" playlist and read the news, or your favorite boring teenager blog. And all of that without having some expectations or waisting time. Thats all.			"

However, the shallow and inaccurate potrait this paints of depression is not helpful to me, and I would be worried if people played this and believed it to be in any way relevant to a real depression patient's life.As a side note, if we are talking about actual gameplay. It's just a text based game, hyperlinks taking you to the next page.

												About the creator's hipocritical actions aside.The game is very short. I've seen pamphlets with more dialog. With that in mind, if you don't like to read you'll most likely find this Not-A-Game(NAG) very boring and unstimulating. If you are a heavy reader you'll most likely feel let down by the lack of substaince. I only played though the game once, forcing my self to finish it. I didn't feel that the choices had much impact if any. You can conpair it to a choose your own adventure, but the Goosebumps version that I remember, back in the 3rd grade is what got me in to reading. This NAG had a lot less content less feeling and jusr felt forced in to pushing an agendaIf I can change anything I'd put all the depresstion hotline right in the opening of the game. Then I could look more past the faults of the ""Game"" and can see it as a PSA of sorts, and I would recommend it, but still not on steam. The way it is set up.

												As somebody who struggled with depression for the better part of ten years, and seeing as this application is free, I decided to play it for myself. Yes, I know that this does not techincally qualify as a game, it's an interactive story, it doesn't belong on Steam, yadda yadda yadda. I agree, and I'm approaching this as the form of media that it is.First off, the presentation is quite bland. The sales pitch for this ""game"" promises that you can ""watch the color get sucked out of how you see the world"" as your depression gets ever deeper, however, there isn't much color in the game to begin with. It's a solid white background with plain black text in a generic font, with a small picture on top of the page, sometimes of something that has absolutely nothing to do with the scenario. I mean, come on guys...I understand that the point of this game isn't to entertain, but if you can't put forth the effort to make it look good, then why should we put forth the effort to stick around to the end? The pictures themselve are very boring and add nothing to the text. The worsening of your depression results in the picture becomming slightly swarmed with static, an interesting (albeit misguided) choice. Indeed, depression can make your life seem dull and dreary, but why would you choose static to convey this? All it did was make the picture look like a TV that's not getting good reception. The audio is also said to change, and it does, but not by much. It's the same ol' track, only tweaked a bit to make it sound a bit more unsettling (of course, I lowered the volume because it's just kind of annoying). Overall, the special effects did nothing to enhance the experience, and the presentation leaves much to be desired.Secondly, I don't understand the mechanics of this game. The story and outcome are driven by the choices that you make, but sometimes the outcome you get doesn't make much sense in regard to the choices that you made. For example, in my first playthrough, I based my decisions somewhat on what *I* would do in the given situation if I were depressed. I didn't always make good choices, and yet somehow, I got the good ending. On the flip side, when I chose the choices that I thought were the best options, I only got an okay ending, which confused me to no end. In the beginning of that playthrough, I made many choices in the beginning that were identical to my first playthrough. The only thing that was different was that I had chosen to try to get some work done in the first scenario, and my character somehow ended up even more depressed than when I had them veg out on the couch watching TV. And somehow, this ended up in me not being able to ""test the waters"" when I had lunch with Amanda. Even in Mass Effect, I could usually choose whatever option I wanted regardless of my past decisions. Of course, the first couple of options are always crossed out no matter what, as if their only function is merely to taunt you. These choices are the best ones possible, and you can never choose them, EVER. Although, sometimes when you pick the best choice available, it ends up backfiring, as is the case with the first scenario in the game. So really, what's the point? Another blunder is that the progress you make isn't really reflected that well between the text and the depression ""meter"". For example, if you have your character take medication, the text will say that they have noticed that they are feeling better, but the depression ""meter"" will persist on saying that your character is still pretty depressed, even after a few scenarios. The text itself is not much different depending on the depression ""meter"". There is a slight difference when you go the extremely negative path, but it's nothing to brag about. All in all, I didn't feel like the depression ""meter"" was a true-to-life representation. It makes it seem like when you are going through a major depressive episode, that you're down in the dumps everyday, and that's just not true. Some days are still better than others, and I just felt like this wasn't adequately reflected in the ""meter"". I feel like this feature shouldn't have been added at all, and I'm thinking the only reason it was added was for the sake of making this seem more like a game. And why was this game made compatible with the XBOX controller? It's just dumb. That's like surfing Wikipedia with a gamepad. Is this their way of saying, ""See! This IS a game! It can be played with an XBOX controller!!!"" Stupid...Now, let's deal with the actual CONTENT of the game. In which case, what more can I say that hasn't already been said? The writing is very dry and uninspired. It's like they were trying to write an imaginative story using nothing but exposition. There's absolutely no style, whatsoever. At the beginning, you're told that you are a ""twenty-something human being"" and that's about all the information you get on the character you are ""controlling"". There's not much backstory into your character at all, and you are spoonfed tidbits about your friends, family, and girlfriend by clicking on their names in the beginning, instead of, you know, fleshing them out in the story. You're also given some vague information about your job and a ""project"" that you work on off to the side, but you're never told what you do for a living other than that your job is dull and repetitive, and you're never told what this ""project"" is and why it's so important. Other than that, you're told absolutely nothing about your character, leaving you with the conclusion that he is the most boring human being that you've ever met. I'm thinking that they did this because they wanted players to put themselves in the main character's shoes, but it doesn't really work here, especially not when the story is so linear. Instead, leaving you to imagine what your main character does for a living, and the nature of this ""project"" comes off as a major cop-out to me. It takes away the work of having to create a character that people can connect with. Sometimes the reactions of the main character are overly exaggerated. Like in the beginning, when he comes home from work and is for some reason overwhelmed with stress over the idea of working on his project. I didn't understand that at all. Why would you be so stressed out about something you do as a hobby??? It's not like this project is important to his job. It baffles me that the developers state the objective of this game is to get rid of the stigma of depression, but it seems they're trying to achieve this goal by resorting to stereotypes. The impression this scenario gives is that somebody who suffers from depression is so frozen by their anxiety that the very thought of even doing something that they love makes them want to curl up into a corner and suck their thumb. Of course, this is not accurate by any stretch of the imagination. It seems like this character is always over-reacting, even for a depressed person. Some elements of the story turn out to be a complete red herring, like the project, which is mentioned maybe two times in the entire story, and then forgetten completely by the end. Then there is the case of the resume you send for that ""dream job"", it's never mentioned whether you were contacted for that or not. I would imagine that being either called in for an interview or rejected outright would have a profound effect on the character, but it's never explored. This is yet another indication of lazy writing, or a complete lack of planning (or both). Some of the characteristics of depression were accurate, such as the feelings of isolation and the mental fog, but even the developers admit that not everybody's experience is the same. I think it would have been better if they had avoided a cookie-cutter story, and had mutliple characters with different personalities and life situations. Oh, but that would have taken actual WORK.Case in point, I can't recommend. It doesn't do well what it sets out to do.			"

												Depression Quest for all its stated aims and intentions doesn't quite achieve what it wished to. Although I applaud the intentions of the development team, the execution fails miserably.Whatever genre/style etc of game you play one of they key focuses is on creating an immersive environment. The first faux pax ""Depression Quest"" commits is to intentionally alienate the player through the constant use of the accusative pronoun ""you"". Being constantly reminded that you are a player and not the game's protagonist means it is increasingly difficult to actually empathise with Alex. This deliberate alienation between player and game actually detracts from the stated aim which is to ""help people understand what it is like to be depressed"". The over-use of the pronoun also makes the game appear to be controlling the action and outcomes, rather than the player. (Alright that's a highly subjective statement so I will clarify it further). When using accusative pronouns, we are telling others what we think about them or what to do. As the only interaction the player can engage in is choosing options, using the accusative makes the game appear as if it is telling us what to do, essentially coding a response, rather than the player having the illusion of control. This is particularly compounded by the fact that the choices are also phrased in the accusative... i.e. ""You choose to stay at home and watch Netflix"". Now the styling of ""Choose your own adventure"" does use the pronoun you, but usually only when asking the player a question. Questions are a direct, overt engagement that break the narrative (and consequently breaks immersion), this isn't necessarily the developers fault, it's a fault of the format, but when juxtaposed against the larger narrative it serves to further alienate the player from the story.The sad thing is this could have been easily overcome by simply rewriting the game as a journal, blog or diary and so switching to the pronoun ""I"". (This is actually a viable option as many counsellors, social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists encourage the keeping of a diary or journal as part of therapy).The writing is tediously unimaginative and dull, and simply fails to hold interest. There is little use of metaphor, simile or any sort of figurative or descriptive language. Now, this may have been a stylistic choice on the part of the writer, Patrick Lindsey, but it doesn't pay off. In other media we have been exposed to vigorous compelling accounts of people who have suffered from Depression, from Woolfe to Wurtzel with Plath inbetween. Lindsey has borrowed nothing from their style and in choosing to create a ""factual"" account has lost the lyricism that allows people to emotionally engage with a piece of writing (or game). Lindsey isn't all bad though, his characterization is consistent and the narrative account is well researched. In fact I can recommend the portrayal of Depression at least. Three of the methods for coping and dealing with Depression are emphasised, the two most obvious are Therapy and Medication (primarily emphasised visually but also within the narrative itself), and the narrative additionally reveals the need for support systems, whether from a close loved one, family or friends. He also manages to note the relapse stages of depression through his characterization, however the game suffers from a lack of dialogue or choices within counselling/therapy. Even when you do opt for the counselling you aren't able to interact with the psychiatrist by giving or receiving information from her, information is only supplied through friend/family/girlfriend interactions. This means that, again the developers have managed to exclude a great deal of important information regarding coping techniques that would have enhanced the game by providing more interactions and improved their narrative discourse to meet their intention of informing people.Visually I presume they wanted to adopt a minimalist style, to better evoke depression. The colours are primarily shades of grey and the background is left a neutral white. The choice of font is similarly plain and clearly legible. In addition a variety of pictures are included to accompany the text, in an attempt to enhance visual appeal as well as serve a function of assisting in a display of how depressed Alex is. This is done by increasing the amount of ""noise"" overlying each picture and the text at the very bottom of the screen when he begins to suffer greater depression and decreases as he returns to an equilibrium state. It's a clever idea and it works fairly well, at least in the case of the pictures. On the text at the bottom of the screen however, it merely serves to distract from readings of the text by annoyingly catching attention in some sort of entoptic diversion. The pictures themselves are at least evocative, and add some much needed emotional colour to what is otherwise a rather drab piece. Now again, Depressed people do suffer from dampened emotions so the choice may have been a stylistic one on the part of the developers, but if you are making a game for non-depressed people to engage with you need to convey lethargy and despondency through your medium which Depression Quest would appear to, intentionally, refuse to do and so fail. The music is suitably doleful, and repetitive, which does assist the atmosphere when reading the story. In fact my response is slightly different to most in that I don't find it annoying, its chords become familiar and in a way reassuring, blurring off into background noise, and not overtly intruding, allowing one to focus on the text. I didn't however notice any substantial change in the music depending on your depression level, in fact it doesn't even tranpose to a ""happier"" key, so I was slightly disappointed there.In conclusion, I applaud the intentions of the game to attempt to recreate what depression is like, however it alienates the player, is riddled with poor design decisions, and utterly fails to capture attention or interest despite being well researched.Instead of playing this go read Viktor Frankl's ""Man's Search for Meaning"" instead.

												The story of this ""game"" is a chunk of life of a cliche-depressed will-less person. Choices given to you are not really choices, because they have almost no impact on the game whatsoever. So it's not really a game.Basically, this is nothing but a trivialized and extremly degenerated modern version of the ""Nausea"" by Jean-Paul Sartre.			"

												According to this game's prerequisites, I, as well as the vast majority of people that I've ever met are officially depressed. Do you procrastinate? Do you think about past events of your life at night? Ever felt weird at a party where you didn't really know anyone? Have no fear fellow snowflake, there is help available in the form of this empathetic masterpiece. ---Real talk though, not even criticising it because of the whole backstory. I genuinely downloaded it wanting to like it; wanting  it to be a misunderstood gem which molded eloquence and painful personal experience into a story which communicated the pain of depression (note: the neurological chemical balance, not mere sadness) to a world which doesn't understand it. I wanted this game to thwart the multitude of self-diagnosed sufferers and create a better understanding for the harsh people who've misunderstood the sickness or mistaken it for weakness. What I found instead was material that will serve only to negatively fuel both parties. It's a relatively small download and free so if there's a level of intrigue regarding the story feel free to pick it up but in terms of being a legitimately worthwhile piece of prose then this ultimately fails.

												This visual novel is remarkable in its singular awfulness. The plot centers around someone suffering from a luxurious, hipster style depression that is ill-defined and capable of being treated with a myriad of different options, such as going to a therapist or taking medication. In addition, the main character is even capable of self-sufficiency and has the expendable income to enjoy going to bars. Many people suffering from depression don't have so many options. Often, they're unable to even go to a therapist due to a crippling lack of funding.However, that's small potatoes compared to the main reason why this game is rubbish:The writing.My God, it's like the entire storyline was nuked from orbit by several adverb nuclear missiles. Reading it was like plodding through brambles full of actually's and probably's only to trip over an awkwardly. Repetitive wording and a ruined flow to the sentence structure makes this a certified mess.What a shame the developers never used a thesaurus. "

												Given the history with this title I will try my absolute best to remain unbiased.The biggest problem with this game is evident from the very beginning, it states it is a interactive non-fiction experience. It isn't, really. There are some very small choices, but they are not impactful and the outcome seems to be the same. There is not even any sort of PSA about how to get help for depression. I am not even sure why this was made. It does not seem to have been created to make awareness about depression, or try to translate the suffering and problems people who have to deal with deep depression have. It just feels like a empty, lifeless and non descript choose your own adventure game, except your choices are limited and the adventure consists of watching netflix and having awkward conversations with relatives and friends. Oh, well I also got a cat, but that really did not do much.This is a empty, soulless experience, that paints a psychiatric issue over this shell of a ""game"" with sub par writing and inconclusive storytelling. There is no value gained from this, no new knowledge is found from depression, and no one with depression will gain any help from this.This is a poor attempt at a interactive novel, and a worse attempt at creating depression awareness.

												Personal Rating: 3/10As someone who has suffered from depression before, I can tell you up front that this is no way a good way to portray depression. The guy in the story seems to have his♥♥♥♥♥♥sorted out. Girlfriend, job, house, family and so on. The way you progress through the game is just to keep on picking certain options until you finish.I always picked the options that were right, going to see a therapist, tablets and so on. This is not how it works. The ending I got seems to think that he just brushes it off as if it was nothing. Depressed people can not just say, ""Well, tablets are good. I'm fine now."" I don't think the creator of this game really knew what depression really is because it's nothing like the game.A nit-picky thing is the title. Depression Quest is a stupid name. It sounds like you're on a quest for depression. However, where the game flops in it's main purpose. It flourshies, sort of, in it's writing. It's very detailed and the multiple choice answers are there and will make you think. Do I want to go to a party even if I don't want to go? Or do I stay in and play with my cat?But these all seems pointless when the main part of the game, the depression, is so quickly glanced over and easily dealt with. It's as if the game thinks depression is like stubbing your toe, you get a bit hurt, shout a little in anger, then continue your day as normal.I can't reccomend this game when it's one purpose fails.

												Oh wow. So, like almost everybody else, I've heard about this thanks to all the controversy surrounding Zoe Quinn and I went into it quite negatively biased. Anyway, I wanted to see what all this fuss was about and I'll try to sum up my thoughts as objectively as I can in this post.So, with all that out of the way, is Depression Quest a good game? First of all, it's not much of a game. It's done in the classic choose-your-own-adventure style, but it's not done very well. Your choices don't affect the main course of the game very much - they mostly just affect your character's status.Generally you just get a wall of text and a few options (which options you get depends on your character's status) and you choose one of them. This may cause a change in your character's status, e.g. it can make you more or less depressed. Then you get another wall of text which is a reaction to you choice and then you move on to the next event.And that's it. Most of the game follows exactly this formula and you shouldn't expect any extensive branching - there isn't any. The only change is right at the very end, and that's simply not enough. The other problem is that it's quite easy to get a good ending - just pick the choices that make your character actually DO something. And of course it's equally easy to get a bad ending - just pick the choices that make your character do nothing. Usually the choices are even ordered from good to bad, so you really don't need to think about them too much. Unfortunately all the above means that there is not much replay value. You may go through the game two or three times just to be able to read the different endings, but you really will not be reading all the stuff before that.Technically the game is alright. Although for some weird reason it has to run in three processes which in total use more than a hundred megs of RAM. I guess it's got something to do with the fact that the game is using Webkit. There's a graphical glitch when the text is shorter than what fits on your screen, but that doesn't cause any problems.There are a few typographical mistakes, but nothing serious (there will probably be more mistakes in this post than there are in the game :P). I haven't noticed any bad grammar or misspellings.What is kind of annoying is the sound. Basically, it's just a single repeating piano track which gets boring quite fast. There are some ambient noises for some of the events but nothing major.And finally we get to the last part. This game obviously deals with depression, which is quite a strong emotional theme. So, did I feel depressed when playing this? Not exactly, although it did show me how a person with depression might feel - or at least I think so.All in all it's not a great game. The mechanics are weak and the depression part just doesn't do it for me, but that is most likely subjective. Finally, I do feel that it doesn't deserve all the publicity it's getting, but hey, at least it's free.tl;dr: I felt more depressed when I couldn't find the bloody keys in Doom. "

												This is all really,really bad.First off, I bear no hatred for Zoe Quinn as I don't know much about the situation she's in (something about Five Guys I guess). I am only reviewing her game, Depression Quest...which sucks.This game is supposed to simulate a depressed person's actions and how they affect those close to him. However, instead of leaving it to the player's imagination about how he feels, the narrator constantly shove emotions down your throat (Ex: ""You feel depressed. You have nowhere to go""). The characters are dry and one-dimensional. Not much thought was put into them. The music tries to sound sad but in the end it becomes monotonous and annoying to hear after half an hour. All in all I cannot find a single redeeming factor in ""Depression Quest"". It is the first novel-type game game I've played, and that's not a good thing. If people didn't like Ms. Quinn because of this game, it would be perfectly understandable.This game recieves 1 out of 10 Spoony Points.			"

It claims to give people a look into the life of a depressed person. This is problematic for 2 reasons:1. Many people suffer from it differently.2. Depression isn't just being sad, something this game horribly portrays. Being depressed is more like feeling nothing at all.This game is horribly written, and I couldn't stop cringing at some of the dumbest lines I have ever seen in a video game (if you can even call this a game. There is hardly ever choices that you can make anyways as it takes away half or more of the options, it is pretty much just a book). This game is essentially the tumblr retard's view of being depressed.I only even played it just to see how awful it really was. Was not disappointed there.			"

												Alright, gonna try to actually write an honest review here.My personal opinion? This game is garbage. Most of it felt like filler and there really was no motivation to read the filler. The story was boring and really didn't leave a lasting impression on me. I literally stuck it out just so I could say I got through it.As a game, this thing falls flat on its face. The interface feels like it was ripped directly from a blogging website, and I'm not usually one to whine about graphics. The best choices are glaringly obvious, and better yet, crossed out. I did notice in the pages of filler that the author provided a ""suitable explanation"" for the crossed out options. The rest of the choices, as far as I can tell, have no effect on the storyline at all. There is no reason to finish this game besides to say ""I finished"". I can't reccomend this to anyone. It's dull.Quick edit here: If this were a book, I wouldn't have read it. Wouldn't have even skimmed the contents, so I can't REALLY review this game fairly. Regardless, I still cannot reccomend this game to my friends.			"

												I want to start off by saying I do not have depression and that I have heard a lot of negative things about this game and how it's not really a game etc.But.This game, is a game. It does involve choices and a story and somewhat of a level of immersion, now as a game it doesn't really deliver any sort of exposition to the player, it just sort of expects you to pick up on it, which kind of confused me near the beginning, I had questions about who my character was? if it was supposed to be me or someone I'm playing? I also was slightly confused with the cast of characters because of the gender neutral names and the lack of any true back story. So as a game this has a few flaws but the story is not one that's bad, the way its told is not bad, the difficulty is extremely easy but, I don't really see the game as something that is about winning, it seems to be more about experiencing depression through the eyes of this character. I honestly believe this game shouldn't have as much flak as it's getting, I will probably start a discussion to further my opinions on this game because its so.... currently noted.So now the standard game rating:Story: 7/10 (Its a story and its not really explained well, there are some branching sort of choices but all together its very short but well written.)Gameplay: X/10 (Text adventure things don't really count for gameplay, all of them have choices and reading, you don't add anything to that normally. Its not bad, but it cannot be rated.)Presentation: 8/10 (It wasn't just a webpage or something like that, but it wasn't fancy at all either. I like how it mixes everything together well, although that's fairly simple for a game this short.)Soundtrack: 7/10 (It fits, it ships, but it is annoying as ♥♥♥♥.)Replayability: 0/10 (Plain and simple I'm not coming back to this game, it was good for one round, maybe two and since its free the replayabilty isn't that much of a factor anyway.)As a game, it's free, it's not the game that I want to play on a saturday night, nor any other day, for that reason I'm giving it a thumbs down as a GAME. In an informational/emotional way, this game is worth playing if you're curious, or maybe if you have depression.			"

												This is not a game. It's hardly even a ""text based adventure"". It consists of reading walls of average-at-best text and choosing from a few different options. Depending on previous choices, you can get to a point where there isn't any choice at all- every option but one is crossed out. I guess the developers were trying to represent the lack of motivation that can come with depression, but when your attempt to simulate depression results in 20 minutes of clicking through boring pages of text, you've done something wrong. After playing through this ""game"", I just found myself angry and offended. It claims to try to help people without depression understand what people with it go through, but all it really accomplishes is making people with depression look lazy, completely unmotivated and utterly incapable of making any good decisions to improve their situation. I have depression. It does make you feel like crap, it can destroy your motivation. What it doesn't do is prevent you from trying to get help. When one of the characters gave the protagonist the phone number for a therapist and my only option was to crumple up the note and throw it away, I just sat in silence. That's the main problem with this garbage (aside from the fact that it's a boring piece of junk)- it portrays what I can only assume is one of the developers' experience with depression as what all sufferers go through. Maybe their depression makes them just sit around and watch Netflix to distract themselves from their crippling lack of motivation and sadness, but mine doesn't. Every case is different, and frankly, I find this game insulting to anyone who does suffer from depression. It's an insulting, patronizing chore with a poorly thought out choice system and subpar writing. If you want to learn about and understand depression, go look it up on Wikipedia or a mental health website. This garbage isn't worth anybody's time.			"

												You'd expect that a text-based game would at least have good writing. Assuming this was solely written to raise awareness of depression, it completely failed to portray a sympathetic or empathetic view of the people who suffer from it. The protagonist was a completely unlikeable self-absorbed whiny jerk with a successful life and tons of friends and family who loved him. It became so irritating that I started purposely trying to make him kill himself. Nope, even though the only gameplay mechanic in this game is the whole choose-your-own-adventure multiple-choice system, your choices don't matter at all, and the game pretty much tells you what must happen regardless of what you want. So, no, I couldn't make the protagonist kill himself. That made me sad.UPDATE: Since Steam intervened and my review is no longer falsely flagged as ""abusive"" by the developer, I can finally edit it and add one last thing. If any of you are interested in playing a video game that revolves around depression, try The Cat Lady or Neverending Nightmares instead. They both handle the subject in a very mature manner without sacrificing content.			"

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because your game gave me cancer anyway. "

												I'm pretty sure the creator of this game has no realistic perception of depression. The ideas that I came across in this game were ♥♥♥♥ing pathetic and the decisions you can make (if not forced) are not entirely realistic or wise when you are in that state of mind. I am personally infruriated by this game as it trivialises something as invasive as depression. A path which I, personally, have lost someone to, and something I (almost) lost myself to once. If you want a game with a more legitimate grasp on the subject of depression play something like Neverending Nightmares or Until Dawn.If you think you are suffering with depression, I implore you to talk to your GP. If they believe you are suffering from depression you will be sent to a hospital for treatment (in my experience). If you are experiencing suicidal thoughts you will most likely stay in hospital for several weeks. Another route is by contacting Healthy Minds, and NHS-run program which has helped me get in touch with some valuable people and continue, to this day, to help me understand my own mental health.

												As someone who suffers from depression for over 10 years (and counting, since at least for me, it isn’t something that can be “cured”; sometimes it “goes away”, but it always comes back. It finds its way home and crawls back, even with proper medication/therapy/love/whatever. It’s not that simple, some people might be “cured”, but it’s definitely not the same for everyone else. It’s a constant thing in a person’s life, it appears when you less expect), I felt that this game was not real. First, I felt that the MC was suffering from the effects of depression beginning to grow. But having choices literally locked because apparently “you can’t do that” made me angry. People can TRY to do those things even tho they are depressed! Locking the options was a terrible thing in my opinion, leading the MC to an endless spiral of unworthy feelings, when I actually wanted to help them. This kills the concept of the game, which was supposed to be interactive and you could attempt to make the MC get help.Character development wasn’t good either. MC was too plain, I couldn’t feel any sympathy for them, same for the other characters. This could have been a decent/good game (I honestly believe that), but it’s not.Please don’t treat this subject like a superficial aspect. I know this wasn’t meant to be a “happy game”, but it’s not that simple.			"

												Wow.This is shockingly bad.Oh and there will be spoilers but believe me, you shouldnt care.Pros:Music and sound are interesting. I like the effects they used to create some of the things you hear in this game.That is it.ConsWhat is with the crossed out choices? I understand someone depressed (or just anti social) might not want to do those things but they dont add anything to the game. They just make it more obvious that there is little to no choice involved.One second the girlfriend tells me shes going to ""stick by my side"" and next she is trying her best to get out of the situation. Look I know that it is hard to write all these outcomes but PLEASE have some continuity!VerdictPointlessDon't waste your time!			"

												Depression Quest is an interactive narrative with a set goal: to try to help people who haven’t experienced depression understand what it’s like for the sufferer. However, throughout my time with the narrative, I couldn’t focus as much on the goal of the story because of the poor implementation of the game design itself.You play as an unnamed character who struggles with depression that progressively gets more burdensome as the game goes on. The goal of using an unnamed character was probably to put the player in the character’s shoes, but for me, it only served to give me no real connection to the character. In the first few pages of the game, when the character is introduced, there are various links to other pages that explain some of the context for future situations. One, for example, is described as “a project you’ve been working on,” but since it doesn’t go into detail, the player loses a connection with the character that could’ve been more personal. At the end of a long section of pages, when the character needs to make a decision, there are a few different options, with the first always crossed out—the next few will continually be crossed out as the depression worsens. This option is clearly supposed to show what the character could do, if not for the depression, but instead it just distracts from the actual possible choices and the player finally picks something to just get past the page.The music and overall design of each page also leaves the player feeling bored and uninterested. The supposedly “sad” piano music is distracting from the text, and the page itself, being a static, gray affair, doesn’t do much—if anything—to hold the player’s attention and keep them focused on the story. The status buttons below decision options are also static, with a poor font choice, and slightly distract the player from the options available. Another problem is that you cannot stop playing and pick back up where you left off. For a game with such a bland, boring interface, not having this option makes the player even less likely to want to work back through the game, if they have to stop playing for some reason. Overall, this game could have been much better, if it had been designed to better keep and hold the player’s attention. As it is, there are too many distracting things going on and not enough draw to the story to keep the player interested and caring about the outcome.			"

												While the creators have the sense to acknowledge that all depressions are different, this does not sound like depression. The biggest problem this game has is completely preventing you from doing the 'best' choices.Depression is not like that.If you are depressed, doing the 'best' thing is hard, but not impossible.If the options were running, the 'best' option would be running twice as far as any other option.Harder, requiring more effort, not impossible. They do, however, often feel impossible.This game tries to represent depression, and to does so poorly. This game shows what a person who has never had depression, but has done some background research on it, would think depression is like. The reviews left on the main site feel forced, because the reviewers may have feared being accused of misogyny, and do not accurately reflect the actual game. But I digress.This game portrays depression as nearly a hopeless spiral of constant self loathing and negativity. Which never leaves your mind naturally.That isn't what depression is like, it implies that depressed people cannot be happy at all.It couldn't be more wrong			"

												As someone who has struggled with depression since early adolescence, and witnessed persons with far greater afflictions than myself… this game is borderline offensive. While I applaud the attempt to address mental health, something that is arguably lacking in modern media in general, this is a momentous failure. This choose your own adventure-esque game tries to confront depression through poor storytelling, artificially constricted choice, and lack of understanding of depression. The absence of quality is unbelievable. Mental conditions cannot be simulated - any attempt to do so is totally misguided. Believing that understanding illness can be imparted through such ridiculously removed circumstances is, in layman's terms, the pinnacle of stupidity. You might as well create a Lower Respiratory Infection Quest, as it would allow the gamer to arrive at no more greater understanding of contracting a potentially lethal disease, than would Depression Quest impart knowledge of undergoing a potentially lethal mental condition. 1/10 "

This game got dreadfully boring fast. More and better information can be accessed on wikipedia and would be more interesting to read too.I know this is supposed to put you in the shoes of someone living with depression but I feel like this scenario could of been executed in a better way than a lazily put together text based game.I feel guilty for not really giving it that much of a chance but it seems like more of a chore to read than anything and is not engaging to the player at all.

												This game is an accomplishment when it took 8 minutes for me to declare its a bad game since it gives a black and white view on depression by disabling certain options implying that people with depression can pick those options, not going into the darker side of depression like commiting suicide but besides its failure to not address depression this game is boring because the music can cause headaches and feels forced along with the fact the pictures shown in the game do not vary or have nothing to do with the scenario. Finally, this is not a game it is just a interactive e-book about depression and the only positives is that it is short, free, and has a quick download time but I don't think thats worth getting this game.

I tried to take actions that represent a person who wants to get better, but almost always said actions were crossed out in red.

												As a person who suffers from depression and has to deal with the hardships on a day to day basis I can honestly say that I am offended that this title is trying to say that it recreates such difficulties in any way. The writing barely skims over daily challenges, makes it seem like therapy and medication are miracle cures, and that depression is just easily overcome. Yes, at the end of the story it says some fluff about this being a lifelong struggle, but the story never delvs into anything more than superficially. It feels as though the warnings of possible triggers were only put in place so that persons who actually suffer from this condition don't see this and point out how absolutely flawed it is.Putting the subject matter aside, I am offended that this somehow managed to get through Steam's Greenlight program when so many great games do not. This is arguably a game, and it fails on all accounts even when it comes to interactive fiction. The audio is abysmal, coming across as annoying more than saddening, what little graphics are present are blurry and come across more as product placements, and the interactivity is so minute that I felt the need to write this review to get the value from my time spent. Depression Quest should be avoided, removed from Steam, and the developers should be scolded for ever releasing it.			"

												I heard about this game from all of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that last few days revolving around its creator.  I was diagnosed with severe depression in high school and went though several anti-depressants and therapists. I'm now in my last semester of college and all is going well but High School was rough on me but mostly on my family.  So, I was thinking that I could possibly be able to relate to this game because of my past experiences.  I could not, this is not a good representation of depression and it is not a good representation of video games, hell it isn't even a game.  Ok, so what is the game?  It is a text based adventure where you are given a set of text and then have to choose a reponse based on that.  These response are in the form of hypertext and this could basically be a webpage and there would be no difference.  Whatever, the actualy gameplay is bland but it is text based, what would you expect?My core issue here lies in the representation of depression and the way the ""adventure"" is set up.  So it starts you as a depressed person with not much context as to how you got there.  Then, it throws you in with a cast of characters who seem  to want to help you but no matter what I did my character was constantly in a downward spiral.  It seemed like the creator was under the impression that a depressed person can only be helped by therapy and SSRI's (anti-depressants).  This game perpuates the idea (which is wrong) that all depression can be fixed with drugs and that all depression is basically the same.  This is anything but though truth, there are thousands of factors that can influence depression.  Diet, excersize, lack of vitamin D, getting a blood test to test for lack of SERT (serotonin transporters), or drug abuse.  You do not have the option to explore any of these.  No, you are on a downward spiral and you can't get help to get better.  It is a terrible representation of depression because depression is something that simply can't be represented in a video game.There are reasons that doctors spent years and years studying depression and mental illnesses because there are millions of factors and millions of solution and possiblities.  This game is not just an embarrassment to video games but to people who are unlucky enough to suffer from depression and or anxiety.  How this game got past greenlight simply blows my mind.  I can not recommend this game at all, to anyone.  If you are suffering from depression, know this, there is help and there are people out there who care about you.  I was lucky enough to have my parents and they are the the primary reason I graduated highschool and made my way into college.  Please to remember,  It gets better, I promise.			"

												Despite the controversy surrounding this game, I was very interested in trying it out. As someone who has had (maybe even still dealing with) depression, I was excited to see its entry into the gaming world. Unfortunately, I found I was troubled by the image of depression that this game offers, and I have to wonder if this could do more harm than good. It didn't feel as if the person the player is controlling is even a person. I felt like I was wheeling a wooden plank through a series of rooms, so lacking in personality or any distinguishable features that I found myself bored, and struggling to read the text that was telling me how I was 'feeling'. It worries me that the person this game is portraying is dull, boring, robotic. While some ambiguity and vagueness is needed in order for any player to put themselves in the character's shoes, I felt like that vagueness was taken to a point where we can no longer truly care for the character. I was also troubled by the lack of options. As someone who has experienced depression, I know that there are times where it feels like options are limited. But people don't express depression in the same way. I have been the person that, despite feeling like death inside, I went out, feigned happiness. I went out and did things, even if I wasn't being honest with people, and that was part of my problem. That was something I had to deal with for years, giving the appearance I was happy and healthy, when I wasn't. I was disappointed to find that so many of the options I'd have chosen, the options that would make sense to not just me, but probably many other people just trying to survive, and maintain the life one has, were just simply crossed out, as if the mere thought of doing such a thing was preposterous. I couldn't help but feel just a bit insulted by that. That my experience was an impossibility. So no, I would not recommend this game. Not to my friends, not to people who have never experienced depression, and most definitely not to others who have gone through what this game tries desperately to depict.			"

												I feel a bit bad for having to say this but. . .this isn't a game. It isn't even really a realistic account of someone with depression. I've grappled with it for some time and as of this review things seem to keep getting worse. I've lost practialy everything from loved ones to transportation and most recently a job. To say that I am about as low as I can get might be the biggist understatment since Lady Godiva walked into her stable and said she had absolutly nothing to ware. I tried to play this ""game"" out as I would in real life, I've seen profecionals and even tried medication, however in the end this ""game"" told me that I should be on the mend. I can attest I am not. I think it might have made me focus on my problems even more, because it's telling me things should get better. If you're going to make a text based ""choose your own ending"" type game you must give the player the option of choosing their own adventure. Locking off answers and simply saying ""You'll never NOT be depressed"" is frankly the antithisis of gaming. If the developer is baseing this senario off of a personal story then I'm happy to see that they may have a light at the end of their tunel, but in the end Depression Quest just reminded me that the light. . .is sometimes a train.

												This game isn't bad because Zoe Quinn is female. This game is bad because Zoe Quinn obviously has no idea what depression is like, has obviously never actually suffered from depression, and clearly shouldn't be writing about a mental illness she has no experience with. I understand you want your social justice bleeding heart liberal points, Zoe Quinn, but please, try and write about what you know, instead of making up nonsense about what you don't. As someone who has actually been suffering from depression for most of my life, I find this game to be incredibly offensive and insensitive to people with actual depression. The fact that you used Robin William's death as a platform for publicity for your game is even more incredibly offensive and insensitive. I don't mind if you keep making video games in the future, but at least try to do so with some actual ethical and intellectual integrity in the future.

												This game was supposedly made to show people with depression that you're not alone, and many others have it too. It was also made to show people who don't have depression what it's like.I think you completely and utterly failed to show any of that, and if anything, made me more depressed. The writing was fine, and it wasn't too boring. But it was painly short and completely annoying. What's the point in having choices if you can't pick them? Although this is supposed to simulate ""your depression,"" no choice is truly impossible. Anyone who is depressed, even ""profoundly,"" can pick up the phone and call a therapist.The only thing I liked about this was the cat. Nice try, but I think you failed to get your point across. Although I did not like this game, you should at least try it and see what you think. Opinions vary based upon how touchy you are about depression and anxiety. If you are touchy, like I am, I wouldn't even think about getting this game.			"

												After playing once through, all I can say is depression quest is not worth any amount of time you might want to put into it or think it might be worth. Depression quest does nothing but allow you to read a fantastical, robotically written story of a young man just having a rough patch in his journey through life, something people have run into since the dawn of time. This ""Game"" (which in all meanings of the word it is not) does not inform, enlighten or resolve any questions a viewer may have about depression.			"

												I have read some articles with arguements and counter arguements on this game. So I decided to have a go, maybe only because the counter-arguements were developed in such a juvenile attitude. First of all, as a person who suffered depression couple of times in his life, this game fails to describe the emotions and perception of every day life of a depressed person. It repetitively tells that you are exhausted, tired, nothing to keep you going but when it comes to the actual feelings that depression creates, it is possible to say narration and description in the game is quite bland and dull. If you want to know how depression actually feels, you can always listen to People Are Strange from The Doors.Also I don't think that this game should be on Steam. As an educative tool on internet, it might help some people but here, it probably won't. If you want to tell a story about a depressed person, do it in the way Telltale Games does, if you want to explore the depths of a human mind, do it in the way Psychonauts does, do you want to express the perception of every day life in depression, get some ideas from Quantic Dreams (or even Max Payne) this is not the way how you can accomplish these with a ""game"" on Steam. Considering they are in the same genre, the Commodore64 game Alter-Ego is still so much better than this so called game.As I said above, be helpful to people, it's a good cause. Seriously. But please don't call this a game. The right definition you're looking for is ""interactive educative tool.""P.S.: Most of the people writing reviews on this game here have the intellect of a pile of manure. You cannot judge a product of a person with his or her sex and love life. You have no right to judge a person's sex and love life. Get on with your lives, because seems like you're not doing anything to contribute to the society. Even manure fertilizes the land, but I think most of you aren't even able to fertilize your own hands.Kind Regards,Barricadas			"

												Alright, so despite the controversy... how upset should people be? I mean, it's not like we are paying money to experience this.Now while this started off somewhat relateable it slowly drifted into not so much. the fact that the character is in a relationship, has a much different job and a sibling already alienated me.To feel more relateable, perhaps start with some saught of survey about your details such as if you are single?, your living situation etc. and build off that, be unique to each different player so they can feel connected.I liked the idea that some of the options were crossed out, as they appeared as thoughts in your mind that you may have wanted to say/do but couldn't, but as i started seeing things i actually would have done be crossed out, i felt even more disconencted still. This got increasingly frustrating as at times all but one answer was crossed out.However,this can an interesting read and if more unique to the 'player'. Could have been something quite more interesting. As of now however, i cant imagine many % of people can relate perfectly to this character, which is what is needed to feel the most forfilled out of this experience.			"

												To be completely honest, I have (knowingly) lived with depression for over 10 years. I deliberately ignored the warning to see what this ""game"" had to offer. Long story short, I had a really bad breakdown and then I decided to go to therapy. So there was some benefit to me playing this.If you have depression, this is nowhere near accurate because, even at my suicidal worst, I was still able to make myself do things. The best ending in the scenario presented isn't necessarily the right one in real life. Medication doesn't work for everybody, there are therapists who are motivated solely by money and, in my case, people aren't always understanding of what you're going through. However, like others have said, you're not alone in the end.If you don't have depression, the same inaccuracy applies, but I will say that it can offer some insight into what depression is. There are still a lot of people who think it's a choice/lifestyle. I think DQ busted that myth just fine, but it's not always evident when someone is depressed and there is a spectrum of kinds of depression. There isn't always consistency with depression. Believe it or not, we have good days too. In the end, Depression Quest was a bit of an eye-opener for me personally. YMMV, but don't expect all the answers to be here. "

												""Depression Quest is an interactive fiction game where you play as someone living with depression.""Releasing this ""interactive fiction game"" made me feel very profound of disapproval, in a way that cannot be explained.No doubt, that this fanfiction-like novel, is written very poorly.I have no problem about fanfiction novels, at all. But what troubles me is that the ""novel"", I repeat, to be written poorly.I hate how depression the portrayal of depression, in the ""novel"", is terrible.Depression should not be described as negative thought, as it is caused by the action of thinking, resulted by lethargy.Do not blame the ""social-cycle"" or anything related to that, it's an individual matter.I recommend reading works by Samuel Beckett, Yusuf Atilgan and of course Franz Kafka.

												If you are depressed, do not touch this ""game.""If you are suicidal, do not touch this game.If you have a history of depression, do not touch this game.If you've been depressed in the past but think, ""Hey, I'm doing quite well. My life is pretty well-balanced these days and I haven't been suicidal in a couple of years. I can probably handle reading some silly Depression Quest diary entires,"" DO NOT TOUCH THIS GAME.If you relate to any of the above, please note that Depression Quest is little more than a huge pile of depression triggers.I gave this game two chances. I first checked out the website and then the game here on Steam. I spent over two hours going through different options.The writing itself is mediocre. The decisions you make from one encounter to the next have some impact on what happens next, but not a whole lot, other than determining if the protagonist gets more or less depressed. The more depressed, the less likely the character will be able to dig himself out, reach out to friends or otherwise seek help.For a resource focused primarily on text, it sure has a LOT of typos.If you are someone interested in reading the diary of a depressed person, Depression Quest may be for you. If you are having trouble communicating with a depressed loved one, perhaps this can be useful to gain some insight into your loved one's mind.However, do not bother installing this through Steam. Just look up the web site. They're EXACTLY THE SAME.			"

												I'm severely cynical of all sides in the recent social justice craze. Individuals must be objectively judged for there to be true justice, regardless of their stance on (insert prejudice or cause here), and hopping on a indignation hype train is not the way to do it.Criticism of the development staffmembers involved aside, there is some good information to be had from this project. Do I believe it belongs on Steam? No. Do I believe it could potentially assist the general public with becoming more educated about ""depression"" as a whole? Sure.It feels disingenuous to call this a game, when it's more like an after-school special, or a pamphlet you'd find at a clinic. Having had to live with and help many people in my life come to terms with and work through their issues, I understand exactly the message trying to be conveyed, but also fully understand that the only people who would benefit from a run or two through this ""story"" are practically non-existent: simultaneously open-minded and ignorant.A person with depression doesn't need this to understand depression, because they live it. A person who deals with depression in others doesn't need this to understand depression, because they live(d) with it.A person who honestly believes depression is not a real illness doesn't understand depression, and this won't convince them otherwise.This belongs on a website, which I believe was its original form. It must be easily and publicly accessible, and distributed, to be truly effective. I recommend talking about depression to raise awareness, but can't recommend this on Steam because it (and mental illness) isn't a game.			"

												Depression Quest has stirred up quite the controversy and has already received many negative reviews as well as a lot of troll reviews that are to be honest hilarilously funny. I was really tempted to write a troll review myself but I'll try to give a honest review here. Im aware that it is highly debatable if Depression Quest qualifies as a game or not but I will at times refer to it as ""the game"" and to the act of using it as ""playing"". I don't want to scratch the topic if it's a game or not but I'll use those words for convenience.In Depression Quest you play as a person with depression trying to manage daily life. The game is fairly minimalistic and basically looks like a website with white background and some gifs. It can be controlled with the mouse or suprisingly with a gamepad. Depression Quest plays like a ""choose your own adventure""-book. You basically read a short story and sometimes get to choose from a set of options to determine how the story continues. The problem is that despite the advertising there is not much to choose from here. Some people complain that many of the options are crossed out and not selectable. However, I think that is actually getting the point of knowing what the right thing to do is while being unable to do it across. Depression Quest portrays depression and it does not do a particularly bad job at it but it is all that it does. It does not offer any way out, what is depressing in itself. If that was the point of it then it works out well but I think that there should be more to it. As it stands Depression Quest does work as an art project but has severe shortcomings in the game department. The writing is not great but is does its job. It just feels too clichéd at times. During the first minute it almost put me off immediately though because it comes with a trigger warning. Also it describes the protagonist as a ""human being"" instead of specifying the gender or just using ''you''. The problem is that the developer apparently forgot about that part immediately. For the rest of the game it is clear that the player character is in fact male. I really wonder what the original point was then.I would not recommend Depression Quest to anybody who is actually suffering from depression or anybody not interested in the topic. If you want to get a basic understanding of the way people with depression think it's worth a look though. However, I say that only because it is free. If it would cost actual money I would advise you to stay away from it.Depression Quest is not completely horrible but below average and has next to no target audience. To a certain degree it does what it was set out to do. What it does is however not for everyone, even among the expected target audience. Some people with living depression may share similar experiences to those depicted in the game, others won't at all. If you want to play a simplistic game that explores the human condition you are better off with Papers, Please since that game does not simply describe a situation but presents you with a moral dilemma and communicates its message through actual gameplay. As for Depression Quest... it takes no advantage of the medium at all.More reviews here "

												This ""game"" is nothing more than a point and response game, reading a sub-par persons story dealing with depression.I think I can speak for most people when I say this game is absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's no different than the free browser based game originally made and the only gameplay you get is responding to questions. This is not to be used to try to sympathize to someone with Depression, nor is it a tool in understanding depression. This is a♥♥♥♥♥♥text game that trys to convey a♥♥♥♥♥♥generic plot and fails at doing so.Everyone going into this obviously wants to have the best outcome. The only negatives you get is if you just choose all the most negative responses regardless, it locks the most obvious postive choices from being picked. Even if you are depressed, and even if you are SEVERLY depressed, you can still CHOOSE to do things that will bring you up, even if for a moment. I know I sure as♥♥♥♥♥♥have done so.Now with that out of the way, theres nothing stopping you from picking everything ""right"" from the git-go. Therefore, it's not realistic in its message at all because you seemingly ""fight"" your depression extremely easily in what seems like a 4 min game.There's not substance. Your supposed to ""care"" about your outcome, but nothing happens because of no visulization. The characters are cringe-worthy, and the story is absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing generic.This game paints people with depression as unlikeable ♥♥♥♥s that are completely useless. I'd like to quote from another reviewer on here, Judge Holden. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------""This game goes out of its way to display depressed people as utterly unlikeable people, unable to think for themselves and dependent on the most superficial of things to be able to carry on with their normal lives. People currently struggling with anhedonia or depression will most likely see themselves meta-scrutinizing their own lives from a new perspective because of this game, should they not know any better. People who have never struggled with depression could easily learn to see depressed people as useless, oversensitive lumps -- exactly the way that this portrays it.If there were like at least either still shots of things happening, maybe I'd care more, but I wouldn't even care if the first option I was presented with was to kill myself. I'd off the character and turn the game off right then and there.""--------------------------------------------------------------------------There's absolutely nothing outside of this mediocre story besides the feeling of boredomness you get.Also, about Zoe Quinn:Zoe Quinn is an insane ♥♥♥♥nut that believes being trolled by people = getting ptsd. She's like the brain dead Anita Sarkeesian, except she lied about the♥♥♥♥♥♥in the first place, calling the supposed website that bullied her ""lame man-children"". and ""virgin pedophiles"".proof she lied http://imgur.com/a/4VOcxPeople like her want to censor the internet because some things people say hurt her feelings. I hate to tell you, but Steam's has already enforced a form of censoreship in censoring words. I wish neo-feminazis would get it through their skulls that not everyone in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed world agrees with their absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t ideolgy of placing themselves higher than other people.She censored people from criticizing her game, and then talks about how censorship is unjust. She is a hypocrite, and among everything, a lying sack of♥♥♥♥♥♥ THE ONLY REASON this game got on Steam, is because she slept with not 1, not 2, but 5 DIFFERENT ♥♥♥♥ING GAMING JOURNALISTS.

												I would not recommend this game for a variety of reasons:1) The game is very uninteresting. Each page, if you wanna call it that, is literally a long story. I'd have no problem with this if this were a book or some other medium, but there really is no gameplay, something that could potentially really connect you with the feeling the game is trying to show.2) The game seems to show a rather extreme side of depression where everything is doom and gloom. I won't contest this as being a real life possibility, but it would seem that a greater impact could be given if there was a build up, a slow, gripping build up that led to the intial level of depression seen in the game. Then maybe it could show how bad and dangerous depression can really get if left untreated.3) The person behind this game, Zoe Quinn, is a total hack in the industry. Based on evidence compiled around the internet by actual legitimate sources, she has done nothing but produce sympathy toward herself through falsehoods and fake outrage. Tack on to this the fact that she somehow has several journalists and indie developers in her pocket, presumably because of the fact she has dated them and then used this to her advantage by getting positive coverage of her out and then destroying any negative coverage, be it legitimate or not, just goes to show how corrupt♥♥♥♥♥♥can get. I do not recommend this game. If it were remade with some better design choices, it may be a great way to show the effects of depression to others and help people who have depression. But with its current state, and the fact that it really only exists to further Zoe Quinn's agenda, it is a sure pass.			"

												Although the game creates a frame through which the player can easily see the impact depression has on its protagonist, I found the delivery to be dull and its theme too pushy. The game lacks narrative drive. Although I understand the game wanting to be authentic to how depression affects people in their day-to-day lives, the struggles of waking up, following routine, etc were boring. Maybe in that sense, the game works. I was too disinterested and disconnected with the character to care about pushing through. I do think the theme is important, but I do not feel like this game is a strong example for how games can capture an experience. I would like to see the theme handled with greater mastery of the medium and narrative.			"

												After playing this game its obvious the author doesn't actually understand depression at all. Its not just feeling down and being tired all the time. The main aspect of it is how your thoughts can turn something positive into something negative. And how you outlook on life shapes and manipulates your thinking. The game looks and appears to be a nothing better than a shotty year 1 game dev project. I'd give it a D-.Defiently not worth your time or bandwidth.			"

												i dont know why anyone would bother with this game, it is bassicly a short story. A poorly written short story. it claims a purpose but completely miss it, would have been easy to make a point system, that could illustrate how being normal in that situation takes a toll on the person with depression, but instead you were lazy and just crossed out options. The game is bassicly just writting, honestly seen powerpoint presentations that were more stimulating than this game. Yes i get that it was not meant to be visually appealing but even then it was underwhelming. All it got is writting, but the writting is poorly done and flawed, why is the introduction to the story done so that you are genderless, both partner and you, but during the story the girlfriend gets a gender all of the sudden.  it was made a game why? would be a better story if you just told it the way you wanted it. why bother with framing it in a game when its clearly just a blog.so in clossing it is poorly made, the story is flawed and not very immersive or captivating. Feel like there would be tumblr blogs that would trump this game.			"

												I think this is the most pointless piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥game in the Steam Library. I'd compare it to Big Rigs but at least Big Rigs had more than boring depressing text.Not only is it short-lived but it depicts depressed individuals as lazy, unproductive and unconsolable individuals that can only be helped with medication.I understand why the maker got all this hatred now. This is one of the stupidest things I've ever downloaded on Steam.Advice: Don't even bother. Not only is it pointless, but it's also insulting.  Nothing but a stupid cheating attention ♥♥♥♥♥ that posts nudes on the internet.Edit: Got banned from the forum boards for criticizing the game and the developper. MASS-Censorship on the boards. Typical feminists trying to label everyone calling them out on BS as ""misogyny"". Ugh. Can't believe 7-8 years ago I was proud of the ""feminist"" label.			"

The character in this story is simply don't want to do anything, he is sleeping all the time, ignoring social contact and has a unfinished project that he can’t spend time anymore. When he gets back home from his day job he is tired and wants to sleep till next morning. So what? Human bodies get tired after 8-9 hr of work. This guy has a mother, a girl friend alex (who is quite understanding) and a day job that pays. This guy also do regular things such as dating etc..I don’t think there is anything here that qualifies as a Major depression.  "

												From my perspective of the gameplay, this is an interactive story. I don't think it should have been greenlit as a game. It's unfathomable to me that so many actual indie GAME developers were passed by for a story.What I'm also seeing from other reviews is that this interactive story was crutched through the greenlight selection solely based on who developed and not wanting to 'hurt any feelings' if it wasn't picked. Greenlight games are to help give indie GAME developers a fighting chance in the gaming industry for their hard work based on the communities approval of the concept. Not social politics. My final outlook on this experience is that this may be a welcome addition to an E-Bookstore or find a happy home on its own website, but it does not belong on the Steam game store.			"

												Quite possiblly the worst thing ive ever 'played'(As i dont think it can be called a game).As a person who genuinelly has deppression, this game does not at all show how it is, it acts like it is impossible to do anything or open up to anyone, deppression is a bad mood that never ends, a hole that keeps getting deeper, but it can be fought.it isnt just a blanked out option.you CAN make that option.A lot of the time i found myself thinking that was the best option to take, while being deppressive myself as i said earlier.I dont know why this is on steam, it has a trigger warning, upload it on Tumblr, this and the Sakura 'Visual Novel' genre is what is ruining Steam, and filling it with what i like to call 'Role Playing Fakes' in which the RP is either non exsistant or forced.Zoe Quinn im glad that Gamergate is against you, your a person who doesnt understand deppression and who probbablly got all thier morals from Tumblr.Please please PLEASE do not waste your time on this game, even if it is free. its still costing your time and your downloads, oh and its just actually pretty embarrassing to even have this on your played games list.

I get the feeling that I am supposed to go away from this ""game"" experience as more learned about the struggles of people with depression. In short, do not even bother wasting your time with this. I would rank this down below E.T. for the Atari 2600. It really is that bad.Edit: I deleted it.			"

												This is an accurate depiction of one person’s depression, something that effects everyone differently. This is mostly a visual novel with the visual part taken out. As a person who suffers from depression, it is easy to know the “right” choices to make, but the choices feel like the have little weight to them. The writing is pretty bland. I don’t want to say that we need to make depression more exciting to have a discussion about it in video games, but this was mostly just a story about someone’s life, and instead of reading their blog or article, I had to open a program to read it. Basically, this game was kind of bleh feeling, which I am sure taps into how they were feeling, but there are better ways to bring up depression and more constructive ways to show the downsides and maybe provide the insight to have others help themselves.

												You know... I suffer from depression myself. I hold no qualms or no anger towards people who legitimately bring attention to this situation and try to help others who suffer from it, possibly helping to find a universal cure. But the way this person has made this travesty offends me. They asssume that everyone that suffers from depression lets it consume them like a cancer, doing nothing but leading themselves to their own eventual suicide. ♥♥♥♥ that. I know plenty of people who had taken a stand and fought it. Whether they were sucessful or not was based on the power of their will, and sadly, sometimes a will can only take so much. This trash assumes that the only course of action people suffering from depression take is to hide from it and isolate ourselves. This makes the people afflicted seem like nothing but weak, self pitying wastes.  And let me tell you something. People who have things to live for, people they love, they will fight this ♥♥♥♥ing thing tooth and nail. And I am extremely offended on the way this disease was potrayed. It's a thing that can be fought, and how dare they forget that. This game is nothing but offensive.			"

It's depiction of Depression is the most insultingly inaccurate depictions I've ever seen, coming from someone whose had to deal with depressiona and anxiety in the past.What it depicts as depression comes off more as teenage angst rather than full blown depression, and with the lack of narrative substance it's impossible to even take the face value that this is what this person feels depression through.A terrible game whose developer w   h   o   r   e   d themself out for good press, and for good reason. Don't even bother with this s   h   i   t

												Before I begin, I've noticed that due to recent controversy, this game has received a large amount of backlash, all of which is either a personal attack on the people behind it or dismissing it, based on the first screen. I hope to be a little more constructive...I was quite looking forward to Depression Quest as I'm no stranger to depression, I've felt different kinds in the past and I'm currently going through a rough patch at the moment. I was also a big fan of Dear Esther, another game that centered around depression, loss and grief and I loved To the Moon for its similar themes.I was equally as disappointed as most to see that the game was about advanced as a basic website, a white background, with text and a depressing piano rift but, obviously, I tried to see past that and tried to judge the game on its story and the things that it DOES offer.What it offers is a scenario, in which it tells you, your problem and then gives you a list of options, asking you how you would proceed. I usually like this style of storytelling, like in Tell Tale's games or your average RPG and went along with it but I was a bit puzzled to see that two of the options were crossed out and one of them was the option that I would have picked. It didn't take me long to see through the message, that this game appeared to be conveying.The logical answer is always crossed off the list, meaning that people suffering from depression aren't capable of ever doing the logical thing. Though this may be true for some cases, it's not true for EVERYONE and it's certainly isn't a rock hard fact. The reason that it, especially, bothers me is the fact that the only thing you do is read a wall of text before making a decision and after a few minutes, the decision aspect is completely taken away from you, to the point that you just read a wall of text and then click the only option presented to you.I tried to make it to the end, hearing that it tries to accurately simulate depression, by taking the colour out of the world but I just couldn't get to the end of it. I was incredibly bored and I couldn't even get worked up over it anymore, the music was just depressing the hell out of me and I found myself trapped in a seemingly endless monotonous cycle, where I just read text and clicked options, that weren't mine.I've always been very liberal with my definition of what a game is, some said that Dear Esther wasn't a game and I argued against that but this? I don't know, I don't believe that it is a 'game' as you could recreate the experience by listening to a playlist of every depressing song/theme you know, whilst reading something off of fanfiction.net and occasionally slapping yourself across the face.In conclusion; I wouldn't recommend it, I don't believe that it is an accurate portrayal of depression and I struggle to see where the 'it's a game!' argument is coming from. If you want a better experience, I'd recommend Dear Esther or To the Moon over this as both are much better interractive stories.			"

												The War of 1812 was a military conflict, lasting for two-and-a-half years, fought by the United States of America against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, its North American colonies, and its American Indian allies. Seen by the United States and Canada as a war in its own right, it is frequently seen in Europe as a theatre of the Napoleonic Wars, as it was caused by issues related to that war (especially the Continental System). The war resolved many issues which remained from the American Revolutionary War but involved no boundary changes. The United States declared war on June 18, 1812 for several reasons, including trade restrictions brought about by the British war with France, the impressment of American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy, British support of Indian tribes against American expansion, outrage over insults to national honor after humiliations on the high seas, and possible American interest in annexing British territory in modern-day Canada.[3]The war was fought in three principal theatres. Firstly, at sea, warships and privateers of each side attacked the other's merchant ships, while the British blockaded the Atlantic coast of the United States and mounted large raids in the later stages of the war. Secondly, land and naval battles were fought on the American–Canadian frontier, which ran along the Great Lakes, the Saint Lawrence River and the northern end of Lake Champlain. Thirdly, the American South and Gulf Coast also saw big land battles, in which the American forces defeated Britain's Indian allies and a British invasion force at New Orleans. At the end of the war both sides signed the Treaty of Ghent and both parties returned occupied land to its pre-war owner and resumed friendly trade relations.With the majority of its land and naval forces tied down in Europe fighting the Napoleonic Wars, the British used a defensive strategy in the Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, repelling initial American invasions. Early victories over poorly led American armies such as the Battle of Queenston Heights, demonstrated that the conquest of the Canadas would prove more difficult than anticipated. Despite this, the Americans were able to inflict serious defeats on Britain's native American allies, ending the prospect of an Indian confederacy and an independent Indian state in the Midwest under British sponsorship. US forces were also able to make several gains on the Canadian frontier; taking control of Lake Erie in 1813 and seizing western parts of Upper Canada. However a large-scale American attempt to capture Montreal was repulsed in November 1813, and serious American attempts to conquer Upper Canada were ultimately abandoned following the bloody Battle of Lundy's Lane in July 1814.In April 1814, with the defeat of Napoleon, the British adopted a more aggressive strategy, sending larger invasion armies and tightening their naval blockade. However, with the end of the Napoleonic Wars in Europe, both governments were eager for a return to normality and peace negotiations began in Ghent in August 1814. In September 1814, the British invaded and occupied eastern Maine. In the south-west, General Andrew Jackson destroyed the military strength of the Creek nation at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. The British victory at the Battle of Bladensburg in August 1814 allowed them to capture and burn Washington, D.C, but they were repulsed in an attempt to take Baltimore. American victories in September 1814 at the Battle of Plattsburgh repulsed the British invasions of New York, which along with pressure from merchants on the British government prompted British diplomats to drop their demands at Ghent for an independent native buffer state and territorial claims that London previously sought. Both sides agreed to a peace that restored the situation before the war began. However, it took six weeks for ships to cross the Atlantic so news of the peace treaty did not arrive before the British suffered a major defeat at New Orleans in January 1815.[4]In the United States, late victories over invading British armies at the battles of Plattsburg, Baltimore (inspiring their national anthem, ""The Star-Spangled Banner"") and New Orleans produced a sense of euphoria over a ""second war of independence"" against Britain.[5][6] The Federalist Party had strongly opposed the war effort and prevented New England from providing much in the way of soldiers and troops; it now virtually collapsed. The war ended on a high note for Americans, bringing an ""Era of Good Feelings"" in which partisan animosity nearly vanished in the face of strengthened U.S. nationalism. Spain played a small role, but was not an official belligerent; some Spanish forces fought alongside the British during the Occupation of Pensacola. The U.S. took permanent ownership of Spain's Mobile District.In Upper and Lower Canada, British and Provincial militia victories over invading American armies became iconic and promoted the development of a distinct Canadian identity, which included strong loyalty to Britain. Today, particularly in Ontario, memory of the war retains its significance, because the defeat of the invasions ensured that the Canadas would remain part of the British Empire, rather than be annexed by the United States. In Canada, numerous ceremonies took place in 2012 to commemorate the war, offer historical lessons and celebrate 200 years of peace across the border.[7] The war is scarcely remembered in Britain, being heavily overshadowed by the much larger Napoleonic Wars occurring in Europe.It was ok.

												Apparently smiling at your girlfriend is one of the best cures for depression.  And my therapist doesn't do anything in particular.But anyways, despite the inconsistencies, unrealistic situations, and frustratingly disabled happy options, you gotta give 'em credit for trying.  This is a fair representation of depression, but it can't speak for every depressed person out there.  There's so many different depressed people out there that such a thing is impossible.  But in any case it was a pretty good idea that came out a bit... off.  And it actually made me feel a little depressed inside to read.  ;-;But hey, my first game wasn't even half as good as this.  It was just a crude MS Paint drawing of Mario that moved around a box for an eternity.  Now THAT's depressing.EEN CUNCLOOSHUN:i r8 this game m8/80 for tryinggg depression			"

												Depression Quest is about a chap who can get a kitten...His psychological problems seem to mostly stem from both, a lack of sleep, and feeling everything is too easy; and attempts to deal with it via a misguided imposter syndrome. (freudian slip of the developers, perhaps?)Anyways, in the story you can get a pet kitten. Highlight of the game.On that note, it is not really much a ""game"" as much as a ""take some mostly irrelevent choices that we think reflect depressed people's thoughts"" sort of thing. The design is mostly text and images with links. This is closer to a choose your own adventure book, a shallow one at that.The imagination here is very paint by numbers and does not portray depression as anything other than a woe is me dithering, to the point where it's downright insulting to the science behind depression as well as misrepresentative of depression in sufferers as a whole. But umm... kitty... going in between people's legs... (The writers are oh so cleverly subtle)I, by no means like freudian phychology, but this game's writing makes a very compelling argument for it.Conclusivly, this choose your own adventure book (because calling it a game is highly demeaning to the gaming industry, forsooth, it is insulting to adventure books akin) comes off as an abusive exploitation of the depressed, and is downright offensive to the reader's (player would suggest gameplay) intelligence, shows and pervades a contempt for humanity, and portrays the depressed as unlikeable slobs who are to blame for their own issues.Cons-Choose your own adventure book pampered up as a ""game"".-Insults your intelligence.-Demeaning to men and women alike.-Comes off as abusive.-Taunts with choices you cannot choose.Pro-Kitten.-Wonderous example of irony.

I am not speaking from purely my own viewpoint but from a very large portion of the community. How did this game ever get the GreenLight? The answer is *ding ding ding* thats right ""Gaming"" Journalists, Steam you should have learned by now that reviews from the big ""Gaming"" Journalists are not always the communities point of view. The community has the final say on a game. The community is the one that plays the game. The community pays for everything you have. LISTEN TO THE COMMUNITY.			"

												I played this game back when it was on Kongregate. It was a quick experience, and it did not leave a large impression at the time. So infact, that when I heard of the Zoe Quinn debacle, I downloaded the game on steam, loaded it up, and it took me a few minutes to remember that I had, in fact, played this once before.An easily forgetten experience with no staying power.

												Terrible. Just a terrible mess of a game. Where do I even begin? From a gameplay standpoint, it's boring. There's nothing visually stimulating (and while I realize that's not the point with choose your own adventure games-but something semi-decent would have been nice, a background to simulate scene changes), and it's all too easy to get the good ending if you have even a sliver of an idea how choose your own adventure games work. The story is bland at best and does nothing to suck the player in and make them care about the character their playing as. Honestly, 3/4 of the way through and I found myself skimming the mammoth-sized paragraphs of crap just to get to my options. Speaking of options, why cross out the ones that would actually help you? I'm speaking from an odd position here, as I have never been diagnosed with depression, but it feels strange that, in an attemtpt to simulate someone being depressed you wouldn't present the helpful option as an option. To the people who played this game who actually have depression, did that feel condescending at all? Plus, the character is completely self-absorbed. There's a point in the game where one of your friends is having some nasty issues in their life and instead of consoling them, you can choose to just ignore him because you feel that you have it worse. Even though this person is a life-long friend you can still opt to turn your back on them. And a trigger warning? Really?Would not recommend this game if you're looking for something good to play. Would recommend this game if you want to have another reason to dislike Zoe Quinn.			"

												I first heard of this game when news spread about the developer who bought reviews by a form of prostitution.  Now that I look back on it I find it pretty pathetic that I heard about the game due to the negative back lash from the developer choices.  So, I decided to base my opinion on the game itself, and I decided to give it a try.   It was at that time that I played this ""game.""  I thought to myself ""How did this get on steam?""  This piece of indie shovelware is not a game at all.  It is a despicable mock on people with depression.  Superman 64 is said to be one of the worst games of all time, and I can find myself prefering that to this because it has gameplay.  Even E.T. for the Atari 2600 has more potential.  I do believe people should play it though.  I feel they should play it so they can understand that indie ""developers"" need to stop thinking their shovelware titles belong in the industry.  Also, those who run steam really need to start actually looking at the games that make it onto steam.			"

												Didn't like it. I may be being a little harsh as I know this is a hard topic, and I know it's trying to portray depression which can be a very individual thing, but disliked the way there were right and wrong choices. Don't want to go talk to a doctor?...well that means you can't go talk to your friends or family instead 'cos we're going to grey it out. I mean there's no way you could help yourself....you need MEDICATION! (Or that's the impression I got from this game anyway.) Yeah I get it, it's meant to be a spiral, but I don't think it's the greatest representation even from an individual standpoint. It's more like someone's idea of what they think depression should be like, but comes off more like someone who's just whiny and can't help themselves without managing to incite any understanding or compassion at all. Can think of many better resources for people wanting to read up more on what depression is. It's also concerning the play though I did at least, makes out like there is no end to it and you'll be miserable your entire life which I think is very misrepresented and a dangerous message, especially for those with current clinical depression. My opinion- skip it.			"

												This game seems to be confusing depression with boredom or lazyness because that's honestly all I felt while playing with options basically breaking down between Do Something (Which you can't do) or Do Nothing.It also didn't help that there were constant reminders of how I was feeling depressed and could do nothing about it.Honestly that's all I really have to say about it because there's not much else. I understand it's coming from the point of view of someone else suffering from depression, but honestly I think that person is just... lazy.Source: I've dealt with depression throughout my entire life and it's never convinced me to not go to work, not get paid and just stay in bed all day. It's actually a part of my personality that I complement with intense cynicism and sarcasm -- which essentially makes me one of the most negative people imaginable -- yet I still manage to go throughout my daily routine. I just suffer all the while in silence, like most people I know with depression.			"

												It should be appreciated that some people want this topic gain more publicity. But I personally don't think that this format of a textadventure fits. The story is just a collection of random events and so no tension is builded. It's also hard to get invested with the protagonist. This said the writing is OK.I don't know if the options you can choose from are deactivated or activated because of your former actions but it makes the player feeling less control of the actual game. A better solution could have been the possibility of unlikely actions wich then return to the initial point.All in all it shows how depression could be (actually you can have depression and still make jokes and laugh) but it's hardly a game for entertainment. So I only could recommend this for people who want to make an experience and aren't afraid of much reading.Everyone else, even lover of textadventures, won't get much out of it.			"

												I'll preface this review by saying that it's highly unlikely that anybody is checking out Depression Quest in total ignorance of the massive storm of internet drama surrounding it, and I'm no exception. Thus, my view of this piece of ""interactive (non)fiction"" isn't the product of going in completely blind.I don't have any problems with visual novels, ""story games,"" and ""walking simulators"" on principle, since they can be great experiences if executed well (insert plug for The Stanley Parable here). However, Depression Quest has some major issues that ultimately cause it to fall flat. The writing is poor on a technical level: it's difficult to get immersed in a text-heavy experience when you have to wrestle with typos, ambiguous pronoun references, and unnecessary alliteration. In addition, instead of being written in a way that evokes certain emotions in the reader, Depression Quest explicitly tells you how you feel every step of the way. This caused me to approach the experience in a disconnected, analytical manner. Finally, perhaps due to my disconnect with the ""player character,"" it was far too simple to determine the proper series of choices to guide the character toward a solution to their depression (protip: don't lay in bed all week).In conclusion, although I personally can't speak to whether or not Depression Quest is an accurate representation of chronic depression, I couldn't force myself to care about the events in the story due to awkward, weak execution. But hey, if you don't believe me, it's free and only takes about half an hour to go through once, so it's not too hard to form your own opinion.			"

												Just finished the game. Despite the short amount of time it took to complete, it felt like an eternity.I wanted to give it a fair chance, but there was no game here. The design of the game is just lazy. It's so bland and uninteresting to look at that I really couldn't focus on the story. It's white background, with black text, and a picture on top that pertains to the story.Whenever I could actually look at what was going on, I was extremely disappointed in the lack of originality of the situation I was in. The story is that I have a girlfriend and family who all love me and are concerned about my depression. WHOOP-DEE-DOO!!! I got excited when someone gave me a kitten. I thought that would make it a good game, but the cat POSSIBLY only shows up one other time. There was no connection with any of the characters really since they're all nothing more than cliches.The game has a total of ONE TRACK of a short piano piece on a loop. There will be background noises sometimes depending on the area which can make this short track even more annoying than it actually is. I would go insane listening to it as I merely got the gist of what was going on. I can't imagine what would happen if I took the time to go over all the details.The whole thing about this game is making choices. It doesn't matter how many choices the GAME says there are because in reality there are only two every time. There can be 6 choices the GAME gives you, but there are really only two. It lists some options only to cross them out because you're ""TOO DEPRESSED"" which is just the most infuriating thing a game about choices can do. I understand my character is depressed, but don't tell me you're restricting my options because of this. Depression doesn't mean incapable of choosing to do enjoyable things. Depression doesn't make some options impossible, but it does make some options more difficult to make because of the emotional weight that just doesn't seem like something to bring around other people. The choices that were presented in this game seemed like they were made to guide the player towards one over the others. I can't choose the crossed out option, but I can choose the option that's the crossed out option with different words. The obvious right option sometimes is actually not always the obvious right option for someone who isn't depressed. The writers basically assume that this is how a normal life should be and anyone who isn't living like this is depressed. I don't have time for parties, internet interaction, and Netflix with a girlfriend when MY JOB is on the line. Depression should have nothing to do with that. Do my choices really matter? Only when it comes down to choosing to see a therapist and taking medicine is when it truly matters. The game is always telling you that you're not doing those things, so obviously the player can deduce that those are the things that must be done in order to win the game. In the real world a therapist and medication does NOT fix all cases of depression. Sometimes these things cause people to become more lost and more depressed.I do not believe that this game depicts depression exactly. There are many ways people can struggle with depression and I've only seen one very generic and uneducated depiction in Depression Quest. The writing is made to make your character obviously sad when sometimes it's not always so obvious even to those affected by this terrible state of mind. I, along with some of the other reviewers here, have struggled with depression and know how it feels. The game gives a trigger warning to anyone who has been depressed that this game might be too real and may emulate our own lives too well. IT DOES NOT!!! If anything it offends and belittles anyone in this very serious condition. I know it wasn't their intention to do so, but that's how I feel about it.Depression Quest is a pretentious way of bring attention to this issue. I'm not even happy that some of the money they receive to support this game goes to the Suicide Hotline. It should ALL go to the Suicide Hotline. It's insulting to think how these people have made money off of this. At the very least, it is at the least totally free if we choose it to be that way.1/10 since it was free. Play it if you want, but your time is better spent elsewhere.			"

												I kinda liked the storyline for itself, kinda a nice little story for free. Could have done with a little bit more ambieance in the game itself, like more music and slightly more interesting visuals but whatever. Gotta say I don't think it did an accurate depiction of clinical depression though. Honestly if it had a different name and some more love put into it (and wasn't surrounded by controversy) I would say it's a nice little niche game. Too bad it didn't have a nice enviroment to succeed in its quirky mediocrity.			"

												I've struggled with depression for the last 4 years and this game was a joke to me. It's the typical 'no one loves me/I'm a burden' stuff and it's basic. There was nothing to draw me into the story and the best part of the game was probably the picture of the cat. This felt more like a chore and not a form of 'entertainment' (for lack of better words). It was boring, plain, and a waste of time. The choices you make have very little effect on the aactual game as the game will have the same outcome, and that is no real outcome. Either you do good and get over it or you do bad and you dont. If this game is trying to show someone how it feels to be depressed, it's failing horribly. Making decisions isn't as easy as clicking a button. You cant show someone how it is to be depressed through a video game. If you want to try and see what it's like for someone who's going through a depression and struggling, go play The Cat Lady. Overall, this game was a disappointment and could possibly be one of the worst games I've played in my entire 18 years. "

												Being diagnosed with depression, I'd say that there may have been a better way of depicting it than with just words.  Use more visuals, lights, show how fast your thoughts go by..  And anyone who is not being treated for depression may be discouraged by the ending.  It was a bit boring, since there wasn't a lot of player interaction, it was mostly just reading a book. Depression does get better, it never completely leaves you, yes, but it doesn't leave you in feeling only halfway okay.  You have good days.  Also: there should be two stories, so you can chose your gender or even insert your name, to make it feel more personal.			"

												The game tries to deliver an okayish story with much pathos, but it really just doesn't accurately portray a clinical depression. The description of the issues the main character is having are as vague as it gets. The game simply boils it down to 3 symptoms. Being anxious, antisocial and having a bad mood. This sadly doesn't do much justice to the complexity of the illness at all. It also doesn't count in any of the problems that come with it, like forgetfulness, irrational input evaluation and the side effects of medication.It seems like the game is about someone who is having a hard time being depressed, rather than suffering from a major depressive disorder.tldr; Not in-depth, but okay story. Still would not recommend to anyone interested in this particular topic. Go, read a book about it. Much more worth your time.			"

Is it enticing to the mood?) - 1Genre Structure - 1Return Factor - 1Average Score - 2As everyone knows, a game is entitled a fair chance. 'Depression Quest' is unique in its development as it brings forward the viewpoints and emotional curtains that define depression. However, it is only applicable to one scenario. It in fact plays through the possible actions of a single person in a very specific environment. The limited actions allow for smooth transitioning, but are generally lacking for what gamers consider to be a developing title.With all else said and done, the game was fairly straight-forward in its guided direction. Did you fight through the depression, or did you succumb to what would be a vision-altering take on an individuals inner turmoil. With multiple paths to choose from which gradually became more and more limited as time progressed, one could feel restricted to their options, an argument which invalidates the free-thought that many gamers wish to experience. With no real graphical rendering save for a very contrasting back-drop to the text, I found my eyes hurting and straining, consistently reminding myself that this game looked more like a website than an actual game. There wasn't any Artificial Intelligence to interact with so the choices seemed rather stale in comparison to other titles. As for the images that did perceive themselves, the images were repetative and didn't give an ebb or flow to the text, so when it came up with changes in time, it felt much like a car slamming into a concrete baricade, and other times it felt like time was at a stand-still.The music was a single repetitive track that played itself over and over again and was almost maddening in and of itself, so the feel was genuinely successful, but the music felt out of place at many points in the story line. As a fast reader, I was able to play through this game in roughly twenty minutes with all possible endings. On that note, the gameplay was very short, and the replay factor was damaged by my own personal abilities. That being said, it felt short and fairly lacking in immersive content. Credit shall be given, however, into the emotions that the game drew out. Having suffered from depression myself, a majority of the situations actually forced myself to review my own experiences in some self-reflection and as I am writing this, I can't help but feel emotionally connected to the game. However, I must remain clinical and give an honest review, and so my personal feelings will be directed in a more professional manner.The last questions that come to mind are fairly straight-forward. Is this a game, and does it befit the genre advertised? The answer to these questions is an undeniable, ""No."" Depression Quest feels more like a book that you would select your choice, and then turn the page to reveal your decision's consequence, whether it be positive, negative, or neutral. As well, with Depression Quest having the graphical interface of a web-page or flash-based game, it did not feel like it belonged on Steam as a Green-Light. With all this said, it also cannot be considered a Role-Playing Game as it doesn't fit the criteria to be considered a game.On a personal note, I feel that Depression Quest was fairly enlightening and would definately help others feel what depression is. As much as I can relate to it, I feel this would be better as a graphic novel or a short-story rather than a video-game. As a video-game, I stick by my rating of '2 out of 5"" and would not recommend this game over-all, but on a personal scale, I feel that this could become something better if it were applied in a different application.If you like this review, please be sure to head over to my Twitter or my Facebook (both will be linked below) and leave a follow/like.

												I can see some of what this meant to do, I just don't really think it works. There's salient points about depression, but it's presented in such a way that it can be easily missed. The overly wordy and often repetitive text is quit frustrating, written in an often stilted fashionIt's also hard to read with a mottled sort of black and grey background for grey text, and an overly grainy quality to it that just cuts into it being easy to take anything in by creating a wall.The concept may be good, but it's executed in a very poorly designed fashion.

												Ignoring the person who made this game and the controversy surrounding her, this game is stupid. It's not a game. It doesn't belong on steam, it is poorly designed, you can't turn off the music which I found annoying, very wordy (as far as 'games' go). It's like a choose your own adventure story except there's no adventure. I get that the intention of this is to help people to understand mental illness better, and to understand that how it can effect your life, but it just fails so badly.			"

												To get it out of the way immediately, I have Bi-polar depression. This 'game' is not an accurate depiction of depression in the least. It is a depiction of someone who is depressed. There is in fact a difference here. Much of the text trivializes the long term issues and makes it appear as if this is something the character is just now dealing with, as in it suddenly appeared. While it is possible for someone with untreated clinical depression to have a girlfriend, a job, a (apparent) group of friends, and overall live a normal life, that is near miraculous as depicted in this game. I attempted to self-manage my depression for years without help, and can tell you that social withdrawal and self-esteem issues are pretty much a given in this kind of situation. I truly think this 'game' utterly fails to depict the mental state of someone with clinical depression. There are a number of issues with the presentation, even aside from the inexplicably understanding people surrounding the character, such as the portrayal of anti-social behavior as a direct result of depression. Some people genuinely don't like other people, and have issues connecting with them, thus seeing avoidance as a way to not have to deal with the added stress trying to deal with that you don't understand creates. I know I'm anti-social. I also know that my being anti-social has nothing to do with my depression, but more to do with just not having the desire for social interaction. That is the root cause of anti-social behavior in most people. Social withdrawal is getting so anti-social that it begins to affect your life negatively. Moving on from that, I cannot call this an accurate portrayal of even caricaturized depression. It portrays someone who is depressed, and fails to do that very well, due to a number of misconceptions on the creator's part on what depression is, and on what the effects are.			"

												I downloaded this game to see if it would live up to the hype (for better or worse), and I decided to take an objective look. What I noticed first were some typographical errors, which would be negligible if not for this game being almost exclusively text-oriented. Also, since I find it difficult to concentrate on large areas of text for long periods of time, I think having a save state of some sort would have been a nice addition to the game, especially since the developer was generous enough to include a graphic showing how to ""play"" this game with a controller.As far as content goes, I think that since the protagonist is supposed to be you (the player), I think that “Alex” (your girlfriend in the game) should have been a neuter character so people of all sexual orientations (not just lesbians) could better relate – there was a huge opportunity to do so, what with “Alex” being a unisex nickname, and since this game is meant to simulate what it feels like to be clinically depressed, I think it would have better immersed the player in that world.Other than these few minor nitpicks, it does have a semi-interesting story, and as someone who has suffered from clinical depression myself, it does have relatable elements. I didn't finish because it was too long for me to complete in one sitting and I couldn't find a way to bookmark my place to pick it up later (as I stated before, save states would have been useful). I think this game could use more development, but it does have potential, and I can honestly say I got what I paid for from Depression Quest.			"

												Don't play this ""game"", nor should you view it as an accurate depiction of depression. You don't make the choices in the game, instead, the developer has already crossed off certain options in order to force you down the same bad ending. Depression Quest only tries to show the worst case scenario for depression, not at all acknowledging that it is treatable by the choices you make, instead, it portrays the only way to treat depression is with pills and a therapist. Notice how I said ""tries"", because even then everyone in the ""game"" acts like a complete idiot around the player.Accuracy aside, this is just a poor excuse for a ""game"". From the static overlay constantly on the screen in a pathetic attempt to make the mediocre story seem ""deep"" to the lack of multiple endings with your choices basically doing nothing, there's a reason this game's top reviews are mostly negative.

												Text-based, 'choose your own adventure' games are already hard to recommend, even when they are good.  Depression Quest isn't particularly good in any way, so it's a no go unless you really want to read poorly edited walls of text while listening to the same terrible song constantly pounding away in the background.  I hate to ask for more consequence in a game dealing with such a dark topic, but it's really straight forward in what it does.  You can easily get the best ending, which comes off more insulting than anything.  All the bad aside, one thing the game does that I completely agree with is that it strongly encourages seeking help, professional or otherwise, if you are struggling with depression.Also, get a cat.

												First of all, this is not a game, it is an interactive story which only really goes in one direction even though you seemingly pick different ways to go about the story, you end up with the same results really.Secondly, this game does not do what it's meant to, which is educate people on the real struggles of depression. All this story does is tell the reader about the authors point of view on depression from what seems to be from a female mindset, which is not educating people correctly on the matter.This story doesn't express the difficulty of actually dealing with depression and how frustrated and hopeless you actually feel when dealing with this illness and even though the charactor refers to being 'exhausted' and 'emotionally drained', this is not the whole of what people feel in their battle with depression. This so called game is wrongly educating people on the subject.Also, if you're struggling with depression this 'game' is not for you, as all it does is make you feel worse about yourself and the direction in which your own life is going, so don't waste your time on this poor excuse of a game.Overall, the music is terrible and repetative, the story is inacurate about the struggles of depression and it is wrongly categorised (this is most certainly not an RPG).

												I went into this with an open mind, despite the sad tactics of the developer to rally troops into getting this greenlit. Twice. Upon playing it, I noticed a few things. This is, a graphical choose your own adventure book. But, I feel it sadly lacks substance. It doesn't touch on real depression. It doesn't at all represent those of us who have dealt with it. Struggled with it.The narrative feels hollow at times. Disjointed. Even by graphic novel standards, this seems to be a hodgepodge of poorly done tripe. But the worst of it is, this simply doesn't touch on the real darkness of depression. The self apathy. The grueling feelings of despair. Perhpas another medium other than point and click might have worked. Random events, for example. A different format or engine. As it is, I found this game lacking in every way. I found no emotional connection to a game that wants me to feel connected to it. To relate to it. I find it does a horrid job even depicting depression itself. It's simply a series of cliking on choice, and get better or worse. That's not even one tenth accurate. It's not showing the troubles one faces in feeling down, then depressed, then the utter despair. I tried going into this with an open mind, and realized this game was simply awful.			"

												I think the game does what it set out to do by helping people understand depression more. These symptoms are relateable by almost everyone with the fog or time moving slow at work but I think the game expresses well that depression isn't just these feelings coming and going at work, these feelings last for months and months. It's the consistancy that is emphasized. The narration is a bit hard to read because it is written as a 20 year old girl and these situations are a bit over exaggerated in my opinion. The anxiety of parties and such are very real but the reasons we create this anxiety are not valid most of the time. Example, being in a crowded party by yourself, you feel as if every person is staring at you and judging but in reality most people don't even care what you're doing. The exaggeration is useful to help people with no base for depression to relate but it might give the wrong impression. I get that the writers used a 20 year old character to help relate to the people who probably need something like this most and that is young adults dealing with these issues so I think the format works but I personally just don't like reading about a 20 year old girls problems. I think this game really shows depression well but also shows the glaring problem of peer pressure and social ""norms"" that people experience. Why is it so crazy to just hangout at a party by yourself and not really talk  much? there should be nothing wrong with that and yet people always ask ""whats wrong with you?"" ""are you okay?"" I lost count of how many times in the story ""are you okay"" or ""whats wrong"" came up and I think that is the worst part of depression usually. No one understands and no one knows how to approach it and so they affectively make it worse. Thats what I took from this game. I wouldn't recommend it as a game but I would recommend it as a tool to help understand depression a little better.			"

												As a person who has suffered with depression for the majority of his life, and a person who loves visual novels like Ace Attorney and Professor Layton. I can't bring it to myself to give this game a good review. I tried to give this game at least one full playthrough but after about 10 minutes I really couldn't do it. I understand what this game is trying to do but honestly its execution is downright♥♥♥♥♥♥poor. I know everyones battle with depression is different and many people deal with it in different ways but this game only gives, in my opinion, a sterotypical depression outlook. Some of the good options to pick through to advance in the story are crossed off. As it seems like a person battling with depression is unable to do those things. It would have done the game more justice to let the player pick some of the more social and common things to see how a person with depression would react to them! I know when I was battling with depression I still tried my hardest to do what was right and I went after help to get things under control. So overall do yourself a favor and don't play this game. The game isn't even worth it to be free. Go download the demo for Five Night's at Freddys or something. Or if you want a good visual novel expierence go pick up Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright:Ace Attorney next week.I'll probably sit down and play the game from start to finish and give my full thoughts on this, however the game just isn't worth your time.

												I don't know who's going to actually take the time to read this but I need to get this out. Jesus, does this whole drama situation make me angry. Angry that I can't do anything about it. I'll start off by saying something that might seem irrelevant. I consider my political stance quite conservative. But you see one thing that I see often labeled as ""the liberal idea"" is that the government has total control over you, and you are simply puppets. Now to a certain extent I see this fit, because after all I'd like to have some control and not erupt into anarchy. But that doesn't mean I'm willing to live in an orwellian society where citizens have no voice. Why am I talking about this? Well see, what sparked my interest in this game was the actions of the Reddit r/gaming subreddit. Comments being deleted. Now that isn't maintaining order. That is flat out repressing our voice. How can you even call it a public forum anymore? It's not like those comments were yelling obsecnities, posting links to viruses, or bullying each other. They were talking about the situation, maybe asking question about the situation, and simply getting deleted. Now I like going to the gaming reddit sometimes to read up on news and stuff. Gaming is something I consider a big part of my life. When I saw something like that happening, it was kind of an eye-opener. A feeling of, wow this is right at my doorstep, kind of feeling. Suddenly, my closeted political activist side of me thought, alright that's it. So many things in this world that I am upset with. Israel and Hammas, ISIS, The looting in Ferguson. And then there's this. Yes, compared to what I talked about this whole ordeal is of lesser importance, yet I think I'm going to voice my opinion about it. This kind of thing probably happens everyday in our government. Corruption. Manipulation of press. Don't tell me that someone sleeping with someone else in exchange for priority over others is not corruption. If it isn't then why aren't we allowed to discuss it? Why do I go through those threads and see *deleted* *deleted* *deleted* everywhere? One more thing. Another reason this game doesn't recieve my support is because of the way this creator has acted publicly on twitter. Alogn with others. I'm not part of this wizchan forum, but jesus, the things peopele were saying about them. THAT is the real abuse. THAT is the bullying. Many feminists are headstrong about the use of sensitive terms and advocate the consideration of other peoples thoughts and feeligns. I respect and admire that. But what I saw was the term 'virgin' being thrown around with a incredibly huge negative connotation. Where's the respect for people following religions that advocate abstinence till marriage? So no, I can't have respect for someone making a game, who is immature, insensitive, could possibly be lying!?!?! (ever thought of that? who really did call her?), and just flat out immoral. I cant support conspiracy and manipulation. But for those of you who want an actual game review. Well I watched a playthrough. Despite others, I thought the idea of the game was amazing. Truly needed in our society right now. But the playthrough that I watched. My god this game misses the mark completely. Just really shoddy work all around. Makes this important topic look very dissmissive. A careless approach to what I thought was a good idea. Surely there wasn't enough work done on this game. I guess it makes sense it was free. But unless this developer puts out anoher free game that truly reflects impressive, hardworked, artistic work. Then sure, I'll give a thumbs up for that one. But for this one, well sorry but it really isn't good. As I said, I'm just here to rant, and provide my opinion on the game. If you want to reply, you wont get a reply from me. Dont think of that as ""Oh man, I really got hime! He's at a loss for words and cant provide a rebuttal!"" No. I'm not going to spend my time arguing about this. Just here to do my job downvoting what I think is a disgrace to the gaming comunity and harfmul   to the industry.			"

												The idea behind Depression Quest is something I have no problems with and is fairly solid. Making people aware of how difficult living with depression can be is really important and more people should be aware of it. However it's also important to take this 'game' at face value. It's at the most a choose your own adventure story with minimal end results. The creator made the right choice in releasing it for free, as it has nowhere near enough content to justify a price tag.Would I recommend people play this game, possibly yes, however for the sakes of the steam review system no. As good as it is,  it's very minimalistic and lacks decent content, it's very linear and when playing it makes you feel like actually the choices you make have little effect on the games outcome. It's also really only good for a single playthrough as results become predictable. Im sure eventually there will be a more fleshed out itteration of this game. However now isn't that time.			"

												The game was boring. There was nothing to hook me and make me say, “I want to keep playing” I was mostly saying, “when is this going to end”. I usually like to go back and try different choice but I wouldn’t in this game because it was so dull. The writing in the game was very mundane I often had to read it a second time because I had drifted off. The choices also felt very fake and were not really choices because a lot of the time they were almost forced upon you.  The choices also made it seem like the devs did not want you to come out of your depression. The game also felt like it rushed the story. The story takes place over months but the writing makes it feel like it took place over a week. That is what overall made the game feel fake to me I didn’t feel like the protagonist I felt like a person clicking buttons and making choices that didn’t really affect me. I wouldn’t recommend this game to anyone and I wouldn’t play it again maybe if the devs did a major rework on it like change the writing and made it seem real but that’s a soft maybe.			"

It's not a good tale about depression, nor could I connect to it in any way, shape or form. The choices that this game has feel like they were just thrown in there for the sake of making this thing an interactive experience, and there are some places where choices could have been put there, but for some reason weren't put in those places (probably laziness). In conclusion, I find this virtual ""choose-your-own-adventure"" book to be lame, and not worth the free download. You're better off picking up a good book rather than ""playing"" this garbage. Overall, this game gets a rating of Five Guys Burgers and Fries out of Ten. Also, despite the ""Time Spent"" counter saying that I completed this thing in about 42 minutes, I left this running while I was AFK, so the time that it took me to complete was probably way shorter than 42 minutes.*inb4 All the SWJs come pouring in calling me a woman hater*			"

												There are two things I want to discuss here.  The game itself, and the controversy.  The Game:  This is not a traditional game, rather a kind of interactive novel.  It is more along the lines of a choose-your-own-adventure type game.  It follows the life of someone struggling with depression, in the second person, in an attempt to illustrate the experience.  While it's a noble goal, the game itself tries to beat the atmosphere and helplessness into you in such an awkward way that playing this is unpleasant.  Not in an ""uncomfortable because it's thought-provoking"" way, but an ""I can't do anything"" way.  Were it not for the disclaimer page before the game starts, I would be concerned about it trivializing the condition by stereotyping it.  I have not put much time into this game, and I don't think I will.  It's just too uncomfortable.  Fortunately if you do try it, it is not very long and can be finished in a matter of minutes.The Controversy:Face it.  The negative reviews and forum posts on this game are not because of the game itself, but are about the creator, Zoe Quinn.  Quinn's ex-boyfriend made a number of allegations about her, and her personal life basically went viral.  It's become a sport in the last few weeks to attack Quinn directly and indirectly for the unforgiveable sin of ""doing it"".  It's like the Internet is made of middle school kids giggling while getting their shamesticks out.  Look.  We get it.  She isn't a nun, nor did she claim to be.  That has nothing to do with the game.  Even when you try to disguise misogyny as being about journalistic integrity, or honesty, or whatever excuse gets used.  When the method is calling someone a ""hooker"" or making ""5 guys"" jokes, that's not about journalism.  That's about her private life.  Conclusion:This game is not fun or enjoyable.  It's kind of an interesting experiment, but most people will probably want to avoid it.  Unfortunately a straight review is hard to find in the nest of cruel and inappropriate snark.  This game is marred by the public reaction to it.			"

												If this define the future of gaming then I will be depressed... not only depressed... SUICIDAL! Don't get me wrong, I like reading! I've been playing the latest interactive novel released on Android such as House of Hell, Blood of the Living Dead and Lone Wolf. And I've been collecting Fighting Fantasy gamebooks for age!But this...This...Has nothing to do with what I grew up with.The title ""Depression Quest"" is very misleading. I thought the game would be about reaching the deepest level of depression. What a fool I was!So basically, you play some boy who as a hard time being positive and living an enjoyable day. The story is set in a very generic context: you live with your mother, you have an old brother and a girlfriend, you have a job and everything seems to fall apart. The writing style doesn't manage to deliver the complexities of depression. It is like listening to a casual conversation so there is nothing creative about the writing. The writer has absolutely no imagination.The music is alright but it is the same throughout the whole playthrough.The game uses some images to help the ""reader"" to get an idea of what is going on but there are too few of them.The mission goal is to meet a therapist and take medication so you can feel better. What kind of institutional propaganda is that?!Even if the game is free, it's still a ripoff. The game doesn't deserve that much attention.♥♥♥♥ing a video game journalist will not save the game from bad reviews.A bad game is a bad game.I hate to say it but...I can list a number of bad games that are better than Depression Quest: The Graveyard (dare I say it!), Dementium 2 HD, Robocop (Xbox, 2003), Judge Dredd Dredd vs Death, Daikatana (thumb up John Romero!), Country Justice Revenge of the Redneck, Land of the Dead Road to Fiddler Green, Big Rigs.Reading my review will spare you from the depression that awaits you in Depression Quest.Rating:1.0			"

												If you’re looking for nice graphics, great sound, challenging gameplay or fascinating story, Depression Quest fails on all of these.  It’s pretty debatable as to whether Depression Quest is even qualified as a game. You click on some hyperlinks that take you to another text-card against a grey background and… that’s it. And by no means should this game be viewed as an accurate depiction of depression. It’s utterly disrespectful to those clinically depressed, portraying them as lazy, hopeless people with no desire to change their lives. If you want to understand depression, ask people with depression or do scholarly research, and don’t play this game. It was pretty hard to play this, but I had to try it out because it was free and I wanted to find out what the controversy was about.+It’s free+Lightweight on your HD space+/- Music was okay, but repetitive-Low entertainment value -A bad way to spread awareness about depression -It will probably make you feel worse if you are seeking comfort.

												Okay so real talk from someone who has had clinical Depression since they were 9.Depression sucks. Big time. A lot of the thought processes, situations, and dialogue that are used in this 'game' are somewhat relatable to some of my own experiences. The not feeling good enough for your partner, being emotionally exhausted, having to pep yourself up for menial activities...It's a lot more difficult than people realize, and I will give some credit to Depression Quest for trying to shed some light on that, for the small hints of it that are there. However, while I understand what this was trying to accomplish, there are better ways of doing so. This is not a game. It is an interactive journal essentially. It is trying to be a new-age look into a 'deep' soul that ends up sounding very pretentious. I just know most people do not want to sit and read walls of text(s) of sad things, which is probably one of the major reasons Depression Quest has been so negatively received. There's also the fact that the story overall really isn't even that engaging. I started skipping over entries after the seventh one and just clicked the most positive options to get to the end. I also can't stand the title. As another reviewer stated, Depression is not a 'quest' where you get a nice little reward for making it to the end. It's draining and exhausting. It's learning how to cope and when you think everything is fine and figured out, the rules change again for no reason. Basically, it's not nearly as straight-forward as this 'groundbreaking game' claims to be.I read a bit on Zoe Quinn and her desire to create a more straight-forward game because all the ones dealing with Depression are more metaphorical and about symbolism (which I prefer personally). Well, congratulations Zoe. You created your snorefe-masterpiece!			"

												When I finished Depression Quest, I was taken on a journey of discovery as I tailed the story of a man who has suffered Depression. It's a wonderful game with lots of potential and is crisply written and nocely noted.Now what I say beyond this point is basically a spoiler and if you intend on playing the game, I don't recommend reading. But if your interested on why I don't recommend it, keep reading.As a man who's had major depression, and has been diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder (A disease that makes it harder to comprehend reality and gives you immense mood swings.), I have to say that the justification given in the ending I GOT, is NOT the way to approach depression. It doesn't matter if the story has multiple branches and has various amounts of endings, it should all end in the RIGHT way to treat depression and not with the going excuse of just saying ""deal with it"". For one thing, depression is not something you can just accept and just let it pass. Like any form of mental disorder, it can be treated with the right amount of medicine and seeing a therapist. It makes me angry seeing how a game about something as serious as depression can just say ""you have to live with it"". Depression is something YOU CANNOT just say go away to.Now I know the game is probably vouching for many playthroughs, and it wants you to find the ""optimal path"" to fighting depression, but the problem is that there IS NO SPECIFIC PATH to fighting depression. And giving the answer to people who may have depressio to just deal with it is the WRONG APPROACH. With Depression, you have to be more careful in what you tell the public due to the numerous misconceptions about the disease. Depression is CURABLE, it's something that could be fought with help. Giving an ending that says deal with it is not only infuriating to me as someone who has known and has had depression himself, but also infuriating because it sending the wrong message to people.Now what can I recommend to make the game more exact in how to treat depression and how to articulate depression better? I would make the story have branching paths, but have it only have one ending which is getting yourself cured. Giving the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that you just deal with it is NOT the way to do it. With a premise as important as this, you have to tell the right message and not muddle the message by adding mechanics that hinder it.So that's what I think. Depression Quest is not something I would recommend listening to but would recommend actually playing to see what experiance you might actually get. From the looks of it, there's a way to get to the right ending, but giving an endng that just says to deal with it is not the way to go.To all of those who have depression, please seek help immideately. Dont be afraid to go to a psychiatrist and talking about it. The psychiatrist is payed to listen to you. Don't be afraid if he will started judging you or something, because he wont. He will help you, and will get you better.Spread the word that Depression is something you can FIGHT, not just AVOID.			"

												I don't now how this ""game"" got here in the first place. This is as much of a game as a Wikipedia article is; it's just text and a few images (that appear many times in different ocassions); there is no graphical representation of characters at all, everything is as you imagine it.Another problem is the music; monotonous, boring and it doesn't ever fit a single moment.There is also the character's attitude towards his/her depression: despite a supportive family, girlfriend and friends, he/she still refuses to do something and let's everything crumble around him/her.This ""game"" is very pesimistic about depression as most of the time you are not allowed to take the option that should raise your self-steem.Zoe Quinn is a disgrace for game developers who effort to make good games, as she has automatic attention for being a ""victim"" of ""misogny"" and instead of making a great game with varied music and decent visuals, she makes a Wikipedia article that gets Greenlighted.I'm sorry for those who lost an opportunity to enter the videogame market against this filthy insult to everything this game attempts to represent.

After all the hubbub that I probably don't need to mention, I decided to give this a shot. It couldn't be nearly as bad as everyone said, right? Well... Depression Quest has a unique aesthetic in that it doesn't have one at all. It is text. I can't even call this a Visual Novel since there are NO VISUALS. I have depression, yes. It's nice to see my illness exposed, but this is inappropriate. THIS IS NOT SUITABLE FOR STEAM. This is not a game. THIS IS NOT A GAME. Even though this is free, get a different game with mental illness as a theme, read a book, or perhaps talk to someone who actually has depression.

												Besides the great amount of effort goes into this game which is practically none besides a flash visual novel choose your own path without any graphics, it doesn't address any issues that has to do with depression. ""Why"" you ask?Take a look at the outline of this game your a male, you have a girlfriend and you have a well-paying job and that's it. There is no other background given to indicate why this person your playing has depression, it isn't well thought out and the only thing going for it, is to assume bad stuff has happened in his life which you are unsure of. For depression to happen you need an ""x"" reason or numerous other reasons without this, this game does not address any issues of depression.Since no effort was made in this game and your just focusing on one person this should be easy for the creator to implement but do they? No. What happened in his childhood or adolesence years that could lead up to his depression, what happened at work or between his girlfriend that could lead up to his depression? With only one person to play as this should be easy, it isn't even worth the download because this hasn't been thoroughly addressed and therefore I cannot recommend this game.			"

												Okay, let me get this off my chest. This is not a game, this is an interactive Short Story.. My rationale for it being a non-game is that it has no gameplay just hyperlinks that can be done in so many different ways including powerpoint. I can't see how this got through greenlight or how it won awards especially over Papers Please.. Personally, I come from a family that does have Depression problems in it and this game while it gets some things right most other problems it doesn't. So don't buy the hype you see from these ""professional"" reviewers.. It is just insane how they think this is a perfect way to understand depression. Its not. I still have my Psychology text books and those are more clearly defined and from personal experience as well. My next problem is on the writing level.. there is no characterization, not even a very good idea of the feelings one experiences when being depressed. But it does get some right. It is very hard to even care about the protagonist or even the choices you make since the weight to them is painfully clear. Some more emotional weight and more atmosphere would have been better suited for the emotional impact. Heck it doesn't even have anything in the way of a hero's journey or even much depth of character. Overall, even though this is a free game its best to avoid this story and actually read up on depression and actually support those suffering from it. Encourage them to get the help they need even if they are afraid. Pro tip for the creator, more depth, more emotion, more characterization, and more atmosphere. Plus researching and interviewing would help too.. That is my friendly advice from me to you writer to writer.			"

On any given playthrough i have tried no matter what the choices i had made that i was allowed to i saw many of the same results. I'ts likely one of the worst pieces of Interactire Fiction i've ever had the displeasure of playing.the original online version was apparently programmed in a WYSIWYG HTML editor called ""Twine"" which works like a bulletin board with bits of string going from picture to picture. if you can program a website with notepad, you have more programming talent then the team that slapped this turd together.

												Not in-depth, horrid pictures that were likely stolen, terrible audio, and plagiarized story. Not insightful, and has helped spawn a whole lot of issues, more than it could ever have hoped to have solved. Decisions are vague and hard to make a choice by, immersion is near zero. While free, definitely not worth your time. As I'm sure has been stated, it provides no actual definitions to any of the discussed illnesses, and even less resources to help you or someone else if you have said illnesses. Overall: Instead of wasting time on this game, spend time on real research on depression, anxiety, and other related disorders/illnesses. Look into resources that are locally available to help yourself or someone else. Don't trust this game.2/10 for effort and marginally accurate information.			"

												I really didnt enjoy this game. It feels like most of the choices are locked because depression and you cant even kill yourself.Theres really no gameplay other than selecting choices which is fine if the game has some good story, but this game doesnt really have that. All in all play this game if you want to, but dont expect much.			"

												This is not a game. This is an ebook that's clearly meant to appeal to depressed people, which is fine... If you're a depressed person. People who are not depressed would most likely find this to be a waste of time. The thing that makes games different from watching a movie or reading a book is that they are interactive, and have fun gameplay so that even if you remove the story, it can still be a good game because it has fun gameplay. But this ""game"", when you remove the story just has the gameplay of a choose your own adventure book.			"

												Grade Scale Notes: This review operates on a One-to-Ten rating scale for various segments.1/10: Horrible. 3/10: Nothing interesting. Might have potential, but is weighed down (By glitches, poor/uninteresting design and controls, ETC)5/10: Average7/10: Well made9/10: StellarI do not give 10/10's, as there is no such thing as perfection. I do not give 0/10's, unless the game truly lacks something. And I always round down.Review Intro:When I was in elementary school, I would read a few choose-your-own adventure books in the library. For vague reasons, a friend told me to try this game out and see what I thought of it.Gameplay: 2.5/10Depression Quest is not a game, it is instead a virtual Choose-your-own-adventure story that does not let you choose your adventure, as it will frequently provide you with many options that cannot actually be selected. This single fact made me lose interest rapidly. If the game had allowed you to select those options, but the results would vary based on the three stats displayed at the bottom of every page (Depression level, therapist level, and medication level), the game might take a turn for the better. The three options do change based on some available actions, but the fact that it means nothing is disappointing. The option for plugging a controller in is strange and entirely unneeded.Gameplay Suggestions: Allow the ability to select options who's results vary based on the stats located at the bottom of the page: Depression Level, Therapist Level ( Which would include seeing a therapist, and one's relation with said therapist) and Medication level (level of medication in one's system at that time.). Do not deprive the player of their aility to choose: There is always a choice.Graphics (For the sake of this particular review, this will include music): 1/10I've never been a fan of grayscaled images. That comment aside, this program features limited visuals that are meant to go alongside the story text, but due to the nature of the layout these pictures fall to the wayside on longer text instances. The music is meant to set a sad mood, and ignoring the fact that slow piano music has become a staple for sad game moments, the lack of variety in music made things feel monotonous...The piano number is also boring, to be blunt.Graphics Suggestions: Different music numbers to coincide with different events, that, like the singular piano number, are meant to envoke feelings. There are many kinds of sadness, there should be just as many sad music numbers. If the game is changed to feature more scenes and instances, have music that accompanies it: Music that shows joy, anger, defeat.Story/Writing: I divide the Story/Writing into three categories. Theme, Characters, and Quality. The total score for writing is 5/30, or 1.6/10, rounded down.Theme: 1/10Depression is a serious topic. However, depression on it's own is not enough, thematically, for a game. We need to better see a gradual decent into the depths of sorrow, but being able to rise above and triumph over depression is just as satisfying as defeating the final boss in any other game. This game lacks any of those feelings, and in turn I felt nothing from the game.Theme Suggestions: Make me feel something.Characters: 3/10The protagonist is unnamed, and meant to be an avatar for the player to see the world with. I did not once feel connected to the world or the plights of the protagonist. The reason for this is tied heavily to my comments in regards to 'gameplay'. We have Alex, your 'significant other', but we know very little about them, and less of the other minor characters such as Attic. Alongside the lack of noteworthy characters, the story does not make you feel for the characters already present.Character Suggestions: Add additional characters. Usually an iffy topic for any story, but when your story lacks characters, you need a few more to bring life to the world. Provide us with more details of these characters; make us feel for these characters. Yes the story is about the protagonist, but those characters are a part of the protagonist's world. At present, they exist moreso to advance the story.Writing Quality: 1/10Depression Quest lacks it's quest.I found the writing to be similar to a High Schooler's Biology essay: It might look proper, but there's no soul to it. It's also short.On the first playthrough the protagonist broke up with Alex, and then a few turns later the story ended. On the second playthrough the protagonist went to a therapist and got some medications, and actually seemed to start to get better (which almost made me become interested in the story) and then a few turns later the story ended. If I decided to suffer a third time through, it would go on for a bit, and then the story would end.THE STORY WOULD END. Yes, all stories have to end, but when the ending is ""Thank you for playing, we know this might not be the easiest game..."". First off, game is the wrong word (see Gameplay review), secondly you do not deprive the reader of the story's end unless you've crafted the story in such a way that it can be interpreted freely by the reader...which is not how a 'Choose-Your-Own-Adventure' works. You do not interprete the end because you found the end, and the end is not a message from the author, it is THE END of the story.Story Suggestions: Start over. That's all I can say.Overal Game Score: By math, the score is 5.1/30, or 1.7/10. But my soul believes the score to be 1/10, at the most generous.Depression Quest attempts to show us the world of someone who is depressed, but it's limited gameplay and poor story are the only depressing things to be found. I would suggest that Depression Quest either evolve into an actual, fully fleshed out Text-Based Adventure game that challenges the player to free the protagonist from the bonds of depression, or be transformed into a Short Story piece. It cannot operate as both.Also, and this question is solely to my fellow reviewers: What in blazes does Five Guys have to do with any of this?			"

												ignoring all the controversy this game brought from its creator (whom im neutral about, i dont support nor hate them for any reason really), this game is really really boring.the whole point is that its supposed to simulate depression from the first point of view of the guy whom you play as. However, theres pretty much only 1 route to the game. Its more of a choose your own adventure e-book than a game, with it only having pretty much 1 main  route.the pictures and graphics are poor quality to say the least.Also i dont seem to connect with the game, you know. I don't feel like it made me feel like i was in that guy's shoes.overall its a free game, at least people didn't get ripped off like other games on steam.that being the only positive thing from the game, it pretty much is just a big do not play, or just once to make your own judgement			"

Badly written, horrifically narrow in scope, poorly scored (bland piano, noice), and reeking of a fedora-clad Starbucks customer.

												This game was extremely simple. About an hour into the game, I figured out that the choices presented all had a very easy to predict path. I could be a loner at the party, or I could be cheery. Guess what made me sink deeper into a depression? That's right. The game is too easy to predict, so I didn't really enjoy, especially since I do have these thoughts. It tells me that I only have one way to go if I choose the choices I would, because it would be hopeless. I can respect what the creator was trying to do, but this is something extremely tricky to create a game out.I'm even directing a play about depression and suicide, and it has been difficult. She goes with the stereotypes and connotations associated with depression, when there is a lot more that goes into it other than feeling hopeless. I would recommend that next time anyone makes a game that deals with that topic, they research the hell out of everything,Overall:4/10It's a fun-ish game to see what your playthrough will result in, but it isn't something to take seriously.

												I've decieded to give this a bash because I saw Isaac Schankler was involved with the project and I really liked his work with Analogue and Hate Plus. People have been bringing up the controversy with Quinn, but here's the thing: it has nothing to do with Depression Quest so I could care less about someone's personal life simply because it was never my business to begin with so lets move away from that and actually talk about the ""game"". Depression Quest is simply a choose you own adventure kind of ordeal touching upon the subject of depression and I have mixed feelings on how the subject matter was handled. I do like on how it simulated the feeling of depression since there is a sense of hopelessness in the world, but what also irritates me is that they crossed out choices that makes a real positive impact in your life and forces you to remain in a state of depression for the entire run, which for those people who are currently or formerly depressed might not find this helpful in any shape or form (at least they gave us a warning about suicidal thoughts). You are basically just some guy in his twenties who currently is in a state of depression possibly because of an inferiority complex constantly comparing himself with his friends and family including his significant other.Unfortunately the soundtrack basically consists of one track on a loop the entire time and for me, it did not deliver much of an impact so that was pretty disapointing because if Depression Quest wasn't good, (which it wasn't) I was hoping the music would at least make up for it.Despite having multiple ""endings"", I had no desire to go back and find out what they are because I feel it would be similar to one another, which is falling into despair with no chance of self redemption with the best ""ending"" is continuing to assess your condition which in no way it feels reassuring which is the purpose of this ""game"" and it acheives it.I do not know much about depression other than it negatively affects the relationships of those around the victim, so to end this, I can only say to those who is or knows someone that is depressed, try to be patient and get assistance as soon as possible.

												I could talk about how the awful writing, the unrealistic and the unfeeling characters and how the main guy or girl seems completely unwilling to help themselves. How I felt no attachment nor had any feelings towards the characters and how frushtrated I was that the text adventure completely striped me of all agency within it, granting me the illusion of choice without actually giving me choice at all. I could talk about how the music is annoying, a harmless little melancholy drum beat that goes on and on whilst you are forced to read text wall after endless text wall and how that music becomes increasingly irrating. I could even possibly give it credit for its portrayal of depression but even then the depressed can and do help themselves everyday, its hard but we do it, the main character in this did not and striping us of the options to be able to help ourselves is just straight up bad designBut instead the reason I think this is a piece of trash is simply that it is not a game.

												I played this game a while ago as the browser version. Didn't like it then, still don't like it now. And here's why:- Dry writing.- Monotonous in every sense of the word: it only has 1 tone.- Thin character development. Nobody in the story is more than just a caricature. Haha, you thought I was gonna use the term ""stereotype"", didn't you? No, that would be too much of a compliment.- Purple prose. Too many words to convey too little substance.- Makes me feel completely detached of any sympathy for a character facing depression. You'd think a story about this subject would have a heart, wouldn't you? Haha, that's cute. There's no heart in this empty and hollow wall of text.Play Narcissu instead for something that actually has character development and actually makes you sympathizes with a character facing depression... and beyond that.Oh, did I mention Narcissu is also free?

												Played this game. Oh, an information to readers: if you see reviews with low  playing time it is because the game is that short. These are not reviews made after just skimming the surface. I played the *WHOLE* game.This said... interactivity is low, the writing is self-conscious and obnoxious. It force-feeds you certain statements, forcing the player in situations they would not be put into. I understand it was intended as simulation for depression, but this must also be a game.As a depression awareness initiative? it's good. As a game? It's not good. Not much content, not much interactivity. Then again, it's free and it's short.I chose to ""not recommend"" the game having in mind a gamer audience.But if the person reading my review is interested in a story, in a look at depression, then i actually recommend that this is played.Bad game.Good depression awareness for public.

If it's depression that interests you, then you'll gain more if you just go and google it instead. If you are looking for a good storydriven text based game then try looking up 'Violet' or 'Digital: A love story' and the games that followed it. :)			"

												This game feels more like a stereotype to depression than anything. Depression is different for everyone and I feel like this was more of a ""what you see in movies"" kind of depression. Sure it hit on key points that people often overlook in depression, but it could have delved a lot deeper. It was mostly about distancing yourself from others and had a lot more anxiety aspects than depression. I think it brings to light a very big issue of mental illnesses being overlooked, but it didn't really convey the message as well as I think they were hoping. Overall good in theory, but not the best in practice.			"

												Wow, what a terrible game. Are you sure you know what a game is? I've had better experiences from YouTube annotations. Also can i consider this ""retro""? since i have not seen Web1.0 since grade school.2/10.As a book though, the story was rather engaging for a short while. This should be a a book/ E-book amateur short story Why amateur? Because the writing could be improved. Though your ""options"" made the main character (MC) look more like a lazy, anti-social, procrastinating and loathing person*(i wanted to use a different word here). MC does not seem like a person suffering from depression. Maybe thats why it's ""(non) fiction"" instead of  ""non-fiction"". see the difference? the brackets or lack thereof emphasize two different meanings. You give players/readers different choices but restricting them whereas in real life, a person suffering from depression or not is free to make those choices, no matter how unlikely. Also your MC has a S.O, a house, no financial problems whsoever, circle of friends and still have depression?3/10.TL;DR : I do not recommend this ""game"" because this (Steam) is a platform for games. This should have been released on a different platform. As an E-Book or audio book for example.Edit: My post in their forums got deleted. Screw this game and it's developers and the mod who banned me. Your draconian abuse of powers should get your burned. You can't censor me. I was not even hating them then. Well, now i'am.			"

												I played this game after enjoying a Five Guys bacon cheeseburger, fries, and a Coke. The food was outstanding: the juicy patties, crispy bacon, melted cheese, and toppings blended so perfectly together that after eating I felt satisfied; in fact, I was in such a good mood after that meal that if you'd asked me to help out in some way, for example like praising your game, giving it a positive review, or bashing others that disagree, I'd gladly do so.HOWEVER, this ""game"" brought that mood down after 5 minutes. If you're the sadistic type, then this might be for you; for the vast majority of people out there, this ""game"" is terrible. While the disclaimer at the beginning warns that this is not meant to be fun, it undermines everything a game should be: FUN. I play games for entertainment and immersion into different worlds, not to read endlessly about depression. If you actually do want to learn about depression, talk to your doctor, psychologist, self-help book, etc., anything but this game. Also, the graphics sucked.But hey, it did get at least 60 FPS and it has controller support.			"

												Hard for me to recommend this 'game'-While it has a lot of things that relate to how depression feels, I don't think anyone who hasn't experienced depression themselves could really understand. I could be wrong on that, but it's just how I feel.That being said, I enjoyed the read- playing through a second time, making as many positive choices as possible to see how the outcome would be, it was an interesting experience to say the least.That also being said, I want to say great work for the team who put this together- I just can't really recommend this to anyone.

												Summary Of EverythingRepresentation of depression: Embarrasingly horrible.Background music & sounds: A N N O Y I N G.Game & storyline: Boring & not that interactive tbh.Look: I could make a better game and I'm the least creative sh!t you'll ever meet.Would I recommend? NOPE.As someone currently struggling with depression, I find most of this game very controversial. Yes, it may be accurate in few areas, but it is also a very vague and inaccurate representation of someone with such a mind. We with depression DO like to hang out with friends and seek help. The answers were extremely pointed and were obviously only leading to one end. So basically, in summary, the representation of a mind with depression is appalling.On top of this, the background noise/music/whatever was the most irritating thing I have ever had to listen to - and I've listened to Justin Bieber. It was EXTREMELY basic and could've had AT LEAST SOME effort put into it.The game itself was just boring. A bunch of text with a few answers at the bottom of every second page? My five year old cousin could make that. There was nothing to interact with or to make the person playing feel like they were experiencing this all first hand.Also, when you're making a game, PLEASE get some interesting pictures. Get something that will make your game look less like a grade 7 IT project and more like a developed, professional game.			"

												While playing this game, I found my mind constantly wandering. That's not good.To put this in perspective, a few weeks ago, I had to play a few text based adventures made by my classmates. The developers were (are) not yet professionals, and some of their games were better than others. However, they were all written in a very similar format to Depression Quest. Very rarely did I slip into a daydream, or wish I was doing something else, when playing my peers' games, something I cannot say for Depression Quest.Self insertion characters, as well as depressed characters, are very hard to write. I should know. I have written characters who have mental illnesses, or have just been down on their luck. I had to rewrite them all several times to keep them likable, realistic, and sympathetic. But the narrative keeps beating me over the head with how depressed the protagonist is. It's pretty much their only character trait. The secret to writing self instertion characters is to give them a backstory and personality of their own. I'm pretty sure Depression Quest Protagonist has a backstory, but a very shallow personality.I'm not overly fond of the piano either. I don't claim to know much about proper music, so to get an idea of how to compose a better piano score, just play Long Live the Queen. It manages to express a wide range of emotions with just the one instrument. (And that game was also developed by a predominantly female crew. :) )However, I'm going to give credit where it's due. Even though I'm not diagnosed with depression, I could feel the weight of needing to protect people close to me, including my own mother, even though Depression Quest Protagonist was the one who needed help.

												Doesn't really go far to try to put you in someone else's shoes. With depression you feel like you don't have that many choices. No, you definitely don't feel you have choices. It's really hard for some people to throw their pride in the trash and go to therapy. This is just a big multiple choice test where one end results in suicide and the other in ""good job, anyone can get better""! After playing through it, I felt like I just had to cleanse my system kinda.That's why I unwind by eating at Five Guys Burgers and Fries.			"

												This game is absolutely terrible. I hated playing this, but I played all the way through. First off: Title is completely misleading, I was completely expecting to be playing an RPG but it turned out this wasnt an RPG... The entire game I thought was like a cinematic where you create the storyline for your character before you start the game. Extremely misleading...Second off: There were a lot of parts where I just wanted to smash my girlfriend, but the game DID NOT ALLOW THIS, EXTREMELY UNREALISTIC. If I was super depressed or anything, I would just smash my girl and be done with my issues.Third off: I dont understand quite why some of the options were completely unavailable to choose from: perhaps I was playing the game wrong? Missed the pre-requisites? Maybe I wasn't a high enough level and after the long cinematic I would be able to choose a class and go back to have those options available? No, not in this game, this game was not a game where you could do whatever you want..My suggestion to the developer : Change the name of your game, I was not on a quest, I did not save the princess, I did not get any poonanny, I didn't make it to the highest level, and I didnt slay the ♥♥♥♥ing dragon - this is not a quest!!!!!!!If you dont wanna change the name of the game, you might wanna make it so that after the whole depression storyline, you can actually move on to the quest and choose a class and♥♥♥♥♥♥ but dont do like Rogue Warrior and Sorcerer either, that's too cliche, you should make it so you dont really have a class, but you choose what skills you wanna be good at, know what I mean?Pros: awesome soundtrack - I personally downloaded the soundtrack and use it when I workoutbeautiful quality images - I felt like I was actually watching netflix at one point when the netflix screen popped upCons: no real questsno classesno boss fightsno xp systema lot of options unavailablecould not smash girlcould not get into hard drugsI would NOT recommend this game to a friend. I would recommend it to someone who I really dislike though.2/10			"

												I've never really written a review so please bear with me.Honestly without even considering gamer-gate I'd give this game alone a 4/10The whole story lacked any sort of real emotional words (whether that's intentional or not) and never really ""drew"" me into the experience. On top of that for the first half of the game what seemed like wrong choices (since they were doing nothing) turned out to be right choices closer to the end of the game. The fact that seeing what I thought would be common sense and the right answer rejected and then picked up later sort of brought the feeling like I could have done better in the game even though, in all likelyhood, I had a near perfect game. I also had an issue with the music. I get that it was supposed to help greaten the story, or maybe even cover over it, but  it wound up distracting me from the story. I of course didn't turn the music off out of fear that the generally labeled ""sound"" would somehow be important later in game (it wasn't). By the end of the game I was not only not affected by the music but I was out right sick of it.Another issue is that some of the points are automatically crossed off. This lead to a more straight-forward feel to the game instead of the (hopefully) intended mood of it being a choose your own adventure. By the end of it I felt like there could have been a completely better and different game if you didn't focus on keeping the character so depressed for half the game. So in summary I feel as though Depression Quest has a lacking storyline, monotone music that will bore you to tears, a confusing choice of story options, and a lack of creative writing that will never really help draw in the player. I rated it a 4/10 because it was honestly not a bad game considering it was free, just medicore at best.  If it was paid I probably would have never bought it because even the cover art draws me off from this title.			"

												This game is dumb. I can't choose what I would in real life so my character is always depressed. I thought the whole reason for going on a quest was to have an end result but this game has none. The character is also a pathetic sap of a person who makes ME want to blow my brains out just reading about his thought process. ""I feel like I should get a cat so I'm not so lonely but I also don't want to take on the burden of having to take care of it even though its LOW MAINTENANCE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!"" :'( BOOHOO!

												Played the flash version of this awhile back. Played this again to see if they’ve made any changes to the possible choices. From what I can tell, no changes were made and the decision making is still very contrived. Would hardly consider this a game about depression. If anything, I’d change the game’s name from “Depression Quest” to “Bob’s Quest, Who Happens to Have Depression With a Set of Very Specific Circumstances.”The thing I hate about this the most (which I don't remember from the flash version) is the music. This works better without any music playing. The fact that it has the piano playing a tune that belongs in a funeral proceeding like that in the background is almost expecting things to turn out poorly.3/10 - Would rather feed Cid bad fish and have Celes jump off the cliff instead.

												After hearing about the controversy, surrounding this game, I thought I would give it a try and form my opinion. I played the game for about twenty minutes, and then uninstalled it. The game struck me as boring, and lacking in any actual gameplay mechanics. I found little interest in the game's story, and the attempts at atmospheric piano music wore thin after it began to loop. As for how this game relates to helping you understand depression, I cannot say. I have never experienced depression myself, but it seems to me that the character in this game is incredibly fortunate to have so many supportive people when they have such a severe problem.

												It's not a game, it's a book. And a bad one at that. The dialogue is rubbish. The choices are very limited and unrealistic, basically boiling down to ""sink into depression because the game says so"". Music is a bad looped piano. This ""game"" doesn't give you any background information or characters' backstories. There's no way you can feel for the characters. Failing at it's main reason for existance, it doesn't even capture depression realistically nor does it get the point out there. The main character laments over his pointless life while having friends, a decent job, family and their loved one, making them sound like a jaded emo kid from a rich family. Why are they not at a therapy? Why do they start at despair?The idea of Depression Quest isn't half bad, but the execution is just painful. Does it work good as a book? No, not at all. 95% of the contenent on fanfiction.net marked as ""angst"" shows depression better than this.  Does it work well as a interactive story? Yeah no. Any choose your own adventure or even visual novel (if you're into them) does its job better than this. As a simulation? Oh please. Read any book on the subject, even if it's under average for better experience than this. It has nothing going for it. Rubbish about an important issue is still rubbish. As a person that experienced depression, I'll tell you this: It's rubbish. Don't waste your time. It's junk like this that drives others to despair thanks to depression being displayed so shallowly in media, with others claiming to suffer from it because it's ""cool, since my favourite video character suffers from it!"". I wonder if Steam realizes that most of the recommendations for crap like this go among the line of ""10/10 cured my cancer"".			"

												I literally have no interest in the controversy surrounding this game and I'm no professional, and I can say that this was an interesting experience. Not good, not bad, interesting. Objectively, it should not be a game. It's a work of (non)fiction that has the sole gameplay mechanic of clicking on stuff. It was mildly interesting to see that the logical things for people with depression to do in order to break out of it were unable to be chosen, but other than that I really don't feel that this was, in any way, shape or form a game. The music was a tad repetitive, but it suited the tone of the game. Actually, its dull, repetitive grind might actually be symbolic, or it could just be lazy design, or an unwillingness/inability to find better music. From the title of (non)fiction, I do believe that it's not unlikely that Zoe Quinn based the nameless character on herself. I ignore the developer and focus on the game, and the problem is that this is not a game. I refuse to make fun of the risk of depression, so I'll just say that this is an interesting view on depression and leave it at that.This is a piece of mildly interactive writing disguised as a game. Only one thing in there actually piqued my interest, and that was the red text that was slashed through. Other than that, I recommend it only for you to play it once and then subsequently ignore. I have no interest in replaying what is, to all intents and purposes a website. Overall, the game itself is, ironically, depressing to play. The dull grey background and the repetitive music give the player a feeling of intense ennui. It's dull and feels like it goes on forever, and thus you should get children to play it before bedtime, as they'll fall right asleep after five minutes.			"

												This is a badly written game, with a message that you get from just reading the title. It seems like the people behind it follows the ""tublr-definition"" of depression, and not the real definition of depression. Every ""choice"" you make is not really a choice, and leads to the same ends (at least as far as I can see), which is probably to strenghten the message that depression is a vicious circle. But this game is just throwing the message down your throat, like if you didn't already know it. On top of that you have a boring, and not even that depressing piano-piece playing in the background all the time, where it would just have been easier to put ""mad world"" on the soundtrack and be done with it, and even come out with a more effective result, if only slightly.And while I am totally for artsy games, and are myself an avid fan of companies like Tale of Tales and the Fullbright Company, this game just doesn't hold any merit, even as being an ""art-game"".Plus, the amount of spelling mistakes in this game is unbearable, and I began skipping a lot of text after a few screens, because of the major unimportance it had, and on top of that the horrible writing and lack of proof-reading. I'm surprised that a game with this great a following could not even get some volunteer fans to proof-read and ""play-test"".Do NOT waste your time on this mess. Go read a book instead, it's a way more fulfilling experience. And if you want something containing a lot of depression or depressing subjects, then let me suggest Edgar Allan Poe's ""The Raven"" or anything by Victor Hugo.			"

												While I felt like this game could be valuable in adding to the larger conversation on mental illness, I was not impressed with the amount of interactivity allowed. I've only given the game about one playthrough, but I found the crossed off options more frustrating than anything. I felt that any option that could've been selected should not have been displayed, as it was just disappointing and caused more negative feelings towards the gameplay than anything.I'm fully aware of the fact that this could represent a person who suffers from depression knowing their options but still finding themselves unable to follow through with them. While I appreciate the sentiments and the depth of the thoughts put into this game, I was not a fan of the seeming lack of interactivity where the devs limited player's choices and I felt that some of the writing was longwinded and a bit unnecessary.

												Depression Quest is a game that delves into depression and its made in the style of a novel but will you want to read through it ? In Depression Quest you play as a un named guy who one day gets Depression and the game tells a story on how he deals with depression. So how is this game ? Its not good its actually quite bad and i honestly dont suggest you play it. The game tries to make you depressed while playing it but all it does is bore you to death. The game is essiantly a novel with choice making which doenst affect the story at all. The game doenst have anything under its belt and all of is just bad. So ill just try to explain everything thats bad about it. The game is incredibly short. You can pretty much breeze through the game in under an hour which already as bad as it is. The games writing is awfull. It makes the game feel unfinished and its not very good. Overall there is another problem with it and that the choices dont affect the story which is stupid which revolves around choices. Overall the only saving grace is that the game is free which all i can say about it. Depression Quest is a boring mess you should only play if youre incredibly bored and dont have a better game to play. I give Depression Quest a 4/10For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			"

												Well...It's not exactly easy to give this game a cheerful thumbs up amidst a sea of negative feedback from others, but this is what I believe and this is what I have to say.Depression Quest is misunderstood. I know that sounds like an excuse, but believe me. I've clocked in one playthrough of it and in that one playthrough, more thoughts crossed my mind than any 12 hours spent on a typical shooter of your choice. In fact, I think it's wrong for me to even bring up the term 'shooter' as though in comparison because shooters are games. That's something many people who criticise this tend to complain most about. That this is a poor excuse for a game. In doing so they miss the biggest and most powerful message that this game does it's ultimate best to send.Depression is not a game.I've read plenty of complaints about this game from people who do have depression that found this game insulting or offensive. The last thing I, or Depression Quest, want to do is devalue those people and their experiences. But I can assure you that the opening message of the game openly admits that it's only trying to give a semblance of depression and what it's like, though they can not, in fact they can never, fully encapsulate everything about it. No two experiences of depression are the same, something the multiple choice nature of this story can only reach for. The game is honest about itself, which I think everyone at least can appreciate. It's not the be-all, end-all definition of depression. It's a taste, based on a limited experience set to try and share the pain that is experienced in the real world.If you have depression, the game warns you beforehand what you're getting into. You may not get along with this game, which is completely okay.As for me? I do not have depression. Nor do I understand depression. But Depression Quest did for me what it set out to do. It showed me - if only just a little - a little of what it's like. In an ironic use of the word, it's through 'play' that I'm given a bit on insight into how hopeless life can be. This is a game that teaches and shares. It might not be music that resonates with you, but the important thing is that it's heard. And I heard it.Another complaint I've read is that your 'character' has no personality and is an empty protagonist. Again, something has been missed. This is a game told through written 2nd-person narrative. You are the main character. This is your life that you're playing through and these are your decisions. How restricted you are is how restricted you could be if you had depression. How you're told that you're feeling is how you could be feeling if you had depression. The game is saying through it's presentation of the story and 'main character' that this could be you. This could be your life. And for some people, this is their life.You're given choices on how to make decisions on what to do, some of which are completely inaccessable. Even though you know that it's there, you can't do it. You're told often how you feel and what your mental state is, so sometimes you'll try to do what seems like the right thing only to realise that your character is only feeling worse. You'll wonder what the right choice was, or even if there ever was a right choice to begin with. Again, not everyone faces the same kind of depression, but to see into the eyes of even one kind is... eye-opening. And regardless of how it ends, you can't simply resolve everything because, once again, this isn't a game. This is life. This is depression. This is no idealised, escapist happy ending for feeling better. This is depression awareness.In summation, no. This game is not fun. You are not meant to have fun playing it. You are meant to think, to consider, to choose and possibly to feel. If that's not what you want, if this isn't what you're looking for, walk away. But if you're up for it, dive. Dive right in. This is less of a game and more of an experience. An experience with depression for those unenlightened to it. Even if you disagree with it and it's portrayal, that's all the more reason to try it.I promise. Devote yourself to one playthrough and you'll come away with something meaningful. Positive or negative, this is a game that redefines what games can be and what they can live up to. This is something more games should aspire to try and perfect.So yes. I recommend it. It's thoughtful, well-written, intricate and with the best of intentions. Above all, it's different. Even if you hate it, you should try it.			"

												First time I played Depression Quest (about a year ago now), I wasn't doing too well mentally. I didn't want to admit anything was wrong to the people around me and felt shameful about many parts of myself. At some point, I came across the game, made by a few indie developers I hadn't heard of before, and decided to give it a shot.Of all of the games I've played, this one has had the biggest impact on my life. It managed to show me that, just maybe, what I was experiencing in my head wasn't ""normal"", but neither did I need to feel ashamed about it. I've since sought out professional help and I'm dealing with my mental issues much better.This game may or may not be for you. It is not a fun game - don't expect to come out all smiles. Some even say it's not a game (not me, although I can understand their point based on their definition of the word). If you're easily triggered by stories or discussions about depression, I recommend avoiding playing it if you're trying to stay in a positive mood.However, if you're looking for an understanding of what depression is like, to help you understand what someone else might be going through... or even yourself, this game offers a perspective. It is not the be all or end all of descriptions of what it is like - for sure, some parts of the game's perspective differ from my own experiences with depression - but if you're looking for a starting place to help you develop that understanding, this game is worth a try.

												Gameplay: 1/10There... isn't any gameplay, really. It doesn't seem like any of your choices really do much of anything, and since there's also no ending, there's no point/motivation anyway. It's essentially just randomly clicking links until you get bored. It's extremely short too; when it finished, I hadn't even reached an hour of play time.Audio: 1/10The audio was just annoying. It's described as being an important part of the experience, but all it is is really plain and awkwardly slow piano music that tries way too hard to sound sad. There was also audio of people talking, which was... okay, I guess. The sound all sounded a little off but I assume that was on purpose.Graphics: 0/10The only graphics were small grainy photographs that appeared over each wall of text. Even without the filters, they look like bad amateur ""photography"" taken with an old webcam. This contributed to the unprofessional feel of the game.Story: 0/10It's aimless. There's no plot. The pacing is really quick, and you find your character suddenly go from miserably depressed to ""barely depressed"" in a span of five minutes. A lot of your choices have no real bearing on what will happen anyway. We aren't at any point made to care about this character, so we're stuck lugging through as a guy we don't care about moans about how miserable his life is. I don't know what emotions we were supposed to be feeling throughout the course of this game, but I assume ""annoyance"" and ""boredom"" are not on the list.It's also not an accurate portrayal of depression. It's so much more multifaceted than it's portrayed here, and it's obvious that the developer has either never experienced depression or was trying to portray a blatantly fake, one-dimensional depression stereotype.Writing: 0/10Since this is a choose your own adventure book rather than a game, I feel the need to comment on the writing. It's nothing short of awful. To visualize, imagine everything that good writers do; then, imagine that the writer aimed to do exactly the opposite. The Choose Your Own Adventure books in the kids section at the library are more thought-provoking and engaging.Overall: -10/10Yes, that's a negative ten. It's a book, not a game, and it's a bad book at that. Why was this greenlit...?			"

												Don't play this game if you suffered or suffer from depression, I'm slightly offended by how stereotypical the whole story is. Depression is too much of a sensitive subject to simply ham-fist it in a game like that. In this case it's simply too shallow and inaccurate.Gameplay wise it's a short novel with multiple choices, it's like a good old choose-you-own-adventure book so no complain here. I would have liked the possibility of choosing the main character's gender or familial situation but it's no big deal.			"

												So, I only played this to see what that whole scandal (and the surrounding mess) on the Internet was about. If it hadn't been for all that, I would not be here writing this.Is depression a real problem for many? Yes.Can it be useful to discuss in a public setting? Sure.Is this the way to do it? Not really.This is like one of those ""Choose You Own Adventure"" kind of little stories, except it's about depression instead of adventure. There's no actual gameplay, just pages of text and a list of choices that branch the narrative out in different ways. The happy choices are crossed out, so you can only pick less happy ones. Depending on your choices, you get different ending text, but considering that the ending was not even particularly interesting, I see no reason to replay it.The continuity in the narrative is so-so. Even after I kept picking ""positive"" choices and having my avatar be open about how things were, and so on, for quite some time, the text would occasionally revert to my avatar being back to the bottom without recognizing the previous progress ""upwards"" in the text, except for the three status phrases always shown near the bottom. It felt rather forced, I must say.Also, regarding the way this whole narrative is presented, I don't get why they would choose to make the reader's perspective one where the narrative keeps pushing ""you feel this"", ""you feel that"", ""you think this"", when clearly that is not going to be the case. It just pushed me, as a reader, away. Combined with the heavy handed narrative that gives the impression that your choices don't necessarily matter all that much, it comes close to breaking even this basic ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" structure. What were they thinking?They ask you to play with sound on, as it's supposed to be part of the experience, but it's really just annoying. Poor piano music and the occasional annoying sound effect just bugged me. Visually, the presentation looks like a bunch of white web pages with black text, a picture here and there and some links, which I suppose might be pretty close to the truth. The whole thing feels as though it had little to no effort put into anything outside the text itself, which perhaps had some effort put into it but seemingly suffers from a lack of storytelling skill.To summarize, this product of just barely interactive fiction did not tell me anything new about depression, nor did it make me more aware of it than I was previously. If someone claims it's educational, don't believe them. It really isn't.It also has no real entertainment value, so no points there. Those ""professional"" reviews shown on the store page are just a bunch of non-sense, which is admittedly not all that surprising.Decent products typically exist to do a job for a consumer, be it to educate, to still hunger, to save time or money, or whatever. I can't think of any job that this thing does for a gamer or reader. Perhaps it serves as a vent of sorts for its creators, I don't know. What I do know is that I cannot think of any good reason for this to be on Steam.I wasted a little over half an hour on this, but you don't have to. If it wasn't for the publicity this got from that big mess on the Internet, this little story piece would have been largely ignored and quickly forgotten, and for good reason. It's just not worth your time, so go spend that time on something worthwhile, like doing something fun and/or hanging out with someone who needs you.			"

The game doesn't help the player understand depression, how to cope with it, or how to respond appropriately to others who suffer with depression. As good as it's intentions may be it didn't convey it's purpose properly and could be done better.			"

												I will be honest, I only heard of this game because of the contreversy surrounding the creater. But amid the turmoil, I found myself somewhere I didn't want to be -a particularly hateful state of mind. I've said things I am not proud of and decided to cool off and approach the axis of this whole ordeal with the presence of mind to be as objective and purely observant as possible, and leaving behind any intial personal feelings and bias so that I may gain a perspective. I am not a professional video game critic in the least bit, but I do write and edit people's stories as a hobby, so I like to think that I have a credible right to review this.With all that said, and after playing through, I do no recommend this game. Foremostly -and this critical point has been brought up before- can this really be considered a game? It is a digital choose-your-own-adventure novel that feels like it belongs to a site dedicated to ametuer fiction or to an art blog like Deviantart -not a video game distributer. I feel Depression Quest would of been more appropriate and more well received if it were distributed on an art site where skill progression and opinionated pieces are welcome. But Steam brings with it a great expectation, and you can be hard hit by the community if you fall short of it with even the greatest intentions. There just isn't a place for a glorified book in steam, and I feel that alone warrants my negative recommendation.But beyond where and how the developers chose to distribute Depression Quest, the game falls flat in a number of ways. Despite a fairly strong start, the protagonist becomes insufferable and I find it impossible to sympathize half the time, and this is due to, for the most part, the constant repitition of the same theme of ""I'm sad"". The chapters blend together as a blur of melancholy and it becomes increasingly difficult for me to go on as it progresses to the point that it is so dull it becomes a chore to keep on reading. Each page felt like a rehash of the previous with a different background and theme like a depression Madlib. My determination to see it through to the end to gain perspective on the situation was the only thing that kept me going, and I otherwise would of just stopped half way through if this wasn't the case.Then there is the sporadic grammar mistakes, colorless style, lackluster attempt at scenery and visuals, bluntness in the expression of emotions and feelings where I'm just told how he feels and am expected to just accept it -not a sight of subtley to be seen. And there's just a general lack of direction, with what would seem obvious to be the main goal of being 'not depressed' always being touched upon but never probed. Without the going into detail of the process of recovering and coping with depression, all this is is page after page of complaining and whining, with brief breaks to choose between an obviously good choice and the obviously bad one -which brings me to my last point.Literally the only gameplay mechanic the game provides is terrible. There is no critical decisions to be made. One is always the best choice with the rest at varying degerees of bad, making the story linear and defeating the purpose of a choice system, and therefore effectively turning this into a book entirely. The only reason to choose the bad decisions is just to speed through it again to see how it ends differently -and spoiler: it isn't suicide. Yes, what you would expect be the greatest and most terrible end the character could possibly find in game about depression is not that. Not to say that I was hoping to see someone, even fictional, lose themselves to the struggle with depression, but it would add such a greater depth when the reppercussions of not being able to solve your issues with depression is ultimately depth at your own hands. If this game achieved anything, it definitely looks like a depressed person designed it, but it needs a writer that can bring across the feeling of depression and have it seep into the reader with the protagonist's actions and thoughts without the writer themselves getting absorbed in self-pity. If this was a story I received from a upstart writer, I would praise him/her/whoever for what they accomplished, but would stress that they put asside a few more months to work on it and make it everything it could be. However; this is a professional, million dollar site that I and everyone else expects a higher standard from, and this game is below that standard. Its only saving grace is that it's free.			"

												Okay this isn't going to be a negative review for it being ""Not a game"" as that's just a pretty ridiculous thing to complain about. Depression Quest, as a product, simply can't exist as anything else other than an interactive experience which at least today, we call a game. It can't be a movie because of the multiple choices, but it also can't be a ""Choose your own adventure"" book because of the fact that not all choices are available, so it has every reason to be a game. Sorry guys but not all games have to be about winning or losing anymore; whether you like that or not.Anyway yeah Depression Quest, I'm giving this a Negative review not because of what it is, but how it does what it wants to do badly. There are good aspects to the game, I personally like how the more depressed you are the less options you're available to choose, you know it's a nice blend of storytelling and gameplay. Also I dig the grain filter on the images, it's pretty fitting as depression's about exhaustion and the grain makes things seem well... exhausted.But that's about it for what I like about Depression Quest. Depression Quest simply doesn't do its task well. For starters the choices you have to solve the depression are PAINFULLY obvious. If someone was to tell someone with depression how to solve it, they'd say ""Take Medication, see a therapist and talk with people about your feelings"", things which are much easier to say than do, and while could help depression, it's not necessarily all there is to helping it. Well that's all you need to do to solve it according to the game. A small child could solve the character's depression in this as you simply just do the things that seem helpful. The game could have presented player with harder to understand options, have the more positive options not always be the highest available one, anything. But it doesn't so solving depression is just easy according to the game.And I know you're supposed to put yourself in the character's shoes but you can't really. You're basically told how to feel about situations and characters around you. The game could have very much benefitted from things such as interacting with the co-workers you don't get along with to see why we don't relate to them, but basically the game just tells us we don't which makes it harder for me to be in the character's shoes. Now I'm not depressed. I enjoy my life quite a bit. However even if I was depressed, I'd still be hesitant to relate with this character. I won't know the people in this game, I won't experience the job I hate, I won't feel the lack of motivation from this character when it comes to choosing Depression Quest's choices as I'm never going to face consequences of actions because of my lack in place of this story.  All depression quest boils down to is obvious advice on how to treat depression which COULD help but I can see it not working for a lot of people... however I still don't think it shouldn't exist.  This is a game which is incredibly hard to make. You need to write a LOT to convey this character's life, you need to make the player think a lot with some very complex choices, among other things. Hell, as weird as this sounds, maybe give the player really tedious and unskippable things to read or do that will help make the player feel more exhausted. I don't know. Point is, depression quest could be an alright tool, but as it stands it's just not good enough for somebody with depression to have as a help. I'm sorry. "

												This game isn't a game at all. It lacks content, the subject around the plot is incredibly mundane and not enjoyable. Finally, this looks like a game fabricated in the 80's. Text based adventure games haven't aged well, but this game wouldn't pass the bar back in the 80's. Video games are supposed to be an escape from reality, not a center focus around some of the worst parts of it. The reason why this game doesn't fit the bill is simply because of that. Depression is not a good plot for a video game. Maybe a subplot for a specific character, but this doesn't sell. If you're going to make a game based around a mental illness, then I first suggest that you don't do that and instead make a game that is actually enjoyable no matter who's playing it.. I've never suffered from depression, so this game is foreign to me and I cannot connect with the main character(s) at all. That is another point where this game falls so incredibly short. Maybe this would've been alright to donate to a hospital that deals with mental illness, but even at that this ""game"" would need a massive graphical (sorry, text based adventures dont cut it) and content overhaul. 0/10			"

It fails to really shows highs and lows, but it does touch them. Losing sight of friends, unable to focus on projects, the fear  and anxiety that comes with trying to find help.I'm not going to allow the recent drama surrounding the author to tarnish the intention of this interactive adventure, but I can honestly say I probably wouldn't have heard of it other wise. I congratulate them on attempting to bring awareness to a mental disease that plagues way too many. However, I wish it was grittier. Not everyone gets it as easy as the character in the story. Some people worked very hard just to get to his level of listlessness and confusion. There is so much more that COULD be done here.			"

It really doesn't need to be on Steam.It is a glimpse at the average year of someone with depression.Its much too similar to my own life.Its also way too short. It fails to really shows highs and lows, but it does touch them. Losing sight of friends, unable to focus on projects, the fear  and anxiety that comes with trying to find help.I'm not going to allow the recent drama surrounding the author to tarnish the intention of this interactive adventure, but I can honestly say I probably wouldn't have heard of it other wise. I congratulate them on attempting to bring awareness to a mental disease that plagues way too many. However, I wish it was grittier. Not everyone gets it as easy as the character in the story. Some people worked very hard just to get to his level of listlessness and confusion. There is so much more that COULD be done here.			"

												I wanted to check out this game and see if it stood up on its own merit, barring all the controversy around its developer. It doesn't. I've played some games similar to this style, such as the infinitely better Digital: A love story, and this one is kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Overall, the visual style is pretty plain. Each screen is essentially block text of black font on white backgrounds with 3 polaroids at the top showing some pictures that look like something jacked from shutterstock. The game introduces you to the depressive protagonist, a shut-in with a deadend day job and a sympathetic girlfriend, and presents you with choices on how to deal with different problems in their daily life. This could be anything from fights with said girlfriend to adopting pets. While this could potentially be interesting, the writing is pedantic and completely artless. Normally, prose is probably the last thing you would give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about in a game, or you would at least be willing to look past it. Unfortunately, this is what boils down to an interactive adventure novel, meaning looking past the garbage writing would require you to find meaning or at least enjoyment in the menu layouts. The message is delivered in a very heavy handed and completely unengaging way. Each choice event is usually 3-5 options. Of those, 1 or 2 are red and crossed out options that those of a more balanced brain chemistry would most likely choose. Obviously, the player is supposed to see these options and feel frustrated, much like how a person with depression would feel, given their inability to help themselves or make the ""right"" choice. Where a more talented developer would have used visual cues/environment/well-written script to make the player feel depressed, they instead decided to use a very simplisitic crutch. The truth is, I really do like these kinds of games. D:LS, Slouching Towards Bedlam, Cypher, etc. Unfortunately, this game is just really not good. To be honest, its pretty boring and nothing deserving of a download. I normally wouldn't even bother to write a review, but I felt that it was good to have some posts from people who are relatively impartial. I could care less about the politics of the developer and all the other controversy surrounding this game. I just wanted to say that Depression Quest, when judged solely on its own merit, is not worth your time.			"

												To call this game a game would be a misnomer, its essentially a tumblr blog with hyperlinks in which you are given a couple of different option all ending at the same points. However more insultingly then calling this a game is calling this depression quest: The person depicted in this game isn't depressed they are an emo kid who derives enjoyment out of pretending to be depressed so they have something to cry about on their tumblr page to the people they are pretending to be ""deep"" with.Let me make this clear, depression doesn't make you stupid, which this character clearly is. From my point of view this game was clearly made by someone TRYING to be insightful, but who had a less then terrible grasp on the source material. This project is to accurate portrayal of mental health issues what Victorian era wandering womb & hysteria diagnosis’s are to modern medicine: In no way related.Whatever this project is, one thing is for certain, it needs to not be on steam: Steam is a place for games, not emo masturbation fantasies conveyed in tumblr blogspot style wall of text, with annoying eye straining animation, repetitive image use & white noise static for music.Watching this game scramble for mediocrity and failing is just painful to watch: I'm not depressed, but i'm pretty sure i would be if this was the best thing i could create given how much support the author was given to succeed.

												Depression Quest, is not a game. It is an experience. Unfortunately, the experience is more akin to sitting in a DMV waiting line and reading the dictionary at the same time, only even more tedious. First and foremost, the main portion (and by this I mean all of it) is reading and choosing some ""action"" that leads to... more reading! . Yes! I totally want to read some lame story to pass the time instead of, you know, PLAYING something. This could be forgivable if not for the fact that the story isn't even that good to begin with. And by that, I mean that I enjoyed reading Wuthering Heights more than this story. Wuthering ♥♥♥♥ing Heights was more interesting than this. What really bothered me the most about this was that the choices you were given almost never go through because your ""character"" is just too full of self-pity to do anything you say. Way to make me feel like I have ANY control whatsoever over a gaming experience.Imagine if an actual game did this. Suppose you're playing some Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, and you come across a Blue Tektite. You have some choices here.1. Swing your sword2. Shoot it with an arrow3. Bomb it4. Megaton Hammer it into the groundSo then you choose the best (or most fun) option, but then a text box appears ""Link tries to lift the Megaton Hammer to hit the Tektite, but feels his scaly arm skin scratch on the inside of his tunic and is reminded of his moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.* And then Link drops the hammer and leaves without bothering with the Tektite to wallow in self-pity.That's not FUN. That isn't satisfying whatsoever. That's just annoying.Now, I know that there are some ""games"" where you choose the best options and if you choose a wrong option, bad things happen... but this is EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU CHOOSE SOMETHING. After about halfway through the game I had a sort of epiphany. The goal of the game isn't to understand how it feels to be depressed... Well.. wait yes it is.But by making you depressed.Depression has a few key symptoms that include: -Difficulty concentrating, remembering details, and making decisions.Difficulty concentrating: I'm so bored that I can barely finish a paragraph at a time.-Fatigue and decreased energy.Even scrolling down feels like an effort to me.-Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, and/or helplessness.""I can't do anything worthwhile in this game so why bother?""-Feelings of hopelessness, regret and/or pessimism""This game is hopeless and it's so boring. I really regret downloading it, even though it was free.""Only see, in this case it doesn't get better. Sure, there's an ending that is ""happy"", I guess? Honestly I stopped caring long before I got to the ending so I can't really be invested enough to care about the ending. The point is, the game never gets better. So if you're the protagonist. you never get to enjoy life (the game). The only way to get out is to play through and feel like♥♥♥♥♥♥..Or turn the game off (suicide)I'd tell the creators of this game to try harder next time, but that would require them trying at all in the first place.Depression is a serious mental problem. Depression is not a good premise for a game, because depression is not a game. By that token, Depression Quest is not a game. If I wanted to learn about depression, I'd look it up on Wikipedia, not play a ""game"" about it. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to ""commit suicide"" and go play an actual game.			"

												first of all, THANK THE GODS that you can turn the sound off... if the developer was actually trying to make people upset, the same boring cycle of slow piano chords ceaselessly droning in the background definitely was a good start. for a game that is mostly comprised with text and story driven, it's not going to win any writing awards, and has some major grammatical issues. It also literally defeats the purpose of gaming for most people (escapism, fun, excitement, etc.), and thrusts you into an extremely boring story filled with a 2-dimensional protagonist (you) and 1-dimensional supporting characters. It was utterly annoying that any and all ""good"" choices in this choose your own adventure story were crossed out, and the only choices you were allowed to make were either self destructive or passive aggressive.plus, it was a little weird that the main character is actually doing pretty well overall. has a decent job, has a great girlfriend that's super understanding and supportive, family that also are nice and helpful. purposely choosing self destructive behavior to drive people away just resulted in the glaringly obvious to happen (treat gf really terrible and she leaves), and removes the more passive aggressive choices to only leave the more self destructive ones (except adopting a cat adds one or two new options to play with the cat randomly instead of watching Netflix) but the ending is still pretty much the same boring ending as when you choose all the good things.overall impression: somewhere between 'meh' and 'why would anyone play this?'

												In short: it’s not very good. From download completion to game end, it took me one hour to complete (note that this was with frequent breaks for me to vent to friends on skype chat about the experience. Other people I know said they finished the game in 25 minutes). The art design of the game was questionable and didn’t match up with the game very well, the music was ill-fitting and cliche, the game design was ineffective at achieving its goals of reflecting the mindset of a person suffering from depression (which I know from firsthand experience), the writing was bland and there were some choices regarding presentation that were extremely baffling.For a more thorough explanation of the problems I had with this game, read here: http://daemonpro.tumblr.com/post/95265081744/in-this-post-a-douchenozzle-who-has-never-made-a-game "

												Speaking as a person with depression, the story feels much too short, the character is difficult to get attached to, and the feeling of depression is conveyed very poorly, as the game makes it far too easy to see what choices are the best for one's mental health. Additionally, simply by showing the choices that could be made if one was not so depressed, the game breaks immersion and makes it even more difficult to get invested in the character or plot.			"

												Interactive Fiction was one of the first genres of videogames that I ever got seriously into. The reasons why are mainly by accident: I was a pre-teen looking for fun things play online that had a little more depth than crappy flash games. A google search landed me on an Infocom database site, and learning how to use WinFrotz, I entered the magical world of text based, parser command games. Zork, Andrew Plotkin, Emily Short, Chickzilla, Slouching Towards Bedlam, Aaron A. Reed (Blue Lacuna), Taco Fiction. These games and authors of games shaped what I know, love, and enjoy from the genre.Playing Depression Quest was difficult for me. The reason being because it does so many things that turn Interactive Fiction players like me off. One of the biggest mistakes was doing the age old WOT, or Wall of Text mistake. The game likes to open, and continue, to barrage you with walls of text, and this makes for terrible flow in IF games. No one wants to sit and read a wall of text every time they make a decision. It's a typical amateur IF game mistake that I'm surprised has been allowed in a game published on Steam. The second biggest issue with this game is the lack of choice. I get that part of the reason that half of the choices are crossed out and unusuable are because they are the ""rational"" or ""good"" choices that a person who does not suffer depression would typically choose. But that's not a good excuse for crappy design, because I am no longer playing the game: the game is instead playing itself. The only feeling of ""helplessness"" that Depression Quest seems to evoke is that of surrendering all choice to the game. Which is another amateur IF mistake.And yes, I get it, that is the point of Depression Quest. To take away your choice because when you suffer from depression you don't have one. But that's where the word ""game"" comes into question here: is Depression Quest a game? The reason I know it is not, is simple.It says so right in the WoT introduction: ""This game is not meant to be a fun or lighthearted experience."" It's not meant to be fun. So of course how can it be a game? Nor is it a CYOA (choose your own adventure), because despite the feature of choice, the choices ultimately effect literally nothing, and are always extremely similar to one another.So why is it on Steam? Well I guess it's in an effort to raise awareness that Depression is a real problem. So is it a good education tool? I don't really think so; it doesn't do it's job as well as it should. There were games that made me feel like the person I was playing easily, not from experience, but from sheer authorship alone, and the way it was designed. That was Blue Lacuna, and when I look at this game, Blue Lacuna, in terms of trying to get the player to understand how something feels, makes Depression Quest look kind of...lazy...in terms of what it tried to do in order to simulate an experience. Blue Lacuna, unlike Depression Quest, didn't ""tell me how I felt"" constantly, it evoked that feeling by building the feeling around me. I felt it. And like Depression Quest, it had the same outcome: an insurmountable dread that you cannot escape, no matter how much I clung to the time, place, and people I was living with. It came and it took me regardless, no matter what I felt, or what I did.tl;dr:While Depression Quest may bring depression awareness to Steam, that's about as far as it goes. Honeslty I don't think this should have been made a game. Using words is a very hard way to convey a feeling. And other than that, there's a difference between making a game with an agenda, and making a game with an agenda done well.			"

												This 'game' is not a game.It's text-based and basically you read long paragraphs about the character, who you are supposed to reflect yourself in to, and then click various hyperlinks to see where the story goes from there. In the beginning there are a few hyperlinks within the post that tell you a little about your relationships with your parents, brother, and your girlfriend, as well as your job. After this, it talks about the following days with hyperlinks on what to do next at the bottom. This is where I have my problem.I have depression. Out of all of these 'choices', normally one or two of them are in red and have a strike through them meaning that these are options that you cannot do because your character is simply incapable of doing because of their depression. The other choices? One is the 'right choice' of doing something that brings them out with their friends or to work on their side project, and the other two are normally 'withdraw from social interaction', 'nothing, I don't want to talk about my problems,' or, 'I'm going to go back to sleep.' Most of the 'bad options' made the person with depression seem lazy and that people with depression just don't want to deal with what's bothering them. Are you ♥♥♥♥ing kidding me?Depression is different for everyone and what this game seems to recommend is to get out and do things. Sure, that helps a little, but it never gets to its core. Not everyone is going to get help from that, and not everyone gets better by taking anti-depressants or medication.I'm offended by this game. After playing it I felt angry. Clearly, they have no idea what depression really is.			"

												Where to start. This game looks like it was written in Flash by someone unfamiliar with how to create a project in Flash. Seriously, I've seen students who - in their first few weeks of learning how to create Flash projects - had created something far, far better than this.The writing and design of this title is simply poor. Choices, when prompted, often don't make any sense, even in the context of psychology (not to mention game design). e.g. if someone doesn't like cats it doesn't mean they're going to get depressed - dog people exist too. This game does nothing for the great cat people/dog people divide in our society - instead of taking the opportunity to mend fences, the author insists that people who don't like cats are depressed loners, longing to slit their wrists.As someone who has suffered on and off again with depression my entire life, along with extensive counseling and even some psychology coursework, I went into this game expecting to understand the subject matter better than most. Instead I'm given a series of overly simplified, trite choices created by a team who didn't understand the first step in game design: understand your subject matter. If you're going to make a first person shooter, you need to spend your time looking at other first person shooters, learning what makes them good and bad, then try to create a game that's compromised of more good elements than bad. When you're going to make a game dealing with psychology,.. you damn well better have a firm grasp of psychology. Anyone who was actually depressed would likely end up getting more depressed by ""playing"" this, thanks to the boorish way the authors deal with their subject.I recommend in the strongest possible terms that everyone simply avoid this title at all costs, it has no redeeming value whatsoever.

												Thought I would review this game to get an alternate opinion of it.Depression Quest is an interactive fiction game and not a modern one. It is in the vein of early computer games that were entirely text-based and derived from narratives. I think that is one of the reasons reviews are mixed on it. It doesn't fit the mold of what a ""modern"" computer game is. Us old fart garmers will remember this type of gaming experience with fondness.That being said, I can really only reccommend  the game for people who want to experience or learn about clinical depression or people who want to deal with their clinical depression in a positive way.It is ingenious in its audacity and for tackling an often overlooked mental disease. It is innovative for its attempt to recreate the experience of a disease at a very realistic level. All the little things are there, such as the thought among many depressives that they don't actually have a disease when they are able to deal with it effectively (yes, that is a real thing) or excusing your tiredness for simply being tired, instead of the effects of a disease. Effects on concentration, focus, seeking diversion (as a result of the disease, not as a way to find enjoyment as it is with many people), social anxiety, interpersonal relationships, and others are all modeled. It takes the form of a choose-your-own-adventure (as interactive fiction generally is) and so there is some replay value to it. I personally played it several times and, since I don't know how the different paths of the game are determined, it's actually kind of fun (yes, in that ruminating depressive sort of way!) to tease out how the choices are rendered.This is a game that does not have a wide appeal and is a very niche product. It is a game that has a therapeutic effect for suffers and/or is a way for the curious to ""play"" with the disease and challenge some preconceptions of yours or your preconceptions of those who suffer from the disease. If you are even remotely interested or intrigued, I'd suggest it because it is free. Just realize that the ""fun"" of the game is derived from  learning about something, not derived from entertainment.			"

												This game fails in all it intends to be; it's not interactive, it's not entertaining nor is it particularly well written. It doesn't give depression more publicity, nor does it really make anyone who doesn't suffer from depression understand it better. It is, at best, an insensitive attempt to create an interactive story around a buzzword. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anyone, as if you have depression it will make you feel worse, and if you don't it will build upon the stereotypes society already has built up around the illness. If you want to play a thoughtful game about the subject, please go and buy Actual Sunlight. It is much better. Please, if you feel you're suffering from depression, reach out to someone, and if you know someone else who is, encourage them. Don't be like this game.			"

												Bloody awful game. It is a internet hyperlink click simulator. I think there are websites out there that offer 5min tests to see if you are alcoholic, pregnant or have depression. This game is like these 5min instant tests. The annoying music makes it hard to concentrate and read the dialogue. The dialogue itself is super cheesy and unrealistic.These 5min tests don't belong to steam in my opinion. Atleast make a different genre to avoid them flood popular genres in the future.I am not really sure what the developer tries to do with this game but it appears to be that the games forums should really be called depression quest. It is full of banned people and locked threads.2/10 beause the interface is working most of the times and doing the test + writing a review for it shortened my wait for a different game to download faster.

												I should say many things about this game. If this was game not free, it would be criminal. It's an interactive whine-fest from a white American feminist with little understanding of the condition known as depression. If you have depression, I strongly urge you to stay away from this game, as it will not help you. Any positive rating on this game is utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. When a girl claims to support feminism then gets boned for ratings, it's completely infuriating.tl;dr Five Guys Burgers and Fries menus are better stories than this. 0/10			"

												I gave this game the benefit of the doubt despite the negative reviews. I downloaded it, and with an open mind gave it a shot. After the first 14 pages of incredibly boring dialog, I had to stop reading and just start randomly choosing options. The play-through took me exactly 15 minutes. I never plan on playing this again.How this took more than 1 person to make is beyond me. This literally could be made in html/javascript as a website, and it would still be horrible.Anyone involved in this should seriously be ashamed of themselves, and I have no idea how anyone enjoyed this. Perhaps they are time travelers from the 80's who were only used to textbased M.U.D.S.? Even then I'm sure many of them would be dissapointed.I wasn't before, but I am now suicidal because of this game. Thanks Zoey.			"

												This ""text based depression simulator"" is pretty on point with how depression presents itself upon a persons actions and thoughts, however the simulator tells you again and again how much you care about your loved ones, but never lets you act on these variables as they are presented to you. It seems the simulator just really wants to drive the point home that depressed people are sad all of the time. Feeling sad isn't called ""depression"", feeling sad is called ""feeling sad"" If I didn't have depression, and was told to play this game to learn more about what depressed people deal with day-to-day, I'd spend more time making the depressed person feel worse by asking them if they were ""okay"" all of the time. What depressed people want are people that understand that a depressed person is depressed, rather than trying to sit them down and lecture them or...try to tell them how they can help. Depressed people are healed by being in an environment where they can forget about their self-loathing for a little while, or by doing something that takes their mind off of it. It doesn't help when someone is at your back asking you how they can help when you show any signs of coming down. The ending to this needs to have an addendum to letting people know that getting someone who is depressed to forget about it for a while is all the help they need to do. Anything else is just pity or unrealistic.			"

This game makes recovery seems much more simple than it actually is (basically in this game you just need to force yourself to go out a few times and surprise!!! you're much better!!!! how come all the depressed people in the world haven't tried this!!!!!!), the characters have almost no personality and there's no plot at all. I don't think this game can help people without depression understand people who have it better and I have no idea why the developers have put on the game that it could do it.Since it's free I don't regret checking it out, but I don't recommend it to anyone.

												This is a really good game. It successfully emulates what it is like to be depressed. If you can immerse yourself in this game you can find you self living or even re-living a very realistic situation that is definitely worth the experience (assuming this won't serve as some sort of trigger for you). The only downside is that if you don't get yourself immersed, you can play very gamey-like and just hit the common-sense choices to get the happy ending.If you do like to get immersed into a good story however I would definitely recommend this for you. I loved it.			"

Not A Good Game.Depression Quest = Depression - QuestOkay, sooo...  I'll preface this by saying that there has been a lot of ""controversy"" about DQ in gaming spheres.  Most of us that are clued in to the gaming subculture know all about it and I'll only bring it up just this once during the review.  The only thing I will say about it is that this review is utterly detached from the poopstorm.  I'm here to tell you what I think of DQ as a game in it's own right.ProTip: If that already sounds too ""SJW"" for you, this game is definitely NOT for you.  Don't download it, don't install it, don't worry about it.  Everyone else, read on.Download this FREE game if you: Are interested in learning a bit more about depression. Are looking for a very casual narrative experience. Are interested in what all the ""hullabaloo"" is about. Aren't a Burgers & Fries poopstain.Decline this quest if you: Want interesting gameplay, such as puzzles, shootmans, or jumping.  This is not for you. Do not have an open mind about clinical depression. Are looking for something that is ""fun"".  This is a game about DEPRESSION. Are scurred of scurry SJW skeltins hurtin' your fee fees!The Bottom LineAs the title suggests, this really isn't a ""good"" game, or even much of a game at all.  It's a short story exploration and there is no real ""win"" condition exactly, no highscores, no frag count, and no real ""questing"" despite the title.In short, it kinda really sucks as purely a game.That isn't why you should play DQ though.  You should play DQ if you think you may suffer from depression and don't know what to do.  You should play DQ if you have ""that friend"" who seems nice but is always a ""loner"" and you don't know why.  You should play DQ to learn more about a prevalent mental health issue that suffers from intense stigma.Is Depression Quest the ""answer"" to depression?  Hell no.  It is only one facet of the story.  Depression is something that plays out differently for everyone that experiences it, and no one experience is the end-all definition of the condition.  That all said, however, there were a few situations in DQ that hit close to home for me, despite other scenarios not being necessarily so.The take-away here is that you should absolutely not feel alone and that you should seek SOME sort of help.  From family, from friends, and your other loved ones.  Depression's best ally is isolation.Don't expect a lot from this game.  It's not a revolution.  It doesn't even say anything new.  It is just another helpful point of view in the overall discussion and nothing more.  Really.  That is it.It's also free, but you can donate if you wish.  That's really all there is to it.  After all the hyperbole I fully expected to be forcefully neutered by a crack team of dye-color haired SJW cuck-warlords just for playing it.  Nope.  Just a regular♥♥♥♥♥little text adventure about a condition that affects many people in our societies, regardless of politics.			"

												I've played this game for a bit on the Depression Quest site. And I thought the title was strange. Am I on a quest to being depressed?There is absolutely no gameplay whatsoever. You just click hyperlinks and just keep reading. Think Homestuck, but no interesting visuals, no engaging dialogues/text to read. You can't really seem to 'connect' with the main character (depressed you).I like visual novels. And I've played quite a bit of date-simulation games mainly for the pretty visuals.But 'Depression Quest' isn't a visual novel; it's literally a novel digitized with some somber music playing on a loop. It's so full of text I doubt anyone who's looking to play an actual game would want to spend a quarter of an hour on this. You'll prefer reading all the books in Skyrim.You get options:> Continue with 'game'> Quit and play something more worthwhileSome options being crossed-out so I see no point in even listing them as a choice.I'm much in support of helping people rid of depression but this isn't helping me or anybody i know who has depression. I'd very much prefer not to waste my time playing this 'game' and actually talk to my depressed friend.Depression Quest lives up to its name in getting you Depressed. For real.			"

												I do not recommend this as a game, and as any other form of medium it is only subpar.  The writing is average, with thankfully few-no mistakes (the texts are humorously mispelled at times).  The red text options are unfortunately a slight against the game I have when there are 3-4 good options and it only lets you select one.  With some love, this could be made both enjoyable and whatever it qualifies as currently.  Anything on Steam that begins by saying it is not enjoyable does not belong, in my opinion.  It has potential, but it does not pull my heart strings or entertain me.  Unfortunate failure of an idea with potential.			"

												Emotionally Exhausting. Plagued by over use of certain terms(see above) Depression Quest is all about, you guessed it, depression. Unfortunately as a game topic I find it to be completely lackluster and unimaginative. Basically the whole premise of this game is you being ""emotionally exhausted"" after some encounter or other, and then going home and sleeping. That's it. If only there was a 'write on tumblr' button so you could write about how you were triggered by a stapler and became even more depressed. It's like they took all of the depression-themed tumblr cliches and threw them into a video game.2/10 They used a Daft Punk song for the party scene			"

												I'm not a fan of Zoe Quinn.Is it weird that the story describes me so well, yet has so many flaws to it that I don't understand? It's like as if they have picked at my brain and took my life apart but added extra things to it to spice it up a bit, like parents that care or a job that I can sustain but I hate?I've only been through a bit of the game and it has turned out okay. To be honest, even though it's a text based adventure, it feels like there is just TOO much text. It branches off important subjects that you don't know properly, like your relationship with your girlfriend Alex, your parents, your job, your brother that you're jealous of, etc. when it feels like it shouldn't really be describing each important subject with such detail. They should have just added minor explanations of certain things to help you become acquainted with the character that you are portraying, rather than create entirely new stories out of them that make it hard to catch up with and remember.The idea of depression being different for everyone is both true and false, and they do have that kinda knotted down properly in the beginning of the game with an explanation, but I don't think they should say to stop playing it immediately if you are suicidal or anything close simply because it's a falsity of something relevant to you.I like the idea of the game to help explain to people not suffering from depression what it's like, but it just doesn't fit well. It says that it's not an explanation or detail of depression because it varies between people, but it nails it down to just one type of depression, contradicting itself in the process of the entire game.

												This is utter tripe. Not even as an avid adventure gamer could I find enjoyment out of this. I suffer from depression and almost a year ago I ended up in the hospital due to it, but this experience, and i use that term lightly, was not something I could relate to.The thing about depression, and it's associated pain is that it's individualized, no one will know what it is like to be in your shoes, and a video game about your experience won't help anyone come to any realizations.This doesn't show what depression is like, nothing can and since everyone experiences it differently, I suggest you pick up a psychology book if you really want to understand depression.There isn't much here of substance, it's all very arbitrary and lacking. It looks like a 5 year old designed it and athestically it looks like it was made with windows 95 in mind.Ironically, the game made me more depressed than I already was, but depressed in a different way... depressed that this made it through greenlight. This doesn't belong here. It's not a game.The entire time I was playing it, I was pigeon holed into making choices I didn't want to make, and as a person with depression many of the choices that were blocked for me were choices that I would make. I felt a strong sense of a victim mentality from the ""author"".Just like anyone with depression - We are but a victim of our own minds. She is a victim, but her own victim, and it doesn't sound like she has enough of a grasp on depression to be trying to educate others on it. Having depression doesn't make you a good teacher on the subject.There isn't much to be had here, it's basically a choose your own adventure book, except you can't really make your own choices. Only the choices of the author. Which is the point, I get it - but it is poorly done.Thumbs down.			"

												This game is the video game equivalent of valium, and is extremely offensive to someone like me.As a sufferer of deep depression, the creator of this game is so far off base. Depression is not you feeling sad or upset that you're behind on that big project, or worried that your girlfriend might not be completely happy with your relationship. Depression is a numbness. There are days when leaving the house feels like the biggest accomplishment on the planet. There are no distractions from depression. You can't just get on Twitter or your email in hopes to forget about it. There is no blocking it out. And no matter what, you put on the bravest of faces, and you hide your condition.Zoe Quinn, you did a horrible disservice to the gaming community and sufferers of depression.			"

												Not only is this ""not a video game,"" in the sense that there is no video and nothing to play or have fun with, but an oddly formatted choose your own adventure novel, it's also a poorly written choose your own adventure novel; it breaks the classic rules of ""show, don't tell,"" the writing is awkward and clumsy, and little of it is actually grammatically correct. ""Depression Quest"" is not only boring and poorly written, it's portrayal of depression is off-base in a number of ways. If you choose the ""right"" option early on (like the third page or so), everything goes swimmingly for ""you,"" and you suffer basically no symptoms of depression. You have a loving and wonderful support system of family, friends, and even a girlfriend. Everyone in the story's universe seems to understand depression (aside from your kind of ♥♥♥♥♥y mom), and you face no obsticles in your pursuit for therapy and drugs beyond yourself. The main character is an overprivelaged ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who does the bare minimum to cope with his depression, and feels, at worst, ""a bit worn out"" by his attempts to carry on a somewhat normal existance. In reality, depression ravages you, and it changes it types of decisions you would make. It does not instantly turn you into a whiny litle ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Depression ignites a myriad of different reactions, but the character in this story lays down and waits to die. When I myself went through depression, I was♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that I had to bury my feelings and keep trudging onwards. For the most part, extreme apathy seems to be consistent, but never really arises in this game. If anything, ""you"" care TOO much: Depression Quest's character is ""worried his girlfriend doesn't really like him that much,"" even though she is entirely supportive (unless you agressively whine at her and accuse her of not caring) and doesn't even get frustrated with you when you wake her up. Depression Quest treats depression as something easy to get out of if you get your thumb out of your bum for just long enough to get into therapy. It also treats drugs as a cure-all with little to no side-effects and an impossibility of increasing your overall distress. How accurate. This game sucks.			"

												The concept(s) or intention(s) behind the 'game' is/are probably be good, but as realistic Depression Quest might get, I don't feel like I get a better understanding of what depression might feel like. I also find it a little confusing that some of the options are simply just crossed out even though they're still listed, like it's not really an option anyway, which makes it feel like a depressed person can't or won't try to make it better, or even reach out for help. And as someone has already mentioned in their review, the reason(s) behind and the sereverity of the depression the main character suffers are a bit unclear, because the main character seems to be having pretty good conditions to live under.The design also looks like it was made by someone who just learned to code and wanted/needed some practice, or someone who  wanted something to publish and just put some text together with a few photos, with a minimum amount of effort put into it. In its current shape, Deprssion Quest would've been better off being launched as a website, or a web/browserbased game, rather than a full scale game suitable to be played through platforms like Steam.All in all, the game could really need some more improving.

I've battled depression since my father died when I was 11, dealt with it still when I was 15 and my grandfather passed away from cancer, then at 19 when I was diagnosed with cancer, then for the next 14 months as I watched two close friends lose their fight with cancer. I know depression, my depression, but that doesn't mean I can tell anyone else what it's like or how to deal with it.

												Is there any better way for a game to start than by disclaimer it is not for the faint of heart, yet it fails to depict meaningful drama or genuine negative consequences of depression? Besides occasional lines of dialog how I am horrible because depression and someone cannot take it any more and suddenly we're up to something else? What borderlines irony is the foreword of the game is perhaps the most enjoyable part of the game, since it feels like the developers knew their onions; they laud and dazzle how it focuses on depression... by simply telling what it is. You have depression. Everything is great but you just have depression and then things falls apart and end of story - or not quite but more like sort of but not kind of. Boo said the ghost of hung criminal at the gallows.Unless there is some new, booming market for choose-your-own-depression books, since choose-your-own adventure books usually operate on different matters at hand.If the game simply gave basic framework for interactivity to properly explore, shallowly telling what is going on with no further investment is not bad idea. That is assuming there is more interactivity besides click for another skip of text that makes me want to read an actual book. I do not shun the idea of interactive media branching beyond common ""ideas"" for video games, but I hesitate to call Depression Quest even an unfinished novella, or early prototype for a visual novel. It is a game which throws plenty of text with less substance than Harlequin novels, offending ambiguity not to offend anyone with anything vaguely related to English gender pronouns, and no personal viewport to depression... which the foreword already said is very subjective. I am here to read a story for the novelty of reading a story about depression that pretends to be a video game: People are referred as human beings as ambugiuosly as possible all the bleeping time with less character than mouldy piece of paper, and once again, I am supposed to be looking through viewport to one manifestation of depression. Yay. (If semantics are that important, can we please have it written in language with no gender-specific pronouns - aside from inconvenience of less potential readers? Too hardcore? Why not ask the reader's gender? Still too specific or offending? Why not just offer option to type it down then and have pronouns adjusted accordingly for pity's sake?)Rhetorically, it is the only part where the game feels like there was actual effort to convey idea of depression with extremely nonexistent and empty presentation of everything. Unfortunately that still leaves me, as a reader, unconvinced as lame horse merchant given the pronounced lack of subjectivity in something which is supposed to be pretty subjective experience. Warsaw in Poland, cows moo, dogs bark, depression is unfortunate experience etc etc. Such lovely and profound words of wisdom and insight! Truly we are dealing here with a masterpiece! Broken record! Round two! Fight!Oh, and the absolute best\worst part of is lack of even hinting at suicide or you know, actual drama between people besides few lines of dialog. My depression nearly culminated to eaten shotgun and several burned bridges; some which remain burned to this day. What does the game tell you to offer anything remote to this kind of drama? Few lines of dialog and leave imagination do the rest, which could be fair with deeper substance. Once again, the game outright assumes player has absolutely no idea what depression is about, which is subjective but the narrative is less compelling than reading kindergarteners' stories. Where is subjectivity? Has the writer(s) ever heard of show, don't tell? Here it's tell, also choose your own silly options which leads to even more telling what depression is about in daily life.Depression Quest could be passable, even perhaps curious and interesting piece of work if it did not too hard to be an ""art"" game. Art game with novelty of being about depression to educate the foolish, ignorant savages how depression may manifest by presenting ideal scenario torn down by boringly dramatic events presented as grippingly as reading the latest football or hockey match results from news, only exception being at least the match scoreboard can offer me useful insight to what happened. Same cannot be said of Depression Quest, no matter how noble or unfortunate its beginning may have been.(Edit as of September 2nd: fixed some Engrish.)			"

												The best way to do this game justice is to look at a pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥with a few roses hidden inside it. A lot of the story seems like projection of the author and a misunderstanding of how deppression works on the brain and through processes. There are, however, a few very good points that perfectly outline what and how deppression is, but only if you are able to analyze the game without your own bias. The author tried to use situations and telling (instead of showing) how the character feels to try and manipulate the player into understanding deppression, yet she *completely* missed the point. If she truly wanted to make people understand deppression she would've used the mentioning and not mentioning of in game concepts to manipulate the player into looking at a 90/10 world of happiness/sadness and making the player only look at the sad. That would be a true work of art, unfortunately this is just angsty-projection with big words thrown in to sound smart and tell instead of show. 2/10 Is harmful to the understanding of how deppressed people's mindset and feelings. Is also terribly written at times and has typos.			"

												I'll admit, when I first downloaded this game, I thought it was going to be much worse than it actually was.As far as games go, you could definitely do worse, especially since some of those worse games would actually cost you money. However, the writing style feels a bit sloppy. The main character is described as sparingly as possible early on, to make him/her a blank slate for the player to put themselves in his/her shoes. And then the writers screwed that up by giving the main character a family and girlfriend, which requires him/her to be a definite person seperate from player. You can't have a character that you make your own and have the same character be defined by the writer, because odds are, the two ideas of what the character should be won't mesh.I'll be generous and give it a 7/10.

												I was (And still am) diagnosed with moderate-to-severe depression. While it has been getting better, I can entirely say this experience was complete and utter garbage.How it handles something as permeating as depression is shameful at best and downright ham-handed at worst, shoehorning in options some people take, but then crossing them out in what I can only assume is their way of saying people who are really depressed don't make them. Some victims don't just shut themselves in, and this story seems to be saying that all of them do. In addition, depression is usually a slow fadeout. It doesn't just ♥♥♥♥ing appear in less than a day, and getting rid of it can take months at best, years at worst. Then, the ending which claims it is a constant battle is an absolute slap in the face. We've been so hilariously unrealistic so far, why didn't you go that final ♥♥♥♥ing mile and make our protagonist suddenly all better, ready to face the world with his arsenal of rainicorns and unibows? Did you waste it on your ""Watch Netflix and cry"" scenes?I could say so much about this game, about how badly it does what it set out to do, how I completely loathe the developer and the scandal parade behind her, but I'll just stop at this:This is not depression. This is a Social Justice Warrior's depression fantasy. And that's dangerous.			"

												A text-based adventure game that fails to provide any sort of real adventure. Nothing interesting or profound happens to the protagonist, an unlikeable ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ whose disability doesn't seem to be depression as much as ""I'm a whiny ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" disorder. This is misrepresentative of people who actually suffer from depression and fails both on the level of what it actually is, and what it pretends to be. This is not a well-written story. I'm hesitant to even call it a ""story."" It's really nothing but words on a screen, assembled in a random, meaningless order. My dice could have written this game.1/10 Could have benefitted from 5v1 multiplayer.			"

												This isn't really a game, it's more of a short story, a poorly written short story at that.  I don't really care about the controversy, I will admit that is what brought me here, but I wanted to see if this person had created something that could elevate public awareness of what depression really is.  Unfortunately the answer is no, the ""game"" looks lazily put together with little to no effort whatsoever, the narrative is a stretch at best and does very little to illustrate what living with depression is like.  To be frank, calling whatever this is a game is a travesty.I understand that Zoe wants to see women in the gaming industry and I fully support this notion.  Women have a lot to offer the gaming community as a whole and the gaming community can only benefit from the inclusion of female voices in the industry.  However the controversy that bore this ""game"" is not the way to make that happen.			"

												Played it for a little to see what's up thinking, hey at least it brings attention to depression, but I think it does a poor job of showing what depression is like, from my experience with it, and it would be difficult for a game like this to show the thought process of someone who is depressed when the final options are already laid out in front of you. The writing was also kind of meh, just seemed very stale and boring, lost interest around the third page. I also could not become immersed or interested in the story at all, I was not able to put myself in the shoes of the character basically because the whole gender neutral tone gave me no information about the character, and what information I did get felt like it was being shoved down my throat from the beginning and I was not left to discover the information throughout the story, it made it seem like the character was more of a robot than a person the fact that I have to describe the character as him/her or ""the character"" illustrates this point. Something’s that could be done to improve the game:1) Try to make it easier for the play to become immersed, a short questionnaire that would ask the age, gender, and sexual orientation of the player that would change the story slightly to fit this information and help the reader step into the shoes of the character. I was basically taken out of the story from the very beginning by how hard the game tried to be gender neutral with the whole ""you are a human being, you have a significant other"" thing. Also no one describes them self as a ""mid-twenties human being and this information is irreverent anyways, we know the character is a human being and there would be better ways to find out the age of the character than this. 2) You need better writing period, this game is heavily dependent on reading and yet the story is poorly written and robotic. Instead of telling us who the character is right off the bat, let us discover the character, develop him/her over time instead of having him/her fully formed straight from the beginning. Show us his/her experiences instead of telling us ""you lack motivation, you lose sleep over this"" show us how the character has lost his/her motivation, show us how him/her is up all night wondering why he/she can't seem to get his/her life on track. TD;DR:Get better writers who can write a decent story, get rid of gender neutrality, and make the game more interactive. "

												This game is so bad written that you actually don need tho read the whole text to know what is happening.Besides the fact that your decitions through the game doesn't make any actual differences on the story, the gameplay is just clicking over hyperlinks to read the rest of your ""story"".The story is about some person (you; and the genre isn't specified, wich makes everything a lot confusing) that is wondering what to do about it's life.l The character is around 22 years old, and it's a complete moron; the ""game"" is supossed to make the player actually ""feel"" what is it about having ""depression"", when the character is just being a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about everything and playing the ""victim"" role.Actually, the thing that most bothered (sadly not the only one) me is that the only character that's actually well personified is the main one, the rest of the characters of the story were just a cliché of what the ""main"" character thinks about people, getting you away from what's really happening, and confusing your gameplay.You can make decitions, but only the ones that the game lets you make, the others are actually ridiculous and are marked in red (ovbius sign that is just more text to read) this gimmick of the game makes you feel that all the decitions you make are all the same. And the worse part is if you make ALL the ""wrong"" or ""bad"" decitions, you character never kills itself. It always ends up the same or you just curl up onto your bed and sleep, or you ""deal"" with it and be ♥♥♥♥♥ing around about your ""depression"".2/10 only because you can adopt a kitten (wich makes no difference through the story, but eventually appears to sleep in your lap)			"

												As much as I would love for people to understand what it's like to live with depression and go through every day with such helplessness and a game is understandably a very promising way to go about for giving others that insight, I don't believe there was much fleshing out at ALL for this so-called ""game."" This is not a game. It's a choose-your-own-adventure story that would do better if there was some kind of visual, less scrolling paragraphs and pages to read through before a choice, and somewhat better options. The thing with it is that it's understandable that it's not going to be any fun - I mean it's called Depression Quest and the whole point is to show what it's like but at the same time, so much work to go through means nobody is really going to read everything. People are just going to exit out. Some of the responses don't seem very realistic either. But then we all have different experiences with depression and some have none. It wasn't very good, the story was mind-numbing as were the supposed characters, responses and timeframes could be better, it was long and arduous and usually I just skimmed to make my choice, and the ""game"" was so quick that it was just blah. If I want I could just tell people everything I'm experiencing or feeling instead. It'd be a little more fun that's for sure!			"

I don't think i'll ever play it again, but I hope someday, someone will make a game that suceeds in  what this game tried to do, but sadly failed. I would give this a Neutral rating if I could, but I can't, and I would only do so because of the idea. The game itself is too simple.

												It's utter♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ It does not even help in the slightest in learning about depression (Let alone the MULTIPLE FORMS OF IT), and instead uses it to motivate a floppy 2 dimensional story. That's right. It uses depression as the driving force of a story. Not that it can't be done, but this game delivers it in the most awful way possible. The game gives no insight on how the psyche of a depressed person truly works, and utterly shames the issue completely. Developers, you should feel ashamed for this. I feel ashamed for this game, as a player, and as someone who deals with others with depression daily. A simple google search could have given you plenty of insight, but instead you choose the most bland, stereotypical version of depression, and followed that through. Why on Earth would you all think your base knowledge was good enough for such a complex issue?!?! If this game was truly for insight on depression, you all should have spent more time adding in various stories that at least include each form of depression (Chronic, Persistent, Major, Bipolar(Manic), Seasonal Affective Disorder, Psychotic, Postpartum, Premenstrual, Situational, and Atypical. There you go, listed all known forms of depression, go research them and deliver the players a PROPER informational Story on each form of depression with actions backed by research from professionals proven to help against depression. Not just ""Take the meds, get motivated"" bull♥♥♥♥♥♥) As a person who deals with this, depressed people can lie to others, can manipulate cunningly well to hide a more sinister side to their depression, which can ultimately cause themselves Fatal injuries. Some depressed individuals, if not all, plan out their deaths to prevent any intervention. This game shames all of those people. This game shames the issue. This game is shameful, and any news site or what have you that tells you that it is accurate to the psyche of a depressed individual clearly need to research their♥♥♥♥♥♥Alright, now the game is nothing special. It's a shoddily, quickly done Visual Story (If that can even be justified), with a looping audio of a ""Piano playing a minor key for emphasis on the mood which makes the game cheesy and irritating to listen to"". Not to say the piece is bad, but when it loops it becomes grating on the ears quickly. Devs, add in different audio tracks, options for said audio, and the like to suit the mood of the story. When things go well, make the melancholy music fade somewhat or become slightly more cheerful. When there are dips in the story, make the audio change accordingly. The audio, as it is, is half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and lazy. I can play any D-minor improv and get the same effect as this audio. Improve the game's audio, and story, those are it's fronts and they are both LACKING. Obviously the game was designed to play on people's heart-strings and suck out as much cash as possible. So make it do that, because right now, you all are FAILING MISERABLY AT DOING THAT. You are failing as a team to deliver a sensational, informational, honest story that could be BEAUTIFUL. It has the premise of a good Story, so make it good. If you need help with that, read EDGAR ALLEN POE a few times, Read notes from depressed individuals, spend TIME with depressed individuals. Learn about the people, then their psyche, and then deliver the steam player base a sensational story.Fix it, or rebuild the game completely, but don't leave it as a decaying piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥it is now. If you all fix it, I garauntee a lot of negative reviews that are relevant will turn positive, and you all might not have such a bad track record later on.If you, the individual thinking about this game, truly want to learn about depression, don't waste your time on this piece of garbage, and instead look it up online and learn from professionals who deal with it daily. This Free game isn't even a game, nor is it even informational on the situation it tries to convey and talk about. You could spend your time better by having a burger and fries at Five Guys.			"

The depression boss didn't even put up a fight he kinda just laid there and complained on tumblr about his triggers. Overall the game made depression look like it was cureable and the game should be early access since all the options weren't available.			"

												So, as some one who has had depression problems in the past, I can safely say this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. This is nothing like what I went trough, I realize that depression is different for everyone but.... for ♥♥♥♥s sake the game treats it like an icurable plague. I can not understand why the protagonis is unable to just simply state how they feel (I never had problems telling people how I feel so I just cant relate to the protagonist). Real depression is taking ADHD meddice for months in country which completely alien to you, with no friends, difficulty speaking the native language and a dysfunctional family that constantly fights over child support.♥♥♥♥ man, if I had a better relations with my family and at least one or two friends back when I had depression problems....Thank god that I actually tried to find help.So...Rating? 3.5/10   would uninstall again.

												Impossible to relate to. This guy is not depressed, he's just unhappy. In reality you don't make one simple mistake and it drives you into spiraling depression leaving you unable to interact with people, have fun or function in daily life. That's what happens in this game: he makes one simple mistake that anyone can make and goes from being moderately depressed to deeply depressed (there is an ingame tracker). Real depression is NOTHING like that! It takes a lot more than that to actually make depression worse keeping in mind that depression numbs your emotions so you don't care about stuff as much. You can actually make him reach the highest level of depression in 3 steps making the same mistakes any person could do in one day and brush it off and walk away. Whoever made this game has never had depression, doesn't understand it and is not in any position to be educating anyone on it.			"

												It has branching paths, which do lead to different choices and, possibly, endings, which is a good design choice. I feel like its too bloated, with non-relevant information. In the beginning of the game, some words are highlited in blue, which tell you about various things in the game. But the game shouldn't have to spell out your life through these blue links, but rather, let you experience them when those moments come up in the game. Also, while the different choices are a good touch, sometimes, almost all of my multiple choices are crossed out, so I'm only able to choose one option. This means I can't get any other endings (if there are any.) I don't really reccomend it, because its only an okay-written game, and nothing groundbreaking like articles made it out to be upon its release.			"

												The game has an understanding of how a person with depression can react to things but doesn't take some things into consideration. I feel it can be a hard read mostly due to the length. I don't think a lot of people can really relate with it since they will be in varying situations. I would have prefered if the game featured more than one music track since looping one can get kind of irratating. As a tool to teach others about depression I don't know how effective it would be and it feels more like a depression questionnaire that you would take on a site then a game. As someone who was diagnosed with depression I could relate to parts but I feel a few things should be mentioned. Antidepressants are not always the best solution, in my experience I kept having to switch between meds to find which worked best since some cause really bad nausea, insomnia, and mood swings. I can't speak much on therapy since I only went in for a few sessions and would constantly put off or forget my sessions. And for those that don't have people in their lives to talk to it is worth noting that you can find support groups that you can talk to. I always found it easier to talk to people I didn't know about my issues since I felt less worried about being judged. Overall I think if you have depression you would understand some of the choices you are presented with but if you are trying to understand someone else's depression it might be a bit harder. I liked that some options were crossed out but I feel an explaination on why you aren't up to that choice would be better suited. The game was kind of long winded and I feel that it could have been said with fewer words and would still have surmised the point it was aiming at.			"

												This ""game' is nothing more than a story made by a team of people who seemed to only read articles about depression, never experiencing it first hand. Depression is not feeling good enough and knowing it 100% of the time. Depression is distancing yourself from everyone, including your family because you feel like you'll drag them down. Depression is choking yourself until you see nothing but black and fall to the ground only regretting that you didn't tie it tight enough. Depression is hoping something terrible happens to you, like being run over. Depression isn't this game. This game is a sorry excuse for a depression simulator. I have been sexually assaulted, and not in the ""he only touched me"" way. The person in the story has no motive really, besides work and we don't even know the job all that well. This game did only one thing for me and that was relive my past. The only depressing thing about this game was that. But if the game's job was to make me depressed today, then mission ♥♥♥♥ing accomplished. ♥♥♥♥ you developers.			"

It doesn't touch on depression very well and HOW THE HELL DID THIS CREATE A CONTRAVERSY!!!! There is nothing contraversal about it other than it's hypocritical nature.

												This game, was short, but great, and amazingTo some of THOSE people:To those who say this game is terrible, or make jokes about it, I just want to say this in the most respectable way possible. This game wasn't supposed to be fun, or be laughed at by making silly jokes, it was meant to give people the feelings of depression through literature.Actual review:I completed the game in a short time, and enjoyed it. Attempting to simulate the feelings of someone with depressive feelings through literature was simply amazing. It was fun to play a game that wasn't meant to have any formation of 'fun' involved. The reason for that is, it raises our awareness towards those who are depressive. Yes, again, this is a game of non-fictional literature, but please, everyone on STEAM, try it out, and don't listen to those who say it is terrible. I don't want to see people hate on this work of art. ;3;			"

												An incredibly offensive game implying that people suffering from depression are absolutely helpless; the removal of so many options and restricting the character to a meagre amount of actions, some that many depressed people would take if in that position, shows how little the writers understand about depression. The obvious ignorance about the disorder combined with the gall of the writers to pigeonhole an entire group of people and the absolute abhorrent use of the death of such a beloved public figure (Robin Williams) to plug their game is, frankly, disgusting. I would not recommend this game to anyone as it perpetuates societies ignorance and apathy towards mental illness whilst simultaneously offending and marginalising the victims of this cruel disorder. The only positive I can say is at least this filth has not been monetised and hopefully the proportion of negative reviews dissuades any one to play this game. I sincerely hope the creators regret publishing Depression Quest and in future refrain from hurting people. For individuals very enmeshed, get up yourselves.			"

												This work of interactive fiction (this is not a game on the basis that a choose-your-own adventure book is not a video game because you read it online) fails on both of its objectives, that is a, to ""show other sufferers that they are not alone in their feelings"", and b. to ""illustrate to people who may not understand the illness the depths of what it can do to people"". Firstly, the concept of ""Depression Quest"" seems to be something of a text-based roleplay, but the protagonist has no definite identity other than a ""twenty-something human being"", presumably in an attempt to be politically correct for correctness's sake, which instead comes of as dismissive to ""other sufferers"" as the only thing i could tell you about the protagonist is that he/she/it has depression, the effects of which seem to be feeling sad sometimes and losing motivation after every few paragraphs based on my playthrough, which in no way illustrates to people the effects of the illness since it does little to differentiate depression from ""being sad sometimes"". Furthermore, the ""professional"" reviews above seem to praise the game for being ""innovative"" and ""artsy"" however nothing In the game open to interpretation in the way a proper art piece should be, and it is impossible for this game to be Voyeuristic if the character himself has no identity, there is no intimacy between the reader and the character;the reviewers Effectively use the game to deliver the illusion of artistic critique.Going past the recent social media uproar surrounding the personal lives of the developers, Depression Quest is still Ultimately a falied experiment at best and a dismissive publicity stunt at worst, delivering nothing that any site on depression You could find wouldn't give you. It is ultimately a cautionary tale about indie games that try to push the limits and be ""edgy"" Somehow becoming less artistic than games created solely for gameplay.			"

												*This is a review based off the game alone. No contoversy, no rant about being text only, just a review""Bottom line, Depression Quest is a game about immersing you, the player, into the protagonist's shoes, trying to fight depression with little hope.It starts off telling you that this isn't ment to be played as a game, but as an actual way to help you sink into someones life that is suffering from depression. It does a good job of doing that. The game's strong point is being text based. This may sound weird, but when the games says you are feeling hopeless or sad, I remembered when was the last time I felt hopeless or sad, and then I reflected what I tend to do feeling these emotions. Instead of showing what happened to you (with an animation, or a cutscene) the game lets you use your imagination! (To an extent.) This is how gaming was some time ago, in ""the dark ages"", like Zork!The characters are good as well. Ranging from your family, your loved one, and even a freind online. This game covers most friends that we have! The dialogue is good (at times), and it shows different personalities to each character, not some copy and paste/repeat characters.Another strong point is the sound, it's a repeating piano melody. However, sometimes you can hear some other noices reflecting to what the character your controlling is hearing, like noices from a party, or mellow talking when the character is in a therapy session. It's a small touch, but cool.Now some problems with the game:-No save feature. Like come on, I had to do something between a play session, and all my progress was lost! What a bummer!-The ""Mood Meters"". These meters found in the bottom of the screen tells you how depressed you are, how you feel on regards to therapy, and how you feel in regards to taking medication. This is okay, but it gave me dead giveaways to how the character felt. It would have been better if these wern't there so I needed to debunk on how the character is feeling. The main purpose that I got this game is was to find out what is wrong with the character, that's not the case in this game.-Ending. Now the ending, at first enraged me. However, when I read the epelogue, it made sense to me. However, I sort of wanted it to wrap up better than how it did.-Length. The game is shoooort. Even if you read every backstory in the beginning and you read eveything, you will see the ending in 30 minutes flat. Same with the ending. I wanted the story to go further, and to see the character change as time goes on. The game sort of stopped dead in it's tracks and says ""The character is feeling better now"". It kinda ruined the experince for me there.Overall, this game isn't ment to be played as a game, it's rather a simulation.I cannot recommend this game to everyone, becasue again it isn't a game, but I will say it's worth checking out. Hell, it's free to play. The only thing your spending is 30 minutes of your time.5/10			"

												Frankly, I like the subject - I've had depression, and to keep it blunt, it sucks major♥♥♥♥♥♥ I found it interesting to read a story I could in some senses see comparisons to my own experience - which is no suprise considering that it's a medical condition attributable to a deficiency in dopamine and serotonin. Being neurotransmitters that regulate regions of your brain responsible for emotions, it's a simple step to say that across individuals a deficiency in these chemicals will cause a similar response. Considering that, I think at best I was able to get an 'I know that feel' and perhaps gave me an opportunity to look back on this experience, but these two things are aspects 'I' brought to the table. So what did Depression Quest bring to the table as a game?Well, for one it forgot to bring the game. I could go on a long tirade about what can and can't be considered a game, and honestly that area is muddy as all hell, subjective medium and all that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. However, what this is is an interative novel, and when I attempt to draw comparisons to other similar experiences I have had (something I just like to do when experiencing games) - I find myself looking at things like Goosebumps choose your own adventures stories - a book. There are plenty of places for interactive stories to be, and now that this is here on steam, knowing steam, it won't go now, but I just can't call this a game, and so on that level alone, I'm not recommending it - and opening myself to being called a huge hypocrite because I like Proteus, which is also ostensibly a game.The difference for me however remains on the subjective - I found Proteus interesting - this was not - it was just another story, and one which made me think more than anything else.Goosebumps was the♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												*WARNING, WARNING. WALL OF TEXT INBOUND. GAIN +5 DEPRESSION POINTS*Where to begin this review? My first impressions of Depression Quest were on its official site with a myrid of glitches in the hyperlinks. Thoughts ""Oh, well it was an indie project trying to raise awareness for depression and taking donations to give to iFred and the Suicide Prevention Hotline."" This soon faded from memory as a lackluster indie game with a good cause. Now recently seeing this game released on the free to play raised a little curiosity. Did they expand on the story of the game? Have those glitches in the website version been fixed? Disregarding reviews I downloaded the game today and played through ten to 15 minutes. First thought is that this all seems familiar. Same red lines blocking choices, same exact description, same hyperlinks, same everything. But wait, there is artsy piano music now to make it sad as you read. ""Ok, so they haven't expanded the story or improved the look of the game"". Next are the glitches encountered, for example crashing the application twice in a single playthrough. Finally getting through to an epilogue another realization kicks in that this is the exact same version of the game I played before it was released on steam. Nothing changed, nothing fixed, nothing brushed up. I'll rate here to avoid having people read a wall of text. 3/10. Onward to elaborationPlot: You play as 20 year old Michael McNoCharacterization. You have a decent job, loving family, loving girlfriend, good little social circle but you also have depression. A lack of motivation, disillusionment, and general angst ensue. The plot will railroad you, and railroad you hard, further into depression, more actions will be cut off from selection to simulate depression getting worse. The plot falls flat due to this in my honest opinion. Instead of giving us a reason to sympathise it gives us invisible -5s to happiness time an option is chosen.Mechanics: Simple pick option A get outcome A, pick option B get outcome B, with the occasional Pick Option A crash game.Soundtrack: Royalty free piano music to make things sad. Emotional manipulation at its finest.Fourth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t listing: I hate ending on threes so here is a fourth detail, cannot pick this option. Raise depression points.			"

												In this game:- no visuals. just depressing music to guide you into the feeling of deppression.- text only. I need more than a grainy picture to get me interested.- if someone wants to know what depression is like, they can talk to anyone in their life. so many people have it, it's impossible not to know someone.- if someone has depression, this game only makes them feel worse, because it's an easily accessible game, with much media attention, and it's a reflection of the horrors they face day to day.- WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ IS WRONG WITH YOU ZOE?!- this game is horrible.- I don't even know why I thought I should give it a chance.- choose your own adventure went out in the early 90's. please develop more interesting games if you want good publicity.-1,000,000/10will finish only to see how bad it is, and post on various websites, forums and social media how bad your game is.

												This game isn't interesting and should have just been kept off Steam. You click hyperlinks like you're on a website. Remind me, how is reading and clicking things fun? That's the stuff I do when I do homework. Second of all, it used Robin Williams' suicide to give it a popularity boost. That was, like, the first thing they did wrong.The story of the guy you play as doesn't even tell the story of somebody who is actually depressed. He's a spoiled white guy whose reasons for being 'depressed' is probably the developer's crappy writing and idea of a 'game'. This game wasn't designed to make people know how it feels to be depressed, it was designed for people to pick the right decision, 'win' and 'get better'. Bad things don't even seem to happen to this guy apart from the fact he's stuck in his own head.The tags call this an RPG. There are absolutely no role-playing elements whatsoever. There is also no simulation (far from it) at all, and for some reason it was also tagged as a simulator.Overall, I rate it five guys out of ten. Don't download this game please. It is the definition of half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and its developers are attention ♥♥♥♥♥s.			"

												After I played this game, I asked myself one question. ""How did this get on steam?"" I mean sure, visual novels are on steam as well, but at least those have art and actual soundtracks. Sure, they aren't free, but they're far more extensive and faaaaar less pretentious. I'm sorry, but this hardly deserves any of the publicity, interest, or credit it has recieved. If you had told me that this was a browser game, I wouldn't doubt you for a second. I've seen browser games that put more effort in. Bare graphics, some piano music, and overall poor and unrealistic writing.I can't say much on the game's subject. People I know with depression don't normally act in the way the character in this game supposedly acts, but that can be written off as coincidence. The word pretentious comes back because it simply feels like it's trying to be more than it actually is. These websites that reviewed it made it seem like something that would stun me and blow my mind with how thought-provoking it is. It wasn't. At all.Not to mention the recent controversy surrounding this game. I have some not so positive words surrounding the developer and her boy toy- er, friends (HINT: Pretentious is one of them).  Quite frankly, I don't want to say them because I'm horredously afraid of Phil Fish and his threating twitter tweets.  Needless to say, this isn't about her as much as the game. And the game sucks. It may be free, but it's a free waste of time you could be dedicating to contributing to society. Or playing actual video games. Both are more satisfying and significant.			"

												Depression Quest is essentially a Choose Your Own Adventure book put into an electronic format. I wouldn't even go so far as to call it a visual novel, much less a game, because the pictures placed above the text don't add anything to the story. Basically, you play as ""you"", and you start out depressed. You have a bunch of first world problems going against you, and you have to manage all of these issues in order to get to the point where you're still depressed, but coping with it by the end of the story. I believe that the producer of this ""game's"" goal was to raise awareness for depression, but I don't think she really was able to do so. She made it seem much like the misconceptions that overpriviledged people who self-diagnose themselves were what depression really is, and it made the whole storyline seem a bit pretentious. I don't think it's really possible for anyone to get anything from this experience, because quite honestly, it didn't explain depression at all to those who don't have it, and only maybe convinced those with depression that it does help to get seek guidance and comfort from those who are close to you. And with all of this going against it, the producer couldn't even go through all the text walls to make sure there weren't any spelling or grammatical errors!Overall:Pros:-Shows those with depression that they aren't suffering aloneCons:-No gameplay-No visual aids-Not a correct depiction of depression-Grammatical/spelling errors all over the placeScores:Gameplay: 0/10Soundtrack: 1/10 (There was pretty much only one instrumental throughout the whole game)Style: 0/10Graphics: 0/10 Addictiveness: 0/10 Overall: 0/10			"

												As someone who suffers from depression myself brought on by Bipolar, I played this game with an inside knowledge of what depression is legitimately like. Not only is this game NOT a game, but it's a TERRIBLE representation of what Depression is actually like. This game reinforces terrible stereotypes about people legitimately suffering from the disease, such as that we're never happy and all we do is wallow in our own misery 24/7 with no interest in getting better, seeking treatment or taking care of ourselves. It tells people that nothing ever makes us happy ever, not even temporarily, and that all we do is lie around unable to do anything.Sure, depression is brutal. Believe me I know. But this? This game is ridiculous. The only time I've ever been NEARLY as sick as the protagonist of this ""story"" was in my extreme lows where I was borderline suicidal. But it's harmful to people who ACTUALLY suffer from depression to reinforce these horrible stereotypes. Zoe claims she wants to help fight against the stigma but all she's done was add to it. This game is further proof to me that Zoe Quinn not only doesn't care about ANYTHING she claims she does (Women's rights, mental health, ect ect) but that she has no problems milking these things for all the money she can get. Sure the game is free but look at all the press she's gotten from other people who think this is a GREAT thing, people who (spoiler alert) more than likely don't have mental illnesses themselves and just think the sentiment is nice.Do not support this game. It's not even a game and were it not for Zoe's constant lying and harmful use of legitimate causes to gain for herself this game would NOT have made it onto steam, period. Steam sells games. This is not a game. And it CERTAINLY isn't an acurate depiction of what living with depression is like, nor is it sending out a positive message in any way, shape or form.			"

												   This game gives a wrong idea of how depression truly is. It only talk about social anxiety and how difficult it is to accept yourself in a group, wich is sincerely, something really common these days.   The creator makes sure to make the game even more ""depressing"", removing the ""healthy"" option and making the other options completely unnecessary. All the options leaves you more depressed, and the game keep telling you this, even if you made the ""right"" decisions.    Plus, the long texts makes the game monotonus, also because the story doesn't lead you anywhere. The character gets more depressed and rejects any kind of help, doesn't matter if you choose it or not, and there's absolutely nothing you can do about it.  "

												As a 22 year old who has suffered depression as long as he can remember (as far back as age 5) I can attest to the accuracy of the main character's emotions in this story. The way the main character overthinks things, beats himself up over large and small mistakes alike, runs through possible scenarios in his head, only causing himself to worry more - I have experienced all of this. Also, too many times do I hear people telling me to ""cheer up"" or ""get over it,"" but they just don't understand... it's not that easy - I don't want to be depressed, if it were just a mindset, I would have stopped being depressed long ago. Although many situations in this story I have not experienced (I've never had a girlfriend, or seen a therapist) I can still relate to how the main character feels throughout - the narrative is very thorough, and thus is very effective at portraying the situation, making it easy for me to put myself in his shoes. The choices are well varied, and I always found at least one option that I would do in that situation. After completing the game, I came to what seemed to me to be the best ending. Too bad it's just a game.By the way, it's funny how many bad reviews this game got by people who aren't depressed, saying, ""it's not realistic"" when they are the target audience, and yet, a depressed person writing a review gave a positive one saying that it is realistic.

												I don't really know what to say, it's a basic choose your own ending story. I've had depression problems since I was in high school and the narrative was always always skewed negatively. I do realize this is intentional to make you feel more hopeless, but not necessary in my opinion. The story was a simple short story, not bad, not astounding but you get the idea. I came here to check out this game because all of the journalism craze going on and its not as good as the critics were saying more like a student project in college for a game design class. I don't expect triple A results or anything from this but it's not a professional game. If journalists were really skewed over this game screw that. I mean its a good student project but it is by no means a masterpiece. So play it yourself if you like story based games. not bad for a student game but not fantastic for a student game either. like 3/10 4/10 "

												As an actual depression sufferer, I felt a morbid curiosity to see for myself what the deal is with this. I am going to set aside the controversy surrounding the game and focus on the game itself.I am not sure exactly what Zoe Quinn thinks depression entails, but it is not simply a series of ""I don't feel like it"" moments. What is portrayed in this game, if you can really call it that, seems like an eight-minute commercial for Prozac that pushes the ""Hollywood Angle"" on the subject. Depicting anyone who is withdrawn and unhappy with their life as automatically depressed and stating they must be rushed to therapy and put on meds. The mood is punctuated by a rote series of piano codas designed to make the viewer sad and sympathetic, but quickly become annoying. If anything this is almost feels like a poorly-written tearjerker script for a Lifetime movie than any accurate depiction of how depression affects a person and those around them.I almost feel like the game isn't about depression in general. Instead I'm left with the impression that Zoe Quinn created this visual novel, again if you can really call it that, to engender sympathy because she went through a rough patch for several months. I suppose that in and of itself is not a problem, but if it's all about you then just say it's about you. Don't try to speak for all depression suffers, because depression is not one-size fits all.

												Not a very good game. It plays like a visual novel, but without the colourful characters that make the medium so interesting. The storyline itself isn't very good, and the writing is rather meh. It doesn't do much to make one emphasize with depression, as the writing hardly feels realistic. Would definately not recommend this game, it would probably been better to have made it anovel or blog post.			"

 This game is dissapointing Like seriously, what the ♥♥♥♥. I make the most ethical decisions and instead, matters get worse. Certain decisions get crossed out, which leaves you decisions that make you even more depressed. I have depression and even I don't make those decisions! The main character seems like he's uncomfortable to talk to someone about his issues. Overall, the gameplay... it isn't even gameplay at all. It's a choose your own path-esque ""game"". I believe that you are also unable to take screenshots of the game and unable to access Steam Overlay (at least in my experience). Instead of this being a game, this just should've been a type of website or something. I give this game a 0/10.			"

												October 7, 2014The search for a hidden indie gem has yet to be found. Depression Quest is fairly well-written, but I have a hard time classifying this as a game. It's an interactive narrative. The status indicators at the bottom make little sense but they do give the player ""awareness"" for the character. This was a god-awful game, but a 5.5/10 story.			"

												This is a game? Hahaha, oh wow In all seriousness it's a interactive story about some random guy and his depression and you have to direct his actions via multiple choice outcomes. You could probably speed play through it in 1 minute; there's not that much of a story to it. It's not really that much of a game. Maybe it could've been considered one back in the 80s or 90s when they had those interactive text based ones, but even those usually were a lot longer than this and more interesting as well.Now I don't like to use Ad hominems but the broad who made this, Zoe Qunin, didn't even make it directly. She got help from some game makers who were doing a project where they'd help inexperienced women make games. After they helped her make this, she attacked them! Also, after Robin Williams took his life (rest in piece, you were one of the few celebrities I actually felt horrible from after they died) she tried to cash in on that to promote her game more. So she also has no respect for victims of suicide. There's been a massive storm of controversy over her actions, and a lot of censoring of facts and freedom of speech. So I encourage you, the audience, not to support her. Depression is a hellish sickness of the mind that nobody should experience. I can appreciate trying to find ways to make people understand it much better, but this 'game' is an inefficient way off doing so, and it's creator is shrouded in controversy. I cannot recommend this game. Thankfully, it is free, so I didn't waste a dime.			"

												Not only do I blow through my first run in about sixty seconds, as someone who has dealt with severe depression I'm offended that the options I would have taken are displayed but unchoosable, as if they want me to take a specific path instead of doing what I would have done myself. Therefore, I don't get an ending that makes sense to me.I'm not even going to go into the whole controversey surrounding this ""game"". This is not a game. If you haven't downloaded it yet, don't bother.			"

If you are feeling depressed, and you have those friends who don't understand, please, have them play this game. It will really show them what it's like.I recommend this game. 8.3/10			"

												I usually play FPS games, so this was a bit of a departure for me. This game is text based and doesn't take long to 'complete', but what it is lacking in graphical sophistication and hours of gameplay it makes up for in emotional depth. I played it through many times in a row because I cared about getting the best outcome for the protagonist. Great value for money considering it didn't cost me anything! If you want to learn a bit more about yourself, about the impact that depression has on a person and how to combat it, then give this game half an hour of your time.

												Completely unrealistic. How did this depressed guy even get a girlfriend?Also, who said popping pills ever fixed anything? I do go to therapy but medication is overdoing it.It's just the same old story, telling people what they think they want to hear. They're totally convinced that therapy and medication are the perfect solution for people with depression and that you're an idiot if you don't do everything in your power to get as much therapy and medication as possible.I don't know who made this, but you know nothing about depression. How about a game in which every option is crossed out except for the ones that align with very strict variables that you have set at the beginning. How about a main character who cares for his future in 40 years when the medication has taken its toll on the liver, kidneys and brains.This is a nonsense game and it should be removed from Steam. It's a disgrace.			"

												Boring, uninspired, and a bit condescending. Depression Quest isn't a game so much as a 'choose your own adventure' book in a digital format. Unfortunately, it doesn't even do that well. The story is plagued by long, boring, and bland writing. That's unfortunate because the writing is really all you see. There aren't much in the way of visuals, and navigation feels more like navigating an awkward web page than moving through a story. It tries to ram into your head that your 'character' is depressed, but it doesn't personalize the character enough to make you feel sorry for them, nor does the awkward writing make it easy to sit through all of the story. Most of the actions you choose also tend to railroad you in one single direction. It gives the illusion of variation where the reality is that it is severely lacking in that department.Overall, I do not recommend this game. I can't even begin to give this a score because it's not really a game, and even the experience it means to give you fails so horribly that trying to give it a */10 score is like trying to score a trainwreck.

												Out of curiosity, I decided to give this game a try. I now wish I hadn't.This game is hard for me to review because there's so little to review. This ""game"" can barely be called a game. It's more like a visual novel. There's no interactivity beyond clicking text options. At least visual novels have pictures of anime girls. This game doesn't even have that.Generic piano music plays throughout. I'm guessing this is supposed to make the game feel more sad, but it just sounds annoying to me.The story itself is dull and boring. It's impossible for me to relate to the main character. None of your decisions feel like they have any major impact. Nothing truly bad happens to the main character that makes me want to sympathize with him. It just slogs on and on before reaching one of many anticlimactic, unsatisfying conclusions.Depression Quest is the laziest excuse for a game I have ever played. Anyone can make a text-based adventure game. Anyone. You could program a game just like this in flash in ten minutes. This isn't even Newgrounds quality. The only reason this got put on Steam is because the author has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥. That's it. I bet you that if this game were called Ice Cream Quest, it would have never been put on Steam.This ""game"" is a waste of time. You're better off just reading a book.			"

												I don't care about the♥♥♥♥♥♥happening around the developer, but when this 'game' is voted on Greenlight and I see all of the negative reviews about it straight away, I can't help but think that people just voted on this game because of the♥♥♥♥♥♥that is happening to the developer. I finished this 'game' in 18 minutes. This seemed more like a choose-your-own-adventure book rather than a game. I do not understand how this was greenlit and I feel like I was just going through a web-page. I didn't like it gave you a list of choices but than blocked some of them from being chosen. If you can't pick it, why put it in there? It doesn't make any sense what so ever to me. I also wasn't a fan of the music that played throughout my 18 minute adventure, it was just the exact same loop of piano chords played. This just didn't feel like an accurate portrayal of depression.You may as well read a book instead of playing this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥of a 'game'. "

												Ha ha ha. So much hate. Well I would rather not join the group of 'rate it bad becaus we don't like Zoe Quinn'. So I'm just going to ignore that she was even part of this.While this wasn't really a game, it was still pretty decent, not anything super amazing by a long shot, but it isn't SUPER BAD HORRIBLE like everyone wants you believe, simply because they are so butt hurt about the Quinnspiracy. When really they should know that is a lot common than they think, they just simly don't know that. This 'game' is pretty awesome though for a FREE game, although this game needs to be  A LOT longer, have more impacting decisions, and also a better way of actually portraying story than a big ♥♥♥♥ing block of text. I'm trying to rate this not like a game, but more like one of those 'make your own story' books like Fighting Fantasy or something similar. If you want a game, don't download, if you want something interesting to think about and you like reading, download, takes about 30 minutes to complete (that was rounding up, it took me 27 minutes) and considering everything, I round rate it around 5.7/10 not good enough to be 6 but not bad enough to be below half. I tried to write this review in the LEAST biased way as possible and also not count it as a game as much as possible.(P.S Zoe Quinn did not sleep with me to say this, or whatever the ♥♥♥♥ she did)			"

I played it 3 different times choosing different answers hoping to reach a good ending but they were all actually depressing. The first time I played it I didn't completely read the ending because I got bored of the game. The second and third time was when I fully paid attention and yep.. it sure was depressing.

												This is, hands down, the worst ""gaming"" experience of my life. If you can call this a game. It is basically a “chose your own adventure” novel that people read when they were kids. Some parts are well written in terms of style, but not content. It’s not fun, it’s not informative. It’s a complete waste of time and I highly suggest that you not waste your time on it like I, unfortunately, did.As someone who suffers from serious depression, and other depression-related disorders (e.g. anxiety), I found this game to be massively offensive and miss the mark by far. This game will not raise awareness or increase understanding. All it does is reinforce depression stereotypes. Whoever made this game has no idea what it means to be clinically depressed and have a $#!tty lot in life. The creators have reduced the deep and personal struggle I face every day of my life to a few clicks of a button, in a highly unrealistic scenario, and somehow this is supposed to be helping people? You’re only lying to yourself if you think anyone is being helped by this “game.”tl;dr: This –thing- is a complete waste of time and needs to be taken off steam.  "

												I cannot give this a thumbs up because to me it is not a game. The options bottle neck you as it should, that being what depression does, the characters sometimes feel blank. Lack of pictures help focus on the literature but it makes it less game, the options given feel a bit wrong but as it is relatively accurate I can't complain. It shouldn't have been sold as a game or reviewed as a game and definitely doesn't deserve being on Steam. There's better books, and better things in its style but for the price of free it's definitely good. It should not be on Steam and did not deserve the reviews it got from gaming magazines and other game related companies. 6/10 bookish thing, 0/10 game.			"

												Note: Before anyone goes and starts a flame, keep in mind this is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ review, and I feel like I need to get the point across that this game does NOTHING to address actual depression.Long story short, I don't recommend. Not because it isn't actually a game, but for the tremendously unrealistic portrait of a depressed person. To put it bluntly, this does not seem like a depressed individual who you control in the story, but a socially awkward, self-loathing, well, ♥♥♥♥♥. I don't mean to say people with depression are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥because they aren't, don't put those words in my mouth. I'm saying that this guy, who has a girlfriend who loves him; a job that, in spite of his hatred of it, pays well enough for him to be comfortable; a family that loves and cares about him, and who constantly are trying to help and support him through it; and a ♥♥♥♥ING KITTEN (No, I'm not kidding) manages to still just be a mope about everything. Thats not depression my friend, thats called a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ attitude. Which is ok, I have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ attitude towards most things. But the point is, the main character is a tremendous ♥♥♥♥♥. And the people who suffer from depression related to a.)substance abuse b.)abuse in general or c.)real, actual problems in their lives that create stress are amazing people for sticking it out and I suggest they seek help etc. But if you have a girlfriend, loving family, a supporting job that gets you by, and a KITTEN, thats a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, rotten attitude you got there friend. Should be called ""♥♥♥♥♥♥ Attitude Quest""0.5/10(I gave it .5 points because I have a soft spot for kittens.)			"

												The question you propably have if you haven't played this propably is: ''is this game good?''. Here is a better one: ''is this a game?'' The answer to both questions is no IMO. Why? Cause it is just a mediocre book. There is no gameplay and no graphics. There is no reason to play it over so many wonderful free games on steam. Let me cut this game apart in steps.1: No gameplay: Gameplay makes a game, and this one does not even have incomplete controls. It is just a book with some options, there is no gameplay that keeps you excited. It is just not there.2: The story is stupid: Who makes a game about a girl who is despressed and you need to help her get rid of that depression. To me, that is not a good idea for a game (but this is not a game anyway). For a game that tries to sell itself as immersive, the poor writing and the long walls of uninteresting text just make me want to skip it all. 3: It is not fun: I know that at the beginning it says that ''it is not meant to be fun'', but fun is the thing that makes a game good for me. Even technically bad games will be liked by me if they have a good fun factor. But this one does not even try, and it is not hard to see. It is so boring, its only use would be as a tool to help you sleep. If you want to read a book, THEN READ A F*CKING BOOK. 4: The developer: This is a thing that keeps coming to my mind when i think about this 'game'. You see all of those reviews saying it is a great game? Well the 'game' itself did not do anything to create these positive reviews. Rather the developer had sex with the reviewers and they had to pay her in a good review for her game, i am not kidding.... look here:

 all credit to InternetAristocrat for making it. It is just stupid, and also why the reviews are lies. Developer Zoe Quinn....... you should be ashamed of yourself.

And you may call me a hypocrite for wasting 7 minutes on it (it felt much longer), but now i experienced it and i want no more..... ever. The End.			"

They didn't ask for this.Though on the game here's what I think:I won't go on about how the text is uninteresting, etc. or that your  options are always left and right,  even though the door on the left is a hallway to the right.The game was so unengaging, that you don't have to worry about being called a sociopath if you didn't care about what happened to the character. A man in the prime of his life, with a girlfriend, friends, a job, and his own place. That's a lot more than I have, and I'm not complaining with what I do, So why's this guy upset? I guess what I'm trying to say is: This guy has no reason to complain, he's got a mate and lads to hang out with, a job, etc. so what's his deal? The thing with depression is: There's always some sort of underlying cause, and one is never given in the game. How do I sympathize with someone who hasn't a tale to his struggle? There's no sign of social distress, or infidelity (Which would be ironic in a Zoey Quinn game) no past history to go off of to see that the character has a reason to be depressed. And that's the thing: He doesn't. You quickly realize that the character is unsuitable to represent depression, or at least a common form. The Developer's chosen the MOST UNLIKELY SCENARIO to give someone depression, and that's why I can't feel a connection.There's more I'd say, but I've decided to refrain.TL;DR? Succinctly: It's kind of like a mid-life crisis ten+ years too early.			"

												My son (whose account this is) bought this game a few weeks ago. It was around that time I started noticing a change in his behaviour. He lost his appetiite, spent hours in bed and listened to Radiohead a lot. A few days later I came home from work to find he had killed himself with a shotgun while wearing corpsepaint and listening to some god-forsaken noise by a band called mayhem. Do not let your children play this throughly depressing game!			"

												Its a fast food joint that serves up burgers-- so don't expect a ""5-star"" restaurant, just expect a damn good burger served up the way it should be done. Also, if you've been to a 5 Guys, you know what you're getting here, this is pretty run of the mill. All that said, I love this place probably more than I should. And there's a couple reasons for that....Its fast food, but its cooked to order. This isn't like those other fast food places where you place your order and its ready in 60 seconds. Place your order and grab some free peanuts while you wait for everything to be prepared fresh and to-order. Free peanuts! Don't want to spring for fries? Fill up on these little guys instead.The burger itself. I know its not very good for me, but I love these patties, covered in gooey cheese and crispy bacon, topped with whatever I ask for. And the fries. Sometimes over salted, they're cooked nice and crispy and delicious. And they're tossed into the bag, overflowing from their container. If you're not stuffed after a burger and an order of these guys, you're inhuman. All in all, if you set your expectations right and are looking for a good but not so good-for-you fast food meal, you'll have a hard time finding something better than this 5 Guys.			"

												I cannot give this a thumbs up because to me it is not a game. The options bottle neck you as it should, that being what depression does, the characters sometimes feel blank. Lack of pictures help focus on the literature but it makes it less game, the options given feel a bit wrong but as it is relatively accurate I can't complain. It shouldn't have been sold as a game or reviewed as a game and definitely doesn't deserve being on Steam. There's better books, and better things in its style but for the price of free it's definitely good. It should not be on Steam and did not deserve the reviews it got from gaming magazines and other game related companies. 6/10 bookish thing, 0/10 game.			"

												Firstly, if you are having mental health issues similar to the ones depicted in this game, please seek help. Even if it seems like you're being dramatic or making a big deal of a situation, talk to someone at the very least. Many of the negatice reviews are simply from other steam users who wantes to enjoy a free to play text based game. However this doesn't necessarily belong on the same page as team fortress 2 as it's not a game. It's more of a short story providing the 'player' with simplistic choices to conquer a situation where that situation has no satisfying conclusion. It's not an enjoyable 'game' by any means, it's sole purpose is to educate people about mental illness.     "

												It had hyperlinks. It had too much reading. And I didn't understand the concept of this ""game"" at all. I don't think this is even called a game because it was done terrifying. I thought you had to get out the the depression, but instead it twists around, and makes you even more so depressed. This was also the shortest hyperlink clicking object thing ever. 25 mins I think. Yes I am a girl so I am not trying to be sexist. Being bullied online you just have to block and report them. I couldn't tell if I were a guy or a girl at all as my character. Then again I got bored of reading millions of paragraphs per page. If you wanna read about depression make a book instead of a game. For some weird reason this game made me play webkinz again... There is something mentally and physically wrong with the publisher of the game. Zoe Quin wasn't it?        This quote: “Depression Quest hinges on its deeply personal writing style. It feels as though you’re reading someone’s unfiltered mental diary. Depression Quest is uncomfortable in that it feels voyeuristic, but the cramped proximity is how you develop a relationship with the character. It’s why, by the end, I was able to say I understood depression a bit better. It's a window.” By-Giant Bomb Was not a smart quote I would say. By the end of the game to me I didn't understand depression at all. It wasn't in first person at all it was in second or third person view. Reading a diary? I just said it was in second or third person view. I didn't develop a relationship with the character at all.    This quote also: “Besides the blues-ridden story, it's just a well-made game overall. It's excellently written, well-paced, and so engaging that you might just find yourself playing again to find out what might happen” By-GameSpy Well, let me just say this, it's too slow. Yea I played it kinda fast cuz I got bored or reading the paragraphs, but how the story builded up was too slow. It didn't have a climax, lowering action, and cliffhangers. It was just one straight line. Yea when it comes to games I don't reccomend I have like a really long paragraph.			"

												Don't waste your storage on this game. You know it's♥♥♥♥♥♥when it's immediately free. She didn't call it Depression Quest for nothing y'know. You'd feel miserable too realizing you just downloaded A VISUAL NOVEL AS YOUR LIST OF STEAM GAMES. Think Gone Home but with MS Paint and word texting.

												Just a day off of school and I scroll through this, and pick it up because I have nothing better to do.I played through it, answering honest and what is best, and I got a generally good ending.The game is just a story, nothing mechanical other than clicking and making games. Even though it might not be considered a game we all know and love, it is more of a novel or a little story, like a webpage comic or something. So if you were expecting a game, this might disappoint you. Steer away from this if you just want gameplay.A person like me loves a story, and this game did well to portrait realism and a guy genuinely going through life choices that we are all destined towards to, experiencing depression and emotionall/physical exhaustion. The choices in this game chilled my spine just thinking what would happen if I clicked it. Also, there is a nice feature, which if you are depressed in a level, it won't let you make the choice, further adding realism. You can't expect a morbidly depressed guy to suddenly go up to people and say ""Hey guys, hows the weather"".The ""characters"" did well in their role, adding a sense to the story, etheir adding emotional support if you choose the accept it. ""The music adds to the surreal atmosphere, although I put off my headphones because I don't want to feel chillsOverall, if you like stories, go with this. If you like choice-making, go with this. Otherwise, I would steer away from it because it's not an actual game.( I do like the awareness spread with this.)			"

												Before I start this review, I just want to ask one thing: Me and the bae want to guy out to eat tonight, does anyone suggest anything? I've heard Five Guys is pretty good.Now that we've got that out of the way, let's talk about the actual ""game"" itself. It isn't one. It's a ""visual novel"" and I use that word as loose as Zoe Quinn apparently is.This game has Tumblr written all over it; it's almost funny to me. It's pretty much the equivalent of some SJW trying to be deep and poetic, trying to make something that's ""groundbreaking"" or some stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥like that. It's essentially about a guy who didn't get an extra hour in the ball-pit at Dashcon, and now he's an over-emotional crybaby who can't get out of his own ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.One thing that actually made me laugh: the music. It's some somber piano track that trys to force the ""sad"" feeling of the game, but is about as emotional as Yung Lean. This ""game"" is so pretentious that it's not even funny.My final conclusion: The one thing I don't understand is: Why would you cheat on your boyfriend with ""le five guys xd"" to get such a stupid game greenlighted? If you're gonna sleep your way to the top, at least make a game that shows for your work; not some tl;dr HTML crap.5 McLovin's out of 5. One for the burger, two for the fries (because Five Guys give you a lot of fries), one for the drink, and one for the overall atmosphere of the restauraunt.0 privilege-checking McLovin's for ""Pretentious Quest"".

												If you are unfamiliar with depression, or know someone suffering with depression, play this to get an idea of how they may feel and how hard it is for them to do certain kinds of things. I love seeing unique experiences on Steam. My hat goes off to the developer for releasing the game free to reach as many as possible. Depression Quest is an interactive text novel  where you read real-life examples of how someone with depression feels and then try to select the best answer for him. Depending on how depressed your character currently is some answers are crossed out/unavailable such as ""Hunker down and get to work"". This helps those unfamiliar with depression to get an idea of how debilitating depression is.You can tell a lot of time and attention to detail has been put into this game. The music changes to match how your choices are affecting the characters depression and the graphics on each story page also change.			"

												From a person with clinical depression i found myself able to relate with how the main character was feeling, like waking up some days and just not wanting to get up because you feel so bad or telling people everything is okay when really you are falling apart. I had read some reviews prior to playing and i realized once again how immature and stupid people can be and those of you who posted those stupid comments i hope yall grow up one day. To the developers, i actually enjoyed the game and its mechanics, how ever i didnt understand why i couldnt choose some of the choices and at first had no idea what was going on, as i progressed i learned i was playing a 20 something year old and was male but i would have been nice to know those details alittle sooner. I enjoyed the happy ending as well, how he ended up saying that for once he was good. like i mentioned before i suffered with clinical depression since i was 11 years old and even now into my 20s but as life has gone on it has only gotten better but its still hard some days and i think the developers hit the nail on the head with the way some people with depression feel, it wasnt perfect but i feel they accomplished what they said the object of the game was and i really enjoyed seeing the main character end up happy. I hope yall continue to make more games i would like to see them. Goodluck:)			"

												I like the set up of this game and its very cool you have several possible responses to choose from in each event of this person's life your in charge of living. Of course every decision later affects future decisions.The more positive the decision, the more positive the responses usually be. Likewise the opposite can happen as well, when your character becomes more depressed. The one ordeal I'm trying to figure out, if its even possible is being able to almost choose the top positive expression. I do feel though that's just there to show what he'd choose if he was mentally capable to at the current moment(most of the time if chosen right it might become available) and not so deeply affected by his depression.Regardless though playing this game helped me realize(or rememebr more clearly/understand) quite a bit about myself since I used to feel some aspects of depression after some events in my life occurred and I thought I couldn't be happy after them. I did figure out a way to get past them and got rid of habits, some mentioned here such as going to bed at a healthy time and helping others. A lot of this is real life and can happen to any of us. Depression hits you randomly but you gotta be strong enough to break from it. Granted its hard but encouraging yourself and others can do a lot of good to help those feelings melt away.I would recommend a friend to play this at least a few times if you enjoy real life themed games cause this one is written pretty well for how generic it might seem to be layed out. I like the visual/in game sounds that add to the emotion your reading about. Your mind surely does draw a lot of metal pictures to all you end up reading, maybe even envisioning yourself in the situations/or recurring similar ones.			"

												I cannot in good conscious recommend this game for any reason, and I took notes as to why, huzzah! This review will be slightly nit-picky and slightly spoiler-ridden, but no one who reads this is really going to care about that.Starting off with the very first line of this story we have this: ""You are a 20-something human being"". Okay, cool. But yet it reads that your significant other is named ""Alex"", again, not a huge deal until you realize that Alex is a female, meaning the only two demographics of ""human being"" that the author recognizes are heterosexual men and homosexual women. If you are a heterosexual female or a homosexual man, tough cookies hombre! I mean, why even include this if it's so obvious that this story is about a female and her experience with ""depression""? to make people feel included? great job there! you couldn't even include a sexuality slider somewhere? And let's talk about the protagonist here: over the course of the story she is clearly socially awkward with what seems to me to be a rather average case of ADD.Throughout the pages of the story you will see notifications about her depression level, and the lowest I could get it to was ""mildly depressed"" However, knowing what clinically describes depression and how depression actually feels like are two wholly different beasts entirely. Honestly in my opinion this person was just fed up with their awful job at kinkos or fedex, or where-ever and simply wasn't cut out for customer service. Hey, I get that some people aren't meant for that sort of job! But I don't care HOW depressed you are, you are NEVER too depressed to order a pizza over the phone, or most likely over the internet. Heck, I'm almost willing to bet that because of a bad mood you might get extra toppings on it, maybe get some sort of dessert, too!Returning to your depression however, lets take a closer look at what you claimed to have done in order to calm your mind, shall well? Netflix. video games. playing with your cat with a laser pointer, browsing social media.. never at any point while reading through this whatever-it-is did you once make a reference to, or make any attempt to do some sort of physical activity for the purpose of stress-relief. A sedentary lifestyle, which the protagonist seems to have displayed throughout this story leads me to believe that they were not in fact depressed, but simply bored. This lack of physical activity in the protagonist's de-stressing routine may have led to additional stresses, such as an inability to deal with others and making one become quick to anger. (Which really isn't helped by the cliche nosy mother character you seem to have.) It could also explain the complete lack of progress on this ""secret project"" they keep whispering about. Though maybe this motherly issue is somehow related to the fact that the protagonist very well may have lead a rather sheltered life up until leaving the nest and the mother is simply putting on a harsher front to help toughen her up. In either case the protagonist is overly sensitive to perceived threats and probably needs trigger warnings when watching the news.If all of this wasn't enough the protagonist is also quite paranoid, not to the point of delusion really, but every single thing is like ""oh geez, oh man! what if! aaaarg!""  And ya know what? this protagonist needs a good slap in the back of the head, NCIS style. Not everything is a personal attack, not everything is a slight against you, In fact most people on earth have some of these effects simply due to aging. Yes, even an inability to sleep.So, is the protagonist in this story depressed at any point? I believe the other reviews will answer that question nicely. See what I did there? you and your awful ending.. feh! this whole thing was just absolutely infuriating.			"

												It's a game. Thats the only real positive thing I can say about it. As far as a simulator goes it is very poorly designed and written out. The right and wrong choices are painfully obvious so theres no real trial and error to play. Besides that the choices that would actually help you get out of depression are all blocked, as if everyone with depression has zero mental willpower to try and help themselves. Overall my experience with this game has been very depressing indeed, the biggest letdown was the fact there was no suicidal option on the panels, as well as the fact the piano music was driving me insane to the point I had to turn off my speakers and risk not hearing the inevitable gunshot. I would not recommend this game as one to play seriously, but more as to show friends how bad it is.			"

												I see a lot of reviews talking about how Depression Quest isn't a fun game, and at least one review saying that the game reduces the serious subject of clinical depression to being a whiny ♥♥♥♥♥.To be honest, you should play the game. I finished it in 55 minutes, and I see a lot of the reviews played for a lot less time than that - to beat the game that much faster, you'd have to avoid reading which eliminates the point of playing a text-based game or you'd have to flake out part of the way through and write a review without fully understanding the subject of your own review, IE talking out of your♥♥♥♥♥This is not a fun game. If you've ever played Spec Ops: The Line or This War Of Mine, its one of those. This is a game expressly created to address the issue of depression in an interactive format. I'll get the gaming stuff out of the way first.Fun: 0/10Reactivity: 10/10Effort: 1010Graphics: 1/10Gameplay: 1/10Story: 7/10This is not a fun game. It was never meant to be fun, or feel like a heroic journey against impossible odds. This is a game designed to take the experience of being depressed, of feeling like you're a worthless piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥and nothing you do matters, and present that in a format where people who aren't depressed might understand. Since we've established that Depression Quest has little to no value purely as a video game, how does it meet that design goal?Based on my personal experience with the game, I'd say it does. It presents the feeling of being depressed in the long post-process paragraphs after you make decisions which your character reflects on. I'm not gonna lie - you're going to need to have a basic understanding of human empathy and need to be paying attention to read through the lines and see the emotions rolling around in the character. That said, that'd also be true if you were speaking with a person who is depressed and trying to open up to you.I can't believe I'm saying this, but somehow a free game about the experience of depression is controversial, as established by this game's history as kicking off the GamerGate lunacy. But as a simple unbiased player, I find this game unfun and a step to the side compared to what I normally go to video games for. However, that's the exact design goal of this game, and I feel it succeeds in what it was trying to do. Even the controversy can be interpreted as success, since more often than not depression in my society (USA) is interpreted as being a whiny ♥♥♥♥♥ who won't take responsibility for themself.As an experience, I give this game an 8/10, and I would recommend every gamer play this at least once.

												     Boring as all holy hell, railroaded to a bland ending, bland character and story progression.     The music is dull and repetitive, with one song in the soundtrack. I keep seeing people compare this to choose your own adventure books, and that's insulting, the writers of stories like the Fighting Fantasy series put effort into their games. This game looks like a 90s website, with the artwork being pictures they most likely got on a google image search.     They claim this is a learning experience, I knew nothing about clinical depression before playing, I still know jack♥♥♥♥♥♥ The character comes off more as a whining little turd than anything else, he's got lots of friends, a girlfriend, and job that he says right at the beginning he's been rising through the ranks quickly. He's got more than many people who don't mope and ♥♥♥♥♥ about their life. Then, when he gets to doing something about his problem, it takes half a year to get it under control; Damn that's fast!      Looking at the posted official reviews on their Steam page, I see three gaming sites whose word I will never trust. Not just the game is unpleasant though, the developers are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. I dared to make a snarky discussion post and it took about an hour for them to ban my discussion. They are actively censoring criticism where they can, and I'll probably be accused of being a mysoginist for saying this game sucks.      Also, a lot of the other reviews are making me hungry, I'm going to Five Guys.			"

												What’s my verdict on Depression Quest? The game isn’t quite a game. I’m not even sure what to call this. A short story, maybe? An adventure novel? It might even be too short to be considered an adventure novel. I’m not really sure why this is on Steam. Unless Steam is soon deciding that branching out into short stories is a good idea, this isn’t a game, and it’s categorized as one, so why is it here? It’s a “hit next” simulator at best. The ability to convey depression through Depression Quest is something that only the worst of game developers could master. The experience was so horrible, not by the content that they included to intentionally make me feel horrible — no, by the lack of content that was greatly overlooked by these “game developers”. Game review? This was more of a “short story” review, but I hear 5 guys out of 10 loved it. Me? I’ll keep my integrity: Zoe Quinn’s monstrosity was the worst game that I have ever played.			"

												This ""game"" felt real to me. Depression Quest is very upfront about its intentions and what it is. This collection of choose your own story narratives is the result of a few people and their friends/family who experienced depression using their collective experience to tell a story. It isn't the story of every depressed person at all, no matter how many variations you try to go through, but from what is there, you can get an idea of what it is like for some people.They clearly say this and I'll repeat it. This is not meant to be fun. This isn't an enjoyable game. If you yourself are or have been depressed then you may not want to play this. It gives you a vague idea of how someone suffering might not be able to act in certain ways, and the resulting feelings they are experiencing when they make a choice.Going through this, making choices that I would see myself making years ago, I could relate to the narrative that was told as a result. For this reason I think this is an alright way to try to vaguely understand how someone with depression might be feeling.This is just my advice. I do not recommend choosing the ""right"" responses based on what you know to be the best course of action. Try choosing options that are maybe a little isolated from people. Avoid what might be considered uncomfortable for an introverted person. Don't try to act like a healthy person if you're playing it to try to understand someone who isn't.And don't play this for fun. It's hardly a ""game"". It's an interactive story.			"

												Due to a medical problem, I've been for some years in a perpetual dark place before it got treated: guess what? That problem, messing around with hormones, can make you slip in a depression.What Depression Quest was describing was what I've lived. So, yeah, it struck a cord.While I don't think it will cure you or help to put the disease behind, I do think that the game can open eyes for some people (depressed or not).You're in the shoes of a man, getting depressed each day a little more. As it's a choose-your-own-story type of game, you choose the option that will suit you better. Sometimes, the results are not what you expected. These choices will have an impact on your job, on your relationship and on your family. In the end, or you fight the disease or you let yourself getting into a darker pit.As I've said, it struck a cord in myself.			"

												This is definitely not a happy game, but for those who have depression, it really hits home. Several times I couldn't help but see the parallels between the narrator's thoughts and mine. Just like the game does, I'll have to warn those with severe depression that some moments could possibly be triggering. Just like real life, Depression Quest doesn't really have an ending, more of a reflection of the choices you made and the people you reached out to. Yes, some endings are more hopeful than others, but overall, I think Depression Quest did a great job of getting inside the head of someone who is stuck in an endless cycle, not sure how to get out. However, it also teaches you that while you may not make a lot of money or save the world, sometimes it's the little things that make life worthwhile.			"

												I haven't finished the game yet but I just really want to leave a review. Sorry this is gonna get kinda personal. When I was still a junior in high school I was diagnosed with OCD. I'm pretty sure I've had it as long as I can remember but the severity of it was quite low, barely noticeable. Last year it got worse. A lot worse. My grades dropped, I barely slept, I hated myself. Let's say after a while it felt very similar to Depression. After about five months of that my mom noticed that something wasn't right with me she talked me into seeing a psychologist. I started taking a medication and seeing a therapist weekly. It's been over a year now and I feel so much better. I haven't even finshed this game yet but I just see so much of myself in it I'm crying. I am legitimately crying. To Zoe Quinn, Patrick Lindsey and Isaac Schankler I just want to say 'thank you.'

												I saw the many negative reviews, read some of them, and knew what was going on.The fact that there are so many negative reviews is indicative of the very thing that is one major cause of depression. Things like complaining that not all reaction options are available or criticizing an allegedly clichée or cheesy or pretentious writing or how the music is dull and repetitive shows a horrifying lack of empathy, a refusal to see and experience a situation from someone else's viewpoint or to even look at it; upset of not being handed an I-win-button, annoyed by discomfort, by the game tucking at things suppressed in the psyche.I suspect that at least some of the negative reviewers who claim they have been through depression themselves and this game is no good for portraying that have merely been 'successfully' conditioned into dealing with an uncaring world by becoming more uncaring themselves. Because if you can't stand the pain anymore, you have to become the pain. But everybody just becoming as egotistical as the society that affects them is not a solution, but the very expression of the problem.The general emotional experience of the player character I can relate to a lot, while many situational elements not, but that doesn't matter. This game is art in that it conveys an experience to the player, so I guess it is only natural that all those who are fueling the problem will not like it. This game is like an enactment, through showing the mirror and making people attack their projection or focus on evasion points.Its high negative review ratio is like a representative for the emotional distance and uncaring that depressed people might have to deal with every day.It was easy for me to come to a very positive outcome, just by choosing what I would have chosen in a real situation, not even the supposedly strongest, ideal decisions (if there even is one, because everything has up- and downsides). The player character is relatively lucky. Other people might not have any of the potentially positive influences available to tap into. For them it might be a losing game from the start. Unless we change that.If the negative critique points mentioned are your grievances, too, then take that as a sign that you are not helping with your current mindset. And maybe I shouldn't even say mindset, because as this game conveys quite well, the mind alone cannot solve problems of the heart. It is caring and the will to make an effort for a better world, to accept inconveniences based on empathy for others, that solves such problems. And that requires a certain amount of courage. Not so much the kind of courage that makes the warrior wield a sword against a foe, but the kind that makes him cut out a parasite from his own body.https://twitter.com/Dowlphin/status/704736089823645703All the mind can do is square the circle, but it can never remove the sharp edges that cause injury.https://twitter.com/Dowlphin/status/701880481181208578True caring hurts.That's why it's unpopular.

												In reading the reviews for this game i believe that most of these people are misssing the point so im going to adress all of these as i go.First thing i have seen alot of was that all the good choices where crossed out... ofcourse they are. when you live with depression doing something as simple as getting out of bed can be difficult  so ofcourse you cant do certain things.. your depression wont allow you to do them.Secondly there where alot of complaints about the music and the dullness of design... this is also themeing... when you live with depression for long enough things do begin to dull but you dont notice it it hapens slowly over time in little ways, and then when you are finally free from the beast of depression everything else seems so much more vibrant. i feel like the devs where attempting to maintain that dull feellastly ive seen alot of reviews claiming that this isnt a game... lets start with the definition of a video game. a game played by electronically manipulating images produced by a computer program on a television screen or other display screen. DepressionQuest seems to fit the bill alright. and i know that its not funny or fun, but its not meant to be. its honest, its an expression its art in a way which is something that gamers have been trying to claim that video games are formore than half a decade. and personally this game hit home for me.. i was diagnosed with major depressive disorder a year ago, but my therapist beives that i developed depression for the first time when i was 13, thats 7 years of my life i spent fighting just to do mundane things and thinking i was crazy because they were so difficult for me to acomplish. 1 in 3 people in the world have depression most of them dont even know they have it. just think about all the people  that can be helped by simply playing this game and realizing that they arnt crazy there are other people out there who have the exact same problem.

A close analog I can think of would probably be the Stanley Parable which, for all its 1st POV and GUI and mouse, pretty much is a ""Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Book"" but in 3D. DQ hearkens back to earlier-era text-based games. It's no surprise that the game's epigraph come from David Foster Wallace, who crafted in boredom and addiction and depression as much as Pynchon does paranoia, as the closest prose relation (as well as most probable genesis) is his short story ""The Depressed Person"". My one criticism is actually a rather common one when it comes to western RPGs as well as love songs (not to mention Bella Swan in Twilight): by making the protagonist's circumstances and personality so general, you'e actually making them less universal. Providing specficity is what creates resonance, as specificity provides more opportunity for empathy. Largely, though, due to the nature of the game and the fact that you are making the choices, you're able to tailor the 2nd person POV so it can be more like a mirror and you can be the one whose actually making these decisions. I felt immersed in this than I ever did Fallout 3, and in a fraction of the time too.Overall, an amazing game that everyone ought to play.			"

												I have depression, and I've seen a lot of people say they hate it, but.... I think it's spot on. I'm only 23 minutes into working on this story, and I agree with a lot of viewpoints. It's not easy being depressed, the constant anxiety, the feeling that you can't really get up and do anything.... It really feels that way. And when loved ones and parents start saying ""You can get through this, just suck it up and do more with your life"", it doesn't work that way. Depression doesn't work that way. I really think a lot of people that do have depression would agree with most of it. BUt, that's my belief.... I actually really like it, and it kind of helps to know at least someone knows how it feels and how it seems to effect the world around you. That's all I gotta say ^^""			"

												All commentary on the hate and misogyny that stood in the way of this interactive experience aside, this game was a worthwhile experience if only because there are too few things like it, be it tackling the subject of depression or creating a game that is something other than burly white men shooting at each other with oversized phallic symbols. Well done, everyone who worked on this. Congratulations to you on your success in the face of biggotry, Miss Quinn.  ~From Russia with Love			"

												I managed to get rid of depression in this game via few clicks. Took me 14 minutesMLG, ♥♥♥♥♥es.Okay, let me give it a constructive criticism, it would be easy to mention something about five guys or something, I just did, whatever.Let's talk about the....g..game-...novel......thing.....I don't know.SJW software.It doesn't  give you the proper idea of what depression really is. It doesn't.The game gives you too much information. ""You are now depresed, you can't now properly talk to people and stuff""People with depression don't know that much about themselves, they don't really know anymore what's going around them.Game is also too scared to show you the darkests the worst case of being severely depressed. Suicide, I choosen the worst choices, no death. I'm just  severely depressed.And yeah, there's no way around this it's clear what choice will get you out of depression and which won't. It's clear as hell, the game pretty much tells you what good is.The writting is...pretty bad honestly""You didn't take the cat as you think that ALL cats hate you, your inner monologue is giving you enough hate alreadly""Not word for word, too lazy to copy paste. But seriously, that's some Heavy Rain stuff right there. And by that I want to say that it's poorly written and doesn't really shows how depressed people think. The soundtrack will get on your nerves, rather than making me depressed it makes me annoyed. Help me. ArergehThis game doesn't show the depression for what it really is, it is too scared to show the darkests turns where depression can take you.There is no gameplay.The writting isn't good. It's was hard for me to read through this all, not cause it's too ""sad"" but cause it's not a good read. The choices are clear, it's clear what choice will help you, every thing is too clear, you are not confused you know EXACTLY what's happening throughout this game. Nothing worth while here. Move on.It doesn't achieve what it thinks it's achieve, or what people think it's achieving. It doesn't.			"

												Not a bad game, not really something I would invest much more time into, but I think that everyone who immediately dismisses the game is probably suffering from depression themselves and this game probably struck a chord to close to home. So maybe they should seek help, from a doctor, for depression. Also, what kind of sandwich does he eat before he works on his projects? I want a sandwich.			"

												This is an impartial review of this game.  I'm aware of the Zoe Quinn Scandal and the bad publicity of this game, however, I wanted to try it on my own with as unbiased a few as possible.  First and foremost, this is certainly not a game by any means and should be treated more as a depression simulation and should be provided to those suffering with depression to share with those around them.  Though the game fails to provide any catalyst to explain the depression or to allow the player to empathize with the character, all of the activities, layouts, choices, and mindsets clearly depict depression as intended.  On this front, the ""game"" achieves what it intended to do.  Since it is free of charge, this depression sim should be recommended to anyone who knows someone suffering with depression.  Even if you hate Zoe Quinn for the scandal or want to blast this for not being a true game, think of the message of depression and the stigma it can help alleviate to help people.Pros:-Accurately depicts depression symptoms, feelings, actions, restrictions etc...-Will accurately explain depression to someone who hasn't experienced it-Spreads awareness of what true depression is and helps alleviate stigma of mental illness-Costs nothingCons:-Just like Coming Home, this isn't a game-The player will only relate to the character if they are within the range of late teens through twenties, limiting audience-There is no explanation for the depression, making the character appear to be a whiny privileged person with first world problems-Anyone unaware that this is essentially a depression sim read-along may be in for disappointment			"

The story the ""game"" tells is interesting enough I suppose, enough to get me to an ending. After playing it, I can say it's not fun, but that's advertised already. It's a text based adventure to make you think about stuff. It was semi-relatable. I guess it's okay as a choose-your-own-adventure type thing, but it's not really re-playable.

												I believe that it's a pretty interesting game. If you really read everything and understand it you find out that it's not meant to be a fun or excting game, but more of a serious game which from playing it I can see why. Some aspects really caputre the depressed state. I for one think that some of the things are pretty accurate, but not everyone will because not every experiences depression the same way as other people. All and all it's a good game and should have better reviews than it really does. Indeed it is a ver touchy subject and is risky to make, but I still think the developers did a very good job despite some typos.			"

												This game has quite a lot of negative reviews saying that it is inaccurate or that there are no options. I disagree with both of these points, I think there's a lot of value in this game and you can pick other options, you unlock options based on your earlier actions. The game isn't entirely inaccurate, mental illness affects everyone differently and this is a very plausible case. This game would definitely help someone with no understanding of depression to understand more.			"

												Depression Quest provides a very brief but intense impression of what a depression may feel like. If you have someone near you suffering depression and may want to gather a better understanding of what they fight through, the game may provide a better insight. Just like this horrible psychological disease, depression quest does not provide a definitive ending with a clear solution to the problem. The game shows the struggle and fight people with depression have to go through, even if it is only a glimpse at what they may experience. As someone who suffers a chronic despression myself, i would like to warn everybody with this illness to play this game while having a rather unstable emotional status as it may indeed trigger you. Nevertheless it is a stark reminder of battles one has already gone through.			"

												The game makes a very important point at the end: there is not a ""true"" end to depression, as it is something that just happens and you can't plan it. There is so much stigma and ignorance against mental illness and I find that the game portrayed it very well, as well as the feelings of desperation, self loathing, mind feeling numb and blank all the time, and making those little efforts that although they are absolutely important to someone with a disorder, it feels like we did nothing. I found the game particularly real and it felt like reading the diary of someone that actually feels the way I do. The scratched out choices, who were like ""the best choices for yourself"" were scratched out and that makes a powerful statement: you can't just shake off depression or any other disorder, because it is  a chemical imbalance in the brain, an illness, no different than any other and it consumes you slowly.I hope Zoe Quinn will still produce beautiful content like this in the future.

As someone who has been depressed before (and to the point in which I took therapy for multiple months) I am unable to vouch for this game.  For some reason, Mrs. Quinn thought it would be a good idea to put some options you just *can't* pick ""'CAUSE IT'S JUST LIKE REAL LIFE LOL"" and you're forced to go through the game.  It's booring and has no purpose to exist.			"

												Going to be honest here and agree with my friend Klay on this one; This game is full of flaws and totally inaccurate. I mean, I understand this IS a simulation and that all games can have errors, but this one just sucks. Like, imagine getting excited over the PS4 or something similar when they're just released - you buy it, unpack it (Or it ships to your house and this is the next step you partake in..) AND IT'S ♥♥♥♥ING BROKEN. THIS IS WHAT THIS GAME FEELS LIKE. I ALMOST FELL ASLEEP. So happy this game was free and now I see why.			"

												A short but good enough game, considering it's free...Actually got me depressed at the start. Pretty glad I read it to the end in one sitting, otherwise I'd have remained depressed afterwards XPThat being said, it's more like reading someone else's story than playing a game. Or rather, that's exactly what it was. And while I can sympathise with the main character on one too many things I can't help but feel like it's possibly too convenient how if you pick the right choices, everything goes along smoothly and everything is just fine and dandy...Still, would reccomend it as it's free and short.

												Wow, this is a really boring game, if you can call it that. Having dealt with depression my entire adult life, even I couldn't relate to this caricature of depression, and I highly doubt people that don't know depressed individuals personally would be able to relate to this exaggeration, which seems to be the intent of the whole enterprise. I really don't understand the push to put this on Steam, the experience would be exactly the same in a browser based format without all the drama that stemmed from it's ""release"".			"

												*sigh*  SO like some of you and a lot of who didn't.  I have(do?) suffered with depression.This game brought tears to my eyes as I relived thoughts in my head of times past.  At this point, I have recently broken up with my girlfriend and I fear that I did that because of how she was feeling when she was depressed, especially after reading this.  I may have fractured a relationship forever because of my own insecurities and fears.The phone number of the therapist in the game was an actual phone number to a Toronto based therapist (I assume it works based on IP, or the creator(s) are Canadian).  I am strongly considering calling them as a result of what has happened.While I agree with a previous commenter that the protagonist has a much better life than some, sometimes depression hits you the worst when you are in the middle of an upswing (have a sig. other, job, etc.) like it apparently did me.To anyone who feels down and depressed.  Do yourself a favour, no matter how bad things may feel, talk to someone, anyone that may have an inkling of giving a damn about you.  If that doesn't work, call a suicide hotline and tell them you want to get in touch with a local therapist.Anyone who is depressed can be brought back from that.  Anyone who wants things to change, has the power to change them.  You are your own worst enemy and your own best friend.			"

												Depression Quest, the game that shattered the gaming community due to alleged journalistic bias going to this game regarding her being in a relationship with the journalists.  While I cannot confirm this nor care enough to, Depression Quest is an interesting experience.  For those who don't know what it's like to have the frustration of clinical depression, this game does do a good job trying to explain it.  You really do feel for the main character who just doesn't know what to do.  I especially like the design choice of X-ing out one of the dialogue options that you or me would choose but  not someone with clinical depression.  Now it is a text based adventure and I did finish the game in under an hour.  There are different routes you can take the story like try to get professional help or keep it all bottled inside.  I did get the best ending where my character is getting help and told his girlfriend about it.  It's not exactly a happy ending, but that's how it is for some people struggling with clinical depression.  I highly recommend playing through this game once.  I am glad that it's free on Steam as even asking for a dollar is kind of a little overpriced for a one-and-done game.   I don't even have this installed in my computer anymore.  But it's free so check it out.  It's not really a game, but more of an experiece.   "

												I see in other reviews that there is a lot of negativity surrounding this game. Although this game is incredibly simple with no gameplay elements nor entertainment value, I believe that there is something integral that people can take away from this. Depression Quest provides a very interesting perspective that allows one to truly understand the concequences and repercussions of depression through decently well-writen and introspective narrative and exposition.I strongly believe that this game is definitely not for the majority of people who are looking for entertainment and in general; a fun time.( which this game totally does not offer ). However, it does provide an insight about depression that is captivating if you are open-minded enough to get engrossed and invested in the characters in the story. It gives you this feeling of helplessness and despair that is truly unmatched by any game I've played.There is something i would also like the clarify, which is that this game is NOT for people suffering from depression, but rather people that are living normal/happy lives and make them truly understand and empathize for the people who are actually suffering from depression; exemplifying the helplessness and solitude they are facing, despite the social world around them.However, a word of caution is that people who are weak-hearted or suffering from depression to NOT play this game as it will  leave you in a state of mental turmoil for quite a while ( around 2 hours for me ) after finishing the game. My advice for anyone who wants to try this game is to put yourself in the shoes of the protaganist and to keep an open-mind about the game, understanding and empathizing the emotions that the protaganist feels, making the choices that best fit the mood that you are feeling right then and there, in the shoes of the protaganist.This game is definitely not for everyone, and I only reccommend this game to people who are intruiged about how people suffering from depression feel and percieve the world around them. Otherwise, to everyone else, its a boring game and please stay away from it because its probably not a pleasant experience scrolling through text that you're not invested in, dont waste your time.OTHER NOTES: - I suggest playing this game in one sitting, it is ~1 hour.- Turn the music on, its pretty good setting the atmosphere.

												There is a lot of flak for this game and it's creator. I decided to avoid reading reviews and just dive in.Depression Quest plays like an old choose-your-adventure book. You play as a depressed man and are given different choices each passing day. Some choices can be unpickable based on the mental state of the protagonist.All in all, there are a few different endings but the game itself is very repetitive. The protagonist is a pathetic whiner who is completely unlikable.I talked about this game with my girlfriend who claims to have suffered from depression. I told her that the game was uninspired and the protagonist an unlikable♥♥♥♥♥♥ She got really premenstrual about this and whined about ""being intolerant"" and not understanding what a crippling disease depression supposedly is.Needless to say, we're no longer together. Anyone who's half-sane knows depression is not a REAL disease anyway.I'll give it a generous 2/10.			"

												I appriciate the game for attempting to break the mold of convention as to what is concidered a game. That being said the dialogue is very uninspired, I was hoping that this would be more of a ""literary"" game. When it came to actual mechanics the dialogue choices gave me very few options, by marking out the dialogue options in red made my interactivity fall off the chart completely.I would recommend this game because I feel that in better hands it could have been something much more interesting. With command functions and true dialogue responses it could have connected the player closer to the content. I had a very strong disconnection when the script tried to put me in first person. I feel that the game would be more effective if the player was playing as someone other than themselves. From a mechanic stand point this stops the player from making the easiest, obvious or ""right"" decision.			"

												Depression Quest:I can't really classify this as an actual game, rather than an experience. Sure, it's a bit short, but it's not like the devs wanted to make this a full fledged game. Heck, not a whole lot of people even notice this game anymore. So you wanna know wether or not to get this game? (Even though it's free) P.S I'm gonna be doing this Completionist style. STORYYou start off as somebody who's, obviously going through depression. Like the description says, you are given daily life scenarios and have to decide what to do, considering the fact that you are in depression so you are not given some of the choice you may want. Luckily, in my first playthrough, I got the ""good"" ending, or where you beat depression. I would definetely NOT want to see the bad ending.... PRESENTATIONHow you play the game is by textscreen. At the bottom of the page is your choices, with some of them being crossed out making you go like, ""Oh come on why won't you WORK WITH ME"". Ok, maybe not, but that's how I felt. FINAL VERDICTAfter playing the game, and looking at other reviews, I think that this game deserves a 4/10 to a 5/10. It just feels right inbetween there because it's not good enough to be noticed by ""the big guys"" but you should defenitely give this game a shot!			"

												This is an interesting one, unlike anything I’ve played recently, and consequently rather difficult to evaluate. It would be misleading to classify it as a video game, or even a visual novel, and should be approached accordingly. The awkwardly titled (yet entirely appropriate?) Depression Quest is a cold, presumably personal take on depression. In the course of my first playthrough, completed in one sitting lasting about an hour, I felt it was more of an opinion piece, a snapshot of depression, wrapped in biographical accounts, situations and perspectives. For me, it didn’t work. The quality of writing is average at best, suffering from overwriting, repetition and a jarring form of second person narrative that too often insists on telling the reader how to feel and why. Perhaps this is intentional - one of the aims of Depression Quest, I’m told on the opening page, is to help people who do not suffer from depression to understand those who do. This could work, yet I also find that the plot was fairly generic - we assume the role of a character who is depressed for undisclosed reasons, and as a result, he or she has no energy for hobbies, work, family and friends. I’m not entirely sure what message Depression Quest carries about depression as a whole, other than that it happens. This may sound good on paper, a frank depiction of depression, the sort that doesn't necessarily have an underlying cause or meaning, but it’s akin to filming a man crying continuously for several minutes - there must be more, ultimately, to truly engage the audience, to give them a reason to care and empathise. The interactive element of Depression Quest is also questionable, multiple choices provided at the end of every other page of text. As with so many other choice-based titles, this creates an unsatisfactory overall narrative, and the idea that you can go back and change things, achieve the best possible ending, is in stark contrast to the realities of depression. Beyond that, it also creates logic problems - without spoiling anything, in one scenario I achieved a positive outcome, and a mere two pages later things had fallen through, without any real relevance carried in the writing. The music, too, is poorly implemented, the same piano piece, while fitting, looping over and over and in the end serving as little more than a frustrating distraction from the writing. Ambient sounds are introduced in various scenes - coffee shop sounds in a coffee shop, for instance - but this does little to enhance the experience. Nor do the images, small snapshots of images vaguely linked to the current scene, which seem to have various amounts of blur depending on your character’s depression level. This is another thing I don’t understand - depression, in my own experience, does not affect visual or auditory senses. I do not start seeing fuzzy images or hearing static no matter how low my mood is. Ultimately, then, I found my experience with Depression Quest underwhelming. Regardless, I recommend the title because it’s free, because a playthrough will not eat up a lot of time, and finally, because it is a personal experience that will invariably resonate with different people in different ways. If you're interested in gaining insight into one of humankind's ugliest emotions, give Depression Quest a go.			"

												Going to be honest here and agree with my friend Klay on this one; This game is full of flaws and totally inaccurate. I mean, I understand this IS a simulation and that all games can have errors, but this one just sucks. Like, imagine getting excited over the PS4 or something similar when they're just released - you buy it, unpack it (Or it ships to your house and this is the next step you partake in..) AND IT'S ♥♥♥♥ING BROKEN. THIS IS WHAT THIS GAME FEELS LIKE. I ALMOST FELL ASLEEP. So happy this game was free and now I see why.			"

												There is a lot of flak for this game and it's creator. I decided to avoid reading reviews and just dive in.Depression Quest plays like an old choose-your-adventure book. You play as a depressed man and are given different choices each passing day. Some choices can be unpickable based on the mental state of the protagonist.All in all, there are a few different endings but the game itself is very repetitive. The protagonist is a pathetic whiner who is completely unlikable.I talked about this game with my girlfriend who claims to have suffered from depression. I told her that the game was uninspired and the protagonist an unlikable♥♥♥♥♥♥ She got really premenstrual about this and whined about ""being intolerant"" and not understanding what a crippling disease depression supposedly is.Needless to say, we're no longer together. Anyone who's half-sane knows depression is not a REAL disease anyway.I'll give it a generous 2/10.			"

												I appriciate the game for attempting to break the mold of convention as to what is concidered a game. That being said the dialogue is very uninspired, I was hoping that this would be more of a ""literary"" game. When it came to actual mechanics the dialogue choices gave me very few options, by marking out the dialogue options in red made my interactivity fall off the chart completely.I would recommend this game because I feel that in better hands it could have been something much more interesting. With command functions and true dialogue responses it could have connected the player closer to the content. I had a very strong disconnection when the script tried to put me in first person. I feel that the game would be more effective if the player was playing as someone other than themselves. From a mechanic stand point this stops the player from making the easiest, obvious or ""right"" decision.			"

												As someone who has never experienced depression, I am unsure as to whether this game accurately represents the illness or if it is exaggerated for effect (although I imagine not everyone experiences depression in these ways, regardless of whether or not this game is accurate), but I found it very interesting. It does show how hard life can be when you have depression and frustrated me a time or two because I couldn't choose to do something simple or something that I would have normally done because of the character's lethargy. I was also very surprised at the amount of self-loathing this title presented, which was also very frustrating, and very depressing. So I guess the game accomplished what it set out to do, to show how depression affects people on a day-to-day basis, even if it wasn't a particularly fun game to play.Also lots of spelling errors, repeated verbs/adjectives and word confusion.

												This is an interesting one, unlike anything I’ve played recently, and consequently rather difficult to evaluate. It would be misleading to classify it as a video game, or even a visual novel, and should be approached accordingly. The awkwardly titled (yet entirely appropriate?) Depression Quest is a cold, presumably personal take on depression. In the course of my first playthrough, completed in one sitting lasting about an hour, I felt it was more of an opinion piece, a snapshot of depression, wrapped in biographical accounts, situations and perspectives. For me, it didn’t work. The quality of writing is average at best, suffering from overwriting, repetition and a jarring form of second person narrative that too often insists on telling the reader how to feel and why. Perhaps this is intentional - one of the aims of Depression Quest, I’m told on the opening page, is to help people who do not suffer from depression to understand those who do. This could work, yet I also find that the plot was fairly generic - we assume the role of a character who is depressed for undisclosed reasons, and as a result, he or she has no energy for hobbies, work, family and friends. I’m not entirely sure what message Depression Quest carries about depression as a whole, other than that it happens. This may sound good on paper, a frank depiction of depression, the sort that doesn't necessarily have an underlying cause or meaning, but it’s akin to filming a man crying continuously for several minutes - there must be more, ultimately, to truly engage the audience, to give them a reason to care and empathise. The interactive element of Depression Quest is also questionable, multiple choices provided at the end of every other page of text. As with so many other choice-based titles, this creates an unsatisfactory overall narrative, and the idea that you can go back and change things, achieve the best possible ending, is in stark contrast to the realities of depression. Beyond that, it also creates logic problems - without spoiling anything, in one scenario I achieved a positive outcome, and a mere two pages later things had fallen through, without any real relevance carried in the writing. The music, too, is poorly implemented, the same piano piece, while fitting, looping over and over and in the end serving as little more than a frustrating distraction from the writing. Ambient sounds are introduced in various scenes - coffee shop sounds in a coffee shop, for instance - but this does little to enhance the experience. Nor do the images, small snapshots of images vaguely linked to the current scene, which seem to have various amounts of blur depending on your character’s depression level. This is another thing I don’t understand - depression, in my own experience, does not affect visual or auditory senses. I do not start seeing fuzzy images or hearing static no matter how low my mood is. Ultimately, then, I found my experience with Depression Quest underwhelming. Regardless, I recommend the title because it’s free, because a playthrough will not eat up a lot of time, and finally, because it is a personal experience that will invariably resonate with different people in different ways. If you're interested in gaining insight into one of humankind's ugliest emotions, give Depression Quest a go.			"

												The game is just not as interesting or deep as it thinks it's being. It starts off with you waking up in your room on a monday morning and the flavor text berrating you. Some of this text is clickable and brings up even more text than the intial introduction. The first flag is how condescending the narrator is to the people in their life, how everybody ""is trying their best but just ""doesn't understand the pain."" Instead of explaining what ""the pain"" is or why it's affecting their life so adversly, the narrator just admits that they have a problem but that there really isn't anything anyone can do about it and that it's there to stay. The actual interactivity of the game really shows the blatent ""feel sorry for me"" attitude with options that are logical and pretty helpful with the situation or further the downward spiral of the character. Instead of having a choice in the matter, however, the ""helpful"" choices are scratched out in bright red with text at the bottom of the page reinforcing the fact that your life is terrible and nothing is helping you. I don't know if it was the developers intentions to sound condescending and pathetic at the same time but it's frankly not sad but annoying. Just because it feels like there is nowhere to go doesn't really mean it's true and if other people are willing to help you then it isn't going to hurt more just to talk about it. Also it feels like this is just focusing on a very specific type of depression instead of what could actually be a varying type of disorder that people actually have, trivializing the concept of depression. It's a game on a high horse and I'm not impressed.			"

												I tried this game expecting a result that would match some of the critics I read, and honestly, I'm baffled. This game is absolutely fine. I have gone through a few playthroughs, and I think it depicts depression (and only depression, not linked to any kind of PTSD or any other mental or emotional disease) with a simple and neat outline. Obviously, it doesn't cover everything it could cover, and as it states at the forenote, it's not recommended for people still struggling with depression.However, it puts simply the basic functioning of depression, it's limiting capacity and how it works as a neverending cycle if you don't step out of it, which is something most people without depression or closeness to someone with depression can't understand.So yes, I do recommend this game, because honestly, the basics are great, and it makes some clear statements that, judging from other reviews, not even people with depression know, and everybody should understand them.Long story short, the makers are skilled with the subject, know how it works, and produced a neat outline to display the basics of how depression feels and works, and also how to keep it on track.

												Before talking about the actual game, I want to emphasize the first sentence of this game's description: ""Depression Quest is an interactive fiction game where you play as someone living with depression"". If you're expecting anything more than a text based game, think depression is just 'people being lazy' or simply don't like reading, this is not a game for you.I've seen some reviewers complaining the character you control is gloomy, lazy, paranoid, clingy... Well, welcome to the ugly ugly world of depression! I don't think the people complaining about the crossed choices quite get the point of the game. Depression is a downward spiral of negative thoughts and emotions, where even the things you once loved cheer you up. Everything is exhausting, even something as simple as making dinner or talking to someone. You want to ask for help, but instead shut down and distance yourself from others, genuinely believing you don't deserve their attention. Asking why you can't choose the better option is the same as asking why poor people don't buy money.I think the good and bad endings could have benefited of more differences between them, simply to emphasize the importance of getting help and support during these times. Otherwise it was a good, short, free game. 8/10			"

												An interesting text-based game. While the phrasing can be a little awkward at times (""You are a mid-twenties human being""), it's a good read if you have around half an hour. I'd say give it a go.Some of the criticism of this game is valid: If you don't like reading, this game is not for you. The way depression is portrayed is a little simplistic, and characters seem a little too supportive at times, which is usually not the case in reality. The cross-off mechanic that prevents you from accessing certain options seems restrictive. At least in my experience, depression doesn't really work like that. It might be interesting to try to attempt something unreasonable and be worse off for it. Also, having a depression indicator is a little on-the-nose; players should be able to judge for themselves. The UI could also be a little more interesting in general.On the other hand:Despite what I said earlier, the game does an okay of job of portraying the battle with depression. The characters are very supportive and the game encourages looking for professional help and reaching out to those who care, which is good advice. It's not too long, it's free, and provides an interesting insight into depression, if nothing else. Also:Some of the other criticism is very unfair. It really isn't the ""worst thing ever"" as some seem to be making it out to be. It's not that fun, but neither is dealing with depression. Since it's not too long, I'd suggest playing it before jumping to conclusions.			"

												Depression Quest is an interactive presentation of what living with depression can feel like. As a game, it is very spartan - in fact, it is closer to a hyperlink story than to other interactive fiction games. One could think of it as a Choose Your Own Adventure game, but the game could also be described as a minimalist visual novel or, more technically, a finite-state machine. On the other hand, so can adventure games. As someone who lives with depression many of the scenarios hit close to home. Social missteps become impossible embarrassments. Enjoyable activities become guilty pleasures or rote comforts. Simple tasks become insurmountable projects. Minor insecurities are internalized as vast character flaws -- the very condition of being depressed is mistaken for being one. As a player, however, it is important to recognize that depression is not the root of any of these problems. Being introvert or insecure is intrinsical to a person. Depression exacerbates traits to the point of being harmful.I am fortunate to never have slid too deeply into depression myself. I was able to get get the player character's mental state progression to more or less mirror my own, but without my own experience I would have fared a lot poorer. The game reflects the negative spiral of depression by locking out productive choices as the player character's mental state declines.  This conveys to the player some of the frustration that someone with depression will feel at not being able to take perfectly obvious and sensible steps to improving a situation.The prose is written in the terse style of most works in the interactive fiction genre. Sentences are short and active. Descriptions are restricted to the bare essentials. The point of view is second-person to blur the line between player character and player. Each scene in the game constitutes a page of exposition, and a page for describing the short-term consequences of the player's choices. Short of a few grammatical mistakes, the writing is perfectly readable, albeit a bit bland, as is typical of the genre. Overall, the effect is one of detachment. The authors recommend that the music be left on to complement the writing, although I do not consider the music to be all that effective. More poignant is the conservative use of sound effects and secondary tracks, such as the distant mumble of a woman or the bass sounds of a party.Depression Quest is a well-written exposition on depression in the form of an interactive story. The hour or two it takes to play through the game is well worth the time to get a better understanding of what living with the condition is like for some people.			"

												Wow, the recent uptick in negative, derogatory, and just plain abusive reviews of Depression Quest is SO BIZARRE! It's almost as if a bunch of folks with more free time than common sense got together and decided to flood the reviews! But that's crazy talk, right? Anyway, I thought this game was a thoughtful experience, accurate to many of the things people with depression have to face. Highly recommended, but only if you have enough empathy to consider someone else's point of view, listen to someone else's experiences and try to learn something from them. If not, the game's probably not gonna be your thing.			"

												The problem with Depression Quest is that it attempts to capture an entire mental illness yet only SPECIFICALLY focuses on one specific person's journey with it. Everyone's handle of depression is different, and this game does not capture the journey well. It captures a journey, but it's so focused, so narrow that it feels like the developers made it for themselves.			"

												Dear god, no.This game is barely interactive. It just pushes you unsubtley in the direction it wants you to go (which is towards the bad ending, by the way.)There is a part in this game where they cross out all of the choices except for the worst one.Chosing that choice causes ou to become more depressed. The game demotes you for doing something it forces you to do.There's another part where one of the choices was blocked out for no apparent reason.It just seemed like the creators were just to lazy to write an outcome to that choice.""An interactive (non)fiction"" the subtitle boasts.Ha.Hah.You see, the problem with this is that it would have to have actually happened to be considered ""nonfiction"".Sorry Zoe, but considering how this has multiple endings, there is no way that this has all happened to you.Don't play this.

												I loved this game. It made me feel more emotions than any other game I've ever played. I have struggled with depression and it is comforting to me that there is a game that shows how difficult it is to live with depression. Many people who don't understand what it is like to be depressed don't know how to help or understand someone who is lives with it. I actually had my boyfriend play it even though he was against it at the beginning because there was a lot of reading. But when he finished we talked about it and I think he got a lot out of it. It's hard to live with me sometimes when I get down but he's always there for me and I think Depression Quest can help him know more how I feel. I liked how there would always be a ""normal"" response to a situation but it would have a line crossed out and you weren't able to pick it. That's just like real life. You know what you should feel like or what you should be doing but you just can't do it. It's just not possible. That also is a great way to show people who don't suffer what it feels like. I always tried making the best decision possible when I played. Again, I know what it's like to be depressed and I always try to see the best in life even when it's really hard to do so. I think it should be manditory for everyone to play this game.  "

For some people, it makes them sad and cry. For others, it causes lethargy and lack of motivation. You cannot say that someone doesn't have depression simply because their symptoms don't match yours EXACTLY.

I sympathized with and understood many of the character's situations, if not ALL of them, and even teared up at some of them because I've been there before.♥♥♥♥ the haters. The developers did good.

												While I haven't finished this game yet, I noticed that there were a lot of negative reviews. I noticed that a lot of them didn't like depression being defined for them by someone else, but they were more than willing to provide their own definition. I find that to be weird, because in my experience depression takes on many forms.The game even tells you that this isn't meant to definitely define what it means to be depressed. There are just too many types of depression and people in order to have one set definition.I do have a bit of a theory that some of these negative reviews might be a knee-jerk reaction of shame. Such as us saying ""No, I'm not that PATHETIC."" or it could even be that you think you are far more pathetic than this. It depends on your depression I guess.There were some statements I agreed with a lot. I have seen a therapist recently and have been doing better. I'm not sure there's anything like a cure out there for depression, but I do think there's a possiblity of living life fully without it fully controlling you. I don't think it's easy to get there and it depends on each individual if we can make it to that point. I hope I continue down the road where I am relatively happy instead of how it has been, but I don't know for sure.I'll take playing this slow, but for now I think it's worth reading just from the standpoint it makes you think.Oh yeah, it's a ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" book and not a traditional ""game"". Get over the fact that you need to read in this - the screenshots are not deceptive about what's in this game.			"

												I don't think the majority of the negative reviewers actually ""get"" this game. It's not meant to be fun. It's meant to be frustrating. As someone who suffers from depression, this is probably the most accurate representation of the experience that I've seen. Is it meant to be a ""good"" game? No. Could it have been better? Yes. It's nothing fancy, and there's a few spelling errors, but I don't think there's any other legitimate criticism. It's just some dumb little game, and it does the job it set out to do. I find it unbelievable that this is what set off the Gamergate mess. Is it really unbelievable that someone else ""got"" what this game is about and wrote a decent review? If you want to see what depression is like, play this. This is not something that's meant to be enjoyed, and that's the whole point.			"

												I note that a lot of the marked helpful reviews of the game, at least at the top, are negative, as I read them before playing. I disagree with them. A lot of people are saying this game is awful at imitating depression, but as a depressive and anxious individual, it really clicked with me, and even brought me to tears. Obviously the experience of depression and anxiety is different for everyone, and so will their experience with the game be, but for some of us this game represents perfectly how hard just living life can be sometimes. This game is a really good addition to the library of anyone who suffers these things similarly to the way I do, because it doesn't just help you see your own troubles more clearly, but it represents the fact that there are people who understand. And that, I think, is very important.			"

I am aware of the polemic controversy around this game and that's why I looked for it, planning to write a good review about it.

												I'll be blunt about this terrible game as I haven't had any relationships with it's developer - unlike some of the authors behind some of the reviews on this. This is as much as a game as reading a .pdf file with all the 'interaction' being the tools up top. This is as much as a game as reading a website from 1999 and seeing all the .gif buttons lead you through the website. Shucks, maybe this is actually the next revolutional game and I'm too happy to even understand it.I don't know, and I couldn't give any more ideas or opinions on it because I had barely played it to realize that there are people on the Greenlight who get ignored and spit on, but hey, at least they spent actual effort, right? They didn't have to do some dirty work just to get it through to several outlets where it's authors' opinions are one's people might actually listen to. They spent actual work onto it, dreaming of being into the industry one day. In this day and age of things like Game Maker and YouTube handing out free tutorials, all you really need is ambition and determination. Clearly, making a game like this had neither.  In short, this game is a load of♥♥♥♥♥ and I want you to play it! Do YOU have a 2k Gaming PC, a good relationship, great social life, a job that makes you financially stable, great family, and possibly even more that makes you smile in the morning? Good!

												This was an unique game, and an interesting opportunity to connect with how I see  Depression. I myself have been diagnosed and struggle with clinical (or major) depression. I downloaded and played through the game today, read all of the note from the producers in about 1 1/2. My experience, and the choices that I chose throughout the game really helped me connect with the same behaivors, and the impact of my choices in real life. While the game itself may not be for everyone- and may insult or desenitize others with depression or similar diagnosis- I would say it in my mind very similar to what I myself have experienced as a person diagnosed with Depression. I would simply like to thank the producers for their involvement in this project, and while I may not ever touch this game again, I would recomend it to some friends- their outcomes, their resolutions may not go well, but maybe they might just be able to grasp how difficult depression can be to handle from day to day. One choice can affect everything, making positive choices- even when you feel empty, guilty, hurt, embarrest- like you are a failure or ugly inside, and don't know how to tell anyone else- That is one of the hardest things to do. No ammount of telling someone to try harder or be a better person will change if they don't trust themselves to feel safe, or to feel loved, beautiful, or capable to live as they want to. The only reason I have this ability is because I made that choice to open up no matter how afraid I was everything I did would fail. This might be a game to some people, but for me, it's like reliving a part of my life that I didn't know how to connect to before. So Thank you.I know some people may not agree with my review, but please respect that this is my opinion, you don't have to agree with it, but please don't bash it.			"

												To the three developers of this game, Take it as a Criticism, a Harsh and yet a valid and constructive criticism, from someone who aspire to become a game developer.Honestly, were you even trying? My First issue with the game is the stup*d soundtrack, boring, and it becomes nuisance in no time, it's so terrible that i cannot even concentrate in the text, the very long and boring text about someone with a very♥♥♥♥♥♥y life, after the first five pages a was like ""Ok, it will start anytime now"", but, a text without gameplay it's not a game, it doesn't have the any of the four basic element that consist a experience as a game, you beign developers, i think you should know what element are those, in case you don't know, fear not for you incapaity, i will listen those here, they are Alea (The Random factor in a game, Aka Luck Factor), Agon (The Competitive Factor, Aka Skill), Mimicry (The Roleplaying Factor) And Ilinx (The Vertigo Factor) The only factor i saw was roleplaying, you say the game brings the experience of someone who suffers from Deppression, i will come back to this later, right on the bat i see the first choice on the blocked, cleaver, giving limitations to the player to make the ""Game"" Challenging, i chose something, even if it's not what i would chose because what i would chose is not an option or it's blocked, but after some turns i just get annoyed by this design choice, i'm just chosing random things, making the ""Mimicry Factor"" not really there, but i'm feeling generous today, but every bolder choice that would be better if you where in the main character position only results in your own demise, beign blocked or becoming a unhappy cat owner, an i guess this is not how depression works, would you care to send me the contact of the psychologist or the psychiatric doctor that gave you consultorship for your project? Because that person is a incompetent, and that is a important thing, in any matter, developers can't say ""I Think"" about a problem this dangerous such as depression, you NEED consultory, you NEED someone who know what they are talking about and when your friend offers help to you YOU CANNOT EVEN GET THE F*CKING THERAPY RIGHT AWAY, the game make a huge burden for you to call the doctor, even if you should encourage depressed people to do so, well, since the soundtrack is stupid, the gameplay is non-existent and the content is bullcrap, the graphics must be Outstanding, Crysis Level sh*t, but they at it's best, Lookable, they don't hurt your eyes, but they are not an eye candy, the fonts are boring and the background is so bright that make the text feel take a huge effort to read, which should not happen in a TEXT BASED GAME, why not use the Visual Novel style? It's good enough for what you need and feel better, in general, by not making your text based experience feel like a 1-ton Burden, and i didn't even talk about the reused resources like the same photo beign used over and over again.Now, in all Honesty, how DARE you call yourselves Game Developers? People study, they learn, they work hard, they give they bests to produce and successfully release a Game, Japanese developers expend a great amount of money to release their games in conventions like Comiket, ocidental developers have to raise a great amount of money on IndieGoGo, Kickstarter, etc, and get past on Steam GreenLight, i've see so many people trying, and even small RPG Maker games made by some random kid deserve some praise, you know why? Because you can see they, even if they didn't know much, they gave they f*cking best, hell, I even defend Super Man 64 sometime because how ambitious the developers imagined the game and how DC broke they legs, but i can clearly see that you guys didn't even GAVE A F*CKING♥♥♥♥♥♥ABOUT YOUR GAME, Video-Games are Art, expression, text, media, imerssion and emergency, how Dare you Negglect those meanings so much and make this abomination? Hell, Big Huge Games Broke because they made Kingdoms of Amalur which is a great game, but didn't sold enough, they gave they best and it was not enough to those great developers going (Some of they even worked on games like Conkers and my eternally beloved series, The Elder Scrolls) and they could not keep it, And you get here by Sucking Balls, LITERALLY, Now it's time to get back to the depression point, and that's what i'm feeling now, i wanted to be parted of this industry my whole childhood, i learned what i could from what i had, read a lot of book in game development, and then, when i finally get in the university, i see this monstruosity, do you know how i felt? Broken, everything i idolized was now unholy and dirty, my passions and aspirations broken, and i'm not talking about this ""Gamer Jornalism"" Bullsh*t, it was always stupid to see people with no knowledge in games harshly criticizing thing they know♥♥♥♥♥♥about, as a Future Developer, i feel ashamed of you, and you should feel as well, your names may carry shame and hatred, people will remeber you not as developers, but as atention seeking morons, who think everything can be bought by the right price, but know, tha me, and many more like me, who are really passionate about we do, what we want to do, what we love to do, your ART, that you carry no weight for us, we will not be bought, we will not bow down, we will always give your best to make this industry better, and more acessible, a world where everyone can play, a world where everyone can develop, know that you will not stop us			"

												An alright story about a person with depression.As a person that lives with depression, but have gotten past my most extreme parts of it, it was more of a look-back at my own experience with depression, social anxiety and self isolation.I can relate to some things while I don't get some parts.That's as much detail as I can really go into.It's not great, it's an alright, short read that most people will probably dislike.Now, a touch on other reviews; a lot of people complain about how it doesn't manage to portray depression correctly.Depression is different for every person who has it, if you went into this novel thinking it would cover every single aspect of depression ever or manage to perfectly portray your own experience with depression then you deserve no attention and your review is invalid.The game says in the opening paragraph that it goes without saying because of the very basic nature of depression it is experienced differently by every single person who suffers from it.This game is just a tale of the experiences of the developers and people close to them.It doesn't say that this is the best or most accurate representation of depression.To close the review it is an alright read that manages to portray depression in some aspects but it also goes into things that has nothing to do with depression, like disliking your job, hating your job has, at least on the surface, nothing to do with depression.

This game gives a good scenario, but like some people say in their reviews it isn't very accurate. If he was THAT depressed, without any counseling or medication, he would of been thinking about suicide a hell of a lot more. Maybe even make a plan or carry it out.  I'm not sure how he ended up in a relationship unless he wasn't depressed before that. A lot of people don't understand. This game is a 'sort of' example what it is like day to day. I will give it that. Everybody is different though. Depressed people are able to hide it well, I know I did. But it got bad. Really bad. I begged my mom to take me to talk to somebody but she didn't take me seriously. But she finally did. Well after that she realized how bad it was. The main thing is, talk to a professional person. But sometimes you don't care about anything, or anybody including yourself. Then you start doing stupid things, getting angry for stupid reasons and become anti-social. If you know somebody that is going through this, please encourage them to talk to somebody and get the help they need before it is too late. And be there for them if you really care about them.This game was hard to play through for me. But I got through it. I just wanted to see what all the hype was about and see for myself instead of just reading the reviews.8/10 - Will not forget my meds on the counter again... (STP song Bi-Polar Bear.

												I was diagnosed with depression which I'm over with now so I can tell that this is certainly not how it feels like. This is just an autistic, socially awkward self loathing simulator and the only sane responses in this game are crossed out because QUINNSPIRACY thought it would be a good idea.

												I've lived with depression for 6 year's. If you suffer from it i recomend staying away from this game, but i suppose you are a rebel and wont listen to me. Anyways be aware this game will make you feel alot worse, it brought back the suicidal side of me.If you have a friend that you wish to know how you feel this game would be great for them, how ever. Be careful who you share it with. "

												This isn't a game in the traditional sense, more of an interactive story or a digital version of a choose your own adventure book.  What makes this game interesting and unique is the writing.  I expect most people won't understand it, or will find it boring because all you do is read.  However, if you really give it a chance I feel like it will at least give you some idea of what living with depression is like.More than a few times while playing this, I had tears in my eyes because the writing perfectly depicts the feelings of anxiety and feeling like you can't even face the world.  Losing interest in everything that used to excite and entertain you, the social anxiety.  Everything.I can't rate this highly enough, especially for someone who maybe doesn't suffer from depression themselves, but knows someone who does.			"

												Painful game, but worth attention. It shows one story, maybe little simplified, of a men that fights with himself. As myself had/still have depression, I can strongly relate to that. It really is hard to live, when your brain is telling you - you're a failure, everything you do is a mistake, don't do nothing, jump into the limbo of despair and apathy. Depression Quest tries to show how it is to be in the loop of self hatred - game is free, so spend 2 hours with it to develop an empathy toward depressed people.			"

												This game novella is not depressing. I found it thought provoking and kinda cute.What to expect: It's written in second person (""you are feeling stressed and your mind is numb""). ""You"" are 20-something of unstated gender with a girlfriend and a dead-end job. The writing is quality and easy to read. The pages are short, and it runs in a window, so it's convenient to read while multitasking. I came across a couple of typos and a couple of details I didn't quite understand (I think because the writing is very US-centric), but those are trivial concerns. I think anxiety & depression sufferers will identify with elements of the story, and it might help others to understand these phenomena a little better. With the path I chose at least, it was ultimately a hopeful story.It's unfortunate that the popular negative reviews are political in nature. Reviews should be 100% about the content, and the content is super rudimentary. The whole thing is essentially old school HTML + some music. But I'm fine with that.Edit: I just realised how much this story, as a stream of consciousness, reminds me of The Catcher in the Rye.			"

												This game isn't your typical game. You're put in the shoes of a guy in a very bad place. The game does a fantastic job of captivating you and making you feel like you truly are leading them down the path you're choosing.Each choice matters, every decision counts. I managed to clear his depression first try, but after replaying a few times I found this is only done by making the correct choices.The only fault in this game is the fact that when I used a controller, it'd crash a lot.Overall, I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes reading a lot, learning about depression, and feeling immersed in a game at the same time.

												Maybe I experienced the game differently. I definitely thought the protag was whiny and the writing was a bit pretentious, but I didn't get the sense that the game was making them out to be lazy and selfless, more that the depression was crippling their motivation and made it hard to find interest in the things they normally do.For people saying that all the positive choices were crossed out, yes, the most helpful ones were, but there were still positive choices (usually the second option - this game has a tendency to list options in order of most-to-least helpful with a few switch-ups thrown in now-and-then, which I find a bit weird but w/e). I managed to get what I believe is the best ending (my protag was seeing a therapist, taking medication, and they weren't depressed anymore), so maybe it's just that I took the time to read the choices and think about what would be most helpful.For those saying it's too long/too much reading, come on. It took me maybe 20 - 30 minutes to play this game and I only skimmed like 5% of the text.I've never been officially diagnosed with depression and I don't think I have it, so I can't speak to the accuracy of the depiction in this. I'll simply say, take it with a grain of salt. You may relate to it, you may not. This game doesn't suit everyone. I liked it, but hey, that's just me. Experience the game for yourself if you want to have an opinion on it. Or don't. It doesn't matter.			"

												Depression Quest provides what I feel is a very fair representation of some of the thought patterns and attitudes prevalent in those experiencing depression.  Calling it a game however, is a bit of a stretch in my opinion considering depression itself is not a game.  I am seeing lots of reviews that are written by people that seem to think that the ""solution"" choices being unavailable is ridiculous, but from my experience wtih type 1 bipolar disorder the lack of those options is nothing short of realistic as a representation of the workings of the mind of the severely depressed.  Hell, I would even argue that the options presented *aren't hopeless and dark enough!*  That, however, is just reflective of my personal experiences with very intense and deep depression where hygene and food intake are put completely on hold and every other thought that goes through my head is self deprecating or suicidal.  However, the authors explained the choices and decision options very well in the description when they stated that eveerybody experiences depression differently, and it is quite simply not possible to cover every single possible decision and experience angle.  Besides, if they DID manage to cram in... say 100 different decision options, it would result in the game not being what it is supposed to be - a glimpse into the mind of one ""average"" depression afflicted individual for the purpose of educating those unfamiliar or curious about what could be on the mind of a depressed person.Is this title for everyone?  Hell no.  There is no happy ending or real control illustrated in the text... this is EXACTLY how MANY, MANY people with depression feel and see the world and is completely intentional.  The only goal of the seriously depressed is to make it to the next minute of their life.  The princess is NOT in another castle... she bled out in her bathtub last week.  If you expect a sunshine and lollipops style ending with just the right combination of choices, you're in the wrong place.Does this title reflect poorly on the depressed, making them appear lazy?  Only to the grossly uninformed or those with a deeply misguided view on depression as a weakling's illness that's cured with force.  (Please F*** right off - you only perpetuate or worsen the problem)  The described emotions herein are very true to life and the lack of a real ""ending"" is truly reflective of the illness.Should people give this a try for s**** and giggles?  If you are truly looking for giggles or a sense of accomplishment after  completing this, you are looking in the wrong place.  Trust me.  Uncertainty orbits the depressed mind like a moon and often eclipses the soul from the light.  People curious about the depressed or those faced with living with a depressed person absolutely should give this a go.  The reality of the depressed person won't make you smile or laugh, so this game will not either.  Reality's a ♥♥♥♥♥ like that.Do I reccomend people try this out?  Definitely.  Just know what you are getting into, and that everybodies experience and attitudes are going to be different.  Don't be a jerk - realize what the goal of this project is, and not what you want it to be:  education, not entertainment.			"

												I know that this game doesn't accurately represent what depression is. The choices are so simple they might as well have named the choices good choice, bad choice. But why do I recommend this game then? It's because I read the authors note at the beginning and the epiolouge of the game. It's cleary said that this game isn't therapy or an accurate representation of depression, it's way for general audiences to understand what people with depression are going through, it even said that this might not be true for everyone's case. The story about being a 20 something year old with an achieving brother and a out of your leauge girl friend might seem cliched, but it's the narrative that make it work. There are time where things don't sense, like when your boss tells you ""it's dead"". What's dead, wtf is ""it"" boss? But the point I'm trying to get across here is that this isn't a terrible game, it's original and the developers really took a chance making a game about depression. That's couregous as hell, if a bit crazy. I played the game twice, getting the good ending and the bad ending, it was really easy for both. But what the character was going through was made it interesting and engaging. Not everyone with depression is going to go through this, but the main character did, and that's the point of this game. It's a visual novel, you don't see people complain how dating sims aren't realistic. I know depression and harems are completely different, but it's about putting your self in the character's shoes, and I was able to do that. Yes this game has room for improvement, better grammer/spelling, more complex choices and for ♥♥♥♥s sake a save button (what's up with that?), but it also does things good, like the narrative, charcters, and how it handles telling the story from our main characters perspective.TL;DR? It's free, play it, but don't expect it to treat depression, expect it to be a visual novel			"

												I think the biggest thing people don't consider with this game is that it isn't about a specific kind of depression. It isn't something so easily defined. It is about the player, and how they cope with certain situations, and how hard life seems to be when crippled by their own thoughts. It is meant not to be a realistic break down of depression, but to show key points in the process, and to show those small moments that most people think won't matter, and how they really do make all the difference.I honestly loved this game, and it felt nice to see a happy ending, without the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t romanticization.

												Don't mistake this for a game. It is not. It is a piece of propaganda designed to drive home that depression is a hopeless condition.What annoys me the most is that there are no real choices presented. Any meaningful way to improve your character is vividly struck out in red, to underline that it is hopeless. This is a huge lie-  there are genuine sufferers of depression who do make an effort to and do overcome their condition. They do select the red choices and make things better for themselves. This game does a great disservice to genuine sufferers of depression who may be led to believe the message that all is hopeless. I worry that it might just tip them into seeking a permanent solution. If you have any remotely depressed friends, DO NOT let them play this 'game'. I cannot stress this enough.And I cannot understand why the developers have chosen to preach such a bleak (and untrue!) message instead of one carrying some hope for depressives. This is bordering on, if not outright irresponsible. "

Honestly, the Masculine Mystique (a porn game) is helluva lot more fun and interesting than this. If your depressed? Get the ♥♥♥♥ over it you ♥♥♥♥♥. Most of the time its your fault your depressed and only you can solve that. Drugs that might make you go shootup a school won't really help you the way just solving your♥♥♥♥♥♥will.I would advise researching ""Zoe Quinn"" I wanted to type a whole peice on her sadistic, sociopathic, and manipulative behaviour that has rewarded her by taking advantage of the rampant corruption in the USA and Marxism of most media outlets with connections going to the highest echelons of this country, but I think looking into it oneself and self educating on this topic would be good.Zoe Quinn is nothing. Shes a scumbag but learning how she got where she is and took advantage of who is important. It shows that even in Video Game Pundits like Kotaku there is massive corruption. I personally beleive if there was not a hidden agenda behind the Communist Social Justice insanity that it would never have gained the traction it currently has in the brain washed, PC controlled minds of so so many. Pay attention to these people for any amount of time and you will know they ARE Communists. They worship the state, they hate personal freedoms, and truly beleive some are just more equal than others.  The USA is under a Communist take over. Don't be fooled, Communism isn't about equality so much as having all the power over everything in the hands of a few. There is an information war everywhere around you, so many want to hide the truth from you and it would be highly advisable to join the resistance to these lies by supporting independant media. Places like Drudge Report and infowars.com are advisable sources.  After you learn enough about the trends and real world it becomes easier and easier to see corruption where it hides.Zoe is just a 2 dollar ♥♥♥♥♥ whose trying to take advantage of all this though, shes unlikely to be connected to anything big and no one should pay attention to her or all the brain washed men she has had sex with and now jump to her defence. If anything she should get a real ♥♥♥♥ing job or learn to program. There are extremely intelligent individuals with highly specialist skillsets that can make amazing games and its people like these that gets the spotlight? The only reason anyone would pay attention to Zoe is because of an agenda. Shes taking advantage of this, but shes about as much of a tool as any. Hopefully she wakes up to all this and renounces her ways, even then I wouldn't trust her though.			"

												A very true tale of someone with depression. Seeing as I have depression myself I can relate to feeling like a burden to a lot of people and i've even had the ""just tough it out"" motherly cheering, which really didn't help at all with my problem. In the story(Spoiler) if I actually chose to keep a kitten, I would love a little cute companion to just kinda be around me. The choices that were marked out always seemed like a 'tease' just to add. Overall, if you're dealing with depression or want to find out what it's like, i'd deffinately reccomend playing this game.			"

												This is not a ""game"" in the traditional sense of the word. Its more of an experience, a window into the life of someone living with depression. I'll tell you right off the bat: this game is not very fun. However its not about being fun. The game exists to provide understanding. I read some of the reviews for this game, and several of them came off as shallow minded and superficial. Phrases similar to like “Was listed under the RPG category but its not an RPG its just a text based game.” I’m not saying that people aren't entitled to their own opinion. I’m saying that a person shouldn’t take this experience as just another free to play game. One must look past the simple categorization and actually see Depression Quest for what it is. The developers never had the intention of making a fun game, nor did they ever want to make money off of it. I believe that this game was created because someone (namly a Zoe Quinn) simply wanted to tell a story and get a thesis across.I came into Depression Quest with low expectations as I do all free to play games. I found that the ambient soundtrack was appropriate for the subject matter. The writing wasn’t anything revolutionary, but it told a narrative that I saw to the end. The story had its moments where I related to the characters and felt real emotions like pity. I was told that the game has 5 endings depending on the choices you make. I only played through once to in order to not dilute my experience and impression of the game. Like I said before this game was not fun and it was never meant to be. Depression is a real world issue and it affects real people every day of their lives. Simply creating a triple a Sims-esque simulation game would possibly serve to detract from the subject matter.Bottom line: If you go into this game with a sense of superficiality or immaturity you are going to leave feeling like you wasted your time. However it you read into it and get invested the same way you would any other form of media, the experience will resonate. I’m not saying it will affect everyone like it has me and many others, but it will  one some level. If you do have depression. Seek help. It is out there.			"

												As a long timer suffer of depression and having tryied help others feel the void that one feels. This quest relly brought to by heart of what it does feel to be a sufferer or depression. Most games offer a point gaining empathy on the issue showing that lack of anceny a suffer has. Do the right think will make you feel better. That is EXACTLY the point od depression. That is the illness in and of itself. ""Go out and have a good timme and it'll make you better."" ""Why could Robin Williams and like so.... So look at those that love them, how could they do this on you."" The real question of depression has been amplified with since of crying. Remore perhaps but not sadness, not happiness not an extreme in away ways form..The best analogy is I come to you with my fishes are dead... ""Oh maybe, they're just asleep"" No they're dead. ""But my fish are dead"" Maybe we could put them back in the tank and they'll be alive again... ""WHY CAN'T ANYONE SEE MY FISH ARE DEAD?""This game, it not only shows the dark path that an emotionless person walks truly. I can't find happiness or remorse of at least what my mind remember them at. You equate depression as merely a lack of optimism or a lack of choice. You'll go out and have fun but this silly say phase you're in will just vanish"" And that ""Happiness inventure or shoubles on top of the feeliong of I know this is fun but I have no feeling of what fun is and I further pull away into myself. And as you pull awa y ""fun"" things, your friends pull away as they find you no longer fun too.So you're alone  in your bottle and all you want is to stop the nothingness. Fime with your family and closest arrange you drain you because whats the points is tasks when theyre munedane and spar not even the slightest sparkk of ""fun"".When yout find fun, even though you new what they used to be, a vague sliver in the dark, they're the light at the end of the tunnel.but the tunnel is no light ahead. Some are lucky that eventually light leads to this tunnels end and what's next?I don't want to stay in the dark.... I'be been here for so long. I can't go to the future because it's been many years here and the white light is a fleet memory past....What do I do? What ways change this cahange?

												This book was boring. Depression can't really be recreated in anyway, and I fail to see what the this is trying to accomplish. You can't choose the options you actually want to do, which would seem like logical things to do in this situation. I was expecting this to be a story about overcoming depression, as I see it is harder to overcome than to cope with. Those who sit around all day waiting for something to happen to them will never get anywhere in a situation of this measure, real or not. I don't even know if there is an ending where you get over it. If you have depression, seek guidance, because the people who try to be tough and not talk about are those who end up with the serious depression. I don't see why you'd make a ""game"" about a serious thing almost everyone endures nowadays. I don't know, maybe it's to ""raise awareness"" or whatever tumblr says today. Someone pass the Vicodins... NO WAIT, we need Ambiens. Well, we sure need somethiens...Also the trigger warning made me laugh hysterically, it could probably relieve depression!			"

												I recommend this game if you've got some idle time, as it's short, free and it paints a beautiful, sometimes upsetting, sometimes uplifting view on one of the most common mental states in the world. It's presented as a visual novel, it's low budget, and it shows. Regardless, if you are patient enough to immerse yourself in the fictional character through the text, I think the experience warrants it. It employs one particularly clever trick - showing you options which you want to pick, but preventing you from picking them. This gives you (the person behind the keyboard) a sense of frustration, and through that, an understanding. Those banned options go through your characters head too but, like in real life depression, they can't do them any more than you can click the buttons.It has some story telling issues, the biggest of which was that time was poorly represented. I suspect the events play out over many months, yet this isn't made obvious, and it feels like weeks instead. Also, it's ""obvious"" which are the better options to pick - at least when you're in a healthy mindset - but I'm not sure how it could be done better. If you're suffering right now from depression, this might make you feel terrible, but you might still want to persevere - it's a story of hope, as much as it is a story of depression.			"

												The game leaves you with a heavy feeling in your heart, but that's exactly what the developers were aiming for. They told from the very beginning that it wouldn't be a pleasant expirience, and it wasn't. But I think they achieved their goal - show  the player how people with heavy depression feel.I see two minuses in the game:1. It won't start from Steam menu, and I had to launch the .exe file from the game folder. Not a big deal, but this technical flaw spoils the impression a bit.2. No saves. The game is really short, but the fact that you have to beat it in one run makes you hurry a bit and doesn't allow you to feel the story as deeply as you could.I think it would be useful for everybody to get acquainted with this game, because it can help you to understand how somebody near you feels, and how to better help him/her.

												I've played this before on the interwebs. Might as well toss out a token review.For a game that causes grown men to go into fits over the dreaded ess-jay-dubyas, this isn't a terrible intersectional game. The main character doesn't have any money concerns, has a steady job, a supportive girlfriend and at least one supportive family member, hits the jackpot on their first time visiting a therapist (it took me about four or five tries to find one that clicked), lives in a location that allows them to keep a cat, and doesn't seem to suffer any ill effects from race, religion, physical disability, age, or gender.As a long-time sufferer of depression's smaller cousin, dysthymia (if depression is a big black dog sitting on your chest for stretches of time, dysthymia is an overweight cat that lays on your head and never leaves), I recognized a lot of the situations presented in the game, and the options for action described pretty well actions I might have taken. Although I really wish getting help were as easy as clicking a link in a Twine game...All in all this game doesn't merit the hate it gets. So thusly I give it a recommendation. It's not a Half-Life-esque landmark game... but it deserves to be appreciated for what it is.I hope that somewhere, somehow, thisgame  makes a grown man-child dudebro cry. I hope it makes him recognize depression in himself or someone he loves. I hope he can become a better person because of it. I hope like hell.			"

												This game is not like typical games, whereas most games do have a story to tell, this game really hit close to home for me. In my playthrough, I really symphathised with the main character and his situation. I really do recommend playing this game, especially if you are going through hard times, like I currently am while writing this. The game in total lasted only about 2 hours and, for that entire time, I was intently reading every line of dialogue, skipping nothing at all. In a playthrough, I believe that you should choose every option as if you were in that exact situation. It is definitely worth the time and, if anything, it will help you out if you're currently dealing with any depression-related problems yourself.P.S.I think that the game should only be played through once, as there are multiple outcomes and your inital outcome will represent how you feel and how you dealt with things the most.

												Depression Quest manages to convey a believable sense of what one might experience, living through daily life with depression.  While it won't capture everyone's experience with the illness, it can certainly serve to allow players who haven't experienced depression to imagine what others go through better.On a mechanical level, Depression Quest is also interesting in the realm of interactive fiction in the way it tracks your character's mental health, and presents choices which may be disallowed because of your character's illness.  An interesting study on the power of the *illusion* of choice (or at least, the frustration of missed opportunity, even if certain options are never allowed to be chosen).			"

												Being someone who has suffered from clinical depression for years I found Depression Quest to be a very relatable experience as well as also being excellently written and quite well-paced. Many have disregarded the game completely for reasons such as it not matching their personal experience of depression or their knowledge of the illness, however depression is an almost entirely unique experience for every person who suffers from it and this game can only depict so much.  Overall I’d say this is a great portrayal of what depression CAN be, and in my opinion it’s a massive step in the right direction for a better understanding of the illness for both people who don’t suffer from it and also people who do suffer from it but aren’t aware of how others might experience it.

												the idea is actually not that bad. The only problem I have with this game is that while it has this insanely good soundtrack (best part of this game), the whole thing in of itself is nothing but an unfinished text reading and clicking bonanza. Seriously. It often feels like perusing a wiki article and flowing through hyper-links out of curiosity, while at others, the lack of appeal to this ""book"" makes me flat-out skip entries I'm completely and utterly uninterested in.While this game can be sharp in terms of it's text entries, it certainly lacks in terms of everything else that should make it a videogame - but ultimately can't make a videogame out of it, as the ""video"" elements of this game are missing- outside of the surprizingly striking status text at the end of each day's entry.In the end, this game worked one thing for me: reading the increasingly worrying status texts in the entries was immersing, but in the end, I was so bored out of my mind with everything else to this game that awarding this game a 4/10 is, unfortunately, a too generous review.2/10 is my final grade.Hope this project gets to be polished. As of right now, this isn't worth being called a videogame. I'd have more fun reading wikipedia articles. "

This game is killing the industry, the fact she (Zoe Quinn) can censor her action is disgusting, and just ♥♥♥♥ this game in general. Spread the word, guys. We need to pull the whole thing down, and bring the whole ♥♥♥♥ing diseased corrupt temple down on her head.			"

												This game is just... ugh. Despite it's good intentions, it manages to depict sufferers of depression as whiny, angst ridden people content to live in their misery, which i know for a fact is not true. As I played through, I tried my damndest to get my character help, but every attempt to open up to somebody or to pursue help led nowhere. Beyond that, the supposed choices the game offers are a lie. Every single choice you make leads you to exactly ONE alternate snatch of text, and then directly back to a screen which you'd have wound up on if you had made any other choice. On top of that, the game does NOT tell a cohesive story, with a beginning, middle, and end. out of nowhere, you get a screen explaining to you that it didn't have an ending, because depression never ends (oh I see, it's completely insurmountable, good to know). I could forgive all of this if the game was simply able to cause me to empathize with sufferers of depression, but in that, and many other regards, it utterly fails. The people heralding this as a grand artistic step for video games absolutely baffle me. The writing reads like the kind of stuff a high schooler might write, and the scope of the game is surprisingly limited, even considering the small development team. Don't give this game your time.

												Having lived with depression all of my life, I found a lot of things in this that really struck a chord in me.  I especially liked how there were struck out options for the kind of comon useless advice that non-depressed people so often give (""Just snap out of it!""  As if it were really that easy!)A quick game - perhaps an hour.  It made for a  ... not pleasant, but rather introspective ... diversion this night. "

												The feeling of having no motivation, getting no enjoyment from anything, and believing that by getting help you're just inconviencing others, are all things that this game tries to portray as well as it can. So while it does fall short in terms of length and actual gameplay, it at least makes a effort to try and emulate the real ways that depression slowly eats away at you like a crippling disease.The fact is that in the end it actually displays the effects of depression better than most other games, movies, and TV shows. Because depression is a monster in your closet that you can't ever be rid of. No matter how much people say things like ""Just go get help"" or ""Do something to not be depressed"", that's just not possible because that beast called depression will always be in the back of your mind chewing on your thoughts and making it seem like every possible choice will just make you a burden on others. Often people suffering from depression will never seek help, and the best help they can receive is by their friends and family noticing the problem and getting them that help (sometimes whether they want it or not).To sum up:Gameplay: 3/10 (Pretty much non-existing)Story: 5/10 (Could be much longer and more compelling)Experience: 10/10 (For anyone who has actually experienced real depression and been diagnosed, this game may or may not be relatible to your own experiences)Fun: 0/10 (This game is about depression and doesn't have a happy ending)Worth it? (Price): 10/10 (It's a free game)Length: 1/10 (Short and simple)Overall: 2/10 as a game, but a 8/10 in terms of actual effort and care that was put into it. I wouldn't say that this is a all-time ""Must play"" kind of experience, but rather on par with playing through a brief educational game.In the end I will say that it's good attempt at approaching a serious subject, and that It is unfortunately a forgettable experience.

												I think that this game was done very well. Speaking as somebody who has dealt with anxiety and depression, I think that the game embodies what it's really like to have these mental illnesses, and that the feelings this character has are very true to what people who actually have these illnesses feel. Even though the game is extremely sad, I really enjoyed it. I think that it can give people who don't understand mental illnesses a very good idea of what they are like. The game did seem a little boring, but as stated in the introduction, the game was not created to be fun and I think that the goal of this game was to have an accurate portrayal of depression, and it does just that.

I found the game to be fairly accurate, and most of my choices were more or less what I would have chosen in the situation. Of course you couldn't possibly expect depression to be the same for everyone.Overall id reccomend it if youre curious about what depression could feel like, while keeping in mind this is just one interpretation of it (you wouldnt expect a war movie to represent the experiences of every person that went to war, would you?)

A bunch of people that have suffered from depression in the past feel insulted but they don't realize that people deal with depression in different ways. The main character in this game wasn't lazy because he had depression. He was depressed because he hated his job and didn't ant to keep doing it. Those are completely different. It also brings awareness to a very serious problem in our society. I hope everyone out there with depression is strong enough to fight and to one day be happy.			"

												This.Thiiiiiiis.Let me start from where I should: It's about a man in his mid-twenties who goes through, well, depression. It's interactive, and presents situations this man goes through while providing 2-5 options to pick your way to continue.At the very beginning and a few more [pages?] through, it felt as it was shouting ""Welcome to Ayudon"". Way too me-ish, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who felt like this.But then as I progressed it felt like.. I don't know, should I say ""less charming""? With this I mean, I think I 'lost focus' on actually giving accurate answers on what *I* would do in his place and instead trying to get the best ones for him to achieve a happier mood. Maybe because it showed your mood ""status"" on each page and I felt like it asked me to increase it, maybe because it had options to make you choose from (still, if it hadn't I suppose it would be even less interesting) instead of being a one-way wall of text (don't get me wrong, a very worth reading wall of text)... or maybe it's just me playing it entirely for the whole night. Although it's quite short, so it's possible.Enough, back to the point. In sintesi, if there was an ""Unsure"" option for recommending games, I would leave this one there. It has its ups (such as depicting something I was diagnosed with very accurately), and downs (losing its touch), but then again it might as well be just me...... Why don't you find out *yourself*? It's a very short road in both playtime and file size, like ~100mbs, so there's that to it as well.8/10. Might re-review it some day.. I think..			"

												This isn't much of a ""game"" so much as a story you can click through, and I don't understand why such a big deal was made over it, oh wait yea I do because people still think trigger jokes are funny and harassing women is a sunday passtime.The game is lacking a lot of...everything. For one thing, the game assumes at the start that you'll be able to relate to the main character despite him being about as fleshed out as an actor in an antidepressant commercial. I was honestly hoping that, with the thought of an actual game in my head, we'd be able to personalize the story a bit at least as far as our age/gender/race goes. I can't relate at all to some dude who, despite apparently having debilitating depression, has his own apartment/a girlfriend/loving family/can hold down a job.For another, as many other people have already said, the game is simply too easy. A text-adventure game cannot convey the difficulty many individuals with depression have simply asking for help, let alone seeing a therapist, consistently taking medication, being open with their S.O., etc. etc. etc. and a format in which you only need to click the button you know is the ""right"" choice is one that destroys the potential any game that attempts to be thought-provoking has, although the bit where the ""best"" choice was blocked out/not available was a nice touch.Regardless, it's a step in the right direction as far as acknowledging mental illnesses in vidya goes, even if it didn't quite hit the mark, or even have a mark to hit to begin with.

												This game accomplishes what the goal is supposed to be: highlighting and explaining depression in a realistic way. Thus, it isn't enjoyable or fun in any sense, but it IS interesting. The music choices and visuals offer great atmosphere for the depressing content. Most of all, I like that there are choices listed that someone that isn't depressed would usually make. ""Be honest,"" ""Enjoy your night,"" ""get the therapist without prompting,"" etc. However, for you, being depressed, it is impossible to make those choices. Including them, but making them inaccessible, was an important choice. I would only recommend playing this game if you understand that not all games are meant to be fun, but can be a social/emotional commentary.			"

												I really love the concept of the game about an insight of what goes through a depressive mind. As the devs said it is not going to be something that everyone suffering or suffered from derpression can relate to but rather for people who never have been depressed before to have an idea about what goes through the mind of a person going through depression.Now, the game is well written, explaining in detail things even when I was depressed I couldn't express, and the choice based system is nice. It is a good interactive novel.While I had such an unique experience, game could improve upon some aspects, I'd like to say that sometimes there were things which were crossed out, but if I was in the protagonist's shoes I would do just that, which sucks as I could relate better if game allowed me to do the crossed out things. I understand everyone's experience with depression is different, I could actually quite relate to many parts of the game. The best part is that this game is free so please give it a try.			"

												A quiet and honest look at the emotional resonance that games can have. Even if they have to let go of the concept of fun to do it.This game doesn't have win-lose scenarios, an obvious best choice, or even a guarnteed resolution. All it has is realistic decisions based on the story's current circumstances. It plays with exceptations the same way reality does.While I've only played through the game once, I managed to get a personal ending that I felt was appropriate for the story (out of the possibilities of 150 possible encounters). If you ask me, it was pretty close to the best ending, but I felt like I didn't always make the right choices. Just honest answers.And rule of thumb: the first choice isn't always the best choice.Plus it's free and takes about 20-30 minutes of reading (at my reading speed).If you can spare that time, then I guarantee that this game deserves to be played once; and you deserve to understand that depression is always a possibility, but never an eventuality. So remember what this game offered. As a fellow human, it is the best that you can do.Sincerely,R.B.			"

												Judging the game on its own:This is a well-written game(or simulation?) about depression (and the quest to overcome it) that is also free to play.I liked the game and enjoyed my time playing it.If you are bothered by the whole drama surrounding the game, then just don't play it?If you don't consider textbased games or anything that doesn't have action to be games, then you obviously haven't played any visual novels(kinetic novels).If you do not want to play a game that is clearly about depression, then don't play the game.Otherwise, you should at the very least give the game a chance.

												I really didn't know what to expect when i downloaded this ""game"".It made me a little uncomfortable as I played because it actually puts you on the spot of a depressed person.And as I was progressing through it,I felt that many of the situations that were described there actually happened to me.Now,after getting to the ""ending"",I feel a little better.Because i know things get bad,but there's a way to get yourself back up after.And I actually felt kinda happy when I started to see that my actions were actually helping the protagonist and that every choice i've done,no matter how small,changed him in some way.It was a suprisingly fun experience as much as a helpful one.I recommend it to everybody that has (or know someone who suffers from) this problem.

												I understand that for everyone with depression, this game isn't a reflection of every person and their experiences with depression. However, people would realise that if they read the introduction that the producers never claimed that it was. It was an interesting and enlightening game for those who are not sufferers of depression and it was comforting and eye-opening for me. Zoe Quinn herself suffered from depression and she is trying to spread awareness through an unprecedented medium. It could do with a lot of revamping and become a more visually enticing interactive novel, but I see nothing intrinsically wrong with the game or the concept behind it. Ok, it's not a barrel of laughs, but depression isn't and it shoul be taken seriously. And yes I bought the damn cat, why the hell not?			"

												This is one of those games that make me feel that games worth the effort.You should play it, and more than that, you should listen to it.The goal of the game is not to beat the boss, it is to feel how it was for the creator to deal with depression, you just have to accept what the game has to tell you as a life experience and I am totally sure it will be worth your time.

												As much as I want to enjoy this game, for the sake of abandoning bias, Depression Quest is undeniably a boring game. While the game is obviously designed to make the player feel helpless, the method of achieving such a feeling is awkward at best and dysfunctional at worst; The Player does not take the role of the protagonist or understand the protagonist, but rather feels agitated by the lack of control of the protagonist (For this reason, I especially do not recommend Depression Quest to those suffering from Clinical Depression).You know you've failed in your work when an MS paint comic (Hyperbole and a Half) made by one person better conveys the concept of clinical depression than an Interactive Fiction made by three people.

												This ""game"" was nothing more than my life on screen. I am even right now in bed at 3pm after taking the day off from work. I have no motivation and if you people that write reviews want to say I have no personality that's ok. I don't go out on the weekends. I have a dead end job, with a few co workers that I talk to. The only reason I am still around is because I legit don't have the balls or energy to kill myself. I have tried therpy and pills and neither seems to work, and I would rather sit quietly in my room facing the wall then have to talk to someone about myself. The last relationship I had ended almost exactly like that expect at a much faster pace (we only seen each other for a couple of weeks). The holidays for me are my hardest couple of months. They bring nothing but stress aniexty and hopelessness to me.			"

												Can highly praise this type of game - it explores subjects we seldom touch in gaming or in real life, and yet have probably all suffered from depression or contributed positively or negatively to others who suffer[ed] from it. Reading the ""helpful customer reviews"" is a curious experience, the ""most helpful"" seem to not agree on whether the character is male or female or what the game was trying to achieve as it wasn't ""fun"".Perhaps that's the issue, when we try to construct something that isn't there and don't simply relax and enjoy what this game is trying to do.So far as replayability goes, I'm not sure.. will see if I pick it up again in a couple of weeks when I'm in a different mindset!

												A quiet and honest look at the emotional resonance that games can have. Even if they have to let go of the concept of fun to do it.This game doesn't have win-lose scenarios, an obvious best choice, or even a guarnteed resolution. All it has is realistic decisions based on the story's current circumstances. It plays with exceptations the same way reality does.While I've only played through the game once, I managed to get a personal ending that I felt was appropriate for the story (out of the possibilities of 150 possible encounters). If you ask me, it was pretty close to the best ending, but I felt like I didn't always make the right choices. Just honest answers.And rule of thumb: the first choice isn't always the best choice.Plus it's free and takes about 20-30 minutes of reading (at my reading speed).If you can spare that time, then I guarantee that this game deserves to be played once; and you deserve to understand that depression is always a possibility, but never an eventuality. So remember what this game offered. As a fellow human, it is the best that you can do.Sincerely,R.B.			"

												I rather enjoyed this game since I could relate to it. It was a good test of knowledge over what I've learned on depression and personal progress as a whole. As it seems, I aced it.The game itself was well-written. The perspective was kept in it's boundries, which maybe made it that good.Such a fine piece of material. Glad I played.Some perspective the game brought to me: It's kind of worrying that depression might go on but maybe the trick is to build new/strong/good habits to cope with the depression/be a better person overall. Show your mind who's the boss and such.And ultimately - live life how you want to.			"

I first tried to end up as positively and after as negatively, both with guessing the answers. I found that it was way easier to end up depressed then happy, this would of course be the whole point of the game but it feels like you don't really have a choise, you just read the story from beginning to end with some small alters in the end.

												     The issue I would first like to adress, is the issue of people saying this visual novel does not give an accurate description of what depression is like. I have never seen a single book, visual novel, movie, show, article, website, etc. give a proper understanding of depression. No healthy mind can understand a suffering one. (Well, there are some exceptions to this yet I am speaking of the majority of healthy minds) We simply don't have the ability to understand the extent. It is simply cruel to expect that of a game made by a limited number of people. They did their best to explain the mental suffering to those who have no issue with it. Also, the majority of the public is quite sensitive to issues as suicide and thoughts of suicide. This did a fantastic job at not giving too much visualization for those who are sensitive yet just enough to still show them the severity.      The next problem, is that people point out it is not a ""game"".  This is a visual novel. At no point was it intended to be a game in which you could play and enjoy. It gives you choice as to what you should do yet it does not tell you to ""play"" it per se.      Finally, many people say that it offers little choice and simply tells you a story. Yeah...no shiz. It is a visual ""novel"". This means that it is supposed to give an experience instead of let you play a lot. The choices you make do affect the outcome but the goal is the same. To speak to you about depression. The choices you make are determined by earlier choices. This shows the ""player"" that if you stay in one mind-set, things will continue down that path.Anyways, that is all I have to say. I quite liked this game and don't feel that it is being judged correctly. People become really harsh to games with sensitive topics and I just wanted to give a nice review for this. I don't mean to offend anybody and if I have, I thoroughly apologize. I have little experience at a lot of things and hope that people don't take my words too seriously. This was simply my personal review.			"

												Depression Quest did it's job. To show depression.It needs to be said (and should have been said by Quinn herself) that Depression Quest is merely a manifestation of a general idea of clinical depression, meaning that the whole nine yards of the condition will not be exhibited here. Should you want to have a more in-depth comprehension of the concept, Wikipedia will do the job well enough. Hell, even prior to starting the game, there was a disclaimer, for lack of a better term, stating that Quinn is not infallible, and what is provided here is all she could muster from others. Maybe she is lying but she is still rebutting all the people here shaming the game simply because of that. Just like any other disease, there is always a spectrum that ranges on various aspects of the condition. Now, the game.The character is...You. Literally, to enhance that self-insertion part of the game. You have a girlfriend, a minimum-wage nine to five, and parents who still happen to be together. The average guy, You are, but here's the kicker. You suffer from depression, and Depression Quest is a chronicle of said depression which places You in situations that the average twenty-something year old might face. As this is a record of Your progression, the game has the propensity of lending You the course of events, for You to determine the events that transpire while coping with the symptoms. (Note all of this ♥♥♥♥ing redundancy, I'll stop.).Quinn, or should I say, ""The Quinnspiracy"" tackles themes that are associated with clinical depression, such as anxiety and social exclusion. These themes are used and emphasized fairly well as they are exemplified in many occasions throughout the game when the player gets confronted by others or even more so when Mr. Protagonist succumbs to his condition, lessening to a pile of spite and self-loathing. Even if one does not suffer from this illness, I am certain that players can relate to the events here, since the average person does find him/herself in a number of situations here. The only visuals here consist of small photo pamphlets containing even smaller pictures of daily trifles in subdued color, which often repeat. Along with the continual track of music, they do nothing to thicken the ambiance of the story. Depression Quest might as well be considered a ""Choose your Adventure"" e-book rather than a game, taken into account the large portions of text the player is given. I think the main problem most people have with this game is the ""decision time"" element of the game, which I don't entirely disagree with. It's honestly sort of absurd how the game handles it, as some, if not most choices will be scratched out or not there at all if you didn't take up the cat offer. It is evident the choices provided are affected by your depression level, but even this is stupid as on the instance of a high depression level you will be barraged with scratches, leaving only one damn choice most times. To make matters worse, there will sometimes be that one ""ideal"" choice that is scratched out always, practically ridiculing the hopelessness one can potentially feel with depression. The level-choice relationship could have made a fine mechanic to implement in the game, but the developer failed to get a firm grasp on it to make it work well.The game sure isn't perfect, but what was done here isn't as reprehensible as some other projects I've got my hands on. If you seek a brief, satisfying story that tries not to amaze but to ""inform"" (to a certain extent), then pick this up and give it a go. Don't expect much, it's still from Quinn herself.			"

												Depression Quest is a well-written and emotionally powerful work of interactive fiction.The game has a limited 'progression' system tracking your mental status and mental health. This system influences the ending and other in-game text.The dialogue feels authentic, and the descriptions and narrative flow smoothly. I've played this game several times before it came to Steam, exploring different options and pathways, and have enjoyed it every time.			"

I found myself identifying with the game in many ways, recalling times that I had been in similar situations. This would be a great game for anyone to play that wants to try to see the other side of depression, or understand a little more about something that afficts a loved one, or themselves. I would recommend it, it's a very accurate interpretation, a deep and involved game.			"

												Being a 17 year old with Bi-Polar (Manic Depressive Disorder) who has developed a very strong control over his condition,I find that this game very much describes my actions and thoughts/feelings when I'm stuck in a manic depresive phase. The gameplay is FILLED 110% to the brim with heartbreaking walls of text with little to no interactions which is a total downer and makes me question the actual amount of effort put into making this into a ""Game"" and I do not feel like this was good game material or a good idea for one. However, seeing as this is a ""Game"" and is currently playable, this ""Game"" was more than successful in delivering what it promises to: Heartbreaking Scenarios that you have little to no control over. I do not reccomend this game to anyone who already has symptoms of depression, Bi-Polar, Cyclothymia, Multiple Personality Disorder, etc. If you don't and you actually give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about how it feels to be like the above mentioned, this is not a dead on simulation, but a good start to understanding how we feel and think. Also, if you're like me and you find anything offensive to be extremely hilarious (like dead baby jokes and nazi stuff), play this for laughs. Like I said, I have good control over my emotional situation and can recognize my current emotional status at all times nad can act accordingly to function socially and perform menial tasks properly without my condition getting in the way. Because of this, I was actually able to laugh at some of the scenarios and situations in this ""Game"" because they tended to be only Semi-Realistic, yet I find myself to have been in every single one atleast once.Overall:Gameplay aspect = 1/10 Total♥♥♥♥♥♥..this aint a game...it's a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥depression simulator.Story Telling aspect = 9/10 Very good! Good story still!Overall Rating = 4/10 This seriously did not need to be made. However, I aint gonna complain about the fact that it was.Note: While this aint exactly fun, I gave the game a thumbs up because of the fact that despite it's rating (the one I gave it), it's a ""Game"" that I would honestly suggest everyone without symptoms of depression, Bi-Polar, Cyclothymia, Multiple Personality Disorder, etc. to play atleast once and to actually read it and take thier time to actually choose their responses (if allowed).

												This is not a fun game.Now that we have that out of the way, let's get to what it is.  This is an attempt to shine a light on how difficult depression is.  I live with someone who suffers from depression and many of the situations in this game reminded me of ones close to real life. The game follows the player through the discovery of what is happening to them as well as who their support system is. During some parts of the story there will be options marked off. These options are simply what most people would say to do, but someone suffering from depression might not be able to do.If you are looking for a game that will deal with some pretty mundane but powerful situations, here it is.

												First, this isn't a ""game"" and does well to label itself as ""interactive fiction.""I can definitely see what the intention was here, and the writing isn't TERRIBLE. But the main character's experience with depression is a little over the top and not always relatable. There are definitely moments where the writing hits on some poignant things, but it's overall a little too serious and doesn't live up to the potential for a witty commentary on depression that it could be. I'll admit, I played this ironically, reading aloud to my boyfriend as we worked through the story. The protagonist, while meant to be androgynous, would not realistically read as male in most cases. My boyfriend had trouble relating in most instances. The only believable impression is that you're playing a girl in a relationship with another woman. We both cringed at the protagonist's available choices as well.Overall, it was okay, but the ending was pretty lackluster, and even with occasionally insightful passages, the story itself was filled with secondhand embarrassment. It feels very much like reading an individual's very personal experience with depression and their own (poor?) way of coping. Better than I expected, though, to be honest. Quinn might have some success in blogging at the very least, but this isn't a successful ""game.""3/10 -not a game (why is this on steam?)-low-quality visuals, no aesthetic appeal-decent writing style, poor story structure/ending-only semi-relatable example of depression-ambiguous protagonist, but very personal narrative "

												This game may not be like any other you have ever played before, it is something ompletely new.Many negative reviewers have said that because they are 'depressed' they cannot pick the options that they said would make them less depressed, ans so succeed at 'completing' the game. Depression is exactly that, it's a spiral of downward thoughts and negative emotions, it is meant to seem like you can never break away and make yourself 'better'. This game captures that very well, you have to be intuitive and engineer your own way out, not the easy option, but the realistic one that suits your mental state.I have never had depression and hope i never do, but this game might have given me an insight on how that mind set may come about and how damaging and comsming to life and social interactions it may be.I don't know how accurate this game is at portaying how it is to live with depression, however it was an enjoyable play and is quite short, a bit less than 1 hour.

												Very much a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure style game. This is suppsoed to give an insight into depression, something which it does very well. Having been there, and seen others who're in the same state, it's very true to the nature of the disease.I'm not going to enter into a debate about what constitutes a game or not, and whether this was 'fun' or not. I consider it a game, but by no means was it fun, nor was it meant to be.It's 30-60 minutes of eye-opening, and it's free. In terms of spreading awareness in a unique and interactive way, it does its job. Don't play if depressed, but definitely play if you know someone who is and you don't quite know what they're experiencing.			"

												About halfway through a playthrough of this game, I wanted to off myself. This game's mission was to show the player what depression was. This was definitely achieved by playing 10 minutes of the game. You are NOT given a choice whether or not to be depressed in this game, so you have to overcome depression even though you would not have particularly chosen that path for yourself. 10/10 Game was depressing as mess.

												Its been a good year since the GamerGate controversy. And as always, I heard negative things about the game, but after playing it, I enjoyed it. Since I'm not a dumbass I got the good ending where the player ends up combating his depression. game lasts 41 min.repatative sound track, although its a piano loop so not much to hag on.I'd give it a 6/10, not horrible, but not great either.Whatever your opinion on Zoe Quinn is, go ahead and give the game a try, you might end up enjoying the experience.

												You should know what you're getting into. It's a fairly short game but the impact is lasting. If you aren't curious on the obvious subject or haven't been through it yourself, this game will either be a drag or an eye opener. At least give it a try. It's free and, at worse, won't waste much time.			"

As a target of depression, I can state that this game assisted in a few aspects. Helping me, as well as providing a few techniques.This game, is immaculate, and the story is fulfilling as well. However, there are flaws such as not being realistic enough. Depression can't be simulated, and this is not the most accurate it can be represented.However, I enjoyed it.7/10.			"

												     The issue I would first like to adress, is the issue of people saying this visual novel does not give an accurate description of what depression is like. I have never seen a single book, visual novel, movie, show, article, website, etc. give a proper understanding of depression. No healthy mind can understand a suffering one. (Well, there are some exceptions to this yet I am speaking of the majority of healthy minds) We simply don't have the ability to understand the extent. It is simply cruel to expect that of a game made by a limited number of people. They did their best to explain the mental suffering to those who have no issue with it. Also, the majority of the public is quite sensitive to issues as suicide and thoughts of suicide. This did a fantastic job at not giving too much visualization for those who are sensitive yet just enough to still show them the severity.      The next problem, is that people point out it is not a ""game"".  This is a visual novel. At no point was it intended to be a game in which you could play and enjoy. It gives you choice as to what you should do yet it does not tell you to ""play"" it per se.      Finally, many people say that it offers little choice and simply tells you a story. Yeah...no shiz. It is a visual ""novel"". This means that it is supposed to give an experience instead of let you play a lot. The choices you make do affect the outcome but the goal is the same. To speak to you about depression. The choices you make are determined by earlier choices. This shows the ""player"" that if you stay in one mind-set, things will continue down that path.Anyways, that is all I have to say. I quite liked this game and don't feel that it is being judged correctly. People become really harsh to games with sensitive topics and I just wanted to give a nice review for this. I don't mean to offend anybody and if I have, I thoroughly apologize. I have little experience at a lot of things and hope that people don't take my words too seriously. This was simply my personal review.			"

Posted: November 5, 2015
												There is so much going wrong for this game that it would be far quicker to list the good things than the bad.  However, I find it's often best to do things the hard way.In the opening screen, you are presented with the statement, ""This game uses audio as a part of the play experience.  We encourage you to play with the sound on.""  This is not a good idea.  The music is very haunting and fairly immersive, but only for the first few bars.  It quickly devolves into a grating noise that is either looping or just played with annoyingly similar chords, throughout the game.  It does not enhance the experience.  If anything, it hurts it.The story itself is a major problem.  As the game states, people experience depression differently, and the game can only shed light on so much.  However, the game feels lazily put together.   There aren’t many options, just a few blanket ones.  As you plod through, more types of options are locked or unlocked based on your decisions.  But even with the amount of text displayed on each page, the story was very lacking.The characters felt like two-dimensional effigies.  You could not get attached to, or even empathize with, any of them, because there simply wasn't enough to them.  It was as if each character was their own dating website profile, with only a few words plugged into each text field.As the protagonist continues to get worse, (or better, as it's hard to tell since it often feels vague) more options are blocked off, leaving the player stranded on a route based on just a few decisions they made early on.  Though this is somewhat accurate to reality–people living with depression find themselves unable to do even simple things like get out of bed or shower, at times–it seems to railroad the player into one of three possible routes:  The good end, the bad end, and the neutral end.The truth is, these ends come with some loaded messages.  Productive actions will be rewarded, yet by choosing not to make productive choices you will be heavily punished.  This message is incredibly dangerous to spread to those with depression who are playing the game in an effort to feel understood.  It spreads a message of helplessness and worthlessness.  After all, you are made to feel you’ve lost the game, and downright worthless for having done so, if your choices weren’t the “right” choices.At the end of the game, in the credits, you are pretentiously thanked for ""being willing to play games that are meant to be something other than simply 'fun.'""Even though I have referred to ""Depression Quest"" as a game throughout this review, it really is not.  This is a ""choose your own adventure"" book, or an exercise.  There are no real gameplay elements in this thing, save from being able to make choices that have lasting effects.  And yet, it is making itself out to be something better than ""fun"" games, despite having almost none of the qualities that make a game, period.In fact, it's barely even a game book.  In ""choose your own adventure books,"" the story is engaging, and what you do matters in the pursuit of your goal.  ""Depression Quest"" is not engaging, there are no stakes, and it's hard to tell what effect you're having.Long story short, ""Depression Quest"" is, at the most, a meretricious, amateur attempt at creating a ""choose your own adventure"" game book, loaded with text and grammatical errors, being projected as something above and beyond other video games.  This is ironic, seeing it accomplished none of its goals.It fails as a video game.  It fails as a game book.  It fails as a teaching or therapeutic tool.  It fails at depicting what living with depression is like (especially if you consider the testimonials I've received from friends, family, and online sources).  It even fails at being an expression of the author's personal pain, as it does nothing to instill any sort of empathy in the player.  It's all so tedious, unimaginative and even narcissistic, that it comes off as a whining teenager's journal, destroying any attempt of connecting with the player, even at a superficial level.Worse still, the game's history renders it even more unenjoyable.  What really did or didn't happen is irrelevant.  Obviously, it doesn't make any sense that the creator would have fraternized with online game journalists for monetary reasons, seeing that the game was always free.  However, after playing the game and seeing what it's all about, it makes perfect sense that they would for pure publicity.  That is quite possibly the only way that this game would have gotten any form of notoriety.  Otherwise, it would have faded into obscurity in less than a week.  And it worked.  The scandal is the biggest reason that anyone knows about it.  It has given its creator more publicity, voice, and money than their talents could have ever brought.That doesn't mean that the subject of depression is impossible to put into game form.  ""Actual Sunlight"" is one that better achieves this.  Although, some may think that it's more of a visual novel than a game, it still has more and better gameplay elements than ""Depression Quest.""  Better writing with a deeper, more meaningful story, and makes no lofty assertions about what it is.  The stakes in the game are clear, and you can empathize with the characters.  Its creators put thought and care into their game, despite it being simple in the game play aspect.In closing, ""Depression Quest"" was one of the most poorly made, pointless things I have ever spent time on.  The creator owes $25 to every person who has ever downloaded it.			"

												This... this should not be on steam by any means. I'm going to start out with that. It cant even be considered a ""game"" really, because even with other text based adventures, you get somewhere. I know that is not the point of this story, but it makes it very unegaging, espicially since you dont truly have any actual choices. I get that you can choose the good answers because you are ""Depressed"", but why even put them in the game then?.This doesnt feel like it was written by someone with depression, it feels like it was written by someone that was trying to understand depression, but doesnt have an idea of what it is. Generally you dont want it, and atleast try a little to fix it, even on your own.I cant even really write a review for this, theres so little ""Game"" to it. Overall, its unengaging to the point I couldnt even finish it, and very, very badly paced. "

I seem a little better now, but i caused a lot of problems with my life in being bitter and discluded from everyone and im to face major consequences this week and probably things that will effect my entire future ._.  But this game lightened my depression this night, reminded me how weak my depression is compared to other people in this world. Not the crappiest game that fools with my emotions. I'll call this a good game, even if depression isn't like that exactly for me and people i know or hear of who are/were seveerly depressed.			"

												It's okay. It's a Choose Your Own Adventure book that makes use of mechinics that couldn't be done easily in a book to push its message. It can read through really quickly and it's free so you can't really fault it for anything. I suggest giving it a try in your free time, simply because it does no harm if you don't like it.Whether the writing is moving is subjective but you can't really fault that it doesn't do what it sets out to do effectively, which is, to put you into the prespective of an average someone suffering from Clinical Depression.

""Depression Quest"" is not engaging, there are no stakes, and it's hard to tell what effect you're having.Long story short, ""Depression Quest"" is, at the most, a meretricious, amateur attempt at creating a ""choose your own adventure"" game book, loaded with text and grammatical errors, being projected as something above and beyond other video games.  This is ironic, seeing it accomplished none of its goals.It fails as a video game.  It fails as a game book.  It fails as a teaching or therapeutic tool.  It fails at depicting what living with depression is like (especially if you consider the testimonials I've received from friends, family, and online sources).  It even fails at being an expression of the author's personal pain, as it does nothing to instill any sort of empathy in the player.  It's all so tedious, unimaginative and even narcissistic, that it comes off as a whining teenager's journal, destroying any attempt of connecting with the player, even at a superficial level.Worse still, the game's history renders it even more unenjoyable.  What really did or didn't happen is irrelevant.  Obviously, it doesn't make any sense that the creator would have fraternized with online game journalists for monetary reasons, seeing that the game was always free.  However, after playing the game and seeing what it's all about, it makes perfect sense that they would for pure publicity.  That is quite possibly the only way that this game would have gotten any form of notoriety.  Otherwise, it would have faded into obscurity in less than a week.  And it worked.  The scandal is the biggest reason that anyone knows about it.  It has given its creator more publicity, voice, and money than their talents could have ever brought.That doesn't mean that the subject of depression is impossible to put into game form.  ""Actual Sunlight"" is one that better achieves this.  Although, some may think that it's more of a visual novel than a game, it still has more and better gameplay elements than ""Depression Quest.""  Better writing with a deeper, more meaningful story, and makes no lofty assertions about what it is.  The stakes in the game are clear, and you can empathize with the characters.  Its creators put thought and care into their game, despite it being simple in the game play aspect.In closing, ""Depression Quest"" was one of the most poorly made, pointless things I have ever spent time on.  The creator owes $25 to every person who has ever downloaded it.			"

												The content of this game, to me was very moving. It shows how simple things could really be huge struggles. I found the game enjoyable, but a bit frustrating when I couldn't select a certain choice. It's not always about how you play the game, with the fancy graphics, and animations. But how you 'see' it for what it's trying to project, it content. Probably one of the best games I have ever experienced, sad to say that the story, of course eventually 'ends'.			"

This is a narrative game with the purpose of making you think, and it succeeds in this regard.

												Stepping into the shoes of someone who has a different experience of life and interact with their world is the thing that games are much more capable of doing than any other medium. Using a limited and restrictive set of mechanichs and graphics can still be effective if you have a good story to tell or an inventive idea. Just like using a limited pallet painting the artist can produce something fantastic but it takes skill. This game nails how to do that in the games medium. The central idea of depression limiting your ability to be proactive or energetic is really well done. It's a simple mechanic crossing out the options but its a really artful way of putting the player in the shoes of someone with clinical depression. The options are there and anyone can tell you, that doesn't mean you can take them. This game would be really helpful to someone trying to understand a friend or family member going through this so long as they aprouched it honestly and with an open mind.			"

												Seriously, this game does not belong on Steam. That sounds heart, but it's true; this kind of format is more suited to a text adventure, style games in their own right, but shouldn't exist cluttering games on Steam.Also, as far as a text adventure, this is pretty aggravating. This does NOT convey depression accurately as far as decision making and the general vibe. I got more and more frustrated as the answers only dialed down to ""depressing"" or ""More depressing"". Nothing about the story is engaging. It would be better suited to use this character in a third person to give them some empathy. However, to sound more “Immersive” I suppose, they stick you in the first person as the player. Problem with that is, I would NOT make those choices in those situations. So instantly, I have lost focus with this character, these scenarios, and this game.Positive things?...I dunno, it launched and exited quickly. Looks like my PC can run it, so there’s that. Color palette isn’t absolutely disgusting. So...there’s that.Totally unrelated to the review, but the fact that this game caused such a big upheaval is unheard of for me. It's certainly no triple A release, but this game is boring and dull by indie game standards. For something more in depth on depression, for games, look up TellTale's walking dead series, or The Beginners Guide on steam.			"

												Although the game seems to accomplish what’s it sets out to do to some extent it is all together a very boring game that I don't believe will have a meaningful impact on the people that play this game. It does have a depressing feel to it and your decisions have somewhat of a meaningful impact but in the end there aren't really any consequences for your actions. Sure you can end up losing your girlfriend but even then you have a positive outlook on it. You take away that Alex (girlfriend) will find someone she will be happier with. The decisions made had slight impacts but no real consequences. I went through a second time and attempted to self-sabotage and i was expecting a darker outcome, for instance death of the character, but there was not such outcome. This may be due to the fact that they didn't want this game to be that dark, but depression is that dark. They allow partial reality to the game, not true reality. If they wanted to follow accurately they should have much darker consequences, but also the ability to have lighter outcomes.			"

												This game feels inaccurate in its portrayal of depression. None of the friends save for Amanda seem to be helpful individuals. I would hope that if I had the behavior of our protagonist, someone would try and talk to me or do something. Depression is a legitimate struggle to get out of, but this game makes it feel like a game. By trying to simulate someone’s very personal experience, you make someone with a legitimate medical issue seem whiney. You can’t really relate to the protagonist if you haven’t had depression, and from people who have had depression, it would seem inaccurate. My brother has Bipolar disorder, and has intense periods of depression. He acts completely different from the protagonist in these periods. No one supports the protagonist unlike the girlfriends and family of the real world. While some people don’t get the support they need, I feel someone would at least notice early on. If you wanted to make an impact, make the game from the point of view of someone only slightly depressed, and have game options that can make it better or worse. Starting from the bottom makes it hard for the “typical” person to get into the mindset of the depressed individual. 	Aside from the faults in its portrayal of depression, the game feels boring. The red crossed out text is just frustrating in the early game where they are not even a conceivable option. They would be better off when they are something a player could access. The static-text is aesthetically unpleasing as it stands out from the rest of the games aesthetic. The photos on the top often feel like its going for an artsy feel, but overall they feel pointless. This game feels like it’s trying to be artsy, being important. It wants to be profound and interesting, but it comes across is trying too hard to be sad and not capturing what it set out to do. The game only got the attention it had due to scandal, and it shows. The gameplay is boring and the commentary is weak. I would not recommend the game to anyone who wants to understand depression. You are better off with an old textbook or internet entries. The only saving grace is that this game was free, so at least I didn’t lose anything other than a few minutes of time. "

												This game's purpose was to raise awareness on what depression felt like to those who didn't suffer from it; which it did, but all too well. I personally did not think I was depressed, but after playing this game I had slight hesitations in my head: ""Am I actually depressed?""It delivered it's purpose all too much, with the very detailed information and sound. It felt too real, and really made me think in the character's perspective. At the same time, I was disappointed every time when I couldn't click on the crossed out option, which is obviously the option for those who aren't depressed. It seemed as though although I wanted to take the more cheery option, it was out of my reach and ended up having to take another option which I felt wasn't my first option. While this game is completely successful in it's purpose, I will not recommend this game even to those who are not depressed just for the fact that it could affect your life negatively, and is not worth any positive points that could be taken from this game.

												In ""Depression Quest"", the game's objective is to have the player experience a situation where depression is present and to help the player realize how depression is a serious illness. The game does exactly that, as it puts you in a 20 year old man's shoes who has the ongoing feeling that he is exhausted all the time and feels down on himself. With the help of the noticable music in the background and the somewhat interesting storyline, it definitely makes you feel that presence of depression. After playing the first few minutes of the game, I was actually fairly impressed with how the developers were able to portray the image of depression through a video game such as this one. ""Depression Quest"" definitely achieves it's goal and takes you on one heck of a ride.			"

I'm surprised steam doesn't just take this down.if this game doesn't stop depression but increases it and they don't do anything about it.They need more employees instead of bots to greenlight stuff.imagine this game making you have to pay,you would be 10X more depressed and you lost some money you could have spent on a better game then just click and proceed.listen.. if your really depressed as hell.Talk to a friend,don't lie to them and say your okay,youll just add more pain to yourself or talk to a suicide hotline.

												This is not a game, it's simply a 'choose your own adventure' novel... but the well timed drama involving Zoe Quinn just leaves nothing but a sour taste in the mouth, and I'm compelled to write something about that. It's obvious that the community didn't want this initially, otherwise it would've made the cut on Greenlight to begin with... Basically this release is the result of a long string of industry related sex-scandals, and what happens when a developer sells every single ounce of their moral integrity in order to make their dream a reality, and in the process involves themselves with people able to help her out with that dream, but also lacking any moral integrity themselves.The whole situation is just a huge mess, what we should all do as a responsible gaming community is just ignore all this nonsense, and just let horrible people be their horrible selves without having to suffer any bs. If only that were the case here...Some might say that this is merely the fault of the people involved, and shouldn't reflect too badly on the end result, but you have to remember, it was their choice to make all of this public, one idiot made the initial push to get the 'news' out there, and then the other idiot brings this to attention on her public social media accounts, so that we're all caught up in the drama and arguing our own points on the matter when in truth, the only idiots who have any say in the matter are Zoe Quinn, the alleged five dudes she was banging while still involved in a relationship, and the first idiot I mentioned who was her boyfriend.They are all stupid idiots who we shouldn't be enabling, but we are regardless of what we say about them at this point because the damage has already been done, they've gotten out of this exactly what they all needed and we're all suckers for giving it to them..So in conclusion, do not play this game if you just want to get a better understanding of the current drama, those people are not worth your time. If however you want to get a better understanding of how to use depression as a mechanic in something that almost resembles a video game, or want an idea of how to present a character with depression, then that should be the only time you consider downloading this.Do not let them use you.-B.Fitz			"

												The writing style is bland, the presentation is completely unengaging, the music is grating, and despite all its attempts to present itself as a game about depression, one gets the sense that while the writers may have read about depression once and maybe even had it at some point, they have no idea how to communicate this fact outside of simple description of symptoms, and have an even weaker understanding of the concept of a ""game"". A far better approach, if you really want to understand what depression is like, is to read Allie Brosh's now-famous account of her own struggles with it, or if you prefer to do so in the form of a video game, try playing Winter Voices. For all the bugs and interface problems Winter Voices struggles with, it does a far better and more engaging job of portraying depression and grief, by taking advantage of the fact that it is a video game in order to represent things more abstractly and truly draw in the player, trying to make them actually engage with the subject matter.Depression Quest is like reading the most boring and linear Choose Your Own Adventure book ever printed, one where all paths lead in roughly the same direction to roughly the same ending and the serious subject matter is treated so blandly that there's just no reason to give a ****. They say real art makes you think, and this game does make you think, but it makes you think ""wow, I'm bored"".It's bug-free, playable, and costs $0, therefore it's already got several legs up on Aliens: Colonial Marines, but otherwise just not worth anyone's time, even as a curiosity.

												I think the most important thing you have to remember is that this game doesn't have ""right"" or ""wrong"" answers. This isn't something that you have to try and win, because that's entirely not the point. Some people might hesitate to call this a game, but I think ""interactive experience"" is a bit less catchy. Nonetheless, it can offer you a bit of insight into depression that simply talking or reading about it won't achieve. Things like being unable to bring yourself to act upon options that seem so obvious or effortless to ""regular"" people, and how frustrating that is. Being fatigued by repeated interactions with well meaning but oblivious people that offer no solution or resolution. Finding occasional comfort in unexpected places.For those complaining that this game isn't an accurate representation of depression, I'm not sure if you've actually played it or are able to read, or understand humanity at all, because if you did, you'd have seen on the very first page that it doesn't pretend to represent ALL cases of depression, nor is that even possible since, besides the innumerable different types of mental illnesses out there, everyone with even basic depression experiences it differently, and live with it under unique circumstances. What I got out of it was a familiar retrospection of how my life and experiences had been several years ago, and occasionally (but fortunately rarely) still relapse into every now and then. But it wasn't exactly the same obviously, as I'm not actually dense enough to expect a 30 minute free game to somehow perfectly mirror my whole life experience.Depression Quest is very honest about merely being an attempt to provide people who know and care about someone who has depression a bit of potential insight into their otherwise private and closed off lives and consider what sort of reactions from loved ones help and what actually makes it worse, despite the best intentions.If this does not apply to you but you're just curious, it's free! But for those to whom the events described in the game are familiar, but genuinely struggle to explain what they are going through to loved ones, this could potentially be something valuable.For me, it illustrated the concept of ""I understand what you're going through/went through"" so much better than a vague verbal reassurance that, when you're in that situation, often feels ingenuine or meaningless anyways. Just remembering the familiarity of that creeping hopelessness reminds me why the vapid suggestion that people should ""just get over it"" is so uselessly dismissive, and that dismissiveness comes from the lack of empathy, due to a lack of perspective. If this game can offer people a bit of perspective, that's value.I'll admit I wasn't overly fond of the music, it was a bit more distracting than probably intended. Here and there were also a few obvious writing mistakes, but other than that, I'd certainly recommend this to people with an attention span.			"

												I looked at this game thinking, ""This is going to be dull as ♥♥♥♥, boring, ugh, why am i bothering, why do this when i already have plenty of good games to occupy myself with along with schoolwork."" Then I actually played the game. I was worried I'd ♥♥♥♥ everything up for myself in it because I don't have depression or anything similar to it.... although to be honest they really should think of a better name for depression becuase the emotion depression can be ignored and forgotten and..... back to the subject of the brain chemical imbalance depression (Sorry about the tangent, I tend to go on them too frequently). My point is, I love the game, the story, and I'm glad I actually succeeded in beating the game using what my parents have taught me, common sense, and thinking about what I would do or want to do in that situation. It is important to be honest with your friends and family who accept and acknowledge you for you as oppossed to being ignorant like the mother in this game. It is really quite sad how my mom is almost the same as the mom in the game. Except mine talks to me like I'm still a baby or a toddler who got a ""boo boo"" or a papercut, gets all pissy when things aren't done when she demands that they be done, and wails all the time expecting pity or to get what she wants. Generally, it is weird how what I see as common sense for what one should do when they are having problems with their life, is what works, and yet so many people don't do that stuff. It is quite disheartening. Oh well, good game, love the story, I hope you make many more story games like this in the future.			"

												I think this game gives a good example of what it may be like to live with depression. It illustrates how limiting it can be by eliminating the obvious good options, since you know what you should be doing but are too depressed to actually do them.  It shows how positive actions lead to positive outcomes, how easy it is to slip further into depression, and even how unpredictable it can be to try to take positive actions but end up being more depressed as a result.I found this to be a very emotional game, both sad and dark and uplifting and positive.

The problem is the game is really well written or executed and it certainly doesnt actually convey what being depressed is really like.  It feels like its written by someone observing depression but never actually experiencing true crushing depression first hand.  For that alone I cant recomend anyone bother but there are other reasons as well.Im not quite sure why this is a ""game"" that has been put on steam.  I came across it via a friend, he said play the game and then read up on the developer.  I've played the game but i question why this person didnt just make a website?Thats what this really is.  Its a website that has been turned into a executable file.  Im sure whoever made this meant well and probably has little experience with actual coding but it just doesnt seem to nail what it was going for.Pass.			"

												So, first off, this isn't a game. Not by any definition. I have seen better text based games online which were 10 times better.I recommend playing ""Coming out simulator 2014"", a flash game you can find online if you want to play a similar game that's infanitely better, trust me, there is nothing of substance here, do not waste your time with this. It attempts to bring a legitimate issue to light but doesn't try and make it engageing at all, the game will just be you scrolling and picking whatever choice sound good to you. The aformentioned flash game actually makes you care about the protagonist and his problems, play that game to understand what i mean by an engaging game that brings light to a legitimate issue.0/10, honest review.Now many of you know about FEZ and it's dev. The dev behind this game is worse, because the game she released isn't even good. She has used this game for publicity to make money VIA patreon. To loosely describe her, she is a person that uses her gender to gain pity from white knights and feminists, causing a group of people WHO LEGITIMATELY HAVE DEPRESSION to be flamed by the aformentioned white knights.

												I'm disappointed in this 'game'. If I wanted to know what a person feels when they're living with depression, I would ask as I have several times before. The concept is somewhat interesting, but the story is just bland; an overall waste of my time. [I don't need flashing lights, loud noises, mainstream music or gunfights to get my attention, much less entertain me, just wanted to throw that out there.] I know the crossed out options for making things better is an attempt to show people without depression how depressed people (may) feel, but it gets tiring when after a while the main characer does just about nothing to actually help themself. The character is over-analytical, and I got the feeling ever so often that they didn't want hope, that they didn't care for a chance to get better. Even if that's what depression can do to a person, a simple attempt to feel better about themself or their position in life should at least be an option, even if the end result is no change for the character. Whether or not the people who made this game wanted an immersive feeling to be had by those playing it, text and a few photos does nothing to grab my interest. Illustrations and a change in the characters' appearances (from third person or the main character's point of view) would have made this much more interesting of an experience. Instead I am stuck watching a person feel sorry for themself. This is not what a game is for. There has to be a goal, a reward or have rising action, a climax and a resolution - a reason to go on, and I see none after clicking 'next' 15 times. The options to make things 'progress' or make things better in this story sound like the kind of things someone would THINK a depressed person would do. If it means anything to Isaac, the repetative piano music kinda made me want to kill myself. I'm not sure if that's what was being aimed for, but man, bad music is one of my dozens of triggers - including triggers - and got me more into the game, but still not very much.I give this an overall 2/10 - the 2 is me being generous, and I'm not sure if I should be.

												It's an interesting experiment but I'm not sure it achieves what it sets out for. In most cases it nicely describes the thoughts and moods of a depressed person but I feel like it's too simple. For someone that struggles with the illness it may seem oversimplified and ""too easy"" to get out of the severely depressed state in the game... you know what option you need to click (even when the ones naturally available for healthy people are crossed out, which is a nice touch) to possibly better your situation but for someone depressed it's not this clear. Also, although the creators do note this at the beginning, this particular character is in a very good environment (even if their job is not satisfying) because basically everyone supports them eventually and they can affort treatment and medication. So I'm not sure the game succeeds in what it tries to do. The idea is not bad and some of the descriptions are on point but the gameplay and the options lack in representing the difficulties and intricacies of the subject... which would be the reason to make a ""game"" such as this in the first place. I do recommend it if you are interested in the topic but don't expect too much from it.			"

												I found this game while searching for games with overwhelmingly negative reviews. I wasnt really sure what to expect, but it was free and I had nothing to loose. My initial thoughts were ""wow who makes a game about depression"" and ""lol when my friends see me playing this♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; I ended up really liking this game tho. Not that depression is fun but the fact that your choices affected you in different ways. I saw a review that read something like ""this is kinda a slap in the face, I have depression"" and at first I kinda agreed but there was nothing that really bashed on depression or made light or fun of it. Not that the people who made this game are 100% right but the morale of the story is to fight depression instead of letting it keep you from living. Not many people would go and google ""what is depression and why should I be considerate of other people"". I think putting this in the form of a game like this can really help open the eyes of someone who otherwise wouldnt care. with that said this game is probably not for people with depression. I do not have depression and I understand that the developers of this game probably meant well however I can also understand how it might make someone with depression a little offended. to name a few things, the title of the game, the fact that it is portraied as a game, and scratched out choices etc. For me it wasnt really a game it was a novel with a branching plot about depression, and that is what it should be advertised as. NOT as a game and probably with a different title With that said I do not reccomend it because even though I liked it and feel as though they got there point across, the ""game"" is advertised as something it is not and for all intents and purposes I think whether you have depression or not this ""game"" should be avoided and pushed under the rug as on of those things that even though the devs meant well it was still a mistake.

												Right away, I liked the way the game gives you information. I like that it gave you the option of getting more exposition/background details or just moving on with the story. After the gray boxes under the options started changing, I felt like I was helping my character and that the options I chose could really influence the story. I like that they show options you can't pick because of stress or exhaustion, which implies that, if you make good decisions, some of those choices may open up, and also shows how depression can make it harder to communicate with people.I was skeptical when I first opened up this game, since, with the title ""Depression Quest,"" it doesn't sound all that engaging. However, a few minutes into playing, I found that I was really invested in my character and wanted to help them.  I don't have depression, but I can empathise with my character with so many more things than I though I would. I have felt the ""end of the week, I don't want to do anything"" feeling, I know what it's like when you feel like you can communicate better through writing than speech, and the procrastination is very similar to how I deal with almost all of my work. It felt to me like my character's successes were my successes, and the character's pitfalls were my own. I felt a real sense of accomplishment and happiness when my character felt better and felt sad when they were having a bad day. What matters in a game is the experience. It might not be for everyone, especially if you're someone who can't get into text adventures, but this game made me feel for my character. Even though they're just a cluster of words in a simple text-based game, I genuinely wanted them to succeed. I felt accomplished, like I'd done something really good, by the end of it. If that isn't the mark of a good game, I don't know what is.			"

												I don't get all the hate for this game. There are some misspellings and grammar errors but they are fairly minor. It's not particularly fantastic storywriting, but it's not supposed to be. It's supposed to be as accurate of a representation of depression as possible. Depression isn't romantic. I also don't feel like it portrays depression as being ""whiny"" as some people say, however it may seem that way because the person's feelings are unwarranted. This is actually a huge part of the problem of our societies' attitude toward depression - that it has to have a reason, that the person's feelings are invalid if they don't have a reason. This only makes people suffering with it feel worse. I feel like despite the fact that this plainly says it is not a ""game"", people still expect it to be. It's not, it's more like a visual novel. The reason choices are crossed out is to portray the idea that people with depression feel like some choices are IMPOSSIBLE. Whether they are or not, the person feels trapped by their own mind. If you go back and make different choices, you would find that choosing to open up, see a therapist, take antidepressants, etc. opens up more options. I DO wish it didn't end so abruptly - In particular, if you choose the options to not get better. This sounds really messed up, but I think the story could make more of an impact if it led to the character's suicide or self harm or something. As it is written, while the indicator at the bottom shows that you are getting worse, the story doesn't really describe it. It should delve deeper into the thoughts and feelings of the character, rather than just describing it as exhaustion, anxiety, etc. It doesn't describe the self-hatred, etc. of someone with severe depression. I think that's part of the reason people think the character seems ""whiny"". Is this game a perfect representation of depression? No. But it IS eye opening and perhaps could help some people relate to a person in their life that may be struggling with it. Depression is something that needs to stop being treated with a stigma, and it needs to be talked about more openly. Hopefully stuff like this can help with that.Finally, to anyone struggling with depression - You can make it through this. You're not worthless. Even the smallest gestures you do can make an impact to someone else. Don't try to go through it alone, there are people that care and will help.			"

												It's a good game. Sure, it's text based but the music is well done, as are the background graphics and the occasional dreary image to add to the feel of the game. It honestly reflects what depression is like in a well thought out way, thoughts just pouring through your mind. What would add to this is a couple of different options. Alex being male would be pretty cool. Maybe removing her altogether would be a good course of action, maybe with some of the other characters to show how important supportive figures are in dealing with this kind of problem. The only thing I have an honest problem with is the ending. It felt abrupt, withoout rhyme or reason. It really should have some kind of objective to it, like achieving a certain state of mind, but instead it just cuts out and tells you that the game has ended. To me, this chronology based ending makes little sense for a game as there is no real ""objective"" to aim for as a game.Overall, it's a free game, and it takes 20 minutes max to complete. Just play it already.			"

												As a person who has dealt with depression, I must admit that this is far closer to reality than I expected, given how little effort went into this game.  That being said, it still looks like it was written by somebody with only a passing knowledge of actual, clinical depression, especially the part where everybody can tell you're depressed.  If it were that easy, there wouldn't be so many untreated casees of depression.  The fact that I could reproduce the entire game in html in a single weekend makes this whole thing insultingly simple.  Even if you don't buy the narrative that this game only got good reviews due to *ahem* inappropriate influence, this thing is like an art film.  It's horrendously boring and poorly made, with no real point, but everybody will proudly prostrate itself before this game, calling it 'bold' or 'artistic.'  It's neither.  It's lazy, and the same kind of people who write good reviews of this game are the ones people make fun of in sitcoms who call a work of art 'brilliant' only to find out it was made by cats running across the canvas with paint on their feet.In short, skip it.  It's lazy, boring, and overpriced.			"

												For a game that calls itself depression quest, I found the actual message of the game to be ""Dealing with antisocial issues"". The character (you and I) deals with the inability to speak with people and gets tired of social interactions in a manner more associated with introversy. I felt a genuine amount of effort in this visual novel (not so much a game at times, in that it limits your options) but it falls short at times. The limited options and the general feel of the game doesn't really capture depression as it does teenage angst. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who would want to understand the feelings of anyone with Depression.			"

												You know, most games that arent entertanment to me, I dont really care for, but this game even thougth it is very boring, and someone inaccrute, I believe that this game was created to get the word out about depression. This is a very tuff game to play. Warning you that. Dont play unless you think you can handle it. Very ruff read. Its like doing a maze, and just running around in circles. This games objective was to get the word out about depression, thougth may not have been done in the proper way, the way this game leaves you feeling, allows you to get a glimpse at how someone that suffers from this feels, 20% of people suffer from some form of depression, the 80% need to help them, and make them feel acceppted and happy. Btw, this is not a how to get out of depression, if so, id be a bit insulted about that, its not easy for people to come out of depression, and its never a cut and dry situtation. If you suffer from depression, you should reach out to a professional, or if you're a teen, reach out to a parent and/or teacher, that can help you contact a professional. This game, is designed, for a goal, and I believe it is impossible to describe depression, and that this is the best attempt/outreach about depression.			"

												Right away, I liked the way the game gives you information. I like that it gave you the option of getting more exposition/background details or just moving on with the story. After the gray boxes under the options started changing, I felt like I was helping my character and that the options I chose could really influence the story. I like that they show options you can't pick because of stress or exhaustion, which implies that, if you make good decisions, some of those choices may open up, and also shows how depression can make it harder to communicate with people.I was skeptical when I first opened up this game, since, with the title ""Depression Quest,"" it doesn't sound all that engaging. However, a few minutes into playing, I found that I was really invested in my character and wanted to help them.  I don't have depression, but I can empathise with my character with so many more things than I though I would. I have felt the ""end of the week, I don't want to do anything"" feeling, I know what it's like when you feel like you can communicate better through writing than speech, and the procrastination is very similar to how I deal with almost all of my work. It felt to me like my character's successes were my successes, and the character's pitfalls were my own. I felt a real sense of accomplishment and happiness when my character felt better and felt sad when they were having a bad day. What matters in a game is the experience. It might not be for everyone, especially if you're someone who can't get into text adventures, but this game made me feel for my character. Even though they're just a cluster of words in a simple text-based game, I genuinely wanted them to succeed. I felt accomplished, like I'd done something really good, by the end of it. If that isn't the mark of a good game, I don't know what is.			"

												I don't get all the hate for this game. There are some misspellings and grammar errors but they are fairly minor. It's not particularly fantastic storywriting, but it's not supposed to be. It's supposed to be as accurate of a representation of depression as possible. Depression isn't romantic. I also don't feel like it portrays depression as being ""whiny"" as some people say, however it may seem that way because the person's feelings are unwarranted. This is actually a huge part of the problem of our societies' attitude toward depression - that it has to have a reason, that the person's feelings are invalid if they don't have a reason. This only makes people suffering with it feel worse. I feel like despite the fact that this plainly says it is not a ""game"", people still expect it to be. It's not, it's more like a visual novel. The reason choices are crossed out is to portray the idea that people with depression feel like some choices are IMPOSSIBLE. Whether they are or not, the person feels trapped by their own mind. If you go back and make different choices, you would find that choosing to open up, see a therapist, take antidepressants, etc. opens up more options. I DO wish it didn't end so abruptly - In particular, if you choose the options to not get better. This sounds really messed up, but I think the story could make more of an impact if it led to the character's suicide or self harm or something. As it is written, while the indicator at the bottom shows that you are getting worse, the story doesn't really describe it. It should delve deeper into the thoughts and feelings of the character, rather than just describing it as exhaustion, anxiety, etc. It doesn't describe the self-hatred, etc. of someone with severe depression. I think that's part of the reason people think the character seems ""whiny"". Is this game a perfect representation of depression? No. But it IS eye opening and perhaps could help some people relate to a person in their life that may be struggling with it. Depression is something that needs to stop being treated with a stigma, and it needs to be talked about more openly. Hopefully stuff like this can help with that.Finally, to anyone struggling with depression - You can make it through this. You're not worthless. Even the smallest gestures you do can make an impact to someone else. Don't try to go through it alone, there are people that care and will help.			"

												I played through this game twice, and I can honestly say that I recommend it. However, there are a few things you should know before you get into it.It is exactly what it says on the tin: an interactive (non)fiction game. ""Interactive fiction"" fits better than ""visual novel"" because it's almost entirely text-based. Sure, there are some accompanying pictures, but the text is the main focus. The ""(non)fiction"" label fits well because while the scenarios and characters are entirely made up, the underlying premises are very real. The descriptions of how the main character feels and what they're thinking are scarily accurate for someone suffering from depression. You can tell that the people who wrote this have firsthand experience with it.Playing this made me anxious, not gonna lie. The breezy writing style lets you immerse yourself in the main character's persona, and I had some heart-poundingly anxious moments while playing this. The scene where you talk to Attic about what's going on damn near made me cry, because he said exactly what I needed to hear in that moment.My only complaint about this game is how easy it is to railroad yourself onto the worst possible path, and end up with the ""bad ending."" The choices you make at the beginning of the game have much more of an effect on the outcome than your later choices. The degree to which your options are limited in the last half of the game is a tad unrealistic; having been in the depths of this debilitating condition myself, I can say that even at my worst, I could still at least attempt to bring myself to do things that were blocked in the game. I found this unneccesarily restrictive. I understand that it's meant to illustrate the hopelessness that one often feels when deeply depressed, but it still felt unrealistic.Bottom line: this game is not ""fun."" It's not meant to be ""fun."" It's meant to illustrate the struggles that depressed people go through every day of their lives, and I think it gets the point across really well. I enjoyed playing it; the first time through, I answered the way I felt like I would probably answer if it were actually me in these situations, and got completely ♥♥♥♥ed in the end. The second time, I was actually invested in the characters as third parties rather than actors in my own life, and tried my hardest to make things work within the context of the story, and ended up with a satisfying enough ending.Give it a try; it's free, you have nothing to lose other than maybe half an hour of your life, and let's be honest, you'd probably squander it by watching something stupid on Youtube anyway, so why not give this a try? Try to ignore for a moment who it was that made this game, and focus on the game itself; you might be a little shaken up, but you won't be disappointed.			"

Still... a free game is a free game, even if I'm late to the party.Long story short; you have depression. Life sucks because your character feels trapped between a crappy job, an overachieving brother, unsympathetic parents and an antisocial outlook. The solution is just to keep doing stuff.Seriously, that's it. Don't stay in bed all day, try to be social, open up to people who understand, find excuses not to be a lazy♥♥♥♥♥♥ accept help (maybe don't take the meds?) and lie to your parents who wouldn't understand.2/10Dropped a mark for lack of proof reading			"

												Just the right length. Very accurate to the reality of depression. Choices become very limited later on, meaning interactivity decreases - not necessarily a bad thing on its own, but something to be mindful of. Has nice if simplistic art and great atmospheric noises and music. Cat is adorable - however, they were not credited. If you enjoy this game, you must right this justice.			"

												I have suffered with depression myself over a number of years. This game helped me see depression in a new light, specifically how I can deal with it. In my first playthrough, I tried to do all the ""right"" things. I will eventually do a ""negative"" run to see how the ending changes.One thing that I liked about this game is that it seems biographical even about my own life. I have made many of the poor decisions that are presented in this game, namely ignoring people that care about me and situations that could help me. I have also noticed that the ""NPCs"" in the game react like many of my real life friends, something I was oblivious to before. Being able to play a game based on depression allowed me to be more ""clinical"" and make the right choices to see the outcome. I think it has changed many of my negative thinking patterns and I might try to do right thing from now on.The only critique is that I wish I could go back from the ending and be able to make other decisions to see how they played out. Perhaps a narrative tree could be supplied that allows me to go to a specific entry and play it differently. I think it might be beneficial to know about the different types of endings, too, and my progress for obtaining each one. Part of me like to be able learn from my choices and see where different choices take me.This game is definitely an A for me. I can't wait to see more stuff from Zoe Quinn and her associates.			"

												I understand all the down votes this game gets. This is not so much a game as experiencing someone's journal first hand. There isn't any real progression that is experienced, the images are incredibly tiny, and the musc isn't anything to write home about. In the end, this is not a good game. However, that doesn't mean that it is something to be avoided, ignored, or rejected. Mental illness is hard for an outsider to understand. It's even hard for people with a mental illness to understand in someone else, due to a large variety of factors, such as severity of symptoms, what those symptoms are, support network, etc. However, I think this game does a really good job of telling you exactly what it can be like. It doesn't let you experience it the same way you would first hand, but it gives you a foundation of what it can be like. I myself suffer from bipolar disorder. This means I go between depressive states, and manic states. I am of the type that my depressive states are the more problematic. I was able to relate directly to the experiences of the character you are to be portraying as I have been there. This game uses the mechanics as a metaphor well to tell you how sometimes an option is not an option just because you cannot get there. This is a game everyone can take away something from. I issue anyone reading this a challenge. Playing through this, I want you to stop at each option and ask yourself, ""What is the opposite of what I personally would do?"" Then I want you to choose that answer.			"

												This game is very realistic, in that it addresses the issues of depression and the experiences of people living with it. I found that is was accurate in depicting what it is like having depression, for me at least, and definitely reccommend it to anybody suffering from depression, knows someone who is, or simply wants to know more about it and what it is like living with it. The message of the game is a very powerful and positive one, and it's absolutely lifted my spirits and given me a bit more hope for my future.			"

												As a person who has dealt with depression, I must admit that this is far closer to reality than I expected, given how little effort went into this game.  That being said, it still looks like it was written by somebody with only a passing knowledge of actual, clinical depression, especially the part where everybody can tell you're depressed.  If it were that easy, there wouldn't be so many untreated casees of depression.  The fact that I could reproduce the entire game in html in a single weekend makes this whole thing insultingly simple.  Even if you don't buy the narrative that this game only got good reviews due to *ahem* inappropriate influence, this thing is like an art film.  It's horrendously boring and poorly made, with no real point, but everybody will proudly prostrate itself before this game, calling it 'bold' or 'artistic.'  It's neither.  It's lazy, and the same kind of people who write good reviews of this game are the ones people make fun of in sitcoms who call a work of art 'brilliant' only to find out it was made by cats running across the canvas with paint on their feet.In short, skip it.  It's lazy, boring, and overpriced.			"

												For a game that calls itself depression quest, I found the actual message of the game to be ""Dealing with antisocial issues"". The character (you and I) deals with the inability to speak with people and gets tired of social interactions in a manner more associated with introversy. I felt a genuine amount of effort in this visual novel (not so much a game at times, in that it limits your options) but it falls short at times. The limited options and the general feel of the game doesn't really capture depression as it does teenage angst. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who would want to understand the feelings of anyone with Depression.			"

												A game that you play as a man who is depressive. It's just texts and you need to make a choice after you read it. There are several options you can choose and your choices affects to your development. There are 3 sentences after every text except choiceless texts. These sentences describes how is your mood or how you are now. But there is something diffrent. Firts of all i realized that the choices which is at the most bottom ones make you feel more and more deppressive whenever you choose them. And the toppest choices (i mean every first choice) are closed at the start of the game but if you keep select the toppest choice your stress level decrease and first selections opens. For me, this system make the game easier. If developers mixed these selections it would be more complex and good. The other thing that i found weird is our character's girlfriend. The game says that our character has social anxiety, so how he made a girlfriend. Maybe we can say the girlfriend found our character, not our character found her. Then it's okay with me. There are at least two endings which depends on your choices. But as what i said the choices are ordered from best to worst. Anyways it is a good game to play to play. By the way there is no saving feature.			"

												This game resounded with my depression so perfectly. It is a beautiful game. After having my depression completley run my life for the longest time, the fact that parts of this game seemed to be exact quotes from my own personal thoughts was so validating. I really hope that this team will continue to make games of this caliber, and that are this in-depth and accurate when it comes to psychiatric practice. I am so sick of games that are unrealistic and that portray depression as something that you just ""get rid of."" I hope to see more games on steam like this one soon.			"

I'm surprised steam doesn't just take this down.if this game doesn't stop depression but increases it and they don't do anything about it.They need more employees instead of bots to greenlight stuff.imagine this game making you have to pay,you would be 10X more depressed and you lost some money you could have spent on a better game then just click and proceed.listen.. if your really depressed as hell.Talk to a friend,don't lie to them and say your okay,youll just add more pain to yourself or talk to a suicide hotline. Be safe gamers and don't play this so it eventually gets taken down.Thanks for reading gamers,Game On.			"

												I went through the whole story once and I must admit it felt quite close to actually being depressed. Having been depressed some time ago myself, I think it is a genuinely good effort by the developers, and a very important one for that matter. One of the problems with depression is the external feedback as it is generally one of rejection, specially for anyone going to therapy or under medication. Depression quest aims at trying to share the emotions and inner workings of this condition, making it more understandable to people that have not experience it. More than a game, this is an a guided text story in which situations unfold differently depending on the answers given in each situation.			"

												So me and 2 others played this game together, here are all our opinions:Friend 1: It was good.Friend 2: Listening to it was a nice expreience (I read aloud and we made the decision as a group)Me: I thought the game was very well played out, and even though it was kind of easy to reach a good ending, it kept me entertained for an hour. I would rate this game 9/10. Its only issue is that it kind of has low replayability, once you reach a good ending you can't really go again. Another nitpick is that it was depressing to play/read, but it really opened my eyes to what people with  depression face. If you have the spare time, make sure to download and play this game. "

												A chilling, thought provoking, and accurate representation of depression. This game is not enjoyable, however, that is not the purpose that it is supposed to serve. This is a narrative game with the purpose of making you think, and it succeeds in this regard. Personally, I believe that this is the most accurate representation of depression that I have found in media, and I am thankful for it. Ultimately, this is less of a game and more of an art piece.

												This is not a game, it's simply a 'choose your own adventure' novel... but the well timed drama involving Zoe Quinn just leaves nothing but a sour taste in the mouth, and I'm compelled to write something about that. It's obvious that the community didn't want this initially, otherwise it would've made the cut on Greenlight to begin with... Basically this release is the result of a long string of industry related sex-scandals, and what happens when a developer sells every single ounce of their moral integrity in order to make their dream a reality, and in the process involves themselves with people able to help her out with that dream, but also lacking any moral integrity themselves.The whole situation is just a huge mess, what we should all do as a responsible gaming community is just ignore all this nonsense, and just let horrible people be their horrible selves without having to suffer any bs. If only that were the case here...Some might say that this is merely the fault of the people involved, and shouldn't reflect too badly on the end result, but you have to remember, it was their choice to make all of this public, one idiot made the initial push to get the 'news' out there, and then the other idiot brings this to attention on her public social media accounts, so that we're all caught up in the drama and arguing our own points on the matter when in truth, the only idiots who have any say in the matter are Zoe Quinn, the alleged five dudes she was banging while still involved in a relationship, and the first idiot I mentioned who was her boyfriend.They are all stupid idiots who we shouldn't be enabling, but we are regardless of what we say about them at this point because the damage has already been done, they've gotten out of this exactly what they all needed and we're all suckers for giving it to them..So in conclusion, do not play this game if you just want to get a better understanding of the current drama, those people are not worth your time. If however you want to get a better understanding of how to use depression as a mechanic in something that almost resembles a video game, or want an idea of how to present a character with depression, then that should be the only time you consider downloading this.Do not let them use you.-B.Fitz			"

												I found this game while searching for games with overwhelmingly negative reviews. I wasnt really sure what to expect, but it was free and I had nothing to loose. My initial thoughts were ""wow who makes a game about depression"" and ""lol when my friends see me playing this♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; I ended up really liking this game tho. Not that depression is fun but the fact that your choices affected you in different ways. I saw a review that read something like ""this is kinda a slap in the face, I have depression"" and at first I kinda agreed but there was nothing that really bashed on depression or made light or fun of it. Not that the people who made this game are 100% right but the morale of the story is to fight depression instead of letting it keep you from living. Not many people would go and google ""what is depression and why should I be considerate of other people"". I think putting this in the form of a game like this can really help open the eyes of someone who otherwise wouldnt care. with that said this game is probably not for people with depression. I do not have depression and I understand that the developers of this game probably meant well however I can also understand how it might make someone with depression a little offended. to name a few things, the title of the game, the fact that it is portraied as a game, and scratched out choices etc. For me it wasnt really a game it was a novel with a branching plot about depression, and that is what it should be advertised as. NOT as a game and probably with a different title With that said I do not reccomend it because even though I liked it and feel as though they got there point across, the ""game"" is advertised as something it is not and for all intents and purposes I think whether you have depression or not this ""game"" should be avoided and pushed under the rug as on of those things that even though the devs meant well it was still a mistake.

												To be completely honest I hate reviews but I had to say something about this. This is so much more a story than a game that it feels strange to call it that. Seeing depression through the eyes of the depressed really helps you see how people who struggle with it every day see the world. It's a great story and honestly I'm in love already and would like to see so much more put into this (Alternate stories, endings etc...). I think that with more content in the game this could easily be something that most people would pay for. "

Still... a free game is a free game, even if I'm late to the party.Long story short; you have depression. Life sucks because your character feels trapped between a crappy job, an overachieving brother, unsympathetic parents and an antisocial outlook. The solution is just to keep doing stuff.Seriously, that's it. Don't stay in bed all day, try to be social, open up to people who understand, find excuses not to be a lazy♥♥♥♥♥♥ accept help (maybe don't take the meds?) and lie to your parents who wouldn't understand.2/10Dropped a mark for lack of proof reading			"

												You know, most games that arent entertanment to me, I dont really care for, but this game even thougth it is very boring, and someone inaccrute, I believe that this game was created to get the word out about depression. This is a very tuff game to play. Warning you that. Dont play unless you think you can handle it. Very ruff read. Its like doing a maze, and just running around in circles. This games objective was to get the word out about depression, thougth may not have been done in the proper way, the way this game leaves you feeling, allows you to get a glimpse at how someone that suffers from this feels, 20% of people suffer from some form of depression, the 80% need to help them, and make them feel acceppted and happy. Btw, this is not a how to get out of depression, if so, id be a bit insulted about that, its not easy for people to come out of depression, and its never a cut and dry situtation. If you suffer from depression, you should reach out to a professional, or if you're a teen, reach out to a parent and/or teacher, that can help you contact a professional. This game, is designed, for a goal, and I believe it is impossible to describe depression, and that this is the best attempt/outreach about depression.			"

												As much as I can recognise some of the situations and reactions in this title, I can't help but feel that this is more of a way for the author to cope than to let others understad. Reading through it once won't take you long so you might as well since some choices actually were striking. If the subject matter and the emotions are interesting you shouldn't bother with this, though. There are plenty of great books out there, read one of those. And no, you don't need a multiple choice type fiction game to drive home the point that depression cancels out your ability to make choices. Its only real quality is handling a subject that isn't handled often, really. Had it been a more common subject no one would have cared about this level writing / decision making.			"

												Wow, one of the only places on the net where this can be discussed without censorship. Praise Gaben!To Zoe.The Game? The scandal brought me here with every intention on leaving a troll review but having played it and with 15 years experience with depression myself, it's far from perfect but nails, at least in part, what the initial feelings and thoughts are at the onset of depression. I'd give it a 7/10, a taste of depression but a rather superficial one but also taking into account something like this couldn't be too realistic/lengthy without being too much for most. A decent first effort.The Scandal? I'll try to be brief. You are NOT THE VICTIM in this. Your ex who's health you risked, is a victim. He wrote a blog. If it was me? I would've sent a couple of particulary violent female friends of mine to show you the error of your ways, it wouldn't be pretty. The wife of the boss you slept with, she's a victim. I hope she files for divorce and leaves with half his♥♥♥♥♥♥ YAY FEMINISM! Hard to call yourself a feminist without sounding like a hypocrite after that btw.Your friends are bobble headed ""yes"" people, they're not very good friends. REAL friends call you out on your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, they don't defend it. I believe you have some kind of personality disorder, they are feeding it. A good number of those that are trolling you may be coming from misogynism, but it's impossible to see you as the victim.

												Don't just say, ""I hate the dev,Blah Blah,No Gameplay"" Even in the game, [if you read it] they state it is meant to be choose your own adventure game. It is meant for people who will read the dialog. Heck, I hated cutscenes and to much dialog in games but this changed it. When I see people get mad because of this game because of the dev, that is like saying that you can't listen to Elvis because of his devilish hips; it makes no sense. The onely problem i have with the game is only the length, and how in the game you never carry out planned actions!

												It certainly isn't an amazing piece of engineering genius; it's basically a set of hyperlinks. I played for 0.3 hours and won, which is my biggest qualm about it. The choices in the text were obvious:-""Tell GF you love her"" or ""Tell GF you hate her""-""Talk to brother"" or ""sit and do nothing""-""See therapist about depression"" or ""don't see therapist about depression""-""Take cat to cure depression"" or ""I hate cats""Thing is, the game starts off saying that you're depressed, so of course you're going to want to fix it. You can't explicitly say ""YOU ARE CURRENTLY DEPRESSED"" and expect someone to take the depressing route. Say something like ""You're tired and it doesn't sound like you'd have fun drinking with your coworkers"" or ""Your girlfriend doesn't sound like she's being honest"", stuff like that.Bonus point for the subplot where IM friend gets cheated on. It's like it's based on real life or something. Zing.2/5, wouldn't play again; would recommend others try once while still free. I really hope no one paid money for this.			"

												There are a lot of things wrong with depression quest. How the game tells it's story is though text based narrative and player ""choices"". Unfortunately as the developer clearly have a set story they want to tell none of the choices feel like they matter. An argument could be made that this is exactly how individuals suffering from clinical depression feel. The problem is that the player does not feel this emotion so much as it is forced upon them. The game feels clumsy and heavy handed as a result.Why the recommendation then? This game does do soemthing right in that, even though the excecution is far from perfect, it tries to tacle a topic not dealt with in many games: depression. The aspect of feeling closed in is indicative of the condition and comes through in spades in narration portions. It's free, which is also a plus. Finally the recommendation comes in hopes of more developers wading into difficult topics within the human condition to bring players more interactive experiences worth having.			"

												i give it a lukewarm recommendation, since the only thing i spent on it was time it was certainly worth what i paid. i guess the main reason my opinion isn't very high is that it's not much of a game, interesting conceptiual piece to be sure, and honestly seems well researched.the problem is in the exposition. it's all exposition. i think a message just as powerful could have been delivered with a lot less fluff, given that i got a good 'ending' (i know the game doesn't really end) by only reading the first and last paragraphs of every page. it could use a little more show and a little less tell i guessi'd give it 6/10 on the standard game scale, an 8/10 on the indie scale, and a 9/10 on the art scale. worth playing, but receiving massive penalties for the low production value on the 'game' aspects, but the portrayal of depressive mentality was good enough to compensate on a concept level.the caveat to the portrayal is that the main character is kinda boring, the same way mario is, to be relatable to anyone they are a 20 something disappointed with life, with a disappointing job, disappointing love life, and a 'project' which gets no name. sure, i can relate to that, but it doesn't make me actually invest myself in the game because i'm not doing the work for you, i want you to make me want to get invested in the character, not just bait my own narcissism into making me preserve my own avatar's life			"

												This game isn't fun, but it isn't boring. It's not for people who seek to play fast-paced games, it's for people who seek a different experience, a different point of view. I really like this game, even though nothing actually bad happened it left an uneasy feeling, there were parts I could relate to the main character, and it shows you how much we underestimate ourselves without knowing it. Most people will answer the ""best"" answers and not honestly, but if you want to get full experience don't put the main character as a third person, BE the main character.This truly is art.			"

Technically, this game could be pulled off entirely on a website with an appropriate hyperlink scheme. Based on other comments and reviews that I've read, the content is personal enough that people can relate, and it seems the authors conformed to modern thinking with regard to psychological treatment in an attempt to not mislead anyone who may be suffering from depression (you don't reject taking medication and go on a caribbean cruise meeting the guy/gal of your dreams, for example, or anything fancifully romantic). It's a game. It's worth playing just to experience what the authors see as the progression of life choices and how they might affect someone internally.			"

I understand that the atmosphere is supposed to be oppressive and, well, depressing  - and the game has that down to a T. However, there's no excuse for a game or interactive experience to be so UNENGAGING. This game made me want to shut it off after three pages of text, it felt like a chore, I felt like I was playing it for the game and not for myself. Nothing made me curious about what was going to happen next, and nothing made me want to continue. Worse still, it misses the essential trouble of depression: there isn't an escape. Escape from this boring e-book is always two clicks away! I've played games, read books, listened to music, and watched films that have made me absolutely miserable, but I've always been compelled to continue 'til the end.

												I tried to like this game, but I feel like it misses the point of making an interacting [non]fiction. I understand that the atmosphere is supposed to be oppressive and, well, depressing  - and the game has that down to a T. However, there's no excuse for a game or interactive experience to be so UNENGAGING. This game made me want to shut it off after three pages of text, it felt like a chore, I felt like I was playing it for the game and not for myself. Nothing made me curious about what was going to happen next, and nothing made me want to continue. Worse still, it misses the essential trouble of depression: there isn't an escape. Escape from this boring e-book is always two clicks away! I've played games, read books, listened to music, and watched films that have made me absolutely miserable, but I've always been compelled to continue 'til the end. This game had me back on my desktop in half an hour.			"

												Don't just say, ""I hate the dev,Blah Blah,No Gameplay"" Even in the game, [if you read it] they state it is meant to be choose your own adventure game. It is meant for people who will read the dialog. Heck, I hated cutscenes and to much dialog in games but this changed it. When I see people get mad because of this game because of the dev, that is like saying that you can't listen to Elvis because of his devilish hips; it makes no sense. The onely problem i have with the game is only the length, and how in the game you never carry out planned actions! SPOILER ALERT:In one path of the game you talk about meeting a therapist, I said Ok, but nothing HAPPENED!!!!!! Grrrrrrr!!!Aside from that it was great!			"

												It certainly isn't an amazing piece of engineering genius; it's basically a set of hyperlinks. I played for 0.3 hours and won, which is my biggest qualm about it. The choices in the text were obvious:-""Tell GF you love her"" or ""Tell GF you hate her""-""Talk to brother"" or ""sit and do nothing""-""See therapist about depression"" or ""don't see therapist about depression""-""Take cat to cure depression"" or ""I hate cats""Thing is, the game starts off saying that you're depressed, so of course you're going to want to fix it. You can't explicitly say ""YOU ARE CURRENTLY DEPRESSED"" and expect someone to take the depressing route. Say something like ""You're tired and it doesn't sound like you'd have fun drinking with your coworkers"" or ""Your girlfriend doesn't sound like she's being honest"", stuff like that.Bonus point for the subplot where IM friend gets cheated on. It's like it's based on real life or something. Zing.2/5, wouldn't play again; would recommend others try once while still free. I really hope no one paid money for this.			"

												Depression Quest isn't that bad, really. I think it stands up on its own really well. I've held judgment of it because I never bothered to install it, but taking the leap to click play is one I'm glad I took. While the story itself is highly cliche and likes to play into a very simple monologue, it does give you a feeling of uncertainty as to what will happen with the decisions you make and what decision you will have to make next. As someone who suffers from clinical depression, I did find that it was somewhat accurate in the descriptions of how it feels to be depressed, to go to a therapist, and be on various medications to ""cure"" yourself. Regardless of the controversy behind the creator of the game, Depression Quest does a decent job of telling a story about a real life issue. Whether or not one can classify this as a ""game"" is a completely different topic, but it is a rather interesting way to engage an audience through a different medium than ones that are more commonly used (like speeches, books, etc.). In my mind, there's no difference between Depression Quest and visual novels, because neither is focused on the typical aspects of a video game like graphics, gameplay, or performance. Rather, it wants you to invest your time much like you would with reading a novel. It is only a matter of what medium Quinn uses to convey the story.Overall, you shouldn't expect much out of this title. It took me exactly 52 minutes to complete the story. However, you shouldn't be expecting a whitewash, cut-and-paste tale about how depression is bad and how it can affect you. If you do choose to install Depression Quest, I would recommend you to not go in expecting a triple A-class story, but you also should not be expecting a narrative that wants you to hold pity for the protagonist. I would rate the overall experience of Depression Quest a decent 6 out of 10. The story is flat in some parts, and many other parts seem to be shoehorned in for no apparent reason; however, the writing is eloquent enough for you to hold interest long enough to complete the story. For those reasons, I recommend the product.			"

It is very accurate in it's portayal of depression, and I would like to thank the developers for making this. It may not be a fun game to play, but I now hold this in my top ten games to recomend. It realy has touched me to see that others know how this condition works and how we feel when we get depressed. I'm tearing up right now... So please if you have any doubts about playing this, just play it, and please support the developer, this is a gift.			"

												There are a lot of things wrong with depression quest. How the game tells it's story is though text based narrative and player ""choices"". Unfortunately as the developer clearly have a set story they want to tell none of the choices feel like they matter. An argument could be made that this is exactly how individuals suffering from clinical depression feel. The problem is that the player does not feel this emotion so much as it is forced upon them. The game feels clumsy and heavy handed as a result.Why the recommendation then? This game does do soemthing right in that, even though the excecution is far from perfect, it tries to tacle a topic not dealt with in many games: depression. The aspect of feeling closed in is indicative of the condition and comes through in spades in narration portions. It's free, which is also a plus. Finally the recommendation comes in hopes of more developers wading into difficult topics within the human condition to bring players more interactive experiences worth having.			"

												A very accurate portrayal of Depression.  While it is debatable whether this can be considered a game, it does it's job well.  You read through a story describing the life of someone suffering from depression, life seems ok at first, they have a decent job, friends and a life partner. But the whole point of this 'game' is that ANYONE can suffer from depression.   You're are given multiple choices to progress, with the option someone without depression could do crossed out, such as:  You're feeling heavy from the stress of how far behind you are on your work, the thought of doing it makes your breathing short and heart heavy. Normally, you would just bunker down and do the work but, for someone suffering from Depression it just isnt an option so you have to make do with what little options are left.   This 'game' isnt for everyone and it is not for fun.  It is here to give others that do not suffer from depression, an insight into what it is really like and to give true understand of how hard it can truly be.			"

I really like this game, even though nothing actually bad happened it left an uneasy feeling, there were parts I could relate to the main character, and it shows you how much we underestimate ourselves without knowing it. Most people will answer the ""best"" answers and not honestly, but if you want to get full experience don't put the main character as a third person, BE the main character.This truly is art.			"

												I'm not really certain what to say about this game. . .It certainly isn't enjoyable.  That's not to say that it's bad.  Far from it.  The game just has a certain appeal that I think we're only used to finding in other types of art; ideas and feelings that are uncomfortable to confront.  This was one of those games that wasn't easy for me to get through, especially considering the past two years have been a maelstrom of major depressive bouts.  Fair warning that there are a lot of self indulgent comparisons here that might get tiresome to read, but I'm going to be blatant in my honesty.This is the most accurate depiction of depression that I've ever witnessed in any type of art form.  It's often glorified in commercials and television as a fast burning sadness that will immediately end in suicide.  My friends, the road to hell doesn't smell like sulfur, and it's not painted in varying intensities of reds.  This road drones on endlessly, painted in grays and browns with a bleached white sky overhead promising a storm that never comes.  That's what depression is really like, and this game brilliantly depicts the overwhelming nothingness that silently attempts to destroy everything that you've ever loved.(This should really be referred to as a depression simulator.)Although I took a little issue with the often droning nature of the writing (Stemming from a style choice. . .perhaps?), I appreciate the effort that was taken in creation.  You can tell that the fruits of the end product were made from a labor of love.  Everything about this title screams at the top of its lungs why we need to support Indie developers more and more in the coming years.  These experimental pieces of gaming provide a strange kind of joy and a level of empathy that I don't often find in games where I stalk random industrial corridoors, blowing every single living creature away that opposes my color coordinated team.  Combined with the fact that this title is available for the incredibly low, low price of FREE, you've got yourself a winner.Play/Experience it.  Now.			"

												While this game is very intense, and person in it's writing, and amazingly written at that, I only recommend it to those who are strong of heart and will. I nearly cried playing this game, it gave me such an intense feeling of sadness. I got a fairly good outcome, with life looking well ahead for me, and I was glad for this. But the struggles in the game it's self were simply so saddening, and deeply real that it hurt to even read them. Wonderful game, but honestly... It's a bit scary how realistic it is.			"

												really good game, each decision impacts the next choices and you can go back and change your decision - unlike a lot of choice-based games. it was mainly words, which while at first dissuades from the game, if you take time to read everything and get involved with the story, it is really fabulous. while it is kind of obvious what choice does what, the game gives you a really great glimpse of what it's like to dreading social interactions and how people don't understand (and the mother's attitude towards depression is seriously what I get a lot, so that's comforting). overally, short (~20) playthrough, but its replayability is pretty good, it's fun to go through and choose different decisions and seeing what new outcomes there are.

												Most of the time, we think of video games as ""fun"". They often have stories, sometimes involved and emotional stories, but in general video games are generally escapism or competition of one form or another. Depression Quest, on the other hand, admits up front that it is *not* ""fun"". It's an attempt to communicate how depression feels and impacts someone's life, and I believe that it succeeds admirably in that.The game itself is short -- a little over an hour, depending on your reading speed -- but in that time it puts you in the shoes of someone who is dealing with depression. The story is told in text, with branching dialog trees at various points, similar to ""Choose your own adventure"" books or other interactive fiction. The clever thing they do at various points is to list various options, but then remove them. In most games that feature branching dialog, the good/bad/snarky options are generally very clear; BioWare is (in)famous for this. In Depression Quest, too, there are clear ""right"" choices and answers, and the game will show them to you, but they may be crossed out and unavailable based on your mental state. This simple mechanic is brilliant, as it accurately models how depression can feel; you know what the ""right"" thing to do is, but you just can't seem to do it.If you want to know more about how depression feels, or if you're trying to understand or help someone who may be dealing with depression, this game is well worth your time.

												Its a good text based game that pretty accurately describes depression. To be honest, its not a game, its delving into someone life. An unpleasant life at that. It raises awareness, which is exactly what it was intended to do and its understandably difficult to make a game about depression. I really hope they keep working on it, to make it more than a story with different endings and good intentions. I'd love to see a Depression Quest 2. If they do make it 1st/3rd person they could immerse you and really make you feel it. Have you fight the depression mentally, and cope and fight nightmares. At least thats the parts of my depression I would like represented, to show just how emotionally exhausting it is. Even though depressed people normally seem dull and boring as they try to cope, boy, you should see, feel, the fight in their heads and hearts. Feel what its like to break down completely. This is not a game for depressed people. It is a game by depressed people to help others understand what its like.			"

												Although this isn't the COD games that people seem to want more and more of, this was such a simple way of showing depression.I really had no idea what people with actual depression went through, yeah there are days that I drag my feet, but this game changed my idea on ""A bad day"" so give it a try, its free, small, and simple.Try it.

												Playing the Depression quest isn't going to be a riveting experience, but that's not the point of the game.  It's meant to teach you how people who suffer from depression think and might react to the world.  It's a text based adventure and the choices given to you might seem like the best choice, but as it turns out you won't really know unless you try out every choice and you can see the best choice but it's crossed out and unable to be chosen because depression makes choices that seem so easy unbelievably difficult.  Don't let your decision to play this game be based upon someone saying it isn't a game or the horrible news about the developer.  It's a game meant to educate you and it does a great job.			"

												I'm going to recommend this game, although barely.  I'll break it down into pros and cons:Pros:This game does a fairly good job of putting the player into the shoes and mind of someone with clinical depression.  A lot of the descriptions in this game hit home for me.  Although I disliked the characters at first, they started to grow on me over time.  Cons:The game makes it WAY too easy to make the right choices.  The biggest problem with depression is that it robs the sufferer of the motivation or ability to make good decisions.  On my first playthrough, I ended up fixing pretty much all of the main character's problems.  Yes, there are attempts to try and describe the precarious mental state and constant danger of backsliding, but it's just too easy to click on the equivalent of ""suck it up and do the hard thing"" every single time.Also, the structure of this game just isn't very engaging.  It's basically a choose-your-own-adventure story, with the added mechanic that the character's current level of depression may lock out certain choices.If you want a game that truly captures the hopelessness of deep depression, I can't recommend ""Actual Sunlight"" highly enough.

												I don't really know how to describe this game. I'll start with the obvious critisisms; The piano is grating, It's like someone is screaming through the head phones ""THIS IS SAD WOW LIKE LOOK HOW SAD THIS IS ISN'T THIS REALLY JUST GLUM?"", I found myself wanting to hit mute. However, little touches in the sound design were nice, like the everyday household sounds and crackling. The writing felt a bit forced too, though I appreciate the efforts it made. The walls of text were a bit much, I understand it's not something to play 'for fun' but the Author's prose was drab and came in long slathered monologues.I WOULD recomend this game, I don't think it hits the mark so squarely but it's unique enough and it's free, besides it only takes ten minutes in the least to get through. At least give it a try, understanding depression is important. You know someone who is depressed regardless of who you are, and games like this do good in the barriers they break down.			"

												really good game, each decision impacts the next choices and you can go back and change your decision - unlike a lot of choice-based games. it was mainly words, which while at first dissuades from the game, if you take time to read everything and get involved with the story, it is really fabulous. while it is kind of obvious what choice does what, the game gives you a really great glimpse of what it's like to dreading social interactions and how people don't understand (and the mother's attitude towards depression is seriously what I get a lot, so that's comforting). overally, short (~20) playthrough, but its replayability is pretty good, it's fun to go through and choose different decisions and seeing what new outcomes there are.

												Most of the time, we think of video games as ""fun"". They often have stories, sometimes involved and emotional stories, but in general video games are generally escapism or competition of one form or another. Depression Quest, on the other hand, admits up front that it is *not* ""fun"". It's an attempt to communicate how depression feels and impacts someone's life, and I believe that it succeeds admirably in that.The game itself is short -- a little over an hour, depending on your reading speed -- but in that time it puts you in the shoes of someone who is dealing with depression. The story is told in text, with branching dialog trees at various points, similar to ""Choose your own adventure"" books or other interactive fiction. The clever thing they do at various points is to list various options, but then remove them. In most games that feature branching dialog, the good/bad/snarky options are generally very clear; BioWare is (in)famous for this. In Depression Quest, too, there are clear ""right"" choices and answers, and the game will show them to you, but they may be crossed out and unavailable based on your mental state. This simple mechanic is brilliant, as it accurately models how depression can feel; you know what the ""right"" thing to do is, but you just can't seem to do it.If you want to know more about how depression feels, or if you're trying to understand or help someone who may be dealing with depression, this game is well worth your time.

												This game shows exactly what depression is. Such an amazing and well written script as well. I like how some options are crossed out in red and as annoying it is, it's the truth you really can't do everything you want to due to depression and anxiety. I also really love how it tells you how you're doing at the bottom, really makes the whole situation clear. While this game might make you feel down, I really do recommend it because it's going to make you feel happy as if you were the narrator when you see how you've improved your life. I'd love to see more of these type of games.			"

												This is essentially a choose your path story. Ok, so not really a game... but a piece of interactive fiction. There is a lot of text to read, at least the first play through. You are presented with a variety of options, but choosing some may cause later actions to be crossed off. This is interesting, but it sucks a lot of interactivity out. I also don't like the medicate moral that I think this story is pushing. I also think that it provides an incredibly narrow portrait of depression. I respect that, because it doesn't need to. It's the portrait of a single static character rather than a dynamic one that morphs around the player.  I think that using a more dynamic character scheme would have increased replayability, however, I'm not going to count that against the game. The problem lies in the way it quickly degrades into cynically clicking the remaining available options. After the first 2-4 reads, you realize that very little changes with each play through except the ending. The ending only changes depending on choices. There is nothing to encourage a player to see all the endings or to try new combinations. Maybe there isn't supposed to be. I don't know.There are some spelling and grammar issues, but having been an avid interactive fiction player I've noticed that that isn't uncommon. I note this because a lot of reviewers bring it up. Sure, they could update it with better spelling and grammar. Or they could move on to another project. Most choose that latter and it's not a bad choice. Most interactive fiction isn't professional, but made free to play by hobbyists for hobbyists. Does the game achieve the goal of creating the atmosphere or portraying a singular portrait of depression? I'd say yes. Others might and do disagree. I wouldn't say it is the best at portraying depression. Calunio's Depression is probably the best representation I've seen. A major difference is perhaps that this game gives us a character that is incredibly human. We see her as human and as another individual entity, but we achieve only the closeness of an onlooker. Calunio's Depression works by giving us a shell of character and starts with conception. In black and white, the player must slowly and painfully grind to walk a short jaunt to the boss. You win, but he curses you so that with every new screen you arrive, you lose experience. Every new scene causes an exponentially greater experience loss. Meanwhile, you are questioned on the nature of happiness, and no matter how hard you attempt to level, you are never the strongest. Before you lies a tower that seems impossible to climb, a final challenge. Can you reach the end before your curse overwhelms you? Depression Quest may portray a story of a depressed lady, but Calunio's Depression gives out a depressing atmosphere drags you into it (for good or ill.) The powerlessness felt between these to games are incredibly different in both nature and magnitude. At the end, I'd merely say Depression Quest is heavily flawed. I wouldn't recommend it to most people I know. It is free though, so maybe try it sometime. Choose for yourself.			"

												So, first off, this isn't a game. Not by any definition. I have seen better text based games online which were 10 times better.I recommend playing ""Coming out simulator 2014"", a flash game you can find online if you want to play a similar game that's infanitely better, trust me, there is nothing of substance here, do not waste your time with this. It attempts to bring a legitimate issue to light but doesn't try and make it engageing at all, the game will just be you scrolling and picking whatever choice sound good to you. The aformentioned flash game actually makes you care about the protagonist and his problems, play that game to understand what i mean by an engaging game that brings light to a legitimate issue.0/10, honest review.Now many of you know about FEZ and it's dev. The dev behind this game is worse, because the game she released isn't even good. She has used this game for publicity to make money VIA patreon. To loosely describe her, she is a person that uses her gender to gain pity from white knights and feminists, causing a group of people WHO LEGITIMATELY HAVE DEPRESSION to be flamed by the aformentioned white knights.

												I'm disappointed in this 'game'. If I wanted to know what a person feels when they're living with depression, I would ask as I have several times before. The concept is somewhat interesting, but the story is just bland; an overall waste of my time. [I don't need flashing lights, loud noises, mainstream music or gunfights to get my attention, much less entertain me, just wanted to throw that out there.] I know the crossed out options for making things better is an attempt to show people without depression how depressed people (may) feel, but it gets tiring when after a while the main characer does just about nothing to actually help themself. The character is over-analytical, and I got the feeling ever so often that they didn't want hope, that they didn't care for a chance to get better. Even if that's what depression can do to a person, a simple attempt to feel better about themself or their position in life should at least be an option, even if the end result is no change for the character. Whether or not the people who made this game wanted an immersive feeling to be had by those playing it, text and a few photos does nothing to grab my interest. Illustrations and a change in the characters' appearances (from third person or the main character's point of view) would have made this much more interesting of an experience. Instead I am stuck watching a person feel sorry for themself. This is not what a game is for. There has to be a goal, a reward or have rising action, a climax and a resolution - a reason to go on, and I see none after clicking 'next' 15 times. The options to make things 'progress' or make things better in this story sound like the kind of things someone would THINK a depressed person would do. If it means anything to Isaac, the repetative piano music kinda made me want to kill myself. I'm not sure if that's what was being aimed for, but man, bad music is one of my dozens of triggers - including triggers - and got me more into the game, but still not very much.I give this an overall 2/10 - the 2 is me being generous, and I'm not sure if I should be.

												It's an interesting experiment but I'm not sure it achieves what it sets out for. In most cases it nicely describes the thoughts and moods of a depressed person but I feel like it's too simple. For someone that struggles with the illness it may seem oversimplified and ""too easy"" to get out of the severely depressed state in the game... you know what option you need to click (even when the ones naturally available for healthy people are crossed out, which is a nice touch) to possibly better your situation but for someone depressed it's not this clear. Also, although the creators do note this at the beginning, this particular character is in a very good environment (even if their job is not satisfying) because basically everyone supports them eventually and they can affort treatment and medication. So I'm not sure the game succeeds in what it tries to do. The idea is not bad and some of the descriptions are on point but the gameplay and the options lack in representing the difficulties and intricacies of the subject... which would be the reason to make a ""game"" such as this in the first place. I do recommend it if you are interested in the topic but don't expect too much from it.			"

The game does a pretty good job of showing what simply being medicated can do for a person experiencing depression. It doesn't cure depression by any means, but it helps a lot.

												Honestly, I have been dealing with chronic depression for a good amount of my life. The game in and of itself attempted to relate to some and much of the generic issues brought up within a ""depressed"" person's life and they were quite relatable, but at some points it seems quite unrealistic and blunt. It wasn't a bad experience per say, but it feels as if the game shoe horns you into choosing the generic and or bad choice. It did well locking away the freedoms of choice one would have when experiencing depression and I appreciate that, but at times I was just bored and unimmersed with how it portrays it. Also the generic melancholy music and static felt like it was trying too hard to set the mood in my opinion. I ended up succeeding in game possibly getting a good ending, but i still didn't feel all too satisfied. Not a bad game, nor am I going into the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ background of it and its developer, but eh it wasn't as heavy as some people would expect it to be. It's worth like 1 playthru at best, do with it what you will.			"

												Depression Quest is extremely realistic. I played through answering questions as if I was actually dealing with those situations. And, as someone who has dealt with depression all her life, I found that my answers reflected how I've actually felt before. As a result, I became profoundly depressed, and that limited what I could choose for answers. That aspect is especially realistic. When you are truly depressed, your mind can go blank and you lose the will to do things. Beautiful, realistic game. If you don't have depression, but want to know what those who do have it are going through, play this game. It's a fantastic example and can really give you an insight you didn't know you needed.

												Depression Quest is a very well thought out and realistic game. Many, if not all, of the parts of this story are completely relatable. The way the protagonist thinks and acts are ways that i would in this situation as well. In every group of options, I was never forced to answer one way or the other. One answer just seemed to stand out because it is exactly the way i would react in a situation like that. The protagonist's emotions are well spoken and it is easy to see what he is going through and how it is effecting his life. I am very empathetic for this main character. Overall this game is really good, if you like being spoken to on a personal level.			"

												Through what this game sets out to do in terms of goals, I feel that it accomplishes it well enough. It does give away for those who don't have depression to receive a sense of what it is like for those who do. I can say what I have played it has made what it wants to portray clear enough, through its descriptions of situations, relaying what the protagonist is feeling to the player and making the decisions fit with the narrative. In that way, the game is recommended to those who want to know what it's like to have depression, but it offers very little aside from that.			"

												The game really does touch on the subject of depression very well. It gives you that feeling down in your stomach when the world is falling apart. It makes you think about your own life. After playing this game my heart feels heavy and that is probably a side effect of playing a game like this. The story felt real as if you could see it all play out. It made you think about your own emotions as well as the character's. If you feel like you made a bad decision you can feel the reprocutions of it. This game really does hit you hard and I don't recommend playing it if you have depression.			"

												It isn't so much a game as it is a choose your own path story. It does give a pretty good insight to someone with anxiety and depression, but it could be triggering. I believe it warns you about that.If you're interested in psyche or an alternate mindset to maybe get to understand yourself or a loved one better this is the experience for you.			"

												From what I've seen so far, Depression Quest seems to represent depression quite accurately--it feels inescapable, hopeless, and almost impossible to communicate to other people without feeling like a burden. It has ups and downs, and no matter how hard you try, there's no way out. As far as the writing goes, it goes. It's simple and effective language that says what needs to be said. No poetry or anything like that--none needed.Choices are (sometimes humorously) limiting based on how a depressed person thinks and feels, which is a good method of teaching players about that kind of lifestyle.Overall, good depiction of depression, nice writing, nice mechanics. Don't care about the background development or subsequent controversy--this is actually seems like a decent game.			"

												A brief but true experience, didn't cost me a dime, and placed me in an educational and passionate perspective that was relatable to my own down times. Well written, humanitarian in intent, and innovative to the approach of the classic choose-your-own adventure. This game not only embodies storytelling in an interactive space to give the medium justice as art, but speaks compassionately about a human issue. I feel this has raised the bar for gaming.			"

												The game is small, I will throw that out there immediately. Also note, however, that it is free.The game is very well scripted, the music fits very well, and was a good 20-minute time passer. I actually felt like the character I played as, and couldn't recommend this game more as a small passing of time. I couldn't really see this as costing money purely looking at it's size, but commend the creator on a short emotional journey I won't forget anytime soon. It runs very smoothly, as is to be expected from an interactive fiction. If I had any real money to my name, I would throw some money at the developer to try and get a book written. The detail in the text is phenominal, and really pulls you in to make you feel the main character's emotions. If I had to rate the game, considering the price, genre, and size, I give it a 9/10, could've been a bit bigger being my only complaint.So when you have a good half hour, try this game. You won't regret it.			"

												This Game was amazing, i like how u can see how many options there are for each situation and depending on your level of depression you can on select a stark few. There are very focused aspects about procrastionation and how despite wanting to do work your mind trails off to Youtube or Tumbler.My only problem with this game is that most of the time, having a girlfriend is the most overpowered aspect of your protagonist that helps get your person out of depression.I've only played thorugh this once, but from it i simply chose options that made our relation ship open and honest so that she can help with the depression. Im not sure if shell be helpful for each playthorugh but from this, it felt a bit too easy.What if you dont have a Girlfriend and your numerous attempts and rejections account towards your depression?What if this, along with your inability to open up to family [in my playthorough family sucks], spirals you further into depression so that when your friends offer an ear, you decline because if you cant even tell your parents, who can you trust?I know that for me personally i deal with alot of problems with finding a significant other and it hurts alot, but because my family and friends encourage me to open up with them i dont feel bad about not having one. But honestly if you're having a serious depression crisis, would you be willing to accept any help unless you have someone who you can depend on completly because you love them? That's what a relationship offers you, so unless you have REALLY persistent friends or family, then youll be stuck.It would be an AMAZING expansion to have a hardcore difficutly [what is this Halo? YOU CASUAL!] where you dont have a girlfrined [or even better you just lost her], your parents are oblivious to your depression, no therapist, and your friends arent persistent to give you help. Digging yourself out of this would be a real challenge.Also, im not sure if this is implimented, but a few choices could also have a few perma perks or hinderences like how getting a cat adds the option of playing with it. Such as if you try to down the cup of whisky to ""loosen up"" for your girlfriend, you might develop alcoholism. Or if you Chose not to do work and not get motivation to continue working, you might be without a job and furthermore, without a place to live O.O idk, something i just thought about.9.5/10 [cuz if felt a bit short but definalty a good read for a hour]			"

												Over all, this game creates a pretty accurate depiction of the kind of depression that I myself have faced; a state where literally nothing seems to help you get better, no matter what you do. The game does a pretty good job of showing what simply being medicated can do for a person experiencing depression. It doesn't cure depression by any means, but it helps a lot. The element of having some options crossed as unaccessable is a good reperesentation of wanting to do things but being unable to do them.			"

												Honestly, I have been dealing with chronic depression for a good amount of my life. The game in and of itself attempted to relate to some and much of the generic issues brought up within a ""depressed"" person's life and they were quite relatable, but at some points it seems quite unrealistic and blunt. It wasn't a bad experience per say, but it feels as if the game shoe horns you into choosing the generic and or bad choice. It did well locking away the freedoms of choice one would have when experiencing depression and I appreciate that, but at times I was just bored and unimmersed with how it portrays it. Also the generic melancholy music and static felt like it was trying too hard to set the mood in my opinion. I ended up succeeding in game possibly getting a good ending, but i still didn't feel all too satisfied. Not a bad game, nor am I going into the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ background of it and its developer, but eh it wasn't as heavy as some people would expect it to be. It's worth like 1 playthru at best, do with it what you will.			"

												Depression Quest is extremely realistic. I played through answering questions as if I was actually dealing with those situations. And, as someone who has dealt with depression all her life, I found that my answers reflected how I've actually felt before. As a result, I became profoundly depressed, and that limited what I could choose for answers. That aspect is especially realistic. When you are truly depressed, your mind can go blank and you lose the will to do things. Beautiful, realistic game. If you don't have depression, but want to know what those who do have it are going through, play this game. It's a fantastic example and can really give you an insight you didn't know you needed.

												Depression Quest is a very well thought out and realistic game. Many, if not all, of the parts of this story are completely relatable. The way the protagonist thinks and acts are ways that i would in this situation as well. In every group of options, I was never forced to answer one way or the other. One answer just seemed to stand out because it is exactly the way i would react in a situation like that. The protagonist's emotions are well spoken and it is easy to see what he is going through and how it is effecting his life. I am very empathetic for this main character.

												Boring as can be. Mad Lib is more entertaining than this. I've seen more inivative and entertaining games made by one person. Thank god this was free because this is the worst game I have ever played, and I played Alone in the Dark: Inferno and Amy, and I PAYED for those. Please save yourself the trouble and play anything else, ANYTHING beats this. I'd rather play Superman 64 and Sonic '06.			"

												An honest portrayal of an experience of depression. Of course, any individuals experience will be different, but I've found many things relatable. The unchoosable-choices I felt were an interesting way to illustrate how debilitating depression can be -- indeed, honestly, sometimes, some of us really, trully cannot pick up the phone! Honestly, I think it does well what is says on the box. I found it worth my time.			"

												I actually didn't think the game would be good, but being I've had depression in the past I thought I would try it out, and go through the things that I had to when I had it, and I beat the 'game' XD very nice storyline and all, and would totally recommend to a friend that wanted to play this sort of thing.

												Now this thing is quite a terrible one for these reasons.1) The writing on this thing is HORRIBLE2) The choices that are given in this game are HORRIBLE.3) There are very few choices in this thing, and the endings suck; Suicide, endless depressin, or an unfinished ending.4) This thing is VERY pretencious.5) The creators of this thing are censoring negative reviews of this game6) This game was made to combat depression, while giving us NOT DEPRESSION, but LAZYNESS.7) Depression is a very serious issue however the thing removes all options of letting your charecter get help untill halfway through the ""story"".8) This thing's story is probably the most pretencious piece of trash that I have ever had the displeasure of reading.9) This Thing robbed me of 22 minutes, and I completed the game twice.10) This THING does not deserve to be on steam or even be called a Game.11) The thing is free, and it is still a ripp-off and now I am having a VERY hardtime removing it from my computer.12) You are always presented with the Best choice in the story, but are never allowed to select them.13) This has been called ART, no it is not art is is an abomination amongst the gaming community.14) All this is is plain White background, text, bad story, bad decisions, and music from a royalty free websiteTL;DR:This isn't worth your time, if you are depressed or are thinking suicidal thoughts, SEEK HELP.All this is is plain White background, text, bad story, bad decisions, and music from a royalty free website.

												I played this game during my psychiatry placement at med school to see how it corresponded with our teaching on depression, as well as to compare it to interviews I had seen and conducted with diagnosed depressive patients.This game is spot on in accurately depicting depression, as well as the stigma of mental illness. I have recommended it to my colleagues who are also on psychiatry.The warning at the start is not to be ignored. I have suffered mild depressive episodes in the past and by the end of this game you will feel lower than when you started (even if you get the ""good"" ending like me!) However, if you know someone suffering from depression or just want to know more about it, it takes under an hour to get through so broaden your horizons!			"

												For someone who deals with depression on a daily basis, this game really hit alot of good similarities with my own life and way of thinking. It is a very good concept and demonstration for people who do not have depression to look into the eyes of someone who constantly beats themselves up,degrades themselves, and feels like they don't measure up to anybody else. Hits ya in the feels, and there are alot of different choices to make. Definitely worth playing/experiencing.			"

												As many of you know, this game is being bashed by most users, simply because of the controversy surrounding Zoe Quinn. If you are willing to try this, I want you to not think about the war that's happening on the internet. I'll be honest: Depression Quest is not really a game, it's not something that you'll have fun with, it's just something else. Something that you have to see with your own eyes. I recommend it. It deals with certain aspects of life, that have an important meaning to all of us. When you read this, you can easily imagine yourself in that kind of position, you can imagine a friend of yours having these kind of problems, everyone should give it a try, at least to try to understand how depression feels, and why it's important that we understand these kinds of things. Just give it a try and then, tell everyone what you think, leaving aside the Quinnspiracy...			"

												So it was 5:30 am for me on a tuesday morning when i stumbled across a artistic beauty of a game called Depression Quest. Through the expansion of my journey i found that the game was to teach and give players a feel of what its like to have Depressioon. Upon downloading and launching the game I was ever so graciously greeted with a ""(not responding)"" message that some games naturally have upon launch. Once i had reached the title screen i was intruduced to the most enlightening piano music i have possibly ever heard in my life. Instinctively I started playing skipping the controls and other useless information. The first page alone had way to much dialogue so naturally i was all ""wow nope"" and went straight to the options. Without any idea of what my options were actually affecting I picked the most negative one i could. Since everyone knows depression is a fake disease the only possitive choice I made was adopting a cat so I could officially become a cat man. Then I proceded to dump my girl friend Alex so i could oficially be a lonely cat man. I then decided that my love for cats was greater than that of myself. So in this process i realized the only reason I hate myself is because im a male. Finally I ended the game by becoming a flaming male feminist who wanted to eliminate all other males, and once done. Commit suicide. I ended the game with a personal high score of 420 Depression Points which i then cashed in at the arcade shop for a stuffed slice of pizza. Great game over all. Would play again			"

												An interesting experiment trying to portray, with the text-adventure as a base, how depression hampers your everyday life. Definitely worth to try out, if you're interested in games that are willing to take a risk and experiment with the medium. It can be a bit harsh to play though, especially if you're already in a vulnerable place. Have that in mind.			"

												Don't let the reviews dissuade you. this is a really well thought out story.  Anyone who struggles with depression or has a loved one who struggles with it should take the 30-40 minutes to play this game to see into their world. Not for people who just want a game, but for people who are willing to open their mind to a different viewpoint of life. Sad that this game has so many negative reviews, as it's the few games that attempt to actually help understand real life scenarios. Had the same feeling as Dear Esther when I played.			"

												DQ is billed as interactive fiction but it's more a branching decision tree given the game's subject matter. The writing is unornamental and matter-of-fact. Though I don't personally suffer the condition, I related the experiences in this game to those I know that have, and I found it's dozen or so vignettes to be very powerful and very saddening at times. Perhaps the one real weakness of the medium is it's hard to make decision you know will later impact the story negatively, even if I felt these would have been more likely in the circumstances.I can't say I enjoyed playing Depression Quest but I nevertheless recommend it.

												I would love to write an honest review of this game, but the story surrounding the dev is the only reason I found myself here in the first place. So I had my son review it and give me his honest opinion. he called it depressing yet funny. the main characteer seems to base his/her worth on everything around him/her ei significant others, family, co-workers, friends. to be honest the main character doesnt really seem that depressed. Seems more worried about what others think and feel about him/her, than the way that him/her feels about him/her self. seems like its written from a female perspective, no guy cares whether or not he is holding his girlfriend back from having better life with someone else. so in the end i'd have to agree with my son, depressing yet ridiculous. I recommend this game because i've played worse on here, and btw lying to sell yourself or something else is something everyone does. It's called promotion			"

												A lot of people give this ""game""/ experience crap, read them, I'll wait, then come back. Is the writing that great? not really, but it makes a point of showing you just how fast things can spiral out of control while battling the disease. A lot of them also cite their own experiences with depression, some getting mad with the way they portray depression after suffering from it themselves. I'll say right now I have suffered from everything explored in this, yet I would 100% recomend this to anyone who wants to try to understand depresison more. Bercause thats all you can do, is try to understand it, since it is experienced vastly different between each person. This""game""/ experience was made so that people who have no experience with depression a glimpse into the life of someone who does. This obviosuly means that things will be seen as laziness instead of symptoms of depression because guess what?THAT'S HOW PEOPLE WITHOUT IT THINK IT IS. THAT'S IT. This is not a """"game""/ experience for those recovering/still suffering from depression, this a game for those with no experience with it, SO STOP TREATING IT THAT WAY. 10/10 would reccomend for anyone who wants to learn about depression and how things can spiral out of control.

												Depression Quest is a great game if you're depressed. Or even if you're not. In many ways, this game can help you understand how depressed people see the world, and conversely, how people in a depressed person's world see them, and the issues surrounding them. It really can. I was skeptical until I played through it a few times with different mindsets just how good it is at pinpointing the struggles a depressed individual might encounter, but it really is quite good at exactly that. The different choices that open up to you as you heal or decline further are very eye-opening. Whether the struggle is dealing with anxiety in friendships or simply trying to haul your butt out of bed in the morning, this game is a serious must-play for everyone.			"

												As someone who's still in the beginning stages of trying to treat their depression, this voiced a lot of my worries and concerns over the last few years.  As I read through, I did identify with a lot of the ""excuses"" the protagonist felt he was giving and the negative feedback loops.Most of the user reviews for this game have been to Not Recommend it.  Some of the players have, themselves, been struggling with depression and feel this wasn't an accurate representation.  For me, it was.  Maybe just because I'm still at the beginning of trying to figure out what it actually affects in my life and what it doesn't -- what I'm ""whining about"" versus what's actually a result of the depression -- trying to figure out what and how meds and counselling could/should fit in -- trying to figure out (and fight myself on) what my friends/family ""actually"" think/do about it (though, I will say, I am lucky to have a lot of support).It's disappointing to me that so many people felt that this narative was so ... ""offensive"" (for lack of a better term) or misrepresentative.  I, personally, want to recommend this to the people in MY circles, just to say ""Look.  This has been me.""  However, I do understand how this may not be everyone's story and how others' struggles show themselves.			"

												I can't claim that ""Depression Quest"" is the best thing around. A lot of the writing is filled with grammatical errors and the option to undo a choice kind of negates what the intended message of the game is. But living with depression isn't something that is easy to convey and it's hard to say what would be the best way to communicate depression to people who have never experienced it.Having lived with depression, I see a lot of my own personality reflected in the main character. Most of the choices are things I've thought of myself and the way in which the game crosses off the ""good"" choices is very effective in making one realize that positivity is usually present but dismissed to someone with depression.Some of the endings are real downers, but there always seems to be the prospect of hope if you look deep enough. Nothing with depression is easy, especially taking the first step towards treatment. The game properly conveys that outside influences are often required and even reluctantly seeking help may lead to a better future.To any of the people worrying about the lack of traditional ""gameplay,"" realize that ""Depression Quest"" is not meant to be an action-platformer or first-person shooter. This is simply ideas being related in a different format to people who would have otherwise ignored them. I can't say that I read a lot of novels, but I do love reading within digital confines.At the end of the day, trying to encapsulate a depressing life is hard to do for people without depression.  People suffering with depression aren't the types with some weird illness or psychosis. They are average people who just happen to get bogged down by things to a stronger degree. ""Depression Quest"" gets that idea across and it does it for free. Why would you pass the opportunity to expand your mind a little simply because there is no gameplay?			"

												Depression Quest is one of those games that really touch a nerve on you, the label ""non-fictional"" is sometimes discouraging, but the narrative, the interactivity options and the atmosphere created by this game is absolutely overwhelming. It makes you understand a little more what is living with depression, and how can we work to make others who are living with it more comfortable.A game that is not a game, is a reminder that depression is powerfully real.10/10			"

												WHY ARE YOU READING THE REVIEWS? Seriously, for the most part, they're worse than YouTube comments, they're written by the same kind of people, and with the same amount of careful thought and consideration. So that should tell you something.Anyway, here's my real review: It's an interactive story. And while it is not exhaustive on the topic of depression (by the developers' own admission), it does educate on the subject. I really do think that people who really don't understand what depression is like, but want to change that, will benefit from this.As one who does understand, I felt for the character (myself?) as I played. I worried. I chose honest answers and got pretty accurate results. I played through it several times. It made me realize some of the dumb mistakes I actively make and how I justify them to myself. I started a freaking notebook in Evernote just to write down what I was learning from this.Again, it's not exhaustive. I would honestly have liked to have seen more. But it's free, and it's an attempt to venture into uncharted waters with the medium. It's a discussion starter. It's good.			"

												As someone who has only recently started to look into getting help for my own depression, I have to say that this has been a very special experience for me. I know that what I'm going through isn't quite at the level of what's described in the game, but I absolutely know what it's like to feel so completely lost, worthless, and alone that you feel like you can't go on with normal day to day life. I'm glad Depression Quest exists. I'm glad that Zoey, Patrick and Isaac put this together. I can read about depression all day long and it won't mean a thing, but this isn't just reading. This is an experience. This means something, something I understood, something I've experienced. I feel like everyone should take a look at Depression Quest at least once.			"

												How do I even start...I honestly believed that this game would be top quality seeing that Zoe Quinn is one of the ""best indie game developers"" out there, as stated by KOTAKUS own Nathan Graysons article ""The Indie Game Reality TV Show That Went To Hell."" I guess that would also make me one of the best indie game devlopers in business due to the fact that, just like Zoe Quinn, I have no clue how to make a decent indie game. If I wanted to spend any amont of time in my day just clicking hyperlinks I would have gone to Wikipedia, and I would find more joy in learning about 15th century Chinese furniture than playing Depression Quest. This game probably made me depressed. So thank you, Zoe, on fulfilling your quest of making your audience depressed. 5/Five Guys Would reccomend to all of my enemies.			"

												As much as I hate Zoe, I put those feelings aside and actually played the ""game"".It's more like a choose your own adventure book than a game, you can't lose.Having said that, here are my thoughts.It portrays someone struggling with depression and (possibly, as taken from context) Social Anxiety. I'd say the Main Character has a vague description on purpose, and whose issues are not very specific, so you are able to easily project yourself onto him/her.You could argue that it generalizes depression, but it delves into what is probably the ""most common scenario"", which is appropriate.As someone with Severe Social Anxiety, I do not have a problem with the game itself. I do not think it helped ""get over"" my issues, which frankly would be ridiculous that a single game could do it, but I do find that it can help people understand depression just a little bit better and how hard it can be to break the downward spiral.It's not for everyone, nor is it meant to be.I give it a ""Thumbs up"" and give it the title of ""Not Sucky"", even if i personally disagree with the views and actions on the creator.Also, to all the people who wrote the joke reviews, ♥♥♥♥ Off.

												5GB&FWith that out of the way, Depression Quest is still an enjoyable experience. The game is about half an hour long on a single playthrough, and you can extend this to about an hour if you feel like exploring everything (not something I'd recommend).The game provides a decent narrative, and the lack of images forces you to image the scenario happening instead. The crossed-out options when progressing in the game is an intelligent design choice, as  it blocks out the often most common solution to problems.I recommend it, don't expect anything on the level of Paper's Please, but rather something along the side of Gone Home.

												If you are looking for a fun game, stay away. This game, if you want to call it that, is pretty soulcrushing. It really shows the desparation and the helplessness that is to be experienced with depression. You have to commit to those feelings to really immerse in this game, otherwise it's just a waste of time.If, however, you want to have a taste on what being depressed is like, if you want to understand depression better, this experience might help you. It might not have all the answers you are looking for, but it visualizes the inside of a depressed mind pretty well.Get used to reading a lot of text; This ""game"" feels more like an interactive book than a video game. Love it or hate it.If you can look past the lack of fun as well as the lack of actual gameplay, this game can do a lot to expand your own horizon.			"

												The Good: I wanna start off by listing the good things about this 'game' since everyone seems to be hating on it. For starters, the developer says that this is supposed to be a representation of what life is like living with depression. This does EXACTLY that. The is definitely an accurate description of depression. Zoe hit the nail on the head with this. I think the reason this game is getting so much hate is because 1) she's a woman who has the nerve to make a game with content matter that most would not even dream of touching and 2) she's actually getting attention for this game. It DOES have its problems (which I will list below) but it isn't deserving of the vehement hatred that its getting. The Bad:If you have depression this is gonna put you in a bad mood, especially if its undiagnosed. Reading through this, it forced me to introspectively inspect myself and that isn't something that most people want to do. There are a TON of typos, grammar mistakes, and spelling mistakes. Despite how good the game is, I can't get over those mistakes as it seems like she just simply didn't proofread anything. She claims to have spent a while on this but it makes you wonder what the time was spent on. This is more of an interactive story than a traditional video game. It also isn't a very deep experience. While it accurately describes depression, its only a scratch at the surface of what its like. If you want to know more, you should look up more information about depression. Other stuff: I really advise playing through this with an open mind. This isn't something that is meant to be fun; its meant to get the audience thinking and to bring attention to depression. If you read the other reviews, it apparently fails on getting people to think because all I'm seeing is mindless hatred. I played it to see how accurate it was and what exactly a small team could do to bring this much attention to themselves and depression. It took about an hour to complete one playthrough because of all the reading. You could probably finish it in 3 mins if all you did was read the choices, but then what would be the point of playing the game?I want to stress this again: please keep an open mind when you play through this. It won't make the experience more enjoyable, but it will allow the game to achieve its point and you'll get the most out of your time by doing so.I also want to take a moment to point out that depression is different for everyone. Thats why it is so important to keep an open mind towards this. Even if you have depression, you may disagree that this details what depression is like. I believe this is a representation of Zoe's depression; it feels very much like it was written from a perspective steeped in personal experience.			"

												This game has the best graphics ever. They are better than Skyrim. I was able to walk over the river and through the woods to Five Guys Burgers and Fries. I got a nice little kitten, and she was cute. I have a girlfriend, and the graphics at the party were the best of the entire game. I had my girlfriend Alex and some beer. You have to do many tasks while the same 7 note music repeats with the depresing music also playing. The music is the best of any video game. I love the soundtrack. I would buy it if it was released, and I would pay any price for it. The ending of the game was perfect. I got to go and get Burgers and Fries with my 4 friends. just 5 guys and their burgers and fries. I nammed my kitten dog, because this game made me confused about the species of the kitten, because I was depressed. This game was the best game ever, and I would rate it 5/5. Guys will love this game.Wait, no. This game is a peice of♥♥♥♥♥♥ it isn't even a game. You might get laid if you write a good review though.

												Content Warning: Mental Health, Misogyny, SuicideIn the wake of Robin Williams' Death, everybody who speaks English should download and play 'Depression Quest'.It's a free, tiny 'game' on Steam's Downloadable Game service, although it's really a choose-your-own-adventure type of deal. That means you mostly read text, listen to audio, and make decisions on how to move the plot forward. Simple, but it's like looking in a mirror sometimes.It is a harrowing interactive experience that will teach anyone who's depressed that they are not alone (and that they have an illness and deserve treatment). It will teach everyone who's not what depression can be like.I am depressed. Most of the time I think of my general lack of purpose, productivity or motivation as something that makes me an awful person who wouldn't deserve good things, who shouldn't have good friends. On good days I can remember that those are symptoms of depression, and that they are lies.I know this is stilted and ridiculous to say so on social media. I am actually telling you this because there's something else you should know.DQ was also created (mostly) by Zoe Quinn, who is now the target of an online hate campaign that includes slander, misogynistic threats to her safety and hacking of her online accounts. I like to think that by playing Depression Quest, we are showing our support.Again, it's free and only 100 MB download. If you have relatives or friends that are depressed, or you think you might be depressed, please take advantage of this opportunity.			"

												If we try and ignore the controversy surrounding this game what we find is a text driven interactive story about a person suffering from depression. What I found while playing it is some parts rang very true to personal experience and other parts were way off.I have played it through twice now and find the mechanic of disappearing choice an interesting one.This is not an enjoyable game and could be thought of as triggering people with depression. It is however worth a look, especially for free, if only to get a small view of what one person's depression is like.			"

												    I am currently depressed and found this game somewat close to my own experience. The only difference is that I don't have a job or a girlfriend. I found myself stuck on this game at 10 o'clock at night reading through and enjoying the game. It felt...good. I don'tknow why but this game actually made me feel relaxed. I love it and I hope that other versions of this or something really cool happens with this game because it was probably one of the best games on Steam I've ever played. If there were stars, I'd give this game a 5.9999999 or better yet: Over 9,000			"

												Its a very interesting game. I keep going through it and seeing how different options i pick affect his depression level. Some people dont understand that this isnt supposed to be a game as it is more a text based simulation of how certain decisions can affect someone with depression. Like the ending said its not supposed to be something that you play for hours and hours its just supposed to be a simulation.			"

												Depression Quest is an entirely text-based Choose-Your-Own-Adventure game in which you play as You. Well, okay, perhaps not the you You, but someone relatable. You might not have a job that you hate (this You does). You might not have a girlfriend you love, but who gives you intense anxiety (this You does). You might not be accustomed to imagining life without the comfort and convenience of your prehensile tail (this You does not have such a body part, or at least it's not mentioned anywhere in the text). You might not suffer from severe depression. Or you might, I don't know. Either way, this game was intended for every you to play, in the hopes that those suffering from this condition might be able to take some measure of support from it and that those who aren't suffering from it might better understand just how thoroughly depression can undermine someone's entire life.The presentation is simple enough; you are shown a series of days in the life of You, and each day you are given a set of actions to choose from. These range from the healthy (Ignore your bad mood and go out on the town with friends) to the blatantly self-destructive (Stay home and eat Fritos and wish you had more cats), and each choice has repercussions that determine how the story progresses. If you could simply always choose the healthy option, why, you'd probably wind up feeling great and be very successful... but that's not how depression works. Depression saps motivation, drains energy, limits a person, and depending on how depressed you are, your options will be more and more limited, offering you only the Fritos-related story paths. You'll see the healthy, socially-active options, you'll know they're there, but they'll be crossed out - there's no way you could bring yourself to do that. Instead, you get to choose from the remaining options, the leftovers, the coward's-way-outs and the awkward compromises and the lame, humiliating excuses. When it's available, pushing yourself will help you crawl out of your pit, but sometimes it's just not an option.This is a game with some very clear messages about the realities of depression, some of which you may disagree with. Not everyone believes that pharmaceutical options, psych meds, can really help a person. In my experience, it depends on the person, but they can work miracles. Not everyone believes that therapy is a worthwhile expenditure of time. I know that some therapists aren't fit for the job and do more harm than good, but that doesn't mean there aren't caring, intelligent people out there who earnestly want to help. And not everyone believes that their friends care for them, that they can be trusted; sometimes it feels as though the whole world is judging and laughing at you behind your back. But that's not the case, and without that support network of friends and loved ones, the world is a very dark place. I think the messages included here are all beautiful, earnest ones, and I think it's incredibly generous of them to offer the game free-of-charge on Steam; I got more enjoyment out of DQ than I have out of anything in a long while.

												I've just recently been exposed to text adventure games (this being one of them) and after playing through the whole thing it was pretty well done! I had a good playthrough with mine so this is all coming from my personal experience. (Also anyone who plays this game I highly recommend you do something that cheers you up because it DOES get you down)This game has hit close to home for me, I sympathize with the main protagonist on some levels. I have suffered from depression before and continue to face obstacles because of it. Before writing this review, I've noticed how people say ""this doesn't accurately represent what depression is like."" Everyone is different. People go through depression differently be it extreme or mild. Besides this game is only giving us a basic idea of what it's like for someone to experience depression in their daily life. It may not have been how YOU experience it but that doesn't make the game completely inaccurate.  Now about the game itself, since you have to make choices in this game I actually appreciate having a ""back"" option to change your decision. Although there's no button on screen, you simply click the backspace button on your keyboard to go to the previous pages. I enjoyed reading the different outcomes and it helped to decide which route I'd rather take. Depending on the decisions you make, later in the game some of your choices will be scratched out. Often they are choices that may seem simple and the logical thing to do, but it's not that easy for your character who's having neverending battles with his/herself. More choices will be available to you, the player, when you make the right decisions and help your character fight against the depression. I must note that the audio caught my attention. The somber piano music is very mellow and slow. It is played on a loop but it honestly didn't seem repetitive to me. Each page or section in the game has more sound going on depending on the setting. There's a scene where your character is at a party and you can hear jibber jabber and party music all while the piano still plays. I think that's rather clever to keep the piano music. In my opinion it symbolizes the character's depression. The piano music follows the character wherever they go, even in a happy setting, it's always there. After completing this game, I actually do recommend it to others. Anyone who can be triggered easily, play with caution. If you're curious to see what it's like have a go at it. Keep in mind the experience with the protagonists' depression may not be 100% accurate, but it does offer an idea to those who want to understand what it may feel like to be suffering from depression. Don't forget this game can and will make you feel down, so go play some Katamari Damacy or watch cat videos afterwards. =) "

												Content Warning: Mental Health, Misogyny, SuicideIn the wake of Robin Williams' Death, everybody who speaks English should download and play 'Depression Quest'.It's a free, tiny 'game' on Steam's Downloadable Game service, although it's really a choose-your-own-adventure type of deal. That means you mostly read text, listen to audio, and make decisions on how to move the plot forward. Simple, but it's like looking in a mirror sometimes.It is a harrowing interactive experience that will teach anyone who's depressed that they are not alone (and that they have an illness and deserve treatment). It will teach everyone who's not what depression can be like.I am depressed. Most of the time I think of my general lack of purpose, productivity or motivation as something that makes me an awful person who wouldn't deserve good things, who shouldn't have good friends. On good days I can remember that those are symptoms of depression, and that they are lies.I know this is stilted and ridiculous to say so on social media. I am actually telling you this because there's something else you should know.DQ was also created (mostly) by Zoe Quinn, who is now the target of an online hate campaign that includes slander, misogynistic threats to her safety and hacking of her online accounts. I like to think that by playing Depression Quest, we are showing our support.Again, it's free and only 100 MB download. If you have relatives or friends that are depressed, or you think you might be depressed, please take advantage of this opportunity.			"

												Let me start off by saying, I like this game. I like text-based adventure games, this is my cup of tea. I played through the game a few times making the decisions for this unnamed character, it still tells a good story with an albeit fantasy romance. I do believe that this game effectively communicates what it's like to live with depression. My big complaint with this game and the reason I wouldn't recommend it, is that I don't believe it belongs on a site like Steam. It simply doesn't make any sense that a TEXT game that may be boring to most people who are looking for games with entertainment (at least that's what I look for on Steam) a game like this belongs on a site like Kongregate. But, if you're looking for a game that portrays a person living with depression, this is the game for you which is why it gets a yes.			"

												With a name like Depression Quest You know that this ""game"" isn't exactly going to be a barrel of laughs, but then that's not really the point of this experience. Instead, it challenges you to walk in the footsteps of someone with depression (that someone being an amalgamation of many different people's experencies of depression).  It may help you to understand the illness, or even come to terms with your own depression and I have to say, it was masterfully and tastefully done.I reccomend this game to anyone that seeks a better understanding of depression, or to anyone that is struggling to see a way out of their own.I'm not going to go into too much detail, It's free on steam so check it out for yourself, but I can say that it left me feeling enlightened and a little more hopeful about my own depression.

												This game really makes you feel depressed, and a bit in sync with the protaginist. Just for a text based adventure game, it's pretty deep and you almost feel as you are in his shoes. This game isn't really entertaining in any way, but very informitive and now that it's free, it's very well worth playing. Myself being clinically depressed, I feel this game truely shoes how it is to live with depression. Unfortunatly the developer for this game I don't really take a likeing to after hearing what she did to get this game pushed as you can watch here:

Posted: September 17, 2014
												I'm starting with the bad: There are a lot of things I felt like could have been done better, the biggest being getting through to the player why the ""good"" choices are crossed out, because from reading the reviews I feel like a lot of people missed the point. Guys: They're crossed out because of course you're thinking of those options and of course so would someone with depression, but that doesn't mean that you can actually execute those tasks when you're in the throes of it.Also, yes, nothing particularly bad happens to the character, but that's the whole point: depression doesn't have an external cause, just external stimuli that make it worse. In that sense, this is in many ways a solid depiction of depression. It manifests in different way to different people but this is part of why it's so demoralizing and frustrating--you feel like you've had your toenails pulled out one by one when none of what you're dealing with should be that difficult, objectively.While some people have said this should just be a novel or a story, the interactive part of this is critical--the choices you can't make are as important as the ones you can, and the feeling of relative futility equally so.And the stated objective here is to try to communicate this experience to people who haven't been through it, to help people who want to understand just a bit more what this is like to live with. As someone who's fought depression his entire adult life, any effort to that end is an admirable in my mind, especially given how many times I (and many others) have struggled with having the depression conversation with loved ones. It's not Kafka, it's not David Foster Wallace, but so ♥♥♥♥ing what. It's a helpful addition to a conversation many of us have struggled with, imo, and I'm grateful someone took on the task.			"

												There seems to be alot of hate for this game that is utterly and completely blind and unstructured. Regardless of the circumstances around this game's development, one should never in a review look at anything else than the game. If any of the devs read this id like to thank them for the experience theyve provided me with. This is a work of talent and art, something very unique that hasnt been created before. The depictions of emotions and characters in this game are reflections of real life and i can certainly say with full honesty that 90% is accurate to the last detail. I call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on anyone who claims to be struggling with depression saying this game is dumb. Either they are lying, disrespectful morons who take the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of a serious condition, or they are in denial about themselves and i wish them to seriously take a deeper and more truthful look. The presentation of the game is simple and minimalistic, a stark contrast to the maze depression is. It works rather well and doesnt detract from the gameplay experience. The music is spot of with that melancholy and aimless vibe. This is an honest game that deserves attention. It may be more interactive fiction than a fullyfledged game but who cares, it is what it claimes to be. A critisism is the length. I do understand the possible constraints the devs had to work with but if a follow up was created on a much grander scale that can really suck one into the bleak and grey world, it could gain far more worldwide recognition. Finally id like to ask the devs to focus more on the literary aspect. It is beautifully written no doubt but more descriptive elements would solidify the atmosphere. I ask everyone to forget about the controversy behind this game and stop accusing it as ""feminist"". The game is specifically made to appeal to both men and women, there is nothing propagating a feminist message. Even if it is, why not support rights for women? Nothing wrong with that. Just stop whining and start being objective and open minded. If i had the means id donate to this project, yet sadly all i can do i spread the word and hope reasonable and solid people listen and support the game/work.			"

												To get this out of the way, People who are actively depressed and are not seeing a therapist or taking medication should NOT play this game.That being said, I suffer from depression and was diagnosed with Adjustment Disorder and possibly Bipolar Disorder.Playing this game was hard, emotionally. I didn't think that I would have a problem with the issues that the game represented, but it sure got me. It made me re-count a lot of the steps that I had to take to aid my depression and anxiety. I believe that this is an accurate representation of a form of depression, not all forms, but a common form of it. This was an emotional game and definitely got to me, I teared up during some of text, started grinding my teeth, and felt multiple anxious 'heart drops' during the course of the game. It may be short, but it covers a lot of subjets and has what I would think is quite a bit of replay value. I felt like going through the story was completely worth my time and would be for those of you who want to understand what depression is like.I saw a lot of reviews out there about this game, depicting that it's a disgrace or doesn't actually depict depression the right way, they all haven't really played the game or have actually suffered from depression. People have stated that they were diagnosed with 'severe depression' or whatever, 'severe depression' isn't a diagnosis, if you suffered from it, you'd know for sure what you were diagnosed with. Depression is a feeling that people have, everyone has it, it's when it becomes a disorder that is the problem, people get diagnosed with disorders not feelings.Anyways, I reccommend that you guys try it out if you aren't actively suffering from depression.

												If you Have Depression I recomend you dont play this game because  if you do get the good ending you are gonna hope life turns out that way for you too but sadly you have to make that happen... you have to talk to people and take the medication and you have to learn how to stop showing it so easily.... Sometimes depending on who you tell they all have different reactions... And if you get the sad ending you sit there and believe that its whats going to happen to you so you keep going back and you try to pick desisions you would do because if you choose the things that lead to that its gonna happen right? WRONG... people can change within the years and eventually theres a chance you make friends and you can help eachother out... Eventually you start to feel useful again and the grey clouds start to go away... and possibly if you are lucky you can find that one person that will help you through anything.... you can make friends easily again and you can start to talk again... and eventually you will stop being so down all the time and saying sorry for every little thing... Eventually you can be happy again but not if you play this game... If you play this game you will learn alot about different theories of depression but if you play it while already having depression it can give you flashbacks to when you were like that or it can even make you hit a depression spike... Sometimes Depression is a scary thing and such a deep dark hole to try and climb out of... I warn you to not play it if you have depression.... But if you do... Dont fall backwards... Keep climbing out... You can talk to me if you need to....			"

												As someone who has had a life-long struggle with depression, I was curious about this game (partially due to the controversy surrounding it, which has been written about to death so I won't do it here).  When I stumbled upon it, I decided to try it out.I'm a fan of visual novels which, for the uninitiated, the bulk of the ""game"" is reading text.  Visual novels tend to have images of the characters and backgrounds, which is part of its style and appeal.  Suffice it to say that it wasn't a great leap for me to switch over to the ""gameplay"" in Depression Quest.This game seems to set out to give the reader a taste of what it's like dealing with depression, although realistically it can't cover every possible life scenario such as class, gender, orientation, race, etc.  It describes the struggles of whether or not to include those close to you in your treatment, to see a therapist, to get on or continue with medication.  Learning about things like the 'feedback loops' that were mentioned can be life savers to folks dealing with depression.  To quote the old GIJoe cartoon, ""Knowing is half the battle"" and insofar as presenting the information in an interesting, descriptive manner, I think this game does that quite well.  It's a well-crafted game, although I'm not sure how well its replay value would be.My one gripe is very much with the music.  The piano riff put me in a negative mood before I read word one of the game.  I don't expect hyper anime-style music, but maybe something a little more neutral in tone would have been more suitable.I will recommend this game as it did resonate with my own personal struggles with depression and presented the information in a straightforward, entertaining manner.

												There seems to be alot of hate for this game that is utterly and completely blind and unstructured. Regardless of the circumstances around this game's development, one should never in a review look at anything else than the game. If any of the devs read this id like to thank them for the experience theyve provided me with. This is a work of talent and art, something very unique that hasnt been created before. The depictions of emotions and characters in this game are reflections of real life and i can certainly say with full honesty that 90% is accurate to the last detail. I call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on anyone who claims to be struggling with depression saying this game is dumb. Either they are lying, disrespectful morons who take the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of a serious condition, or they are in denial about themselves and i wish them to seriously take a deeper and more truthful look. The presentation of the game is simple and minimalistic, a stark contrast to the maze depression is. It works rather well and doesnt detract from the gameplay experience. The music is spot of with that melancholy and aimless vibe. This is an honest game that deserves attention. It may be more interactive fiction than a fullyfledged game but who cares, it is what it claimes to be. A critisism is the length. I do understand the possible constraints the devs had to work with but if a follow up was created on a much grander scale that can really suck one into the bleak and grey world, it could gain far more worldwide recognition. Finally id like to ask the devs to focus more on the literary aspect. It is beautifully written no doubt but more descriptive elements would solidify the atmosphere. I ask everyone to forget about the controversy behind this game and stop accusing it as ""feminist"". The game is specifically made to appeal to both men and women, there is nothing propagating a feminist message. Even if it is, why not support rights for women? Nothing wrong with that. Just stop whining and start being objective and open minded. If i had the means id donate to this project, yet sadly all i can do i spread the word and hope reasonable and solid people listen and support the game/work.			"

												If you Have Depression I recomend you dont play this game because  if you do get the good ending you are gonna hope life turns out that way for you too but sadly you have to make that happen... you have to talk to people and take the medication and you have to learn how to stop showing it so easily.... Sometimes depending on who you tell they all have different reactions... And if you get the sad ending you sit there and believe that its whats going to happen to you so you keep going back and you try to pick desisions you would do because if you choose the things that lead to that its gonna happen right? WRONG... people can change within the years and eventually theres a chance you make friends and you can help eachother out... Eventually you start to feel useful again and the grey clouds start to go away... and possibly if you are lucky you can find that one person that will help you through anything.... you can make friends easily again and you can start to talk again... and eventually you will stop being so down all the time and saying sorry for every little thing... Eventually you can be happy again but not if you play this game... If you play this game you will learn alot about different theories of depression but if you play it while already having depression it can give you flashbacks to when you were like that or it can even make you hit a depression spike... Sometimes Depression is a scary thing and such a deep dark hole to try and climb out of... I warn you to not play it if you have depression.... But if you do... Dont fall backwards... Keep climbing out... You can talk to me if you need to....			"

My depressiong and PTSD is minor compared to many other people, but none the less, it's something I've had to suffer with, and this story did show many of the emotions I felt, and still do feel to this day. If you're looking for a game to have fun, this is not the one for you.

												This game provided an overwhelming experience, most of which was sad, and even to some, relatable. The game circulates about a man with depression. Now deppression is not a thing to joke about and i personally think they didnt do a good job at showing what it would be like for someone who has deppression. I've read some reviews and others feel the same way, but in no way does that make this game bad. Like i said, this game gave me a new and different experience that i've never gotten from a game ever before. This game could be alot better, mainly because of the fact that there was no negativity with the story besides yourself, sure you had unhelpfull realatives, but there were too many people willing to help you, unrealistic to most people actually suffering from depression. Still, this game gave me a different viewpoint on people, which is what the games intended purpose was.Pro.gave me a new viewpoint on people with depressionCon.Not as realistic as it should have been, for most people depression is much worse.

												I know that this isn't intended to be a ""game"" in the sense that you have fun and find creative strategies to meet your goal. It is a story. A story that addresses a very serious, and often very misunderstood, issue. So I'm not going to judge this based off of the usual aspects I might on any other game in any other genre.This *experience*, from start to finish, was honestly a bit terrifying and often hit too close to home with me. I have depression and a lot of the scenarios the protagonist experienced felt as though they were ripped from my own life and molded into text. It was relatable. It was honest. It took an issue that so many find difficulty discussing and brought it into light. I actually cried at some points, won't lie. In my experience, things ended on quite the optimistic note. Things seemed to be getting better for the protagonist and, reading through this, it gives me hope that things will get better for me too.I doubt the creators of this game will ever read this, but if you do, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. Depression Quest is an absolute treasure.			"

												depression quest... well, it's good. while it was not the most fun expierience and it was difficult at times i was able to relate very strongly to it maybe that is just because i have depression and stilll have bad days or maybe because i see that there is sometimes more to a game than the graphics and ""fun factor"" sometimes a game is an expierience and that is what depression quest is. so would i reccomend this game? yes, but not if you want to play a game only if you want to experience something truely unique and honnest.

												Very Good Text True Story, which can reflect people with depression (like me and other who are still in or people with deep depression, me again) or give a small taste of how it feel to have depression.  This is a game by definition, however it is more of something to inform other about depression, if ur trying to ""win"" in this Story, then you sadly mistaken for what the purpose was ment to be as.

												Having trained as an MSW, worked as a peer counselor in mental health and experienced years of depression myself I can say I applaud this game. As a game it is very simplistic, being more of a ""choose your own adventure"" story than what most would recognise as a game. If you're looking for dazzling graphics and high octane action then look elsewhere. However, Quinn and colleagues tell a good basic story of a person struggling to deal wth clinical depression. This game can provide some support for sufferers - indicating that there is hope as well as some of the ways of bringing that hope to reality. It can also provide a basic understanding of depression to would-be allies who don't know what it's like to be depressed. As such, it provides a potential bridge between people with depression and their support system and between the mental health field and the world outside it. Very well done.			"

												Well, Depression Quest. A free-to-play game about dealing with depression. Personally, I've never had to deal with myself or anyone in my family having depression. I'm sure this game gave the people who have a better understanding of the condition.Lots of lives are lost due to suicide every year, and most people think that commiting suicide is a selfish thing to do. People with depression actually can't get up and do anything, and this game illustrates and explains it perfectly.The protagonist delves deeper and deeper into his battle with depression, and through the story, you dip in and out of feeling amazing and feeling ♥♥♥♥♥♥. There's different things you can do, and in my playthough, I was set on ""ending"" my player's depression. I didn't purposely choose the bad choices, I didn't choose some good and some bad, I chose what I thought was best for my player. I'm not sure what happens if you choose to stop taking meds instead of taking them. I'm not sure what happens if you stop seeing your girlfriend. But this interactive story shows how difficult the decisions are for people who suffer from this.It's free, and it's eye opening. It gives you insight on how most people act, and what to do if you're ever affected by depression in any way.Overall: 8/10edit: soundtrack adds to the mood. its actually great!			"

												This game is just frustrating. Don't even play it, it isn't worth the 20 minutes you'll get out of it.And being someone who thinks they have depression, this game doesn't help. It seriously doesn't. It left me frustrated, and the funny thing about it was how the game constantly told me how depressed I am. THANK YOU, GAME.This game isn't good.This isn't even a game.It's an interactive text adventure, and not a very good one.A lot of the choices were blanked out, leaving me feeling bad when I can't choose certain things that I would do within the situation. This game...it doesn't have a goal. It even admits that. I thought, oh, this game would help. No. It doesn't. At all. It's like...I'm depressed. Yeah. But the difference is, even though I have it, that doesn't mean I can't fight it. The game attempts to teach the player that depressed people cannot fight their depression. That is entirely untrue.This...it isn't helpful to society. At all. Despite how hard I tried to get into the story, the game stops me from making certain choices so I can only get frustrated. If you're going to make a ♥♥♥♥ing game, and give me the option to make a choice, don't then cross them off so I can't change the story the way I want to. This game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Seriously.TL;DR?

												Well, where do I start?At first, I was looking for free indie games so I could play something short and entertaining on my free time. Once I started reading and thinking about it, I realized that this wasn't what I was looking for, it was better; and I love the fact that I found it.This is a game about scrolling down and clicking blue colored options, which leads to the best spent hour and a half in a long time.Sorry for the really foggy nature of my comment but that way you know it's spoilers free in almost any way.11/10 (the extra point is for including a cat, I love cats)			"

												As someone who suffers from depression, a lot of this game hit home. I tried to pick the most honest paths (when allowed), and the results were very true to life. This may not be the kind of game that most people are up for, but I think it presents an important issue in a very real light. Anyone with an open mind should give it a chance, and hopefully, it will help them to understand those of us who experience these things on a regular basis.			"

												It's not a fun game, but it's not intended to be. This is a brave attempt to broaden the purpose of games, and to broaden the genre. It's a storytelling game that gives insight into what living with depression can be like. So this can be used to help people who have a depressed friend or loved one understand a little of what they're going through, and maybe give them some talking points to broach difficult subjects.I suffer from anxiety/depression myself.  I'm 45 years old, but had I played this game earlier in life, I can see how it could have positively influenced me.My only criticism is that it's a text adventure format.  I think it works for this subject matter, though.  Also, it's important to consider that there was a lot less funding for experimental games when this one was being produced.  Consider it a pioneering game in the indie field.All in all, I applaud the effort, and hope that people find it helpful. I also hope that we continue experimenting with therapeutic possibilities of games.			"

												First of all, Depression Quest is not a game in any meaningful sense of the word at all. It’s an interactive set of multiple choice questions that lead absolutely nowhere.What the developers rather optimistically refer to as a “playthrough”, I managed to complete in about ten agonising minutes through severely gritted teeth. And no, it wasn’t long enough to get the point across; it would have needed about another thousand or two hours of teeth pulling for that to happen and still there would have been no point.The developers have classed this as a game and they call themselves game developers; on both counts they are hopelessly mistaken. A video game has atmosphere, a plot, very often a hero, and generally looks nice and is exciting to play. This is none of those things and one of the many things it lacks is guns, so that we could all blow our brains out by page five. This is not a game in any sense of the word and it would be more fitting to describe it as cruelty to the depressed and self inflicted punishment. Games are fun, this is not, so don’t insult us.It’s so easy to criticise the work of others and let’s face it, critics are just that; they produce very little or nothing at all. In this case, all the criticism Depression Quest has received is entirely justified for the simple reason that it’s a badly executed and irresponsible piece of  self congratulatory narcissism that should never have seen the light of day.

												Well, that was something.So first, I won't even bother addressing the developer aspect. There are enough reviews that focus solely on the developers, and you can always read online to learn more about them.Second, to say that this isn't a game because the only elements are role play and choice, well would it help if there was a targeting reticule and a timer so that you could make the choice quicker? Maybe include some QTEs? If so, then it'd be no different than a Telltale Game (a developer I really like, by the way). In other words, I don't buy into the game/non-game debate. Interactive fiction is interactive fiction, regardless of the level of interaction required.Okay, so what is this? It's essentially an electronic choose-your-path adventure where the lead is already suffering from undiagnosed depression, but the decisions you make determine whether things spiral uncontrollably, worsen slightly, improve slightly, or even turn around.If you do not suffer from depression, this game may provide insight as to what people are saddled with on a daily basis. Then again, if you are one of the types who feel people should just stop feeling sad, then Depression Quest likely won't change your mind.If you do suffer from depression, you may find -- despite the fact that symptoms manifest differently in everyone -- elements of yourself depicted. In some cases, you may feel that every single page is ripped straight from your own life story.I played this game like I would with any other RPG with player choice: I played the opposite of how I believe myself to be. In other words, I sought help and I opened up to the people around me, much like how I'd flock to the dark side/bathe in evil points or whatever the particular currency happens to be in the title.In doing so, I... I felt uncomfortable. Like I was lying to myself, not to mention those around me. I felt guilty for leading them along, and pretending like things were okay. I went along with the therapist's advice, and even went out with people, and engaged my family in discussion.Afterward, I sat for a bit and wondered why I am unable to do these things in real life.Immediately, I restarted and chose the polar opposite of whatever I selected in my initial playthrough. In other words, how I really felt. It was disastrous. I sat for a bit longer. Why did I have a stronger emotional attachment to characters and choices in this piece of software compared to those around me? Around those who have stood by me, and attempted to support me?This was all a lot to absorb. I will need to dwell on this further.So, as you can see, not everyone will have the same reaction to Depression Quest. The unfortunate thing is while emotional and psychological variances are bound to occur, the narrative differences regardless of choices are slight. As you can imagine, the polar opposites yield dramatically different results at certain junctures, but it is otherwise the same regardless. I would have preferred to see more variety, and a few more callbacks to earlier choices, rather than copied and pasted pages that happen at preset times. Not only to encourage replays, an act that also could help people on both sides see how the littlest decision can have a profound impact, but also to make the experience more unique for the end user.Huh. I think I spent more time writing about this free game, a 30-minute text adventure, than for anything else in my library. Food for thought.			"

												Is an expository piece still a game?  It depends on your definition of “game”, but is it still worth your time? Certainly.  I have always considered a game to be anything distracting that forces me to think and to feel for someone or something other than myself while maintaining a degree of interactivity.  Depression Quest is, above all else, an expository piece with some aspects of a more traditional game but to me it is a moving experience and certainly deserving of the title “game”. The gameplay such as it was is limited to using either the mouse or keyboard to scroll through text and to make decisions as the protagonist.  You aren’t going to be blasting bad guys or jumping over spikes.  The stated goal of the game is to depict depression as the developers have experienced it and to let other sufferers know they are not alone and as far as I’m concerned they hit the mark both times.  The writing is quite good, at times being quite poignant though at others it doesn’t have as nice a ring as it frequently does.  More often than not, it expresses surprisingly well the less concrete emotions one feels both during depression and day to day life.  What few editing errors I noticed were easily overlooked, mostly because the writer had distracted me with my feelings towards my character and myself.  The game has a very ambiguous tone throughout with regards to the personal life of the protagonist, who you “play” as.  Your job is vaguely defined, as are many other elements of the protagonists life which allows the player to more easily put themselves in the protagonists’ shoes.  I felt that I could draw parallels between my own life and the protagonists, which made the game have more of an emotional impact.  Depression  Quest is a concept more than a game.  Some traditional aspects of games such as combat, more interactivity and a well-defined conclusion have gone by the wayside to further the goals of this conceptual exposition to great effect, in my opinion.  This is not a game for people with a narrow definition of “game”, but if you’re looking for something that will make you think and feel, Depression Quest is for you.  "

												10/10 a hugely moving game. I'm not easliy moved to tears but this game had me filling up. I felt myself at one point feelign completely powerless to change where the game is going and improve my characters outlook. For the people giving negative reviews because of that, your really missing the point. Its supposed to make you feel lke theres no hope of improving your situation.I've never seen such a huge number of people who negatively reviewed the game because they missed the point. Seriously trhe guy complaining that theres no difficulty progression I'm surprised you know how to read.This game is amazing. It wont be fun but yo uwill be moved by it. If your not moved by it then go play it again because you clearly missed the point.			"

												Let me preface this review with one statement:As far as I know, I've never been depressed. I, like everyone, have had bad days, but nothing severe enough to consider depression.That said, the mission statement of the game seemed to be that depression is more than just being a downer or being mopey or a whiner.However, I found that the gameplay doesn't support this mission statement.Whenever I came to a decision to make, I chose what felt reasonable to me, a non depressed person. Don't feel like going out with your girlfriend to a party? eh, just do it anyway because it will make her happy. Even then, I chose to stalk in the corner and not to talk to anyone, but it didn't seem to matter.Should I call a therapist? Yes. Should I continue seeing the therapist? yes. Should I tell people that I'm depressed? Yes. Should I stay on my medication, even when I am feeling a little better? yes. Should I move in with my obviously loving and awesome girlfriend? Yes.And at the end of the game, I was living with my girlfriend, seeing a therapist, on medication, with an adorable kitty and my family was very accepting of my condition. I still didn't really like my job, but I realized it was a small part of my life and just something to get through. I was being more sociable with friends and, for the most part, fighting through my depression very well.There was never anything that would imply a depressed person is incapable of making these decisions. The game is, essentially, implying that depressed people are just being little ♥♥♥♥♥es and intentionally making the wrong decisions.That said, I enjoyed the narrative and the choices, though intentionally limited, felt like I could control my fate, rather than being told that I'm depressed, so I can't possibly recover.It's a free game and it only takes and hour, and I found it rather enjoyable.Despite its failure to meet its mission statement, I did feel like it enhanced my understanding of the thought processes depressed people go to in order to will themselves back to a good state. So I think I would recommend this game, as I have played many many worse games than this.			"

												Very usefull tool for someone with depression or someone who knows someone with depression.  While it's not necissarily entertaining in the typical sense, it does a very good job of allowing you to see through the eyes of someone with clinical depression.  Or, in my case, making it even more clear that I have clinical depression.This isn't so much of a game but an educational tool.  It's not fun.  It's not something you'd play to relax.  But what it sets out to do it does very well.  There's not much in the way of graphics, being a texted based adventure game, but the sound design is wonderfully crafted.  It's oppressive, which is exactly the right mindset to be in for the game.So, good game, but if you're looking for something to have fun with, you'd be better off with pratically anything else.  However, if you're interested in learning about depression, this is a wonderfully crafted glimps into that awful awful place.			"

												This is an iconic game and, perhaps, not for the right reasons.Beyond the post gammergate fuss it's worth assessing this game as a stand alone experience, as a game in it's own right not as an exercise in either alt-right baiting or alt-right propagandising.As such this game stands up as a worthwhile experience.The game mechanics are simple: you have a list of options available to you each time a decision is made. you begin with most of these unavailable as you fall into depression and then as you are offered options such as speaking to loved ones and seeking professional help more options become available. if you choose not to the options narrow again, if you choose to open up to others and seek help more options become available.This is a simple but effective game mechanic and is effective in mimicking the path depression may take.No, the game is not 'fun' but why should games be fun and why are the mainstream games which offer you opportunities to do nothing but kill 'fun?'This is a game about emotional states and it is a work of art. if this is not what you are after from a game then don't play it and don't review it but don't trash the game the same way i would not trash a FPS.

												I would only recommend it if you want to get someone's point of view of depression, if you need an eye opener into depression. I would not really recommend this game, after having just played about 10 - 15 minutes of the game.Depression Quest is a game that will give you a deep insight into what a person is going through a deep depression experiences with daily life and activities. It is a choose your own adventure game that keeps track of your decisions in three ways: how depressed you are (like normal depression or deeply depressed) which affects what choices you can make, if you're seeing a therapist or not (and how much you feel motivated to going to more sessions), and if you're taking medication for your depression. This was a dark story in terms of how your character deals with depression because most of the choices that were crossed out were choices that had a definite yes or no answer. The choices that were crossed out becomes more frequent, the more depressed you are. You mostly had choices where you would second guess yourself and everything about people's opinion of you. I never reached the end of the game but it is a game that I would like to finish to see how it ends. The game does achieve its goal of making you depressed and trying to give you the same experience as your character. So it's not a terrible game but if you play it, be prepared to come out of this game with a negative feeling.			"

												Honestly, I enjoyed it thoroughly. Sitebender explained the experience very well, and I'm glad he wasn't part of the typical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t I'm seeing on these reviews. Legitimately, I'm actually annoyed just by seeing the freaking Burger Joint reviews on this page. Granted, I haven't read up on the full story on Zoe, or Vivian James, only bits and pieces. I just found the story only around an hour or so ago.Surprisingly, I got the good ending the first playthrough. Ended with him reminescing on his past few months, and telling his mom during Thanksgiving Dinner with family, ""I'm good, Mom."", and him sure that he could feel his mom's smile appearing.I've never been depressed myself, and while I may not always be able to empathize with friends who go through depression, I can certainly say that I will always sympathize, and do my best to give them my fully-fledged support. I can't even count how many times I've had to pull my friends through so many horrible ruts. Just having someone to talk to can help.And especially to that last piece, you're definitely right. Hugs for everyone. ^_^*Spoilers for the game go under here*It was somewhat difficult to choose correctly, but I did choose to be openly honest with Alex, chose to help Attic, played with my kitty, and I did choose to take Therapy, and the medication. Gradually, my depression state improved overtime. I had one fluctation where I was extremely depressed, but I can't remember if that was avoidable at the time or not. While it wasn't met to be fun, I certainly found the interactive story enjoyable to play.			"

												It's... okay? Like, everyone experiences depression differently so I can't say this is terribly inaccurate, but the way it railroads you doesn't make it feel like an 'accurate' representation either. More importantly, I feel like the music and overall presentation of the game kind of detracts from the punch. Like, depression, at least to me, is just kind of static. I don't need the sad music to try to tug at my heartstrings. Depression is horrible but it's also mundane. I guess the issue comes down to that because everyone experiences depression differently, you can't really nail it down with one interperetation, and I feel that the biggest flaw of the game is that it seems to introduce itself like it is THE interperetation. Overal, tenuous recommendation if you know people with depression, but not recommended if you already suffer, because you likely won't take anything helpful away from it.			"

												Honestly, I'm not really sure why people don't like this game; in fact I thought it was quite good. And if you take the time to read the first page, it really is exactly what it says it is, interactive-fiction; if you don't like reading, you're probably not going to like this game.I liked that your character couldn't just do the easy thing in a lot of the choices because it illustrates how people with the illness may not be able to make the easy choices in the same way someone without it would. I believe it's a fairly accurate demonstration of how depression can look; though, I do think it would have been cool if the game had more than one story to show how depression might look for people from other walks of life. I also think it could be used as a tool to teach people who don't know about depression what it can be like.Overall I'd say it's pretty good, it's free and not too long so it's worth a play.			"

												This is an extremly good game, SOME of the guys here are just people who hate Zoe for some reason and harrass her because of her ex spreading lies against her. You play as a depressed guy in this game, and you try to navigate your life and better your life while having depression, all the while not seeing a therapist or getting meds for this. It shows how hard a mental disorder can hit you, and one guy here called the guy in the game as spoiled, but he doesn't understand mental disorders. Mental disorders can come at any time for any reason, it's not the guy's fault he has depression, he just has it. This game shows how well mental disorders can screw up a life, if you don't get a therapist or some meds, your life will go down the tube as your mental disorder seeks to overwhelm you. Don't listen to the trolls and haters, and don't call this guy a spoiled brat. Mental disorders can happen to anyone, show some sympathy for them!			"

												It's... okay? Like, everyone experiences depression differently so I can't say this is terribly inaccurate, but the way it railroads you doesn't make it feel like an 'accurate' representation either. More importantly, I feel like the music and overall presentation of the game kind of detracts from the punch. Like, depression, at least to me, is just kind of static. I don't need the sad music to try to tug at my heartstrings. Depression is horrible but it's also mundane. I guess the issue comes down to that because everyone experiences depression differently, you can't really nail it down with one interperetation, and I feel that the biggest flaw of the game is that it seems to introduce itself like it is THE interperetation. Overal, tenuous recommendation if you know people with depression, but not recommended if you already suffer, because you likely won't take anything helpful away from it.			"

												Let me preface this review with one statement:As far as I know, I've never been depressed. I, like everyone, have had bad days, but nothing severe enough to consider depression.That said, the mission statement of the game seemed to be that depression is more than just being a downer or being mopey or a whiner.However, I found that the gameplay doesn't support this mission statement.Whenever I came to a decision to make, I chose what felt reasonable to me, a non depressed person. Don't feel like going out with your girlfriend to a party? eh, just do it anyway because it will make her happy. Even then, I chose to stalk in the corner and not to talk to anyone, but it didn't seem to matter.Should I call a therapist? Yes. Should I continue seeing the therapist? yes. Should I tell people that I'm depressed? Yes. Should I stay on my medication, even when I am feeling a little better? yes. Should I move in with my obviously loving and awesome girlfriend? Yes.And at the end of the game, I was living with my girlfriend, seeing a therapist, on medication, with an adorable kitty and my family was very accepting of my condition. I still didn't really like my job, but I realized it was a small part of my life and just something to get through. I was being more sociable with friends and, for the most part, fighting through my depression very well.There was never anything that would imply a depressed person is incapable of making these decisions. The game is, essentially, implying that depressed people are just being little ♥♥♥♥♥es and intentionally making the wrong decisions.That said, I enjoyed the narrative and the choices, though intentionally limited, felt like I could control my fate, rather than being told that I'm depressed, so I can't possibly recover.It's a free game and it only takes and hour, and I found it rather enjoyable.Despite its failure to meet its mission statement, I did feel like it enhanced my understanding of the thought processes depressed people go to in order to will themselves back to a good state. So I think I would recommend this game, as I have played many many worse games than this.			"

												I would only recommend it if you want to get someone's point of view of depression, if you need an eye opener into depression. I would not really recommend this game, after having just played about 10 - 15 minutes of the game.Depression Quest is a game that will give you a deep insight into what a person is going through a deep depression experiences with daily life and activities. It is a choose your own adventure game that keeps track of your decisions in three ways: how depressed you are (like normal depression or deeply depressed) which affects what choices you can make, if you're seeing a therapist or not (and how much you feel motivated to going to more sessions), and if you're taking medication for your depression. This was a dark story in terms of how your character deals with depression because most of the choices that were crossed out were choices that had a definite yes or no answer. The choices that were crossed out becomes more frequent, the more depressed you are. You mostly had choices where you would second guess yourself and everything about people's opinion of you. I never reached the end of the game but it is a game that I would like to finish to see how it ends. The game does achieve its goal of making you depressed and trying to give you the same experience as your character. So it's not a terrible game but if you play it, be prepared to come out of this game with a negative feeling.			"

												Depression is a symptom, not a disease, and depending on the cause, your experience may vary. That does not mean, that this ""game"" is not an accurate description of depression.It does in fact line up very well with my experience and I believe it helps healthy people to understand what depression is like. Clearly seeing the choices a healthy person would make, but not having the strengh to do it, and usually hating oneself for it.The protagonist is very lucky to have a partner to confide in, and not having an allergy preventing them to have a pet.

												I was skeptical about this game at first; given the title, I thought it was going to be a game that turns depression into a joke, but that most certainly was not the case. As I was reading the first page that talks about the game and the goal they (the creators) hope to reach, I had a change of heart and thought that the game might actually have some realism to it and that it could possibly be an enjoyable experience (which is was).As someone who has battled depression within this past year (2014), I felt a connection to the character that you play out. There is a trigger warning on this game, so be warned. Some parts brought back up some memories of how I had felt and what I had gone through, which caused me to tear up and even cry at a few parts because those memories are still quite fresh and most definitly painful. If you are looking for a fun game, look somewhere else. This game wasn't designed or intended to be fun. It's more about the experience that you get from playing this game that is truly what makes it worth a playthrough.			"

												This game is fantastic! I really enjoyed it. It's a simple text based adventure game where you play as a depressed person. At the begining of the game this person does not realise that he has depresion. The game ofers variuos ways to help yourself in life. While playing the first time I tried to choose the options that would fit my own tactics in similar situations the best. And got the brightest ending. Then I wondered that maybe that's because I don't have depression and then tried to play again deliberatly choosing the worst possible options.... and got the worst ending :SThis game is short, easy to play, and teaches a lot about yourself and other. Would recommend to anybody looking how to spend and not to waste a spare hour. PS music is fantastic!			"

												This is an iconic game and, perhaps, not for the right reasons.Beyond the post gammergate fuss it's worth assessing this game as a stand alone experience, as a game in it's own right not as an exercise in either alt-right baiting or alt-right propagandising.As such this game stands up as a worthwhile experience.The game mechanics are simple: you have a list of options available to you each time a decision is made. you begin with most of these unavailable as you fall into depression and then as you are offered options such as speaking to loved ones and seeking professional help more options become available. if you choose not to the options narrow again, if you choose to open up to others and seek help more options become available.This is a simple but effective game mechanic and is effective in mimicking the path depression may take.No, the game is not 'fun' but why should games be fun and why are the mainstream games which offer you opportunities to do nothing but kill 'fun?'This is a game about emotional states and it is a work of art. if this is not what you are after from a game then don't play it and don't review it but don't trash the game the same way i would not trash a FPS.

												I'd consider this more of a life experience then a ""game""This hits a lot of points at home for a guy like me.Normally when you think of depression, you just think of a person being sad about something that has happened.""They'll get over it"" you say.But it's never that easy.Depression can't just fade away.And a lot of times, it over takes you.You start to lose sight of who you really are, and your thoughts become so cloudy to the point where a rational thought is the equilivant of Gaben making a third instalment of a game.And sometimes, even when it's ""gone"", you think of it.You think back to those times, and it trys to make its way back into your life.I was depressed my whole life untill recently.When I was three years old, I was mauled by a dog.I lost my ears, and my face was full of scars to the point where I looked like I had enough stitchs in my face to patch up an entire leg wound.As a result, I never felt apart of anything.I was always a diffrent person then everyone.I didn't know what I liked, I didn't know what I wanted, but at the same time I didn't wanna be alone.So I did everything I could to try to fit in.I became a shadow of everyone else.I was like this for a very long period of my life.Eventually, I hit freshmen year.I was this angsty teen who had no interest in school.I just wanted to fit in, and I didn't care how I managed to do it.But then, I met a man.He was a senior when I met him, and we had an odd first meeting.He showed me a new side to life.It was in that class we had where I learned about some of the many things I've come to love in my life, such as Gmod, Tf2, and even MLP back then.It felt like a gate was opened for the first time in my life back then.And what was at the other side of the gate you might ask?A light so bright that even to this day, it still shines to the point where it is almost blinding.I have three best friends that I can always talk to, I've been going to conventions, auctually hanging out with people on weekends and not being locked inside my house like a ♥♥♥♥ing animal.And I have a girlfriend, a girl who I love more then anything.I think the main point of this story is that you shouldn't hesitate to reach out to others.Chances are, that person holds the key to the missing parts of your life.And unless you try to find them, You'll end up another shadow like I was.I can't stress enough how much you should experince this.

												This game hits very close to home. Not sure that's entirely a good thing, lol, but I'm recommending it anyway since it's quite accurate and could possibly give some insight into the struggles we face with depression, and the possibility/unlikelihood of ever recovering.			"

												The game overall was short and sweet. As someone who has major depression, I can vouch for this game accuritely depicting what it's like to have the mental illness. The walls of text did deter me from wanting to read them to the end though, as it becomes hard to pay attention at times.			"

												I attempted playing this game months ago and couldn't get myself to read through the first few pages. I ended up throwing in the towel. After a friend of mine suggested this game to me, I made my way back. This is a game that you have to give a fighting chance to. It has a rough start, but once you get into it, you realize how important it is. It allows you to view depression from the perspective of someone suffering. It's an eye opener. If you enjoy reading and can stand to read a short novel- you'll really enjoy this. It's a bit depressing, hence the title, but it's a good story that keeps you engaged.			"

												This game reminded me what it was like when I was severely depressed. It also reminded me that I, like the protagonist, have come a long way. I don't think the protagonist was portrayed as lazy, and I don't think it was cheap that some of the ""better"" options were not allowed to be picked. I think some of the people writing reviews forget that every person is different, and depression will affect people differently. Not every person will have the inner will power and determination to fight through their depression, especially since for the first third of the game, the protagonist didn't even acknowledge that they had depression. Also, it makes no sense to me that people are giving this game a poor review simply because it's a free game. Seriously?			"

												I honestly LOVED this. It's not even a game! I mean seriously, it's not even a game yet I did the entire thing gladly!. Basically, it's a demonstration of what depression is like in a story that you get to decide on by making choices that could lead to a happy ending, or you cold possibly f*ck up enough to commit suicide. Luckily for me, I had a happy ending at a family gathering where you learn, that deprssion isn't something you can fully get rid of. Great story and great concept, love it.			"

												As a game, I don't think I would recommend it to anyone unless they were specifically interested in information about depression, but there are far better sources out there where one can find help.  I played Depression Quest a few months ago, and it didn't feel like a game so much as being dropped into the life of a clinically depressed person, and while I appreciate the informtion provided to find help at the end, that gave the experience a definite PSA feel to it.  I do not doubt the creator's sincerity, but again, I doubt I would ever recommend this to another person.			"

												This... is not much of a game. I will point that out straight away. I find it inappropriate to call it one.But being all about words and discreet visuals, it's all about putting you in the state of mind of someone who is depressed.So it's all about words and reading. But the writing isn't too great and there's minor typos (such as ""Camero"", missing punctuation, etc.). And the language is rather plain. Yet, most depressed people would hardly be poetic, so it fits. (Mind you, some also become much more poetic, penning miserable pieces that only spread the melancholy.Audio-visually, Depression Quest presents itself simply, static filters and little environmental sound effects set to a constant piano loop (albeit one too short). The points are delivered.There is no gameplay. It is simply a mildly branching story. And it's short. You can finish a readthrough in less than half an hour. (Then again, I'm a relatively fast reader.)So how realistic is it? You'll likely find other reviews suggesting it is not. But, it is.People do not understand ""depression"". For most people, the ""blues"" just come and go. They don't constantly eat away at you. Depression Quest depicts someone suffering from this ""unnatural"" state of mind, a medical condition that has only become officially recognized in the last half a century.The character's situation is given little backstory. Though, one might find the situation ""promising"" and good, that it's actually such good circumstances that there's no reason to be unhappy. Yet, the seemingly most successful and happy stars have killed themselves, and depression is an ailment that can strike anybody without reason. Just like a genetic defect.Perhaps it's not a fully accurate representation. It probably isn't. Perhaps you, a non-sufferer, feel it's absolutely ridiculous; that the character you play has a totally obnoxious way of thinking. Perhaps you are a sufferer, undergoing treatment or otherwise and you find that the story does not match your experience.Depression is a highly individualized ailment. If it were to be described as a criminal, it would be one who modifies their strategy to the individual target, striking them oh so differently.Just go ahead and read the Discussions on the Community Hub, or even anywhere else. The realism of the story has been debated there and so forth.But how do I recommend this? In short, I can't really recommend it. It's something that won't be enjoyable. But, if you intend to experience Depression Quest, enjoyment should not be your objective. You should want to ""play"" Depression Quest to experience one viewpoint (of many possible) of a medical ailment.			"

												The only morale of the story behind this ""game"" is that unless you take medication and see a shrink, your life will suck. For that reason I can't recommend this title to even the most depressed person because the game does not successfully address depression on a general scale. This title is actually more likely to amplify depression, not prevent it. Don't waste your time just because it is free.			"

												TL:DR - If TL:DR applies to you, then a game that's 99% reading isn't for you.Is this a game? Loosely.      There is little interaction and your choices don't specifically carry on to influence later options. They do, however, accumulate as a state of mind which impacts the number of options available. You are, in essence, taking on the role of someone who doesn't know they have depression as they fight the downward spiral. That's a deeper characterization than many games I've played.Should you play it? That depends. 1) Do you have depression? 2) Are you interested in learning more about what people with depression deal with?     If 1), 2), or both apply to you, then: Yes. It's an informative look into what is still a widely misunderstood illness. And it's more interesting than just reading dry scientific data.     If neither apply to you, then: No. You won't gain any entertainment value or added perspective from this.Overall: I like it and intend on replaying it now and then to see how different scenarios play out. Thanks to the developers for doing it well, releasing it for free, and getting it on Steam for a wider audience.			"
