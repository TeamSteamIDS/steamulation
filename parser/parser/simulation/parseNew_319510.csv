												Five Nights at Freddy's is an awesome little indie game that's become very popular in a short span of time. The gameplay is simple - you're in a room and have the ability to control the lights and doors of your office as well as the ability to monitor the cameras dotted around the building. You need to keep an eye on the four animatronics that will move around and kill you if they manage to enter your office. To make things more difficult, you have a very limited amount of power which is drained more quickly if you keep lights turned on and doors closed, effectively meaning you need to leave yourself exposed if you want to survive. As a horror game, it works very well. The robots are suitably unnerving and the game makes you extremely paranoid thanks to the lighting and sound effecs. There's nothing unfair about the game - if you can keep your cool and use your resources effectively, you'll be fine, but more often than not the player will end up panicking and being punished for it. The atmosphere and story are fantastic as well - the messages and notes left behind for the player all add up to create a very enigmatic yet creepy story that people are still speculating on, combined with numerous other easter eggs.The developer seems down to earth and willing to listen to his fans, and has already promised a sequel. I would recommend buying the game to support him for this reason and so that we can hopefully see more games like this. The game is not huge, but it's a great addition to the horror genre and is definitely something all horror fans should want to see more of in a sea of action games and zombies.			"

												Besides writing and studenting I work as a night security guard to pay for my extravagant, luxurious needs (food, water, shelter). And it doesn't matter the setting or location, working at night can be very unsettling. Alone with your thoughts in a dimly lit ANYPLACE during the witching hour can be literally the worst thing ever. The clock tick tocks mockingly as time slows to a crawl and the night grows darker with each passing hour. I'm not a spiritual person... but around three or four in the morning, third cup of coffee in hand and heavy-lidded eyes blinking in futility at the specter of sleep, you start to hear things. Snaps and cracks from the wind. Chittering and chattering from various nocturnal animals. A flash of light across your face as a lonely car makes a very slow u-turn. A bang from something somewhere. And you start to wonder: are you experiencing auditory hallucinations or did you just hear a baby cry? So you walk outside for some fresh air. And just where the light from a distant street lamp falters to the shadows you see something standing. Just. Barely. Noticeable.Just waiting for you to shut your eyes.That paragraph best sums up my experience with “Five Nights At Freddy's.” It is a panic attack simulator ingeniously disguised as a game. You're a recently hired security guard at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a kid friendly pizza party parlor with a sordid, spotted past. For instance, most previous night guards are MURDERED BY HAUNTED ANIMATRONIC ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T. And you will be too unless you're hyper diligent. See, not only is Freddy's HAUNTED BY THE LIVING EMBODIMENTS OF EVERY CHILDHOOD NIGHTMARE YOU'VE EVER SUFFERED, it also has an incredibly tight budget (Freddy's is likely crippled financially by dozens of lawsuits). They have only so much energy to expend from twelve at night to dawn. Your working hours. You'll have to manage that as you check video camera feeds, turn on the lights just outside your office, and seal your two office doors.When your night begins everything is hunky dory and all the animatronic monstrosities are SILENT AND STILL AS THEY SHOULD ALWAYS BE. But as the night progresses and you check your feed you'll find some things... off. Wait, wasn't Freddy on stage a minute ago? Now he's in the dining area. And huh, where did the ♥♥♥♥ing rabbit goooooOOOOHHHHHHHH ♥♥♥♥! And then you find out where Bonnie the Bunny went.He went into your office.To eat your eyes.So you'll have to be, as I said, diligent. Keep your eyes peeled for the scoundrels as they make their way towards your office. If they get too close (go on, turn the light on just outside the door and have a heart attack) just seal the door. But for every nervous glance at the feed, every light flicked on, and every door slammed shut, your power will drain, eventually leading to an outage. And God help you if that happens. I'm just kidding! There is no God. Only Freddy.At the end of the night (assuming you survive) you'll start another... if you'd like. This is a simple, terrifying game. It's clever, fun, and will absolutely cause you to shout or shriek at least once. Hell, I shouted at the main screen, and then again a few seconds after that. It marries the fun and inherit hilariousness of the jump scare with a  tense, gripping, paranoia-inducing state - the result of brilliant atmosphere, design, and your own imagination working overtime. And perhaps the best thing about this game is the brilliantly basal story, one told through clues and phone messages. I haven't seen a community delve so deeply into the meaning and depth of a story since ""Dark Souls,"" honestly. ""Five Nights At Freddy's"" is a testament to horror, to the power of simplicity, and to dedicated indie development.Wait.Did you just hear something?			"

												I'll start by saying I had no intention of playing this game.Actually, I avoided it. But it wasn't until I noticed it popping up everywhere that I'd give it a shot.The first night was absolute hell. I kept the doors shut the whole time and drained my power in less than five minutes. I give this game major props. I have bad anxiety, and this game has actually helped me a bit with that. The paranoia and anxiety I experienced through my multiple play throughs of the night one and two, helped me realize that things that make me nervous in real life aren't as bad as being chased down by killer animatronics. So thanks for that.I'd definitly recommend this game to anyone who can last the five nights. I know I sure as hell can't (made it to night 3), but that doesn't stop me from trying.			"

												Night 1, 12AM: Friendly coworker gave me a call to explain the job, but I muted him since everything seems so simple. Relax in my office and keep an eye on the security cameras, easy money.Night 1 1AM: Just noticed they have blast doors installed on the security office doors, this must have been a former military base or something.Night 1 2AM: All quiet on the homefront, I think I'll ask that cute girl who works concessions out when morning rolls around.Night 1 3AM: I could've sworn that the bunny suit was in the room the other two animals, but now it's in the prop room. Must be more tired than I realized. Noticed an indicator that says power is at 65%, they must try and conserve power at night.Night 4AM: Okay, now the ducks in the party room, something is not right here. Power's at 50%, I'll have to be careful if I don't want to be in the dark with these things.Night 5AM: HOLY S#!% turned on the lights to take a leak and that damn bunny was right outside my door! Powers at 20% but screw this, these blast doors are staying shut all night.Night 5:30AM: SOMEONE IS KNOCKING ON THE DOOR. There is no way in hell I'm opening that.Night 6AM: I quit.			"

												Five Nights at Freddy's is an Indie point-and-click horror game that literally bombed the Steam Store on its very first month of purchase and is infamously known as a fresh breath of games that play along the themes of tension, paranoia and sudden fear. It is also most known amongst fans of the game that famous Youtubers such as Markiplier and PewDiePie who have made the sales of this game boost even higher than usual indie game sales. As a small synopsis related to this game, you'll be waddling through Freddy's game of don't-hide-but-seek, right to the very perilous end.With only little power reserved for poor old Mike Schmidt in the Security Guard's Office of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a family restaurant complex, you'll be struggling to stay alive and out of danger on your six hour shift of work, starting from 12 AM to 6 AM for five days straight, hence the title of the game. With every night progressively getting worse in both psychological fear and paranoia. The repulsive animatronics that run alive during the night become much more unpredictable, with unexpected jump scares that will leave your heart to skip a beat and without a doubt, make you want to rage quit the game as quickly as possible. You will be having to deal with Freddy and his fearsome buddies, Bonnie the Bunny, Chica the Chicken and Foxy the Pirate Fox. Rather cute names, yet really ugly faces indeed.Inspired by the beloved restaurant, Chuck E. Cheese, now, the deepest nightmares of those kids have come to life as these animatronics in game don't want to sing you no birthday song or throw you a party. They simply plan to crush your body into a mascot costume, completely mashing, fracturing and probably suffocating you in the process. Pretty gruesome way to die, no?What makes this game very intriguing is the community's efforts on theorizing the deeper meanings of the game's overall plot and context. Ranging from how the phone guy is the actual killer, to Foxy being a good animatronic rather than a bad one. This is all deeming down and shredding away the structure of the story that makes us think in our own perception. And I love the community's reasons for that as it takes devotion and well-thought ingenuity to piece together the mysteries that still lingers on, even to this day.The game honestly doesn't become as scary as you may think. If you have been playing for hours upon end, it becomes somewhat highly addictive in a sense. Not to spoil anything about the game, but after the main five nights, you have an optional 6th night and even after that, you can proceed to the insane 20/20/20/20 difficulty mode, where you're doomed from the very start. Unless you can manage to live through it that is.This game actively toys around with your mind, as you will mindlessly switch the lights on and shut the doors in the much more frightening and perilous nights ahead. Things begin to get real hectic as odd noises protrude from various locations in the restaurant, from the animatronics humming, to random musical tune, to loud footsteps and of course, the demonic laughter. You never know if Bonnie and Chica are ganging up on you or even worse, if you can't turn the lights on or shut the doors, knowing you're doomed with an eventual jumpscare at the end. Even Foxy begins to act creepy, since he's the biggest reserved essence of paranoia for me; you never know his patterns directly and you're left shook up if or when you witness his hasteful, creepy run down the hall, leaving you only little precious seconds to slam the emergency door down, or else you'll be greeted with an expected jumpscare and a game over.Definitely recommend this game, and the time I recommend to play this game perfectly fits at midnight, all alone in the dark. I bloody dare you and if you have completed this game, congratulations! Move onto the even more scarier sequels that wait up ahead, brave soul. It's about to get a whole lot more nightmarish.			"

												Inspired by the sensational and tragic encounter between Rich Evans and the Showbiz Pizza Bear that captivated 20th century America, Chill Week at Chuckee's immerses you as a dirt poor security guard desperate enough to undertake the task of being sodomized by a mechanical fox with pneumatic genitals for $120 a week. Along with Foxy ""Kenyan Murder Machine"" Fox, other character include Bonnie the Bunny, Chica the Duck that should be a goose because of awful teeth, and of course renowned music box/skeletal piledriver Freddy Fazbear. Try to preserve the sanctity of your pooper by carefully managing your power supply in elaborate tower defense gameplay to protect yourself from furries that inhumanly scream in your face at the volume of a meteor impact.Getready4freddy			"

												This game is so tense that it's a blast to play. I don't think I've ever played an indie horror game that was actually good until this.For example, I was on Night 6, midway through 4 AM when Chica disabled the door. I knew I was screwed, so I threw down the left door to block out Foxy. A little bit into 5 AM, I hear banging on the door. This means Foxy is reset, so I throw up the door. With 7% power remaining, I sit still and hold out. The power finally goes, I hear footsteps...followed by the happy jingle of our favorite bear. It was over, he had found me.Then, in the middle of the song, 6 AM arrives!!! Go to hell, Freddy.			"

												Great horror Point-and-Click game. In this game, you're a security guard which got hired in a Pizzeria to work 5 days a week. However, you have the night shift. You don't move around the building, you're in the office, where you get 2 doors, two door lights, and a tablet (Also a freaking fan which takes a lot of power) You use the tablet to look at all locations in the Pizzeria, but you don't look around for criminals - You're looking at the Animatronics, the maskots of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. At night, they free-roaming mode is turned on, and they want to get you. Why? I'll quote the Phone guy here ""The Animatronics think you're a naked endoskeleton which is lacking a suit, and all they want to do is stuff you into a suit, which is with a lot of wires in it.  So basically it means if they stuff you into the suit, the suit will kill you because of the wires. Hovewer, that's not true. The Animatronics are haunted - By kids. A few years ago, a man in a Freddy Fazbear suit kidnapped 5 children. They found a suspect, but the kids went missing. They were never found.The Animatronics don't think you're a naked endoskeleton, because Bonnie, one of the Animatronics was next to a endoskeleton in one of the cameras, yet he ignored it.Anyways, you use the tablet to look at which place the animatronics currently are. If you don't find any of the animatronics on the camera, it can mean two things:1. The Animatronic is next to your door, so you'll need to close it before he gets into the office!2. The Animatronic is in your office, waiting for you to lower your camera. To know if he's in the office, you'll hear a weird sound of a child while you're looking at the camera.You'll also need to check onto the Pirate Cove between ""Often"" and ""Not very often"" if you don't do that, Foxy will run through the hallway, and get into your office.You can't just close the doors for the whole night. You have limited power. You'll need to survive from 12am to 6am, in all nights. With only 100% power, which gets drained quicker if you have the lights/tablet/doors turned on. So you'll need   to spare your power, or the office will be in complete darkness, and Freddy will get you when that happens.In the later nights, the game turns into a more ""Strategic-Horror"" Game. You'll need to plan a strategy, so the four animatronics won't get you, and your power won't get completely drained.It's a really amazing experience, and it costs only 5 bucks. You definitely should buy it, it's really worth it.10/10			"

												I can say i highly recomend Five Nights At Freddy's. It is more of a puzzle/strategy horror based game.You are the newly working security gaurd and you have been told that at night the animatronic bots can be kinda ""Quirky"" at night. No problem right? There most likely going to just turn on and start singing multiple times in a row. Think again, one minute you will look at your security camera and see all the nice look animatronic robots in their den. Next thing you know you will see one on the cameras right next to your door. All i have to say is when you see one of them next to your door make sure you flip on that light and check your blind spot.Lastly, Try NOT to find out what the fox says.			"

												A difficult game to recommend as I come close to loving it but even closer to hating it. But Steam forces me to click thumbs up or thumbs down and in the end it gets a thumbs up because even though I had a love/hate relationship with this game, I am strangely glad that I played it.Five Night at Freddy's starts as a psychological horror game but ends up more of a resource management game. The first four nights were a lot of fun, quite creepy and sometimes scary (although mostly because of jump scares). But by the fifth night the game is all about the resource management to the point where the psychological horror disapears. You are not going to finish it on the first attempt and the chances are by the time you complete this you will be numb and possibly even bored.Night five is like trying to juggle twelve eggs. The basic idea is pretty simple, but executing it without making a mistake is the problem. It can take a lot of practice and many hair pulling moments. For me night five was not fun, and that is where the problem arises: Night Five is where the game really starts. You will spend more time on night five (and beyond) than the first four days.It is not a bad game, and if you like juggling eggs whilst avoiding jump scares it will be sheer joy for you. But for me it was four nights of fun and one very very long night of frustration followed by a brief moment of sheer extasy when I finally finished night five .... and then a painful moment when I saw what was next.In the end I recommend this game because it is an experience I am glad I had, and feel it is one most lovers of horror/jump scare games should try once. But do not expect to enjoy every minute of this game unless you are masochistic in nature. Hair pulling and keyboard violence should be expected.			"

It spreads the Gospel and allows God into your life.

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Five Nights at Freddy's Original Release: 2014 Genre Tags: Horror; Simple; Casual My Overall Grade: B+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 2-5 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Novelty seekers; Horror buffs; Casual gamers REVIEWIt is unfortunate that I even need to say this, but: I am not interested, whatsoever, in becoming involved in the politics and lobbying of opinions that revolve around this game. I am just going to describe my experience with it and my opinion about it, and offer a suggestion of consideration to anyone who is interested.So I stumbled across Five Nights at Freddy's in my backlog, and I will admit that there was an influence of brand recognition due to the circus that surrounds the game. Perhaps without which, I would still have yet to even try it. Regardless, I was curious about it so I checked it out and played it for a few hours one night.It was a fun evening. The game isn’t some insanely life-changing experience, but it is entertaining and has a nice novelty about it. I hadn’t played anything quite like it. You can surely have a fun few hours playing it; I know I did.It is extremely and purposefully simple, and there are very little controls or mechanics. This minimalist approach to the gameplay creates a scenario which allows the game to evoke a strong sense of helplessness and anxiety in the player. You really can’t do much, but that is the point. And even with the opening disclaimer about jump-scares, I got “got” a good 2-3 times by them as I played that night. I liked it.Overall, there isn’t much to it. The game is short, the graphics are ugly, the mechanics are minimal, etc. Five Nights at Freddy's isn’t anything overtly special, but it also isn’t excessively terrible… it just is what it is. It’s like horror movies; they usually aren’t anyone’s all-time favorite, but they can be fun for a night. So if we can put aside the trolling that surrounds this game for a moment, and speak logically: you will likely find Five Nights at Freddy's is an entertaining experience that will definitely appeal to horror buffs and casual gamers, but can also easily be enjoyed by a wide range of gamers. That said, if you are one of those people who believes only the most top-shelf, A-one, premium games “deserve” to be played, you should probably just stay clear. For everyone else: don’t expect the second coming of Jesus Christ, but also don’t expect some unbearably awful experience… just expect a few hours of cheap thrills and then to move on with your life. If that sounds cool with you, then consider checking this out.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												Five Nights at Freddy's is probably one of the games on Steam that everyone will have heard of; however I promised to review every game I finished so here goes...The aim of Five Nights at Freddy's is to survive five consecutive nights in the security room of Freddy's Restaurant, hiding away from the horrors of the night, you have a limited amount of power to use the lights and keep the doors closed. It's very much a resource management game in that sense. The graphics seem to be pre-rendered 2D style, which to be honest, they don't look the best, the security office where the whole game takes place is very pixelated and it doesn't look very pleasing, however the character models of the other bears etc. look quite cool.As in all other horror games, the music and sound effects play the most critical role, they set the mood, and give you the most jump scare effects, and they are done very well here. The levels are all set in the same place; they just get progressively harder and harder, with different techniques used by the bears on each stage.  The game is pretty hard once you get to Night 3 onwards, and will probably have you cowering in fear.The whole game took two hours to complete the Five Nights, this felt just the right length as I don't think I could any more of the jumps and suspense.People who seek that jump scare experience will find the thrill here; and the puzzle aspect of having to look after your power management is a nice feature, so overall, I can recommend Five Nights at Freddy's.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												Five Nights at Freddy's (a misnomer, because it actually offers seven nights) is the kind of horror game that can only come out of the indie market. For one, it's incredibly clever, well conceived (you won't find another game that uses faux-90s low quality computer graphics to its strengths) and so immersive that, yes, its atmosphere and jump scares result in it being a surprisingly terrifying experience. The story doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but there is supposedly a supernatural twist that the developer has somehow hidden away in the game which might clear things up.So if you like buying games you'll never play because you're too scared to do it, or if you're prepared to delve deep into the disturbing depths of late 90s pizza parlor horror, get ready for Freddy.

												I played the demo of this before the full version was released on Steam. Believe me when I say it is one of the most terrifying horror games ever made and it really is as scary as most people make it out to be. The way it plays with your head and toys with you makes you feel so vulnerable and isolated, it isn't like anything else I've felt in any other horror game.What makes this game so unique is two things: its gameplay, and how you have to survive. Normally in horror games you've got the ability to roam around the map, run, hide and pick up items to help improve your odds of survival. Not in this. You're confined to just one room with a device that lets you take a look at the camera feeds throughout the pizzaria, and in this one room are two doors to the left and to the right, both of which are JUST out of your peripheral vision. You've also got a light for each doorway, since it's completely pitch black through them, so that you can see what is through the doorway (trust me when I say you'll be needing to use those lights very often).Here you might say ""well why can't I just close these two doors for the whole night and not have to bother looking at the cameras or turning the lights on?"" It drains the power quite rapidly. If you drain the power early, it's game over... just not instantly. Because of this, you want to conserve as much of your power as you can, which means you won't have the option of keeping either of the doors closed for the whole time, nor the option to keep the lights on. This is where the game becomes pretty terrifying. And then there's Freddy and his pals... It'll be easy for those who want action in their games to dismiss this title, since you are only in one room for the whole game. But holy♥♥♥♥♥♥do things become tense very early and very quickly. If you are a horror fan, this is an ESSENTIAL title that you NEED to play.			"

												I personally like the game and its franchise, but the fandom has kind of ruined the expierence of the gameplay. I can't search one theory that others have of a certain subject without running across a cancerous 12 year old. I recommend this game for anyone who wants to be scared, but only for a short time. The jumpscares were scary the first time, but quickly became old and nonfrightening. The atmosphere that Scott has created is spectacular and created goosebumps the first time I played. Play the game. Ignore the fandom.			"

												Genius in it's simplicity. I finally bought this on sale just to see what the fuss was about, and after all the talk of the series being Youtube-bait with its jump-scares and the tiny development cycles of the sequels leading to them seemingly being churned out I was very cynical when starting it. But I'll be damned if this isn't one of the most palpably tense horror games I've ever played. Whilst the jump-scare aspect gets the most press when it comes FNAF, the game actually uses the core tenets of true horror to it's advantage. The player's influence on the world around him is limited - the only way you can fend off the creatures is to track the threat and close the doors around you when they appear. Given that operating anything uses up your precious power resources, you're left exposed for most of the game and can only act in your own defence when the threat is at your doorstep. Furthermore, you can only know that the threat is there if you turn on the lights temporarily, and the knowledge that there may be something watching you from the black abyss that lies just outside the door is terrifying in itself. So throughout the game the player is left powerless, exposed, fearing the unknown, feeling like the enemy is one step ahead, and incapable of eliminating the threat, only delaying it. These are the emotions that truly thrill you and scare you. The jump-scare is merely the pay off to the complex and deep tension that the game creates. And it does all this on a shoe-string, exposing just what a solid and simple concept can do for the gamer. I now get why this game became so popular, and while the things you see and hear on Youtube may make you feel like the game is nothing more than a cheap thrill, I think it's a deceptively simple but masterfully crafted experience.

												Five Nights at Freddy's is an indie take on the game series, ""Animal Crossing"".Scott Cawthon was inspired by this relaxing franchise and wanted to make his own.In FNAF, you are the security guard at the local Pizzaria, Freddy Fazbear's Pizzaria. Here you have a nice, quiet, relaxing job with few troubles. The best part about it is the fact that every minute or so, you are visited by a kind fluffy animal who wants to say hi! This is inspired by Animal Crossing's relaxing feeling and great socializing. Truly lowers my heart rate.			"

												Welp, this is Five Nights at Freddy'sYou are a Night Watchman at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a Chuck-E-Cheese style establishment, Singing Animatronics, pizza for kids, and so on. Whilst it's a place where kiddies go during the day to have fun and party, you aren't here during the day, no, you're the Night Watchman After all, you gotta sit the night shift through to get your meager living, how else will the bills for your crappy apartment get paid?What are you watching for? Burglars? Teenage no-do-gooders? No, you're keeping an eye on the Animatronics themselves, Now, the Animatronics are left in Free-Roaming mode at night so they don't break down more than they already have, they used to be able to during the day, but that ended up with one of the Animatronics being decommissioned and some poor soul without a frontal lobe.This wouldn't be a problem, but the animatronics will stuff any naked endoskeleton (I know there are theories that they're just murderous, but I'll just go with this for now) into a Freddy Fazbaer suit, it won't damage an endoskeleton, but with all those wires 'n crap in the suits, imagine what they would do to a person? Speaking of a person, guess what the Animatronics think humans are? (hint: An Endoskeleton)The establishment is in decline, after multiple lawsuits and events (including an infamous event where a man dressed up in a Freddy Fazbear costume and kidnapped and murdered children) it's low on funding, kids and their parents aren't as willing to come to if after the public events, and the whole thing is expected to be closed by the end of the year.Because of this state, they have a limited nightly electricity budget meaning that you have only a limited amount of energy with which to do things such as check the cameras, light up the hallways that lead to your office, and close the doors to prevent the animatronics from stuffing you into a suit, with limited power comes with the fact that closing the doors would mean you're wasting it, and you thus need to leave yourself exposed if you don't want the power to go off as Freddy sings to you his Toreador music box before he ends your night abruptly.The game has a dark setting, a terrifying atmosphere, and is a great title, everything from the dark hallways to the animatronics themselves, everything about this game is great, you're going to be blown away by the subtle yet terrifying world this game is set in, with rumors still circulating about its mystical yet dark plot and background of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, you're going to love Five Nights at Freddy's.

												Like Undertale, this game has a Napoleon Complex fanbase. It's at that size where it's not small enough to be quiet but too small to create a fanbase that doesn't smother people who come into contact with it. Between that fanbase and the jumpscares, it's really easy to take these games for granted. Which is a shame, because they're genuinely good and unique in a lot of ways. The design and gameplay are simple and stylized really well. The jumpscares really are the weakest part of the game, but chances are you'll learn to accept it. Scott still knows how to evoke a sense of fear and dread between the background noise and the impending danger. Everything is very eerie in general. If you don't figure out the backstory, you'll have it spoiled to you. It's by far the most uncomfortable part of the game. Like Undertale, let the experience be your own and have fun with it. And if you can handle it, the fanbase really can be fun. Just try to find the fans that are fair.			"

Slap on some diapers and grab your drink of choice because you're about to get ready for the night of your life.

												Let me start by saying I NEVER write reviews. I mostly just let other people do it, and I will read them when I need to. However not only has the game blown me away, but the creator has aswell. So I am very picky about scary games, I like the idea of constantly being scared but I also find constant popups repetitive and at some point boring. This game is NEVER slow, you are constantly waiting for what will happen next. It has a mix of pop ups that are unique and at some points you just go, ""♥♥♥♥♥♥ I know its coming, and I'm ♥♥♥♥ed."" This is a game I make every one of my friends play when they come over. There isn't a huge story plot, but enough to make you go, ""This is ♥♥♥♥ing terrifying."" and Spoiler Alert? When you get to Night 7, you can customize how hard different characters will be, AMAZING! I bought the game on a platform similiar to Steam which I won't name but with little to no research you can guess what it is. I only used this platform for the game, and hated it otherwise. I emailed the creator asking if he would give me a key to get the game on steam so I could delete this horrible game launcher. He sends me a code within an hour. No hassle at all! This guy is truly amazing and I can't wait for what he has to come. Everyone buy this game!			"

												As a child, I loved going to Freddy Fazbear's Pizza and watching him sing while Bonnie Bunny and  Chica Chicken played music as I filled my mouth with his cheesy delicious pizza love. When I turned 18, I was short on money so I got the latest newspaper and checked out it's jobs for hire section. My eyes became wide and pants tightened when I saw there was an opening as a night watch guard at Freddy Fazbears Pizza. I ran to the phone, called the number listed and after a quick interview, I got the job. I still had Freddy figurines, posters and pins laid out in my attic, enclosed in a secret room where I built my Freddy Fazbear Shrine. My prized lifesize Freddy doll laid there as well, who I would whisper to occasionally and caress gently until I fell asleep. After all these nights of praying to Freddy, he answered me. I must not dissapoint him. I began by ordering pizza. When it arrived I let it cool and rubbed the slices, slowly, all over my naked body, being very careful not to miss covering Freddy's favorite spots. The scent of pizza pleases him. I was ready and left my house. When I got there, it was clear the doors were left open for me. At 11:59 I entered the office. Then clock had struck 12:00 AM. I was ready for Freddy. As I began to undress I heard noises coming from the Dining hall. After removing the last of my undergarments, I checked the cameras and saw that the bunny and chicken had smelt my cheese and tomatoe sauce covered body first. ""NO"" I said, ""THIS IS FOR FRED"". I checked the band stage and realized Freddy was not there, He heard. I glanced at the cameras again. Bonnie was coming down the left hall and the Chica was in the kitchen. Suddenly the cameras to my right went down. Freddy was here. Just as I was going to go out for him, all the lights shut off. This was perfect. He knew how to set the mood.... he knew how...I liked it. Frantically, I dropped to the floor, got on my knees and bent over. I cried out ""THIS FOR YOU FREDDY"". I saw his face, his LED eyes shined between my thighs and the Freddy Fazbear theme began playing out of his speakers. Tears of joy began streaming down my cheeks. His pizza dispensing pipe began extending out from his pelvis. One thrust and he began filling me with his delicious pizza love. I woke up in a Bear suit and couldnt feel my legs. 10/10 Freddy is loveFreddy is life			"

												I'm a little surprised at the overwhelming positive response Five Nights at Freddy's has gotten. I suppose I can understand it's entertaining at first glance, but a lot of the reviews I've read have play times mostly less than an hour or two, and some admit they didn't get further than Night 3, which is totally understandable, post-Night 3 was probably where the entertainment factor dropped off for me and the game became an exercise in tedium. And then I played it for 6 or 7 more hours just to try to finish the thing out of obligation. Anyways, let me get this out of the way:The game is innovative. The reason it's gotten as popular as it has is because it's a fresh take on a genre that sadly has been dragging its feet lately. I'd absolutely love to see more Horror games try new things like this, and it's not bad that people are experimenting with new ways to convey interactive horror. I'm just as sick of seeing cheap-quality episodic Amnesia knock-offs and ""Collect-Items-While-Monster-Stalks-You"" romps as anyone else, but I still have severe enough gripes with Five Nights that I really can't give it a recommendation for anything other than as a very temporary novelty.If you intend on fully experiencing this game, prepare for the possibility of a good couple hours failing the same night over, and over, and over. Seriously the 9 hours I spent on this were mostly Nights 4, 5 and 6, I eventually gave up at 6 because I decided the payoff was seriously not worth my time.As it turns out, Five Night's idea of using energy management to build tension just doesn't work in its favor in the long-term. Once you boil the game down to its base mechanics, all the charm falls away really quickly, because there's a pretty limited amount to see, a very limited amount to do, and the strict limit on how much energy you can afford to waste on the latter nights becomes unrealistically tight to the point where if you don't play almost perfectly to each situation, and the AI is uncharacteristically passive for its activity level at those later points, you are often destined to lose before you're a little more than halfway through the night.There's not much more frustrating than fending off your aggressive attackers for 10 minutes straight, only to realize you've failed the night because Bonnie wouldn't leave the door alone, or because Foxy made a run for you twice because you weren't watching Pirate Cove enough, or watching it too much.Read all the guides you want, learn all the animatronics' behaviors, that's what I tried to do once just winging it on my own wasn't working out, but Five Nights gets tough as♥♥♥♥♥♥by late-game, and intense difficulty in what should be a short overall playtime for the length of each night does not impact the horror aspect positively. A horror game does not flourish by treading over the same ground time and again, and that's essentially all that Five Nights can do once you've died a few times.The more time you spend with the game, the more you understand, the less likely it'll have anything new to scare you with, and once you hit that point all you have left is frustration that you can't save enough energy to last a couple seconds longer to the safety of 6 AM.Five Nights builds suspense very well, and its characters are fittingly creepy, but in the end it's always coming up to a couple different animations that play alongside the same exact sound clip with a different model shaking in your face. It loses its edge, and fast. Especially once you learn the tells, like if your wall panel stops working and you check your camera, or if Pirate Cove is empty and you check the West Hallway camera. You come to expect every death, and the only fear comes from how irritating and headache-inducing that damned screaming sound clip is.If you're looking for anything more than a novelty, something to spook friends with once or twice, you may find Freddy & Co. becoming a lot more frustrating than they ever were scary. However, if that's all you want, a quick little game to mess about with then uninstall and probably never play again, go for it. As for me, I've played enough of this thing to never really feel inclined to reinstall it. Also, it's getting a sequel? Come on...			"

												Moje česká recenze: http://www.playhit.cz/2014/10/five-nights-at-freddys-zli-medvidci/I'm not a fan of scary games, in fact I think we get enough horrors IRL so there is no need to terrify ourselves to death on computer. BUTT, there was something about Freddy that made me get it. Maybe the originality, or that it's single-handedly made, or that it's very simple and there's no need to learn complicated mechanics, I don't know. Probably all of them combined. Even after the little time I played, I still feel Freddy breathing over my shoulder every time I get up to use the toilet in the night. I bought it for 2€ and I'm happy I did. It's a unique experience, you don't run from the evil robots, you sit and close the door when they come. You better be sure they're coming though, otherwise your juice to keep the doors closed will run out and then you can only pray for the Sun to come up faster. 8.5/10 "

												Now this isn't the typical bash review it for not being scary when in horror genre. This is just me saying , I actually don't find it scary but too me it's not the scare factor I enjoy. I enjoy this game because it's trying something different, a unique approach to the horror gameplay. I had a blast playing this game and the game is oozing with atmosphere but it's not an atmosphere I find particulary scary.This game is fun and a blast to play but I actually wonder how many people are just playing up that it's super scary because they want to feel a part of the crowd whom do find it scary. I look forward to the sequel Scott has planned and now with all this do$h he can expand on the universe and story.			"

												After the initial hype of this game blew over, I sought about seeing what might lay behind the initial glitz and face-cam jumpscares of the typical YouTube Let'sPlayers out there. What I found was, quite evidently, a labour of love by creator Scott Cawthon.Aside from the kudos toward him for creating the game by his lonesome, it's evident that he's taken much effort to make the game as 'low-fi' as possible. The engine, Multimedia Fusion has been largely untouched since the mid-90s; upon ripping apart the game's files, you'll find all the graphics in the game are encoded in the original CompuServ GIF format - aptly debuting in 1987 (coinciding with the game's entirely ambiguous 'Bite of '87' of which you are informed of the first night); the sound is encoded in earlier versions of FruityLoops (even so far as to be from FLS1.1 - which has been largely unavailable outside of DOS discs from 1997), and even the infamous 'SCREEEE' sound when the animatronics pounce on you is, as far as I am aware, pulled from a public service announcement from the late-80s regarding child safety in the kitchen. Beyond the technical achievements (or rather, deliberate /under/achievements) of the game, the story is told outside of typical explained means, allowing the user to rely on breadcrumbs, theory and superstition - even going so far as to backmask portions of Paramahansa Yogananda's 'Autobiography of a Yogi' into the game's garbled ambience.Cawthon's done as much as possible to set the game's mood, and while its threats reside nigh-entirely in recyclable (and eventually predictable) jumpscares, the atmosphere, sense of isolation, memorable characters, and easily-grasped,  simple mechanics serve a purpose to make this a refreshing and, in a way, quite charming survival-horror game - of which I'm glad to hear will be sequelised.At £4, you could do far, far worse.

												Five Nights at Freddy's is a first person scare game that puts you in the position of a night watchman forced to stay alive five nights in danger of animatronic plush characters walking around. Your job is to survive from midnight to 6 AM.Its not a horrifying game, but the scares are done through the building tension of knowing the animatronics are out to get you and seeing where they are.The gameplay is simple, you are literally stuck in your one screen office, you can look left and right, when you point your mouse down, a series of monitor comes up that lets you look at one camera at a time. You click each camera individually and you'll see areas of the pizza place and where the animatronics are.There are two blind spots and those are directly to the left and right of your office, so there are two buttons. One button is for light to check what's directly outside your door. The other is the door button for when something is right outside your door! You have a door and a light on each side. You can't see both doors at the same time, which can result in jump scares.So why not just lock the doors and giggle at the fluffies trying to get in? The challenge to this game is that each night starts you at 100% power. Every moment drains your power slowly, every time you look at the monitor drains your power. When you turn on a light, that is more power too. Plus, the doors are magnetic, so using them really drains your power. Once you are out of power, everything turns dark and well its virtually game over.As the nights go on, there will be different animatronic characters you will be warned about. You will get phone calls at the start of every night explaining things. How certain animatronics will act, such as the fox will run at you if you don't check your cameras.For $5 it is a good diversion, even if the game is pretty dumb feature wise. New game or continue. No options, but at least you get to continue at the day you failed. A big plus is that the same night can still feel different. So there is a lot of replay, but keep in mind it is a quick game that is one screen with cameras in rooms. I bought it in a $2 bundle, you can too.			"

Not all things will go according to plan because they can be anywhere and everywhere in a heartbeat. So be aware and Welcome to Freddy's			"

												This review is the game itself. Not an over obsessed d*ck sucker, or the hater that thinks this game is worst thing ever because they don't like the attention this game has gotten.Many people have a fear of inanimate objects that come to life. This game plays on that fear, and that is why this game is popular. I, however, do not have this fear. But this game has challenge to it. 4/20 mode took me EIGHT FREAKING HOURS to beat. But i did it anyway because i like challenges, and i will not stop until my mission is complete. Foxy has made me jump a couple of times, but i am not scared of this game. I just like the time consuming challenges of defeating this game.Those are my thoughts on this game. I recommend it if you have a fear of animatronics, like to be scared, or like challenging games. Or all of the above.			"

												This is one of my favorite First Person Shooter games. It has a wonderful campaign and mutliplayer. In the campaign, you play as Paul Blart, a security guard for Freddy Fatbear's Bar & Grill. As a security guard, your job is to kill the minorities that try to break into the restaurant. Unfortunately, thanks to budget cuts, you are only equipped with Military-Grade Weaponry. You have to shoot the minorities, whose names are Fonzy Fredman, Cholo, b4nny, and Starfox. If you see them, you have to shoot them until they run off, because Military-Grade weapons only keep the minorities at bay. You have to be careful, because if you run out of ammo, the minorities will shank you and call you white racial slurs. There is a secret easter egg that replaces Fonzy Fredman with his cousin, Gay Rattlesnake. If this happens, he gives you a promotion and closes the game because that means you shouldn't be working that awful job anymore. In the multiplayer, you play as one of many different Nintendo characters in an all out brawl. Your job is to eliminate the competition in either time or stock matches. The winner climbs the bracket and eventually you can win 1st prize, which is called ""Grand Master ♥♥♥♥♥♥""I highly reccomend this game, as it has brought me many hour of enjoyment. I hope you like this game as much as I have			"

I know it can be a bit overwhelming, but I'm here to tell you there's nothing to worry about. Uh, you'll do fine. So, let's just focus on getting you through your first week. Okay?Just Keep an eye of those camera's as the animatronic characters do get a bit quirky at night. They're left in some kind of free roaming mode at night. Uh...Something about their servos locking up if they get turned off for too long. Also your room is fitted with lights to check outside your doors to see if there is anything unwanted, if there is close the doors and they soon leave.But hey, first day should be a breeze. I'll chat with you tomorrow. Uh, check those cameras, and remember to close the doors only if absolutely necessary. Gotta conserve power. Alright, good night.			"

												Before I start, I don't hate this game. Some people go on and say 'it's the worst game in the world', but there is MUCH worst games out there. So let's start with the FNAF's Pros then Cons.Pros:1, The conceptThe concept is quite fresh. A killer killed 5 kids and put them inside the animatronics and the souls of the kids posses the the animatronics, but nobody knows.2. The gameplayYou can't move which adds to the feeling of helplessness.Cons:1. The gameplayI know it makes you feel helpless in the pros, but the gameplay is quite bland, because all you are really doing is looking at cameras and closing door occasionally.2. The jumpscaresAt first the jumpscares are scary, because you don't expect it. That's what a jumpscare is. After a while it just gets annoying, because they are stopping you from progressing further into the game.To be honest, get this game if you want to. It's really up to opinon.			"

You really need to be on the ball to get through this game with your sanity intact and your pants dry. I'll admit, after watching videos of this game, I kinda already know what to expect, but I still had a jump here and there. Watching videos is one thing. Playing the game yourself is another.			"

												Not what i was expecting. You basically click on boxes to switch camera views while the animatronic characters switch screens.  While the atmosphere and narration is really good, there isn't enough gameplay.  Reminds me of some a game that could have come out in the early 90's, but for the current generation of games it's pretty underwhelming.  Overall it feels like playing a timed game of minesweeper in a scary room with creepy things around you. "

About The Game:Five Nights at Freddy's is a Twitch/Thriller adventure centered around Mike Schmidt, a faceless job seeker who just happened to find the perfect job with decent hours and as a bonus you earn below minimum wage! (You know the kind of job everyone is looking for!)Reguardless of the strange choice in job you chose, the game spans out as a very simple and very easily playable & basic designed game.What you believed to be really simple & easy work turns into one of the most horrific & difficult but 100% worth it times of your life.The Story:The story is really simple & i basically explained it above, you're a job seeker who found an ad in the paper about a really easy job being a security guard at Freddy's Fun Farm doing the late shift of a night that's a Monday - Friday.The Gameplay: You're to spend 6 hours a night in your little office doing the night shift at Freddy's Fun Farm as a Security Guard, the premise of the game is very simple, make sure that nobody intrudes into Freddy's during the night while trying to avoid the strange & earily creepy Freddy & his robotic friends as they roam the building during the night.Not everything is as peachy and friendly of a night time though as you'll soon find out because you're running on a timer during the night as power is scarce & you need to save the power as much as you can so that you can keep an eye on Freddy & his friends as they happen to be quite afraid of new people & tend to... well kill people who aren't familiar to them.Each night becomes increasingly difficult & not only that but it seems to take longer to complete each night, of course if that's not bad enough then you'll find comfort in the fact that Freddy & his friends become more and more active through the week & require a lot more thorough checking in order to avoid winding up like so many other Secutiry Guards before you.This game really relies on you to be 100% alert at all times & not only is hard to do that because you're constantly switching between camera's & checking outside your office doors but Freddy & his friends tend to just randomly screw with you on certain playthroughs by disabling the power to your doors or by disconnecting your cameras, not only do they do that but sometimes they completely obscure the camera vision with their evil smiles or to make things worse sneek into your office & while you're busy watching the camera's feel the need to scare the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you!Worst of all is when you're almost finished & you run out of power only to see Freddy's wonderful smile & hear his jolly music as he stares at you from the door way, at this point you're either very lucky as time ticks over or you're left in the dark awaiting Freddy's embrace as he rips the flesh from your bones.The Verdict:There are SOOO many good things i can say about this game but i don't have enough characters to type all of these things, and very few faults i can pick at with this game.Although this game is designed solid & it's scares are not those small little ""Oh i saw that coming but it still scared me"" scares they're truly terrifying when they happen because you never really know when you're going to get caught by Freddy or his friends & whenever you do it's generally off guard they catch you.The AI in this game although very simple is Flawless an it always manages to be challenging even if it's so simple & due to the randomization of the gameplay you never experience the same thing over and over.Sometimes the game can feel unfair when you're almost finished and run out of power, or when Freddy & his friends turn off the power to your doors so you can't close them, or even when Foxy just spawns outside of his cave and runs at you right in the beginning, but it never feels 100% cheap it is just the game really screwing with you and tormenting you, wanting you to continue but at the same time showing that you'll never be guarenteed a win even if you're so close.The setting in this game although simple is designed perfect to be creppy even if it is a few different static backgrounds quickly slapped together, it's a flawless attempt at making a horror experience and it works 100% without a doubt.I give this game a 10/10. And i give it this because there's really no flaws in it, it's just designed perfect in every way, The game is meant to be difficult & it achieves that by occasionally putting you in situations of intense thrills & other times you breeze through without even seeing Freddy or his friendsEven though the game is very much the same each time it makes the experience different each playthough so it gives it replay value & then there's the thrill of beating the levels and knowing that you've overcome the odds and made it through to the next day! Do I Recommend This Game?:Yes i do recommend this and i suggest that people buy this game because it's so damn cheap and a well worthy experience. What are you doing reading this now? GO AND BUY THE DAMN GAME!Other Games You Might Like:Amnesia: The Dark Decent:Amnesia offers you another great horror experience well worth checking out if you're a puzzle solver & like to run & hide rather than fight.Note: This game has no weapons you must hide if you wish to survive.Outlast & Whistleblower DLC:Outlast also offers an experience well worth playing through at least once as does it's Whistleblower DLC which ties in the original game so you get the full story as to what happened.Note: This game has no weapons you must hide if you wish to survive.My Review for Outlast: http://steamcommunity.com/id/Paddles01/recommended/238320/ "

												""Finally, An ad I can answer back to! Hm, let's see...120 a week...Yadda yadda, animatronics, hmhmhm...This'll be the easiest job ever.""Boys and Girls of all ages, I bring to you the game NIGHT TRAP on the Sega CD should have been: Five Nights at Freddy's.This game is so atmospheric, so creepy, and so tense that even my dogs jump in fright as the game gives me a game over screen. Using nothing but still images on a camera, some lights, and two doors, your job is to last 5 whole nights. ""Last five nights? From what? What's trying to kill you?""Freddy and his gang.These animatronics are unlike any other antagonist from any game I've played. If there is a phobia of animotronics dressed in mascot costumes, I have it now. The game tells you that instead of moving around the establishment, you must sit in the office, awaiting any who dare come your way. Watching the cameras for the robots to move, whilst watching either sides is a MUST. If you aren't careful, one of them might come into the room. And game over. What do they do to you? I won't say. Don't even look up the answer. You'de be doing yourself a HORRIBLE misfavor.You only have limited power, and sometimes, the lights and doors won't work. Key mechanics you should know right now.The only drawback I have with this game, is the jump-scares getting stale, repetitive, and annoying soon after. The game itself, though? Harmless enough.Have fun...Freddy'll keep you company...			"

Please note, I played the Desura version before purchasing on Steam.Five Nights at Freddy's is a hidden masterpiece in the Horror genre. Although it appears quite simple and even a little silly on the surface, what with Chuck E. Cheese mascots running amok, the actual game itself is very tightly made and exceptionally scary. I rate this above Amnesia and possibly even Silent Hill 2 for just how god awful it makes you feel.Your sense of paranoia escalates to levels I didn't even think possible. Your anxiety reaches new depths and the death scenes, even when you know they're coming after you suddenly remembered that you forgot to check the camera just outside your office, are bone chilling and are a rare example of a jump-scare that actually works and doesn't feel cheap!Once you look past the surface and notice all the tiny little nuances, all the little minute sounds the characters make and even figuring out the hidden lore behind everything, you realise just how much depth this game has, and it makes it just that little bit more unsettling.Of course, this game wont be for everyone, but if you're the kind of person who likes horror games that tap into your sense of paranoia with a nice spoonful of dread for good measure, and you appreciate subtlety rather than all guns blazing (ala Dead Space) then Five Nights at Freddy's will push your buttons in such a way that you'll never want them pushed again for fear of heart failure.Highly recommended. Now my favourite horror game without question.			"

												Before reading: this review is more of a neutral review than a not recommended review (which they should add) because I can't recommend it but it isn't garbage. I decided to buy it because almost everyone I know told me that it's the best horror game ever. I'll admit it's scary the first time you play it because you don't know when the jumpscares are coming and if they're scary, but then after the first couple of them you realize it's just the noise that makes you jump and the actual jumpscares aren't scary, it turns into a strategy game. You can see if a jumpscare is coming if ""it's me"" flashes on the security tablet thingy or if the power is off and if you see eyes flashing and hear music. After the first two or three levels it starts to become boring (play in bursts?). There was something I liked about the vague ending though. In conclusion, it's not bad, but not good either. It isn't really that scary to me, more adrenaline-rushing when I need to close the door fast (which needs power to close?!), so if you like strategy games with horror elements or something, then this is the game for you. and for the love of god... DO NOT search ""fnaf"" into deviantart unless you want to cringe or vomit.			"

												Ah... Another horror game... Let me guess, you're walking around, trying to find a certain thing, or get the hell out of a certain place?Yeah. How wrong that statement was. That's exactly what I said before I started this game up for the first time.In the end, you aren't walking around. In fact, you're doing the opposite. You're sitting in a claustrophobic, dark room. The only things accompanying you are a fan, a cupcake, a poster of Freddy ( With a honkable nose ), and a few pre-recorded messages.You aren't going out to find the antagonists, either. They are looking for you. ( And by the gods, are they shifty. )A magical place for kids and grown-ups alike, where fantasy and fun come to life... Yeah, get the carpet bleach ready. The animatronics who skulk the pizzaria may seem a bit friendly at first ( Or not, if you die on night 1 ); but trust me, those little demons aren't what they seem.But in all honesty, this may be one of the best horror games I've played in a very long time; it's definitely worth each dollar.And there's also a sequel coming out soon. The hype is real. "

Note: I got paid to write for reviews4views website.Five Nights at Freddys’ is a game about an employee who has to look after a pizza place that comes alive at the dead of night. As an employee of course you want to be paid so you're going to stubbornly stick to your seat and watch those monitors like a good lad and try to avoid dying. Surviving from 12 AM to 6 AM to get your paycheck sounds easy enough but it proves harder than it seems.The animatronics start in the same locations every night, three of them in the furthest room and one in Pirate's Cove with a total of four animatronics to monitor it can become hectic when they start to separate. Though while I say there is four to monitor there is also goldy freddy to be careful of especially when the poster changes. Foxy the one from  Pirate's Cove is the most mobile of the four and will have you checking on him from time to time to make sure he doesn’t dash straight for you. Management of your resources is utmost importance in order to survive the entire night, which also means not running out of battery. Battery is going to be your main weapon to fend off these animatronics. It’s used to not only lighten up the hallways to check if they are next to you but also to monitor their movement via cameras. This actually is well balanced to the degree where I had many close calls of nearly dying from running out but lasting just long enough to get the paycheck. I died several times on the first night, if it wasn’t for the fact I died I would be fired quickly for just being overall bad at my job.. Having tools to fend yourself helps but in a sense its only there to “delay” the jumpscare unless you make it to 6 am, if you are unable to the tension will explode from the building climax especially when the music box starts to play at 5 AM. The game is basically relays on your mind to play tricks on you and to build up fear for the “one” moment you know can come at any time especially if you let your guard down.Once you beat all the nights there is a custom mode you can play to increase the ai of the robots up to 20. Which allows you to try the most challenging part of the game. At this point however your less scared of the game and more in it for the challenge of it all. You will most likely already establish a routine like many others have that helps you keep control of the situation and power manage the animatronics properly, so that you won’t be killed. The overly major problem this game suffers really is ultimately finding a good routine will diminish the tension you had when you first started. Going into this game without a clue is really the best way to get value of it. Figuring it out step by step really gives it a better experience however once you get there the only real fun thing that remains is beating the custom night with all the AI on 20. The premise of the game and the simplicity really make it standout and is quite accomplishes what it set out to do. The mechanics handle fairly well and are balanced to the point where you will see many videos of others and myself barely surviving the night multiple times regardless how well we try to balance our energy usage. The game is great for the tension that leads up to the jump scares though this diminishes towards the end and ultimately becomes about the challenge I still found the experience well worth the money.

												If you ignore the fandom (which I had no idea even existed until long after I finished with this first title) this is a fun game. The lore/story has to be inferred and guessed at, but it's actually deeper than you'd think for a game like this. Creepy atmosphere, nerve-wracking moments... This game is worth the asking price, in my opinion. You play as a nighttime security guard at a family themed pizza parlor with animatronics. Your task is to survive the night. You're given access to cameras all around the building, and you have two doors on either side of you that you can shut (at the cost of power, for some weird reason) and lights you can turn on and off to check the darkness.It's a very simple set of gameplay mechanics, but there's also something deeper - you can't just close the doors and wait for daylight, obviously, or you'll run out of power very quickly, and then you're screwed. The camera system is vital to gameplay - you need to monitor certain rooms, and sound cues also help you figure out when things are... changing. A rather cerebral game for such an incredibly simple premise. Jumpscares still manage to be freaky after all this time. Probably because of the earsplitting sounds, but hey - that's part of the fun. In summary: Ignore the creepy fandom surrounding this game and perpetuated by lonely 12-year-olds who completely miss the point that this is supposed to be creepy and not some kind of furry lovefest. If you can get past that, it's actually pretty great. I suggest watching the ""Game Theories"" video about it (part 1 and 2) but ignoring every other video on their channel.			"

												First day: Waited listening to a rather nice gentleman about the job I had just accepted. Then at 2 a.m a Carebear's face popped up so I thought nothing of it. I then looked at the cameras and saw a drunk looking bunny rabbit and Big Bird from sesame street walking around and some rat/fox looking animal pearing out of a cage, thats when I realised I made some pretty poor life choices by playing this game then for the next couple of game hours I felt poo slowly slipping out of my bottom. Then the time ticked to 6 a.m and I magically felt that poo get sucked right back up.Day two: Listened to the rather nice gentleman again and thought to myself well maybe it was all in my imagination untill I looked at the cameras and saw the rat/fox animal running down the corridor towards me, that is when I thought to myself I am so f*cked so I shut off the cameras then closed the door... yet me being the pillock I am I closed the wrong door. Then the rat/fox animal jumped into the room and screamed like a pregnant woman giving birth..... and at the time the poo what I had managed to keep inside my bottom was now inside my pants and I learned a lesson don't get a job at a place where killer robot roam on my work shift and don't play anymore of this game.10/10 Would poo myself again			"

												Just got done playing Five nights at Freddys. Jump scares allways get me. I played with my boyfriend who was more afraid then I was. We took turns on each day. Starting with the first day made me finish with day five. It was scary but became predictable as you notice the patterns. First I notice you're good until 1 am. Checking the cameras when you hear foot steps helps as well as checking only 4 rooms near by are the most helpful and energy efficent. Overall It was a good scare. "

												Ok....so how I do start this off....Well welcome to Freddy's Pizza a place where if you bring a child there is a 80% chance he will be eaten alive LITERLALY by ROBOTS! YAY!But really though here is my review of this game.Ok so first off this game is FUN and yes I mean FUN as in it will keep you motivated and interested to keep playing until you complete a full week and earn that $120.00 Check.So first off you start as a Guard that works a night shift at Freddys Pizza and you are surrounded with 3...uhhhh I mean't 4 robots that will basically want to stuff you into a suit full of metal which would be pretty damn bad.....Although there is a good news with this bad news, you luckily are provided with Metal doors that you can lockdown when a robot attempts to Assaul....Rap....You know just kill you.So what are the Pro's and Con's of this game?Pro: -Scary but rather fun.-Always a surprise around the corner (Literally)-Will keep you interested.Con:-There is a glitch where you can survive the Teddy by simply brigning up your camera when he shows upSo uhhhh..... That's it, hope you enjoy the game and I mostly hope you enjoy risking your life for $120.00 a week....Goodbye.			"

												Welcome to your shift at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a pizza diner place built in the early 90s. At first the animatronics are creepy, but they're welcoming. You apply for the Night Shift, where Freddy & Friends aren't as welcoming.From 12 to 6, you must fend off the animatronics from coming to your door and putting an end to your night. But how? Tactics in the games vary- This game has you shut doors and flick on lights to prevent them from coming in.Shutting doors blindly will get you nowhere, and shutting the lights may be required to check for animatronics. And you may not like what happens if on the later nights you keep both doors closed...You can also monitor the building, to check on the animatronics before they attack. Check out a guide I made on how to win. With limited power, vision, and hope, can you survive till' dawn for five nights?(get it if you love horror games. that's all i have to say.)			"

												Despite the simple control scheme, this game is truly terrifying. The problem isn't that it's really scary, because it isn't really. The thing that gets to you is the PRESSURE to get EVERYTHING right and EVERYTHING perfect. For example. When they get you, it sure is scary, but the scarier thing is the KNOWLEDGE that they're coming for you in the first place. Stressful and scary - best psychological horror 2014.			"

												Time for Five Nights at Freddy's from an older gamer's perspective...If you like games that you can play in short spurts that also have that have the calming effect of a good adrenalin rush - and you find the robots at Chuck E. Cheese or your terrifying moments of youth at Showbiz Pizza Place well....terrifying, then Five Nights at Freddy's just might be up your alley.Initially I wrote the game off seeing the banner on a web search because it sounded like some kind of sleepover mystery puzzle solving game with cartoon animals - oh boy was I wrong!  A family friend's son introduced it to me after seeing that my old Atari games looked like a particular element of the sequel (I collect Atari 2600 games, that should tell you how old I am).So lo and behold I got introduced to a NEW game franchise finally, and the nice part is I could actually sink my teeth into it because it did not require hours upon hours of learning how to play the darned thing, and I could play it in short spurts.The genius behind Five Nights at Freddy's is that it's a very simple game that's easy to learn, but tough to master.  On one hand, it's pretty obvious after the night 1 phone call what can be done to defend yourself, what is not obvious though is how to properly impliment the resources given to a particular strategy to survive six in game hours a night while the Animatronics hunt you down for whatever reason it is they hunt you down for.  This sort of gameplay element to me feels like it's a lost art in today's mainstream game landscape.  This is a HUGE reason this game got so popular.The atmosphere of the game is perfectly punctuated by the graphics and sound.  It really does feel like one is sitting in a delapidated old Childrens Entertainment Pizzaria that's been around since the early 80's without a remodel (or apparently a Janitor, seems Bonnie sees the cleaners more than the cleaner guys do).  All of the animatronics carry that friendly yet somehow undertow sinister tone to them.  Fans whir, the sound of aging electrical devices buzz and fizzle, the animatronics themselves though kind of sound more like some guy in black coming to take you away than some kind of creepy cartoon robot seeking to stuff you into a suit.What's also nice is how the violence is implied, but not overdone, keeping the series appealing to a broader audience than usual - meaning I don't have to put a password on this when my family comes around, nor do I feel really strange for playing a game full of cartoon animals.  Another nice plus is this early in the series, the lore is not the primary focus of the game, the gameplay is, so you can dive as deep into the lore as you want (or as little as you want), and still enjoy the game regardless.An impressive bit to think though how this game generated so much attention and eventually grew to have multiple sequels, a freebie RPG spinoff (FNaF World), and now quite a lot of merch (Freddy and co were stalking me through the stores all through X-mas 2016).  And it was all done by one guy - a Christian game dev and animator working at a humble chain store at the time.  It really does show you don't need a 1000 person team and a million dollar budget to make a good game, and as a retro-gamer I'm rather tough on that part of things.  I like seeing my games in my collection as ""art"" rather than as some kind of major marketing effort.Overall, I highly reccommend this title.  While it's not some bloody gorefest like some horror games, it has that magic to it that an old Disney or Looney Tunes cartoon has - a little something for everybody, without veering too far in one direction or the other.

												Five nights at freddys,a survial based, horror game,the point of the game is that, you are a night secrity guard named mike schmidt who must watch over the robot animals from 12am to 6am, however, the robotic animals get a little....""frisky"" at night, so when they see a person around that time, they dont see them as humans, they see them as robotic exo-skeletons, and will attempt to capture you and put you in a robotic costume. dosent seem so bad right? guess again, the robot costumes are Filled with sharp metal parts, wires and barbed wire-liked objects mostly around the facial reigon. and you only have your security doors, lights and cameras to keep them at bay. But the city does not support the building during the night time, so it uses a generator limiting your power, so use it wisely.id rate this game a 9/10 and id suggest this to all who like horror style games.and if your planning on buying this....one bit of advice, Watch out for pirate cove...

												First, let me start off by saying this is a GREAT game. If you can get past the increasingly cancerous fanbase and look at this game as a horror game, then you SHOULD be able to tell it's different for the genre.The core objective of this game is to survive the onslaught of Freddy Fazbear, Chica the Chicken, Bonnie the Bunny, and Foxy the Pirate Fox. While the base game includes numerous jumpscares, the atmosphere is what truely gets me. The paranoia of just knowing that Foxy could charge your door at any given moment, or that Freddy may be lurking just around the corner. Just that instinctive feeling of knowing that you could be killed at any given moment by the animatronics somewhat petrifies me. The only thing saving you is your own wits and a door.I would 100% recommend this game to somebody who wants something different in a horror game. Great concept, decent execution.9/10.			"

Watch's camera's, starts getting nervous.The man then says something about the doors using power.Looks at power remaining....23%....Looks at time.... 2AM...Starts to panic a bit.Goes back to camera's.See's that the duck was gone.Instantly closes out of the game and stops recording software.Feels ashamed of myself.10/10, still plans to finish the Let's Play.

												Short but suspenseful. Don't listen to the naysayers, it's more than just checking cameras and closing doors when bots get near you. You have to learn their patterns and habits, and you'll get mauled a bunch of times along the way. There is some randomness to the enemies, adding a bit of replay value, and after you've beaten the game you can make your own custom-difficulty night, including the very difficult 20/20/20/20 challenge, every animatronic set to maximum. The horror is mostly jumpscares, but the nature of the gameplay keeps you on your toes, especially when you lose track of an enemy and you wonder if you're about to get pounced. A good example of what simple but fun games can come out of Greenlight imo.			"

Chuck E Cheese♥♥♥♥♥♥Dungeon - An Official Waffle King Review~Find more here.[lordwaffleking.com](Edited to fit the text limit)If you've been anywhere on the internet you've probably seen something of Five Nights at Freddy's. Or if you walked around a mall in a really white neighborhood, and saw some little 8 year old fat kid wearing a t-shirt with Five Nights at Freddy's on it, that's an easy way to learn that it exists too. It's a meme, no doubt about it. Let's not beat around the bush about it. Becoming a meme is a double-edged sword to an indie upstart. On one hand, everyone on the internet will know you. Whether they like it or not. On the other hand, not liking it is very common, and they're always on par with or more passionate than the ones that like you.Aside from being the dankest meme of 2014, Five Nights at Freddy's is a humble little survival-horror game. It didn't exactly have it easy. Imagine you're an indie guy, trying to make a game. And people like you. They really like you. But, oh, now they're making furry porn of your characters, and, oh, now they're making cringey memes of your game. Now everyone hates you. Now all of your hard work will forever be remembered as degenerate furry garbage. That's exactly what you get for using anthropomorphic animal characters for your game you ♥♥♥♥ing furry.In Five Nights at Freddy's, you're tasked with staying alive in a Chuck E Cheese full of♥♥♥♥♥♥machines. They want to stuff you in a fur suit and yiff you to death. With no escape, you lock yourself in your office and try to survive the night by closing the doors and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ yourself. Conceptually, it's definitely different. It's not a zombie-ridden stereotype fest. It's not a cheap knockoff of another horror game. It's unique. It's almost like a genre that the game industry rarely taps into has come to life through this. The wonderful world of horror B-movies. Are they meant to be scary? Yeah, a little. Are they? Sometimes. But they're more than that. They're fun. They don't take themselves too seriously. Or they take themselves too seriously, to the point where no one else can take them seriously. That's kinda where this game falls, between those.It's easy to see that this game is low-budget. It was developed by one man, and he's not a billionaire. This ain't Bill Gates. He's off in Africa somewhere carrying small African children on his back like a spider, trying to find the fountain of youth and wrestle lions that keep attacking his villages. This game came up from the streets. It's not a very pretty game. The art style works. But it's just not done very well. It's definitely dark, and atmospheric, and gets you in the mood to yiff♥♥♥♥♥♥♥with murderous robots. It gets the job done. But you can see visible warping in the environment as you move around. And you can't really move much in the game anyway, you're stuck in a room defending yourself from furries, so it's not like they had a lot of environments to design. The least they could've done was make the one room you're stuck in look nicer.At the same time, the art style seems to help make the game. Something about the entire game's slightly off appearance makes it creepier. It invokes the uncanny valley feel, and in a way seems fitting when you consider it's a game about animatronics. Which are creepy as ♥♥♥♥ to stare at. Their lifeless, mechanically blinking eyes.... Its mouth, hinging and unhinging unnaturally, as it sings you Happy Birthday in a southern American accent... It's vile. Disgusts me in a deep, spiritual way. It's just wrong. Animatronics are just a crime against the greater good. Yes, this game is very personal to me. I stopped going to Chuck E Cheese a long time ago. We don't talk about it anymore.The atmosphere and feel are done very well, as low-budget as the game may be. The core mechanics tie directly into the tense feel of the game. Or rather, mechanic, as there's only really one game mechanic. All you can really do in the game is check cameras, open lights, and close doors. You're a security guard locked in a room. You check your cameras to make sure you know where your horny robot friends are. If they're not where you can see them, you open your lights. If you don't♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants, turn off the lights. If you do, make sure you close the door or else you're dead. That's the game in a nutshell. Incredibly simple, yes. It's not a complex game. But there's beauty in subtlety and minimalist design. The fact that you have very little control over what's happening builds the tension. You're helpless in the truest of senses. All you can do to stop death is check to make sure it's not there, and if it is, close the door. And not only that, your defense is crippled even further by your limited resources. Everything you do will consume electricity. And should you run out, you suddenly can't do things anymore. Which leaves you at the mercy of the robots.It's an incredibly tense game. It's paranoia-inducing, and drives home a sense of terror. And yes, when the monster gets you, he pops out and goes ""Boo"" like monsters do. Five Nights at Freddy's thrives on the jump-scare. Is that a bad thing? Yes and no. They definitely do rely on it. But jump-scares are a staple of horror. Everyone uses them. Do they use it a little too much? Yes. The game can be summed up with ""I looked in the spot. The monster was in the spot. Nope. I'm not looking in that spot ever again. Let's just turn this game off and go take a long shower. Forever.""The jump-scares are done decently. They're adequate pay-off, but the tension is the best part. The stress, fear, and paranoia are the things that make this game great. Not the jump-scares. They're scary, yeah. But they definitely do bring with a little baggage. As the nights go on, you'll find yourself being assaulted more often. The patterns that the animatronics follow will get mixed up, and they'll be more active. A lot more tense when suddenly they're not where you expect them to be and actually right there in the room with you. But at the same time, dying much more often for the sake of difficulty can also be frustrating.A good jump-scare is like taking it up the butt. You can't rush it. You need lube, you need to go slow, and you need to be in the mood. No matter how ready you think you are, it's gonna surprise you when suddenly there's something in your butt that shouldn't be there. When done right, it's an enjoyable experience for everyone. But when suddenly it's happening too often, too fast, and when you're not in the mood, you're not gonna be happy. You're just gonna have♥♥♥♥♥♥♥up your butt and be very upset about it. That's how Five Nights at Freddy's starts to feel at the end. Not to mention the jump-scare is a little ridiculous. It sounds like a baby pterodactyl. Or maybe like you stuffed a box full of gerbils into a wood-chipper. But, as Five Nights at Freddy's sort of embodies the horror B-movie, I feel like how stupid it comes across as is really just part of the fun. No one is actually really terrified by the Killer Klowns from Outer Space. It's all part of the fun. The people tearing this game up about how ""dis game is so bad, i showed babby and didnt even cry, 0/10 not scary, anoyone that older than 2 year old do not buy"" miss the point.If you can't appreciate the nature of a bad horror movie, this might not be for you. It's not a perfect game. It's clearly low-budget and gets by on cheap thrills. But to neglect the clever mechanics that promote paranoia and fear in unique ways because people enjoy it is stupid.It's like watching amine. You don't tell normal people that you enjoy it. It's just a secret that you talk to your loser internet friends about. You can wear your Five Nights at Freddy's t-shirt in the safety of your own home. In your closet, when your parents aren't home, while you jack off to furry porn.I won't tell anyone you do it. It's okay.			"

												I need to clarify something right here, right now. This is a game you either like or dislike, that is obvious.I am not a horror fan, I hate being jumpscared, I have actually played very little of any of the games in this extremely popular series. Yet I am a big fan of the series because like most fans like me, appreciate the lore of the games and how far the games have come. I mean this is a series created by a single near unknown developer and within 1 1/2 years has become so popular that there is now: 4 games, a spin-off title, a novel and a movie in the works. Along with billions of views on Youtube, a line of Merchandise and about a thousand knockoff titles.This is exactly what happened with Minecraft! And that gets roughly the same about of criticism thrown at it. I agree that the fanbase is..... bad. But there is a large amount of it that are brilliant like the Theorists, Song writers, Youtubers, animators and artists.I know that i am going to get a lot of s*** from this review. But I dont really care, all I ask is for people to show a little respect for the little game that has changed not only the horror genre but gaming and gamers as a whole.OK with that clarified, Im going to start the review.It's doesnt have the best graphics nor the best gameplay. But it is the story that keeps some players coming back for more.It does have that initial scare factor, but it will wear off after an hour or 2 once you have learned the patterns. But it is a refreshing take on the traditional horror game, rather than a walking down a dark hall simulator, you are unable to move and the tension comes from know that something is coming but you don't know when and what is coming.Horror fans will as i said either love it or hate it.It is a good game, it's innovative, but it wont appeal to everyone. That is just how the industry works... EDIT: Best make that 5 Games now.....  Good luck MatPat			"

												Why I love Five Nights at Freddy’s 1 Now like many of you I was a skeptic for this game. I thought: Surely this game isn’t that scary. So I bought the first game.I click new game and was greeted with the following message from phone guy.“Hello? Heeeelloooo! Uhhh, I wanted to record a message for you to help you get settled in on your first night. Umm., I actually worked in that office before you. I’m...finishing up my last week now as a matter of fact so...I know it can be a little overwhelming, but i’m here to tell you: there’s nothing to worry about, uhh, you’ll do fine! So...let’s just focus on getting you through your first week. Ok?” I thought oh how nice. At least this guy’s friendly.	“uh...let’s see. First there’s an introductory greeting from the company i’m supposed to read. Eeh it’s kind of a legal thing, you know. ‘Welcome to Freddy Fazzbear’s Pizza: a magical place where kids and grown-ups alike, where fantasy and fun come to life. Fazzbear entertainment is not responsible for damage, property or person. Upon the discovery of the damage or death of the third, a missing person’s report will be filled within ninety days or as soon as property and premise have been thoroughly cleaned and bleached and the carpets have been replaced. Blah, blah, blah.”At this point it started to get ominous. I thought: “What do you MEAN death?!” “Now that might seem bad, I know, there’s really nothing to worry about. Uhh, the animatronic characters here do get a bit quirky at night, but do I blame them? No! If I were force to sing...those same stupid songs for twenty years and I never got a bath? I’d probably be a bit irritable at night too. So remember: these characters hold a special place in the heart of children. You need to show them a little respect. Right? Ok.” It was at this point I fell in love with the animatronics and I even felt bad for them.“So just be aware: the characters do tend to wander a bit. Uhh, they’re left with some kind of ‘free-roaming mode’ at night. Uhhh...something about their servos locking up if they get turned off for too long. Uhh...they used to wander during the day too, but then there was the bite of eighty seven. Yeah...i-it’s amazing that the human body can live without the frontal lobe, ya know?” At this point I got the chills. I froze with fear.  “Now concerning you’re safety: the only real risk to you as the night watchmen here, if any, is the fact that these characters...uhh, if they happen to see you after hours probably won’t recognize you as a person. They’ll-they’ll most likely see you as a metal endo-skeleton without its costume on.”This calmed me down a bit. I thought “Oh well that doesn’t sound too bad.” “Now, since that’s against the rules at Freddy Fazzbear’s Pizza, they’ll probably try to...forcefully stuff you inside a Freddy Fazzbear suit. Umm, now that wouldn’t be so bad if the suits themselves weren’t filled with crossbeams, wires, and animatronic devices, especially around the facial area, so you can imagine how having your head forced inside one of those could cause a bit of discomfort...and death. Uhh...the only parts of you that would likely see the light of day again would be your eyeballs and teeth would pop out the front of the mask. ...Yeah they don’t tell you these things when you sign up...”And with this the fear was back. “WHAT?!” I screamed.	“But hey! First day should be a breeze, I’ll chat with you tomorrow, uhh, check those cameras, and remember to close the doors only if absolutely necessary. Gotta conserve power. Alright. Goodnight.”And with this the gameplay started. One of the first things I noticed was that I can’t move. That was truly terrifying. At least in other horror games you can run away from the things trying to kill you.I checked the cameras as I was supposed to. Everything was fine until 3 am. That’s when it really got ominous. One was missing. So the guy wasn’t crazy after all. I wasn’t really paying attention to him, though I did listen so I was lost.I figured it out but at four a.m. I experienced my first jumpscare: Bonnie.He was the first one to kill me and because of that I fell in love with him.My second jumpscare was Freddy. Freddy was just meh for me. He was just a big teddy bear for me.Next was Foxy. Oh man Foxy. I froze when I heard him bag on the door, and when he screamed bloody murder at me, I jumped back what felt like teen feet.I never did get Chica or Golden Freddy though.			"

												What I liked about this game is that at first I didn't think this game would be scary at all. I mean, just look at that cute purple bunny!... Then that cute purple bunny scared the living mess out of me once I saw him peeking into the door. It's a great game to keep ya on your toes! And after the 'cute' haunted critters get you, you might even giggle a bit because you're like 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaah ya got me'. Until you start getting into it. Then it's not scary anymore. It's more determination to beat the game.			"

												Great spoopy game. The only downside I can think of is that most of scares this game has to offer are jumpy ones. Meaning that  climax moments are screamers. But overall, horror games should scare you and this game sure reaches that goal.			"

												Five Nights at Freddy's is a pretty fresh and interesting concept for the horror genre, I really recommend it as an experience it was pretty fun and it's well priced, the jump scares are fun but sadly the novelty value does get old very quickly and it's not something you will play more than once.I really have to say that if you're looking for some deep or intricate gameplay you shouldn't be fooled by the whole ""Security camera"" system this game showcases, the gameplay itself becomes really redundant once you realize you only need to check a single camera (Pirate Cove) to prevent a certain animatronic from leaving its spawn and you can just check both doors in a loop.(See:

												Have you ever been to Chuck E. Cheese's and was horrified to go near the animatronic due to it looking like one of Satan's angels? Well, what if I told you that he walks around at night and kills the working security guard, which is most likely you. That's this game in a nutshell. You're a security guard at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza and you wish you could've picked a better job over this because the animatronics in that hell-hole walk around and will kill ANYONE inside the resturant after hours and the only one there is YOU. Just keep an eye on the cameras, watch the doors, and get your pay. If you follow instructions you might survive. MIGHT!			"

Stir the melted butter into the mashed bananas.Mix in the baking soda and salt. Stir in the sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract. Mix in the flour.Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan. Bake for 1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes (check at 50 minutes) at 350°F (175°C), or until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean.Remove from oven and cool completely on a rack. Remove the banana bread from the pan. Slice and serve. (A bread knife helps to make slices that aren't crumbly.)oh, also the game is spooky.			"

												Hello, fleshling. You will love this game, or hate it. But that depends on your subjective and partial view of it. FN@F was developed by Scott Cawthon using Clickteam Fusion 2.5 as engine. The controls are fairly simple, you only use your Left Mouse Button and there are only 5 interactive objects (well, 6, but that last one is a small Easter Egg played for laughs). You can't move from your position, and instead only look on your left or on your right. The basic mechanics are fairly simple too: your goal is to survive from 12AM to 6AM each night, avoiding being caught by the suspiciously free-roaming Animatronics. Easy? Well, yes, the first night is easy; after that, the difficulty increases exponentially each night, introducing new enemies and improving their AI, even actively adapting to your survival tactics. And of course, it's not only a matter of using the correct control at the right time: it's a matter of using them with moderation. Yes, because all you do requires power, and your power supply is limited. Very limited. You don't want a blackout occurring on the job.This is Creepypasta material: NO SPOILERS, but the story is NOT a long one, but hell, when you realize it, good luck sleeping. It may require some maturity and sometimes patience to understand it. Some theories are still open.One last thing: the game is priced 4.99$. If you think it's too much, you must be in a desperate situation and you have all my sympathy. So, for your information, there actually is a DEMO on Moddb. And it's Free.However, considering you have internet for reading this, supposedly a home and PC, electricity, water and I hope for you food, then 4.99$ shouldn't be too much for you.			"

												Do you like horror games? Do you like GOOD horror games? Don't buy this.Okay, before I rant on about this, let me say this: This review is in no way affected by the fandom, and I do not rate a game by it's fandom. First off, the gameplay. The controls feel awkward. This takes place in a first person perspective, right? In order to turn your head, you have to move the cursor to the different side of the screen. Which makes for poor sensitivity. Don't bring the controls of console FPS games to the PC, there's a good reason why console FPS games suck: There's a deadzone.Also, the buttons, for the lights, are very awkward. In order to leave a light on, I'd expect to hold it, but no. You have to use it like a toggle. Sometimes, I find myself wasting power by turning and forgetting to click to turn off the light.Oh, and the laptop, don't get me started on the laptop. In order to pull it out, you have to hover the mouse over it. Sometimes, if I move over to the other door to check, I accidentally pull the laptop out, then I ""die"".The graphics look awful. Why is it that it looks like the background is just a wallpaper wrapping the inside of a tube. It looks distorted and disorienting. Also, even though the game plays in 1080p on my monitor, it looks like 480p. One of the worst things in here is the lack of settings or pause. If you can't see crap, then too bad, you're going to have to deal with the automatic gamma correction. Need to take a crap in the middle of a game? Pressing ESC will only shut the game down. Also, everyone says it's scary. I think the enemies look plain dumb. And if you happen to get screamed at by one of them, I don't get a heart attack, they just make me angry. It just plays the same old trope of something screaming at you from a poorly lit room. How original.I give it a 30%. It's terrible. Save your money and buy a better horror game, like System Shock 2, Doom 3, or I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream. Those games are actually scary, and if you surgically removed their spookiness, they would still be fun.By the way, I think the sequels are bullcrap too. They made so many of them in a short amount of time. Three games in seven months. And they all play similarly to each other. You know how people on the internet complain about Call of Duty having too many repetitive sequels released every year? Imagine if they done that for every 2.33 months. At least Call of Duty is somewhat fun compared to this garbage, by far I'd rather have CoD than FNAF. At least CoD has a redeeming factor for being a game: Gameplay. FNAF has neither of the two redeeming factors: Gameplay or story.			"

												I grew up playing horror games on my original xbox. So being a high schooler and playing the Silent games with surround sound and all the lights off at night was the ideal horror experience. Well after school, once I moved out sadly there hasn't really been that experience since then. Slender was cool, kept me on edge, but the it felt kind of linear. Mr No Face hides in between trees and jumpscares you. But this game feel so much more intense and even stressfull haha. The sheer amount of paranoia I feel as I glance back and forth countless times at the camera screen and back to the door to my left flicking the light on, then slowly inching towards the door to my right to do the same. All while Freddy stares at me from out of view..Aside my rambling, great game if you're looking for an intriguing backstory and a completely new genre of horror video games			"

												I am personally not a fan of this game. I think the concept is very interesting, however, I feel as though it is poorly executed in this game. It is not something that entertains me much. However, I see the appeal, and I think that anyone who is interested in the concept should check out the sequel, which has far better execution as far as I have seen; if the concept interests you, try out the other ones.

												Best Hide and Seek Game Ever.Night 1.-Very Easy -Watch out for bonnie -Chica moves but not as much as MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING BONNIEAlso i like how the dude spoke for at least 2-3 hours.Night 2My Lord is ♥♥♥♥ING HARD. You're always looking at the dam power usage which drains Within seconds, And even before it hits 1am bonnies on the move like he was ♥♥♥♥ing Foxy and chica moves and dissappers and when shes not anywhere ik shes in the kitchen making me a pizza for the morning but dam it gets intense there because bonnie starts moving even more and then u get freddy's face popping up on ur screen. As your ♥♥♥♥ing Chica a min passes and bonnies Tearing ur ♥♥♥♥ing HEAD OFF.-Foxy Moves near the end-Bonnie Is Your Worst Nightmare-Chica Is a Master at hiding.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ok so basically this game is a mouse clicking game. You click cameras and try to not consume to much power even then thats hard because you don't see anything move if your not looking at the cameras and when u are they fuzzy which makes you paranoid as ♥♥♥♥.If you struggle with Loud Noises and Close Up Faces Then i would not reccomend this for you.

												This game, where to start. Really easy to play just the mouse which is nice. Do not press escape to leave the tablet as it will close your game straight away. 10/10 such a tense game especially when you cant find one of the animatronics.How to play this game:1. Download and launch 2. Stare at the menu trying to think what talked you into this3. Start first night all calm and ready4. End of night 1 havent died but on edge5. Think how you made it to night 26. Get to 5 am on night 2, run out of power, get jumpscared by freddy and never play the game again.Great game, I would definately recomend getting this game			"

												To start things off, this isn't the scariest game in the world. That isn't to say it doesn't jump me everytime I see someone out the door (somehow this happens even when I'm expecting it), but this game has a mild humorous feel to it in my opinion. They're lots of minor things that come together, and in my opinion kind of give a somewhat relaxed feel to the game (when nobody's out the door). These details are little things like how casually the person giving instructions speaks, your hilariously low pay, or clicking on Freddy's nose on the poster.That doesn't mean it fails as a horror game, though. The atmosphere on the loading screen creeped me out the first time I played, and the almost silent atmosphere in the guard room was pretty well done. As mentioned before, it always jumps me when somebody's out the door, even when the game is near mute and I'm expecting it.Overall, this game can be considered a jack of all trades but a master of none. You can get a chuckle out of it if you're in a less scared or panicked mindset, or this game can increase your heartrate by 50 if you let it. Simultaneously, you won't be laughing the whole time (A good thing if you want a horror game) nor will you get a heart attack (A good thing if that horror game wants a positive reputation).This is just my opinion, though. The experience could be very different for different people.			"

												Five Nights at Freddy's is a point-and-click, horror survival game created by Scott Cawthon. The game centers on a fictional pizza restaurant called ""Freddy Fazbear's Pizza"", where the player must act as a night security guard, defending themselves from the malfunctioning animatronic characters by tracking their movement through the facility using security cameras.The player must survive their shift, lasting from midnight to 6:00 a.m. without being attacked by one of the animatronics roaming the facility. The player, who sits in an office and is unable to move, is given access to a network of security cameras throughout the facility to track the movement of the animatronics. Four of the five characters have distinct movement patterns while the fifth, ""Golden Freddy"", only appears when certain actions are taken, however, most of the characters' movements take place off-screen. The player cannot leave the guard room, but can close the doors to defend themselves, and briefly turn on lights in the hallways to check for animatronics.Use of these actions consume the player's limited electrical power; if the power runs out, the cameras become inoperable, the doors open, and the lights go out, leaving the player with no defense against an attack. FNAF is actually a fantastic game. Even if the animatronics aren’t scary, the lore behind the series is the most talked about, most researched, and perhaps the biggest lore of any game ever. Heck, it’s the only thing that keeps Game Theory running! (No offence to MatPat. You are one my favorite Youtubers)If you have never played FNAF, you really should. Even if you don’t enjoy the games, the lore behind the whole thing, is something worth checking out. 10/10    Three sequels have been released: Five Nights at Freddy's 2 Five Nights at Freddy's 3 Five Nights at Freddy's 4 and soon,Five Nights at Freddy’s 5 : Sister Location			"

												On it's own, it's a decent game. The scariness (or more accurately, tension) comes from the anticipation of jumpscares rather than the jumpscares themselves. But it gets old fast. By the way, fans:1. You are not married to Foxy. 2. Scott has not dethroned Stephen King, and I'm fairly sure he would agree with me if we asked3. You can only write so many fanfics, er, ""theories"", on oversized homicidal toys.4. Stop making everything about this game. (End airing of grievances)			"

												☠Five Nights at Freddy's☠         9/12/2015♥Five Nights at Freddy's is a simple horror game where you take up night shifts as a security guard for Freddy's resturant, strange and frightening things being to happen when the animatronics seem to develop a mind of their own after 12AM. You have a limited amount of power and thus, very limited visibility while you struggle to decide if you want to keep the cameras/lights on or the doors kept sealed.First of all, I am really glad that I took the time to play Five Nights at Freddy's, even though it's not the type of game or genre I would normally go for, it turned out to be a lot of fun and actually pretty scary, even though you know what's coming after a couple of play-throughs, the game still has an ability to keep you on the edge of your seat.For a game with a simple premise and simple controls (monitor the cameras, click the doors or lights when needed), the game is immensely terrifying. There's no background music, save for occasional moments where the Toreador March plays (which, trust me, is not a good thing), leaving players to deal only with the background noises: the hum of the desk fan, the buzz of the florescent lights, the clattering in the kitchen, the footsteps down a dark hall, the dum-dee-dum of the characters... the silence, truly, is disturbing. Combine the simple controls, the nerve-wracking environment, and the lack of music, and within moments (and it's actually happening to me just recalling it) your palms are sweaty, your heart races, and every noise causes a panicked twitch.It's too bad that the franchise is way too over hyped, but it's still a good game!♥			"

												Five Nights at Freddy's is the hit new Indie jumpscare simulator game developed by Wisdom Tree for the Sega CD using click and play. In this game, you take control of some loser whose only job he can even get is being security guard at a children's baby play place. Now because this is a spooky Halloween scary game, it's got all the things you expect to make you wet your diaper if you're a big little baby idiot.It's got all the creepy music, and sometimes you see someone looking at you over there, and... Oh look out suddenly he jumped out in front of your face you weren't even gonna think you would've saw that right then! But you did, and now you're probably scared.What really ties together Freaky Friday is its innovative revolutionary gameplay system. It really maximizes the horror that  those blender Chuck-E-Cheese mascots have to offer.To play Five Freddy's, you click cameras and sometimes maybe close a door. You do this for convenient 10 minute bursts, designed with the big name Let's-Players in mind. Now some of you might be asking ""But ROCKCOCK64, is that all there is to Five Nights at Freddy's?"" And to you I would say... Yes. Yeah, that's it.Now it may sound really easy, but there's actually a lot of depth and strategy behind the gameplay. Sometimes you have to close both of the doors!Graphically, this game is perfect. Now, while in most other games, this look, this ♥♥♥♥♥♥, ugly, pre-rendered garbage wouldn't really work. This game however is a horror game, so you get to be totally creeped out by the one pre-rendered room you're stuck in that has this weird pixelated cylinder filter applied to it. You get to be totally creeped out by that and then pay like, a dollar or two on the app store to put a little plushie on your desk.The scares are also REALLY effective. Especially when you run out of power or one of your doors is broken, so you already know the loud scream scary spook is coming. Jumpscares work best when I know about them ahead of time. Then I get to plan out my funny facecam reaction. Some people say that jumpscares are a cheap and effortless tactic to try and instill horror. And that's just insulting and dismissive of how brilliant of a game Five Night Freddy is. Cheap and effortless are the LAST two words I'd use to describe this game.Would a cheap and effortless game have a sequel almost entirely finished two months after the original release? No!Would a cheap and effortless game take advantage of free ad space on gross websites to extend its audience? No!Would a cheap and effortless game try to milk microtransactions off of cheats and cosmetics through a mobile version that was hastily slapped together? No.Overall gamers, Weekend at Bernie's has earned its spot as one of the most legendary horror games ever. A game about being scared as the guy dressed as Chuck-E-Cheese giving you a pizza belongs in the same league as a game about the scariest thing the Internet could think of: A very tall, well-dressed, white man.Any dumb idiot can play it, and it makes a loud scary noise here and there, what more could you even ask for?FINAL SCORE:3/10 GAMEPLAYS2/10 GRAPHICS2/10 SOUNDS10/10 HARDCORES4.25/10 OVERALLS (BEST SCARY GAME OF ALL TIME!!)

												Well, this game is currently really hyped and I can see why. I've never played or saw a game like this, really did enjoy the game till the end and still enjoyning it. It still creeps me out, even though I find it funny to die here. The wait makes me nervous and let me look around and click the light button. When I see one of them approaching I am scared and try to click the door button to shut it fast down. When it doesn't work... Farewell cruel world. I gotta say Foxy is the least scariest creature here, he only looks from the door at you and screams unlike the other ones who are infront of you screaming. Still trying to figure out how to  how to beat the customized night at max difficult on all creatures. I think it is impossible to beat it on this difficulty, well atleast I died before it was 1 am always.Now the gameplay, it's easy to understand what and when you have to do and what you shouldn't do. Easiest creatures to avoid are Bonnie and Chica, since you see them infront of your door before getting killed. Last two obviously the difficult ones, Freddy and Foxy who can kill you without to stop at the doors. I heared there is a "" Golden Freddy "" which I never encountert. As I read, you can encounter him by watching the poster in the west corridor. It will be in your office and do nothing for seven seconds, then kills you and lets your game crash. Maybe it's a bug that it crashes or it is supposed to be like this, I don't know.All in all, Five Nights at Freddy's is great for people who likes / loves jumpscares. I would say it is a kind of Tower Defense game without attacking something. It is good designed and well made. But sadly, it is a short game, it lasts like one hour - two hours, if you die often it could be longer. I would've like a longer version of this, even though the "" customize night "" is there, didn't entertain me long enough. Either I made it too easy or too difficult, which made me replay the whole six nights. To be honest, I would still replay the six nights because I can't change any difficulty and the calls at the beginnings, I liked it. So what are you waiting for? Go try the Demo and if you liked it get the fullversion.Atmosphere: 10/10Design         : 9/10Jumpscares : 10/10Length         :  4/10Fun              : 8/10 "

												yes i recommend this game its been a while since a good horror game came out in a while because the way the game is and the way it is played is also good you sit in a room looking through a camera and also a helpful tip is to look at pirate cove time to time because my friend the fox of pirate cove might get you and bonnie the bunny and chicka the duck will come to but dont worry just keep the doors closed when you see them using the light but bonnie the bunny can be a little more active sometimes.....Have fun and welcome to freddie fazbear's pizza			"

												this game is one of the greatest games i have ever played.story:you are a security guard working the nightshift at a chuck-e-cheese-like place called freddy fazbear's pizza, with many anamatronic anamals.however,  they are left in a ""free roam mode"" at night.[ultra spoiler: now, this would'nt be so bad,  but if they see you between 12:00 am to 6:00 am, they won't recognise you as a human. they'll see a endoskeliton without a suit. ao, they stuff you into a suit. the suits are not made for human habitation. they have no air holes. see where i'm going here?7/10gameplay:there is a small amout of power each night. all defences use up power.you have three defences, and two weaknesses.defence 1: door lights.your door lights help you see the blind spot in your camras right outside your doors,to help you tell when to close them. NOT ALL ANAMATRONICS APPEAR IN YOUR DOOR LIGHTS.defence 2: camras.your camras help track the anamatronics in the pizzarea. they can sometimes stop working though, and they may trigger something or other.. they may trigger a certain  easter egg that kills you or foxy by watching him too much.defence 3: doors.your doors are the ONLY WAY to keep out the anamatronics. they can be shorted out if you wait too long though.weakness 1:the anamatronics cannot be killed. your only defences keep them out, not murder them.weakness 2: YOU CANNOT MOVE. you can only use your 3 defences.overall:9/10 one of the best games i have ever played.

												Ignoring the cancerous fan base of 12 year old ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game is really great! The emphasis on a deep lore shrouded in mystery is what has truly kept the legacy of the series alive for so long. The game isn't terribly long, but the gameplay (though some may criticize it as repetitive) I found to be suspensful and intense. Be sure to give this game a chance if you are a fan of horror games!			"

												A game you played when your parents were out having a nice dinner, while you and your sister were the only ones at home. You told your sister, ""I might be screaming but it's just a prank"". Your sister gives you that look and tells you to get lost. Now, somehow, you find yourself in your room, door closed and your pc on. You see the game in the top right corner of your screen, whispering your name. Trying to lure you in. You sit down, ready to play but realise you're the biggest wimp and only got the game because you wanted to tell your friends you were the big boy of the group. You stop to agree with yourself and start watching Markiplier's videos, scrolling down to the comments section to see the exact time of the jump scares.			"

												Here we have a game that started an enormous trend amongst the internet, with mostly children around twelve and up playing the game, and despite it's horror factor (which is somewhat meager), it has spread as a strong internet phoenomena, and even since it's release date of August, 2014, exactly a year before creating this review, it has been extended in to a four-game franchise.If I wasn't 100% honest with this review, I'd say that this game is the spawn of Satan, or something ludicrous, but that really isn't the case, while I admit that the general fanbase for the game is realtively annoying and most certainly an indicator that the game is overrated, even I have to say that from my meager, but still existent perosnal experience with this game, I found the jumpscares to be somewhat fulfilling, not hardly as much as I'd have hoped, but at least enough to encourage you to want to play the game with caution.In all honesty, I do not regard the game as a perfect game, not even close, I would put it on the same level as casual game, but it has made itself a well-earned reputation, and it was clear that the devotion put in to it was strong, for instance, the 3D models rendered to make it were made with good care, and it was ensured that all of the materials rendered made the game look as spooky or ominous as possible, this was very effective, even to the point where seeing the animatronics up-close gave some sort of fear factor, to me at least.One thing that seemed to be weak and light about the game were the jumpscares, the pitch and volume of the noises emitted when the jumpscares occur seemed to catch me off guard, and the animatronic models, while retaining a cartoonish style to some degree, had some kind of ominous appearance to them, but the way these elements were stitched together gave no core-shattering effect that put a constant fear in you, in most cases, you know exactly when the jumpscare is about to occur, making it even less terrifying than it could have been, not to mention the overall weakness of jumpscares' use repetitively.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this game, not because it's a bad game, but because it just doesn't fulfill it's purpose, and that is to be a ""scary"" game, there's a fine line between something being sometimes shocking, and something being scary, and while this game tries to be a strongly scary, it still doesn't 100% fulfill the reputation given to it by the public, this doesn't by any means mean not to buy it, that is your choice, maybe it is that I'm strong-hearted in comparison to others, I don't know, but it's not a game I would recommend in all honesty.Rating: 3 / 5 stars			"

												The game itself is amazing, providing a very addictive environment that also will force the player to use the restroom one too many times. There are a few Easter Eggs, most funny, and one lethal. The objective of the game is to hold off for 5 mandatory nights, as well as two that are optional following the completion of the fifth night. This game was based off of a Maryland pizza parlor, called Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, carrying the motto, ""Where food and entertainment come to life,"" straight from the restaurant itself. The restaurant was closed down in 1987 and is still being investigated because of an animatronic coming to life and biting into the frontal lobe of what used to be (but she is still alive) a very happy customer. For those that love a good scare but hate spending money on the movies, here is a very great alternative!			"

This game has very easy controls, which is better than having a billion of directions just to move forward.  The fandom needs to learn this isn't a Fifty Shades Of Freddy game and enjoy this game as a realistic nightmare, since in the futute this may be possible.  Like I said, Game Good, Fandom Bad.P.S. The fandom doesn't affect the game so don't say don't recommend it just because of the fandom dumb@$$es.			"

												Viral hype aside, this game does a better job of fostering paronoia and an unsettling atmosphere than most games of it's type, Indy or otherwise. The ebbs and flow of the game work in direct synergy with the gameplay, which while it is limited in scope, the extra resource management coupled with it's frantic pacing ensure you won't have much time to think about it. The surreal scenario only enhances the game further, as the unfamiliarity and constant looming uncertainty drive home the point that YOU do not belong here, YOU are the trespasser in this territory.Somewhere down the line we'll all look back at this and laugh about the whole thing, but for now it is the high-water mark for the ""BOO! Haunted House"" Genre. Very sensibly priced.			"

												Although a lot of people say this game is overrated, it really is a unique take on the horror genre, with simple controls blended with an incredibly creepy atmosphere. Combine with lore that would make the Human Centipede frightened, and you have a recipe for success.For those of you who don't know, Five Nights at Freddy's is a point-and-click horror game that takes place in a Chuck E. Cheese-style restaurant, where animatronics are the main attraction. The four main animatronics (Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy) were allowed to walk around freely during the day, until an incident known as ""The Bite of '87"" took place, in which a customer lost his/her frontal lobe, due to a bite by one of the animatronics. After that, the animatronics were restricted to being able to walk around at night. You, as the night security guard, must watch the animatronics using a camera system, closing your doors when they get too close. If they find you, they will assume that you are an endoskeleton without a suit on, and will try to stuff you in a suit, killing you in the process. The difficulty of the game is that you have limited power, and anything you do (turning on lights, checking cameras, closing doors) will use up some of that power. If you run out of power, Freddy will come out and kill you. I would also like to point out the game's difficulty (for me, at least) as I have never made it past the 4th night. This might be because of my tendency to shut off my computer whenever an animatronic is at my door.So that's it. If you couldn't tell already, I strongly reccomend this game to anyone, horror fanitics or casual gamers. The lore of the series alone is enough to keep me intrigued for a long time. Make sure to watch the Game Theorist videos, becaue they are amazing(Also, it says I only played 1.2 hours, but I usually play this game when I don't have internet. It should be about 4-5 hours.)

												This is a good game.For 10 minutes.   When it first came out, it gathered a massive audience because of its fresh new take on the horror genre. With its new widened audience came the FNAF fanbase. I know I shouldn't judge a game based on the fanbase alone but I can't seem to get past the screaming 13 year old fanboys every time I get ""jumpscared"" by Bonnie. Speaking of which- the jumpscares in this game are wildly overused and pretty cheap. After a few of said jumpscares, there comes a point where you just stop and say, ""Alright... Is this it?... Is this all I have to expect from this game?"" And it truly is. Other than the survival aspect of this game (Which mainly consists of waiting to push a couple buttons) that's pretty much it. That's Five Nights at Freddy's. This game is overrated in my opinion.			"

												I recommend this game as Five Nights At Freddy's is a huge twist to all horror games. The hugest problem is though that once you know how each animatronic move pattern the game can become a cake walk, however they change their patterns up each night. This ment I could pass Night 2-7 (4/20 mode) on my first try aslong as you follow a routine each night. A good thing to know before you play is that F2 resets the game but ESC quits the game.On the overhand I don't recommend this game to anyone with a faint heart or is elderly as you will expect lots of jumpscares. (Which only so far I've had 1 and that was only on my first night.) If however you like some horror and jumpscares this is the game for you.			"

It's not a bad game at all.-Would I recommend this game? Naturally, given the jumpscares, no. But with how the game is designed, both in mechanics and visuals, I'd say yes. The game is comprised of a series of GIFS, not animated models like what we're used to today, this is more akin to older games. Very well done for that fact alone.-I sound like a broken record, but it does a good job of keeping you on edge, trying to determine which of the animatronics will pop up and from where. Bonnie and Chica, of course are fixed on sides, Foxy can come from either side and Freddy pops up when least expected under some occasions.-Even for each night lasting nine minutes, the suspense makes it feel so much longer.And the atmosphere adds to this. Eery.My recommendation for the game, personally, is to add more background compared to the skimpy details observed on the walls. Storyline based details. News stories clipped to a bulletin board only take us so far.Hopefully there will be an expanded sequel.			"

												I recommend this game as Five Nights At Freddy's is a huge twist to all horror games. The hugest problem is though that once you know how each animatronic move pattern the game can become a cake walk, however they change their patterns up each night. This ment I could pass Night 2-7 (4/20 mode) on my first try aslong as you follow a routine each night. A good thing to know before you play is that F2 resets the game but ESC quits the game.On the overhand I don't recommend this game to anyone with a faint heart or is elderly as you will expect lots of jumpscares. (Which only so far I've had 1 and that was only on my first night.) If however you like some horror and jumpscares this is the game for you.			"

												FNAF is a good horror game that can mess with your nightmares you had as a kid about animatronics, and it gives that feeling of paranoia because this game has things you don't usually expect. For all the negative reviews, I say you don't really have anything that says the game is bad, most of the time I see negative reviews that really say the game is frustrating and was not scary, now I don't really see a problem in that, but uh I really find it hard to believe you weren't scared. I see other things negative reviews say,  like it wasn't worth $5, some terrible immature joke bad interviews and like the such, and I hate how people say this game is a youtuber streamer trap, really? Why...ok, first of all, I have a youtube channel yet I uploaded FNAF but did I get popular? No! All I got were like 12 views. But uh, going back to the other things like this game isn't worth $5...dude...that's like...pocket change in the world right now and yet you're complaining this game is too expensive? HA what a joke. But going back to this game, I can say it truly made me scared and paranoid at the same time. This game is definitely worth your time and worth your money, the sequel deserves even better praise. Oh, and might I say this game was when Scott Cawthon (the creator) was very close on giving up onon the entire video game industry because the fact that critics for his other games said that his characters looked like scary animatronics.

												There are a lot of people who say that this game isn't scary, or at least isn't as scary as it's hyped up to be. That's fine. What makes something ""scary"" is subjective, after all. Even if you don't have a fear of animatronics or don't react much to jumpscares, the one thing that I think we can agree on is this: The tension in this game is very high.Managing only one resource--power--seems simple enough but the room for error dwindles as the difficulty increases each night. Even if you know each character's behavior and how to monitor them, the speed with which you have to address them ramps up and you're bound to make more mistakes. Meanwhile, the atmosphere is doing its best to unnerve you to a higher degree as you progress. The noises in the game aren't so bad on their own but the last thing you would ever want to hear while checking the cameras is footsteps in the hall or Freddy's laughter, regardless whether or not they indicate an actual threat.Throw in some hallucinations and Foxy channelling Usain Bolt and you're almost done with Night 3.

												Five Nights at Freddy's is a cute and very original resource management and strategy game. In the game you take on the role of a security guard who has to keep track of four animatronic robots without using too much power. The game is surprisingly fun and gets challenging at later levels. The part where the animals catch you can be somewhat startling, although that just adds to the fun.			"

												Invite the Demons into your Computer with Five Night's At Freddy's, a unique, one-of-a-kind Horror Experience brought forth from the crazy/genius mind of developer Scott Cawthon. No movement, no fancy mechanics. Simple point-and-click horror at its best. These monsters take the form of your inner childhood fears and stalk the corridors of a derelict pizzeria, eager to, without heistation, force your weak human form into a walking Iron Maiden and kill you in the most horrific way imaginable. One second they're there, the next, gone. But, always watching you.Simple mechanics. Open a door, close a door. Turn on a light, turn it off again. Open camera view, close camera view. Five Nights (give or take a few, if you play long enough) alone with 4 (5 *wink*) murderous animatronics. The question falls to you. Are you ready, for when Freddy comes for you?			"

												Pretty good game for $5. Died the second night, but that didn't stop me from going back. You basically have to make sure you don't get killed by 4 animatronic animals, that move during the night, and make it through your shift. You stay in your office the whole time and watch them on different cameras. Added to that, you have limited power and have to be wise with what you choose to do with it.-Great game!-Music is loud so you might want to turn down your volume-Don't forget to click the bears nose on the poster :)			"

												This here is the game that started it all.. Five Nights at Freddy's is by far one of the best video games I've ever played. I like Sonic, and I like Nintendo games, but something about this game and its sequels just really stands out among those others. Probably beacuse many of the big game franchises have studios that make them, and those studios put ridiculous mandates on them.*cough* *cough* SEGAGameplay is simple, but that dosen't mean you won't get tense. Freddy, Foxy, Bonnie, and Chica are all cool characters, but by far, FNAF 1's coolest and scariest character is Golden Freddy. In FNAF 1, GF is by far my fave :)Also, I wanted to mention, people talk about the 5 main characters, but what about Endoskeleton in parts and service?? (Dosen't Endoskeleton have a fan base?)In conclusion, Five Nights at Freddy's is BY FAR one the best games and franchises of the 2010's. Probably one of the best of the past 40 year history of video games. Scott, I LOVE what you do!! Thank you for listening to us fans and we wish you years of good luck!!!Five Nights at Freddy's: 10/10			"

												I remember this game being popular when I was 14. It was still summer, and everything was good. As soon as this game became popular, everything on the internet was flooded with conspiracy theories, fake phone numbers, and that one viral photo of that pizzeria in Colorado. I liked looking at that stuff. I even binge-watched Smike's videos. It wasn't until this year that I actually bought all five games and realized what I missed. And though I enjoyed Five Nights at Freddy's, I can't disagree with what people are saying this game needed:  Being able to move around  (sorry...) Less jumpscares More horror A fanbase with less autistic children and furriesI've also noticed some flaws with Scott Cawthon's perception of old pizzeria animatronics that make design holes in the game: In the game, the animatronics can walk around and need to keep walking or else their servos would lock up, but real life pizzeria animatronics couldn't walk around at all due to being bolted to the floor... In the game, the animatronics appear to be made entirely of metal, but real life pizzeria animatronics had fabric coverings and rubber masks In the game, you take the ""night shift"", but I'm not sure if animatronic-based pizzerias ever actually  had  you stay there to take care of the joint from 12am to 6amOverall, I do like this game. I do find it scary, mostly because of the uncanny presence of the animatronics and the creepy sounds coming from the cameras. But unfortunately, this game about entertainment robots designed for children, was ironically  ruined  by children.Oh, and yes, I'm autistic if you've been wondering all this time. Fight me if you want. "

												So, Five Nights at Freddy's 3 has officially been announced! Choo Choo, all aboard the hype train! Final destination: your worst nightmares!I already posted a review of FNaF 2, so you can go check that one out if you want. I figured I'd just talk about what could easily be my game of the year 2014 and the biggest indie horror sensation since Slender (though far more deserving in my opinion). So is Five Nights at Freddy's really that good, or is it an overrated piece of non-scary garbage after all is said and done? Eh, considering you already saw my recommendation, you probably know my answer in advance. Ah well, let's get to talking about it.On the surface, the story of FNaF is very simplistic. You play as Mike Schmidt, a nightshift security guard at a family restaurant called Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria that's based on Chuck-e-cheese. The mascots Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie the bunny, Chica the chicken and Foxy the pirate fox are represented as animatronics, and though they appear innocent during the day, entertaining the children with songs and games, at night they roam around the restaurant and don't take kindly to any humans still around. Your goal is to survive five nights, from 12 PM to 6 AM (around 10 minutes in real time), avoiding getting your face rammed into an animatronic suit. Sounds fun, right?The gameplay is refreshingly simplistic. Instead of moving around with a flashlight like in most indie horror games, you are stuck inside the security office. You can use the security feed to monitor the mascots throughout the restaurant, check the doorlights and close the doors should one of the aggressors get a bit too close for comfort. This would be a lot easier if you didn't have a limited amount of energy to manage. Everything you do uses power; using the cameras, keeping the doors closed and turning on the lights. When the power runs out, the building goes into a black-out, and it won't take long until Freddy gets his chubby bear hands on you. You can't close the doors all willy-nilly, you gotta do it when you really have to.Balancing is of course very important in every game, and FNaF handles it well. Foxy and Freddy force you to use your cameras while Bonnie and Chica require you to check your doors. In short, if you only use your camera, Bonnie or Chica will kill you, and if you never check your cameras, Foxy or Freddy will eventually get you without warning. There's a fairly competent difficulty curve, where new animatronics become active across the first few nights, and become more aggressive during the later nights. Unfortunately, with some very simple tactics the main nights become kind of easy. Even on the bonus night 6 it's perfectly possible to prevent Freddy and Foxy from even moving at all simply by watching them frequently enough. Yes, my main complaint about the game is that it's perhaps a bit too easy. Then again, Custom Night 7 allows you to make it as difficult as you want it to, so you could say it's a moot point. I just wish the main nights were just a bit more challenging.Now let's clear up a misconception I frequently hear about this game.""In Five Nights at Freddy's you're just waiting for a jumpscare to happen.""This is a rediculous statement. That's like saying ""Super Mario Bros is just waiting until you get hit by a Goomba"".  Unlike a lot of horror games, Five Nights at Freddy's uses jumpscares as a sort of punishment for failing. A succesful night will have virtually no jumpscares. You could say that the sound that plays when an animatronic appears in the doorlight is kind of cheap and pointless (FNaF 2 removed this), but they're not THAT bad. I prefer a screamer as a way to accentuate failure over one of those fake jumpscares common in horror any day.FNaF isn't all about jumpscares either. It nails other horror aspects exceptionally well. From the eerie dark ambient music that plays subtely in the background to the pitter-patter of the mascots on the move all around you. Weird circus music plays from an unknown source, mysterious knocking on the walls and children's laughter echoes through the halls. This game is filled with brilliant atmospheric sound design, and I'm a sucker for good sound in video games. I found the sequel lacking in this regard. Paired with the ominous dark rooms of the restaurant, the parts room being the most unnerving, and you've got yourself a highly immersive horror game that seems so simplistic at first glance.The concept of having sentient animatronics as villains in a horror game is such genius I'm surprised it hadn't been done before. It plays off the irrational fear of mascots and animatronics a lot of people seemed to have when they were kids (and perhaps still do). I can't say I have the same sentiment for animatronics, since chuck-e-cheese is not a thing where I live, but I know mascots at theme parks unnerved me when I was young. I found Freddy, Bonnie, Chica and Foxy so fascinatingly terrifying from the moment I saw them, and they were the main reason why this game spoke to me, but Foxy sprung out to me. While the first three are designed to be creepy stalkers, Foxy is simply scary. With his sharp teeth and threatening demeanor, he evokes a more rational, primal fear, like you would fear a wild animal. Seeing him sprint down the hall towards you is comparable to being jumped by a rabid dog. His design and behaviour conveys it perfectly. He means you harm in more obvious way.I would say Five Nights at Freddy's is more than a game, it's a psychological test. How well do you handle stressful situations? Do you easily panic under pressure? Because the game totally punishes you if you do. When you start freaking out you make mistakes and lose track of what is really important. It feeds off your paranoia and kills you when you start losing it.Horror is extremely subjective, and not everyone will get scared by the same things. If it didn't scare you, that's a shame, but you can't deny that Scott Cawthon did a damn good job on this one, especially considering he did everything by himself. It's a game that has scared the pants off of thousands of people, reached cult status in mere days after its release, introduced characters that are already iconic, has a deep and dark storyline that sparked huge amounts of theories and has countless fans chomping at the bits to see more of Five Nights at Freddy's 3 in the near future. Oh, and it's fun to boot.Five Nights at Freddy's is THE new IP of 2014 that by far had the biggest impact on me and I can't wait to get some more of that goodness.I'm Ready 4 Freddy!			"

The lore is too vague to be considered good, and I've played the souls games, and I'm basically not repeating this one. :/// Summarization: Buy if you enjoy playing this game for a short time, but don't if you want a game you can spend a lot of time on.

This game has been played by thousands and thousands of Youtubers and all have the same reaction. Do not be fooled by the cuddely cute suits that these animatronics wear, These guys will rip you to shreads.			"

												I used to like FNaF too. Mostly for its storyline. When the franchise was still young and beautiful I really loved this game. It felt unique and its storyline was absolutely fantastic. But now I only see a horrible monstrosity which has been milked empty. First and maybe second FNaFs were made with love and passion, but the last ones were... crap. Syrupy fanservice to milk some money. And yes, nowadays I dislike the franchise as a whole, but there IS reasons why I don't like this first game in particular.I'm positive that almost all of the fanbase is there because of the storyline. I'm not saying the fanbase is horrible and it certainly isn't afflecting my opinion in any way. Anyway, the game itself is dull and short, almost not worth its price at all. I admit, I only liked this game for its story. I was amazed how dull it was in reality because in all the videos it looked awesome.And that's the main reason I pressed the red thumb under this box. DON'T BUY THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE WATCHED ANY WALKTROUGHS, IT'S NOT WORTH IT! At first the idea of anomatronics was interesting and in fact scary, but after three games and so much hype they became no scarierer than basic teddy bears. Jumpscares were scary, but now when you can expect them, they are not scary at all. Believe me, watching videos about this game is much more entertaining than playing it.Few GOOD things about gameplay features:+ Unique and interesting systems.+ It really can feel frightening+ Cameras are an excellent idea.And then there's these not so good things.- Short. Not worth it.- So overhyped.- Franchise has been milked dry.- No replay value at all.If you are one of those very few who found this game only recently and you've not yet watched anything about this, this game is ok. I don't like its gameplay, it's something that Greenlight usually gives birth to, nothing less, nothing more. It can feel frigtening when you play it for the first time, but after watching 100hrs video material about it and played it trough 100 times, it's not so interesting anymore.If you still like the storyline, nothing is in your way to theorize about it and attend discussion. This game can't give you any more information than let's plays do. In fact, it gives less. I strongly believe that this whole great story was born accidentally.			"

												I'm going to give this game a 4.5/10.No, this review isn't going to all be bashing on FNAF fans. No, this review isn't going to be saying ""The fnaf faendum is cancur xddd""Yes, this review is going to be constructive critism. Let's start off with cons:- The fandom.I'm not saying it's cancer. I'm just saying that at least 50% of the fandom ruined this game with fetish art, shipping, sexualising the animatronics, etc. I have absolutely  No problem with this, as i rarely see this kind of art anymore. - The jumpscares.The jumpscares aren't even scary anymore. It's just animatronics screaming at your face with wide eyes, nothing scary about that.If you're a fan of jumpscares, feel free to buy this game. If not; Don't waste your money.- The storyThe story is too cheesy.  Someone dressed up as purple freddy, grabbed a knife, lead 5 children into the backstage, and stabbed them and then the children possessed the animatronics and now they kill people. Sounds cheesy when you put it that way, huh?Now, the pros:- The suspense you getThe suspense you get, even at night 1.The phone call ends, bonnies gone, where's bonnie? At the door. He's gone, roams around, at the door, door is jammed, 6 AM. Thats pretty much it. I have no grudges against people who like FNAF/FNAF fans, i'm just voicing my opinion.			"

												This is a good indie horror game, it's not great as the replayability is little to none after day 6 unless you've grown a taste for screaming both angrily and in fear, the atmosphere is very disturbing as even though it takes place in a pizza parlor after hours (Which would be most any kid's dream if it weren't Freddy's place..) and the fact the animatronic animals will kill you while screaming and moving right in your face is definitely worth saying ""jumpscares galore"" as well as the fact you have a very limited amount of power to Check cameras for the animatrons, Close the doors before they get you, or Check the door lights to see if they're there or not, you need to survive 6 hours per night (About 3 - 5 minutes per hour, right around there) while the AI gets notably harder with each new night (Night 1 obviously is the easiest as most of them will idle except for two and night 5 or the bonus 6th night are the worst scarefactors as they will easily overrun you unless you've figured out this game's system of checking the cameras/doors/lights.) but besides the atmosphere and scares from the animatrons the game's mild, there's no real objective besides living and the story is non-existant unless you go out of your way to google it.This game gets a 7.5/10			"

												I love the game. It is probably one of the scariest games I have ever played (and I've played Outlast, Amnesia and so many other scary games). The game really plays on the players anxiety and paranoia because you never know when they're coming for you Plus some of the characters don't even give you enough time to react. For example, Foxxy is the most aggresive character because he runs through the hallways and bursts through the doorway. If you don't close it in time then you're pretty much dead. I love this game but I also hate it just because it is poop your pants scary. I would recommend this game to anyone  who absolutely loves anxiety-based games. Thanks for Reading			"

												Five Nights is the epitome of horror games. It is fear in gaming distilled to its purest form; an experience that forces you to give it your full attention and focus while it strips you of any sense of balance or safety. It is unnerving and upsetting to its core.What truly makes this remarkable is how simple the game is. There is really only one action: Close the Door button only and always when you think you're about to be attacked. Close too early, and you waste power. Close too late, and you are doomed.All the rest is window dressing to this, but what is there is so perfectly executed. I must emphasize that what I say is praise. The simplicity is to its benefit, providing you with absolutely nothing to distract you from your feelings of foreboding, dread, and terror.This is, in many ways, the perfect horror game.			"

												Five Nights at Freddy's is an indie horror game made by Scott Cawthon. You have to survive 5 nights at a Chuck E. Cheese-esque place called 'Freddy Fazbear's Pizza'. What do you have to survive? Animatronics, yes, animatronics. The four main animatronics are Freddy, Bonnie, Chica and Foxy who all have different attack patterns; different ways to get to YOU. Here are some things that Five Nights at Freddy's does well: Making the player feel challenged: Five Nights at Freddy's starts out very easy but then ramps up the difficulty, especially in the later nights. Making the player feel helpless: Now, it goes without saying that if you were stuck in a place with 4 killer robot furries, you'd feel pretty helpless. And sense you're in a tiny office just waiting for you to get stuffed into a suit, it amplifies it. Fear: Five Nights at Freddy's will obviously be scary, right? Yes, it is scary. If you fail to stay alive through a night, you will be killed by one of the robots in a... jumpscare... ""A cheap jumpscare? Really?"" you might ask. Yeah, the deaths are jumpscares, but it isn't the jumpscare that scares you, it's not knowing when it will happen. If the death is predictable, then it isn't as scary.As a final review for Five Nights at Freddy's, I give it a 9.9/10.			"

												This game is great. When people look at this at first they think it's scary, so they buy it. When they buy it, they wait for 2 in game nights and wait for something to happen. And before I actually start this is from my friend's perspective. Around half way through 2 AM the bunny leaves. He checks that he is in the supply closet. He knows to conserve power and notkeep the doors shut. The cameras black out. The bunny makes that creepy face in the supply closet. Friend starts to get anxiety.  The bunny stays in the party room for 2 hours. Not in the room but in the hallways. Friend is scared. Doesn't shut door. Duck leaves. Quits game.			"

												This game only seems scary when you play it. You can watch Youtubers play it or your friends and it just won't give you the same feeling as when you play. What's that feeling? A quickly escalating scense that somethings about to happen to you. And when it doens't happen right away then the pressure just builds. The pressure is probably what makes this game the best. It adds to the already scary atmosphere, and makes you beg for Freddy to let you live until 6 A.M. This is defininately one of the best horror games I've ever played. This game is truely a masterpiece. If you like horror games or haven't played any and want to try them out, this is a great game for you! To top it all off, it's only 5 dollars! It's worth so much more!			"

												The game was a huge hit in the Indie Horror category of games, getting 3rd place in the category for the 2014 Global game awards. Over hundreds of Youtubers have critiqued this game, and with the positive reviews in all stores sold I was intrigued in giving it a try.  The animations and graphics in the game is very limited since we have only the office and the security cameras to look at, but by no means were they dull. This left room to add nice effects, such as the statics in the cameras, blinking lights to even the honking nose of the Freddy Fazbear poster on the wall! Like any Horror game, it has its nerve-racking moments and FNAF seems to induce profuse amounts of it. Every waking moment in playing this game will leave you trembling until 6:00 AM, with the only calming remedy being the sound of the timer once it’s morning or when you hear the ‘phone guy’ speaking. But even the latter does not last long.I’ll leave my review at that, with no details on the animatronics (that may lead to potential spoilers). I enjoyed playing this game, despite the complaints about how simple and repetitive the goal is. Each and every stage we are introduced to new challenges, and (seemingly) longer nights. FNAF is a must-play for anyone who is engrossed in all aspects of a classic and/or simple horror game.			"

												Honetly loved everything about this game!!  Its story gives great background information about the characters and various going-ons throughout the game, especially the ""phone guy,"" along with the newspaper article as well.  I love the sound effects in the background that makes one just feel the suspense and when something may or may not be closer or at either door on either side of the room you're placed in.  There's probably only one thing, whether it's an actual part of the game or not, which would be some of the mechanics; they're a bit glitchy, mainly the door lights on either side of you.  They tend to stay on for either a brief moment or for quite awhile after being clicked the second time in order to turn them off.  Despite this factor, the game is absolutely astonishing as well as pretty freakin' scary!  It definitely gave me the creeps during my first go-around, but 'cause I'm just ""too pro"" at my gaming hobby, I'm totally over it now... except when Foxy jumpscares me though.  I swear, that just gets me every time!  I'd say on a scale of 1-10, this game gets a 9.5 out of me!  ~Shea			"

												Well you all knew this was coming so here it is, Five Night's at Freddy's, a point and click horror game made by Scott Cawthon has his final attempts to make a video game, but of course now it's Final Fantasy all over again. You play as the night guard at a family pizzarea called Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. Sounds simple enough... if it wasn't for the animatronics out to kill you. Your only advantages of defending yourself is using the sercurity camera to check on where the animatronics are, a light switch to see if anyone is coming to get you, and a door switch to close the doors, while dealing with a limited amount of power. It's a good game with a decent amount of challenge.			"

												The basic premise of Five Nights at Freddy's demands the player spend the vast majority of the game inactive. The diminishing power supply - the resource used for protection - actually incentivizes sitting still and waiting. Not that there's much that can be done, electricity or no. There are two doors, a light for each door, and series of security cameras to check. There's not even an in-game menu, esc just closes the game entirely. But surprisingly, inactivity and the helplessness that develops from that lack of options, only strengthens the inevitable jump scare. While Five Nights at Freddy's is very clear about what it has to offer, it does bear repeating: this is not a game that lends itself to speculation or any sort of terror that would outlast the experience; anticipation and jump scares are all that can be found here.

Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy are the stars of this show, entertaining children and bringing smiles to all. The place seems to have its own special magic to it during the day. Given how beloved these characters are, you are needed to ensure nobody with foul intent tampers with them overnight. It is a simple job. Just watch the cameras from the security office until 6 AM.

												Very fun game, and very fun to force people to play. You'll get some great reactions and lore out of this game making you want to delve deeper into this pizzaria.However, I must warn you of the terrifying part of this game, and that, my friend, is the fanbase. It's full of unoriginal ""OC's"", annoying girls requesting ""RP's"" (Roleplays), and people who compare every little detail from various works to Five Nights at Freddy's. It's like Bronies but not really.			"

												It's hard to find something to say about Five Nights at Freddy's that hasn't already been said. I'm a huge fan of horror and have played just about every horror game, watched every horror movie (even the cheesy ones) and read every online ghost story and creepypasta there is so obviously, I'm a bit more harsh when judging a piece of horror. I can't necessarily say Five Nights at Freddy's is ""scary"" as much as it is tense. VERY similar to Slender in that the game relies on the tension caused by the feeling of paranoia and the feeling of being hunted to get into the player's mind. The problem though is that this game's tension is built more so out of the fact that you don't want one of the animals jumping up and screaming at you loudly, not so much that you actually feel in danger like you would in Slender or games similar. Because of that and the fact that while you don't know EXACTLY when the jump scare will occur but get a good idea of when it's coming (animal is close to your room in the camera feed, clicking sound when trying to turn on light, etc.) leaves this game feeling more like a digital version of a jack in the box rather than a real, horror experience. All that being said, I still very much enjoy this game and (especially considering the price) would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in it. A good piece of horror? No. A good experience? Yes.			"

												A spectacularly-frightening game that is honestly worth every penny. What you need to do in this game is to survive 5 nights as a security guard in Freddy Fazzbear's Pizzariea. This requires that you utelize cameras, lights, and the two doors that lead into your room, to monitor and protect yourself from the deadly animatronic mascots that wander around at night.But why is this scary? Here is why:-You can't move from your security room. All you can do is wait for them to come to you!- Everything you can do drains power. So you have to balance security vs. sustianing the power.- The monsters will look at you and watch your every move throughout the camera waching, and when they show up at your freakin doorstep.And much, much more. I don't really want to give too much away about this game because of how terrifying it is when you know less about it.Simply put; BUY THIS GAME! Is your body ready for Freddy?			"

You can't. Your goal is to not die, when everything around you wants you to.Great fun! 10/10			"

												This game is mighty scary! My bowels nearly bursted as I played the first night! Bun Bun the Spook snuck up on me as I work to say ""hello! Would you like some pizza and some soda?"" I rejected his greeting and decided to shut the door on his face. After playing the 'Interrogation Song' on my Iphone multiple times, Duckster heard the beautiful music and decided to join the party and dance. Her dancing was so terrible, that I accidentaly threw up and closed the door!!!1!!! Of course they started crying like babies behind the doors and ran off to tell Freddy the Bear about my rude actions. Freddy didn't care, but simply stared at the camera menacingly, an obvious way to tell me to sit in the corner. Being the rebel I am, I didn't sit in the corner. The duck later did her business the entire night, possibly touching herself in the kitchen. She was making awful grunting and moaning noises in there, sending chills up my spine. I let her do her business until my shift was over. Although Bun Bun was still behind the door, I made it out alive. Being desperate for the $4 an hour, I came back to the attraction unarmed the next day.Moral of story, I recommend this game to brave souls like Mermaid Man.P.S I never got my cash for the first night.

												This game is so overhyped, people were telling me how scary it is and all this other stuff... Well, it's not scary. Maybe it is if it's your first ever horror game but overall, after a few jumpscares the game is tedious and becomes more along the lines of annoying trying to survive nights... If you want a couple of jump scares, and to click back and forth between cameras and staring at a weirdly 3D 2001 graphical looking room back and forth then you'll love this game.			"

												Although people argue this game is only a ""jumpscare fest"" it feels different. In a way it's not scary but makes you extremly paranoid, and has a cramped atmosphere. The game rewards you for playing ""properly"" and uses these jumpscares as more as a punishment. All and all it's a fun trial and error horror game and I suggest you buy it and the 2nd one. It's a fun challenge you should try. -Operation Casual			"

												As a horror game vetran playing many different horror games (check my profile to see if you don't believe me) I figured that this game would be similar, already knowing of some background info, can't move, use doors and lights, etc. It seemed easy enough, just close the door on the anamatronics when they appear.                     First night: I get to 2 AM after listening to the guy on the radio/phone. ""okay I think I got it"" Looks at camera and checks doors. ProTip: although Foxy (pirate cove guy) isn't supposed to be active on the first night but he can, rarely but surely appear. Of course I figured he wouldn't so I only paied attention to the doors checking for the bunny and chicken who left the stage. Talking to my friend on skype, because he wanted to hear me scream (he did), I was talking about how easy this game is, already at 5 Am with only an hour left and 37% power, I got this. Then, remember it's the first night, Foxy of pirate cove decided to say hi, wait no I mean decided to scream Hi from the door, leaving me wimpering after a scream.          100/10 Will play again after I get out from under my desk			"

												Night Trap with furries. While the concept might sound kind of lame and hokey, in execution it's a damned fine minimalist horror game.You're an underpaid security guard for a kid's entertainment center, and during the night shift, the animatronic animals come to life and wander the halls. You must check your camera feed constantly to see where they're ambling about, power the lights outside your office to see if any of them are at the door, and slam the doors in their face before they horrifically mutilate you by stuffing you into a spare suit. You have a limited amount of dwindling power to see you through the night, and checking the video feed, powering the door lights, and shutting the doors all drain your reserves.The plot and the gameplay don't mesh too well, but this isn't a game you play for the plot. It's a game you play to experience that special sort of tension that comes from the fear of the unknown. You'll scramble to check your feeds as you hear kitsch music and shuffling steps echoing through the hallways, your paranoia will claw at you as you leave the video feed and the lights off to conserve power, you'll panic when the animals play peekaboo outside your door and come running down the halls looking for human blood.This game is cheap at $4.99. If you have any love for true horror, you'll at least give this game a chance.			"

This game was a brand new look/start to a different kind of horror that we're used to, you know, remember when all horror games was just Slenderman clones? This game, to some, isn't all that scary, but you got to admit, it's very tense!! It keeps you on the edge of your seat! Not to mention it's amazing backstory!! So much mystery and secrets that we still haven't even discovered yet! And to back it all up, it was made by just one guy!! Congrats Scott, you made a game that I will forever remember and even show to my kids/grandchildren! I really like this game, and if I would honestly rate it, I'd choose 9/10 :) Now time to write a review for the sequel :3			"

												Amazingly fun horror, if you like to jump out of your chair.This game is pretty basic and incredibly fun, there's not much to say about this game except you'll spend a fair bit of time trying to complete it and you won't give up because your bored..The game can be incredibly difficult but is a great way to eat time up late at night.It shows that for a game to be good you don't need good graphics, this game is locked to 720p which is okay but there are no graphics options at all. Because of this lack of graphical settings some people will have issues playing this game with strange aspect ratios or a low resolution monitor.Overall great game well worth the only £3.99 (at time of review) for the game. 8/10.

Who the ♥♥♥♥ woulda known I'm actually a crybaby bish when the coyote/wolf? comes speeding down the hallway into my room to eat my face with a spoon...All in all, this is a game you love and hate. I hate playing it because that means I am going to lose another pair of pants, but I love it because it's just so unique and the creator really did a great job making the player actually give out emotion when playing and events happening.Great game.

												I've always held that the cheapest kind of ""horror"" games are ones that exclusively use “jumpy” horror as their vehicle for scares.  This is the reason games like Dead Space or Doom 3 aren't very scary--as usually the jumps are predictable and are startling, not *horrifying.* This is because there is no atmosphere or pacing which are requirements for a true horror game.  It’s also impossible to be truly horrified if you’re carrying enough weaponry to turn the installation you’re inside into ash.  So, why do I love FNAF, when it proudly boasts that it has tons of jump-scares?  It is because it also has the other ingredients for a true horror game:  Good atmosphere and sound engineering, a very scarce and crucial resource for survival, a feeling of helplessness and insignificance, and the fact that in addition to the many jump-scares, your imagination is what produces most of the feelings of dread and terror when playing this game.  This is what makes the game stand out as a true horror game like Silent Hill 2 or Amnesia, the game gives you the tools to interact with it, a plot with basic instructions,  and then sits back and lets you s*** your pants by yourself.  Buy it!  We need to encourage more innovation like this.Do NOT play if you have hypertension or heart trouble, or if you have a full bladder. "

												Five Nights at Chuck E. Cheese's is what it suggests, you spend 5-6 nights there because you are a security guard. Sounds boring however Winnie the Pooh, Chuck, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and Tigger all come to life to play with you with a nice game of hide and seek, however their rules are different than common Hide and Seek. They run around, knowing where you are to ""tag"" you, however you get several cameras to spot them and doors to close to make it harder for them. You have a time limit and power, of course, but the reason they do this is because after 6 am, they have to go to their original spots until 12 am. While you are working there, your buddy, Christopher, calls you and drops several hints, so you need to listen to him. Best part of all, you get free pizza, drinks, games, you meet famous characters, and, to top it all off, you get paid just for having fun with those characters.Overall, this is a great, fun, casual game that you can just come home to start it up and forget all about your worries.12/10			"

												I've always held that the cheapest kind of ""horror"" games are ones that exclusively use “jumpy” horror as their vehicle for scares.  This is the reason games like Dead Space or Doom 3 aren't very scary--as usually the jumps are predictable and are startling, not *horrifying.* This is because there is no atmosphere or pacing which are requirements for a true horror game.  It’s also impossible to be truly horrified if you’re carrying enough weaponry to turn the installation you’re inside into ash.  So, why do I love FNAF, when it proudly boasts that it has tons of jump-scares?  It is because it also has the other ingredients for a true horror game:  Good atmosphere and sound engineering, a very scarce and crucial resource for survival, a feeling of helplessness and insignificance, and the fact that in addition to the many jump-scares, your imagination is what produces most of the feelings of dread and terror when playing this game.  This is what makes the game stand out as a true horror game like Silent Hill 2 or Amnesia, the game gives you the tools to interact with it, a plot with basic instructions,  and then sits back and lets you s*** your pants by yourself.  Buy it!  We need to encourage more innovation like this.Do NOT play if you have hypertension or heart trouble, or if you have a full bladder. "

All you have to do is watch over Freddy Fazbear's Pizza at night from......you know theifs and stuff.  You'll have access to 11 different cameras all around the establishment and secure metal doors if anything is to happen.....Like annoying people begging for loose change.  You will also have access to a light outside your door so you can.....see whats outside your door.  Oh whats that?  There shouldn't be anything outside your door at all.  Well anywho your shift starts at 12am and you'll be off at 6am.  The graveyard shift.  Nothing ever goes on during these hours anyway.  Its like FREE money.  Just watch some cameras, kick your feet up and close a few doors during your shift.  Oh did I mention you also have access to a telephone?  Sweet I know, and without further ado the pay.  You will recieve a solid grand total of $120 per week!  Now how does that sound?  Sign up now by clicking ""add to cart"" and start making that CA$H!  Don't waste another minute!			"

												To start off, i think this game is scary as s*** when you start that is. When you get to night 5-6 you loose that scare facter and it seems like you just want to win. in the beginning I though this was scary so my sister played it on night 5 and died twice and didn't scream or even jump. i honistly think it's more of the hype that's with this game that makes it more scarier. At least there's alot of youtube videos on this to ""help"" (markiplyer, jacksepiceye, pewdiepie and so many more BUT i find it kinda ruins the fun knowing before hand how the game works. This game is a good game to play with others to get the first reaction like the scary maze or slender and it's quite cheap to get.-I R8 6-10DeathKillerRock			"

												Five Nights at Freddy's has to be one of the most scariest games ever. Everything about it is scary. The atmosphere, the enemies,the jumpscares, it's all so scary. Especially the fact that you can't move at all and you just sit in the same room while these animatronics slowly move to your room to kill you. All these factors make a very good game, if you put them together correctly, like Scott did.Overall, this game is very scary game and I recommend you get the game.Are you ready for Freddy?			"

												First off, this can be a really tense game, depending on how you play it and if you actually get scared from horror games (which I usually am not).  The one bad part I have encountered so far (after 3 nights in my first playthrough) is that it is not a hard game if you find the right strategy or strategies:(Both these things are explained in game [Nights 1 and 2] and there are no big spoilers from the rest of the recordings on these nights or any other nights)- You need to try and save 50% from 12-3 so you have the other half of battery life from 3-6, which isn't that hard if you know what to do and when to do it.  If you have a strategy that can help you do this, you'll make it to 6 AM usually, and therefore it won't really scare you as you know what to do and how to last the whole night.- If a character is not on one of the cameras they are most likely at a door so it really eliminates any scare tactic there, unless of course, you forget that part of the recording and don't realize that until after you see it.Overall it is a really good game, but it may benefit from having more rooms added without cameras (or ones that have blindspots where the animatronics can hide) so it eliminates the problem I have with the second point.  I'm not sure how it would be possible to fix or change the first issue I have, unless it actually does become very hard for nights 4 and 5, which I have yet to start.  If so, then the first point may not end up being a problem if you are forced to change strategies midway through the playthrough due to losing too much battery life.			"

Keep doing that until it's 6am in-game and you're done for the night. Repeat again the next night. Congratulations on completing the game in under an hour.Honestly, I had hoped for way more than it delivered. I was expecting a horror game for PC. What I got was something that wouldn't look out of place on some casual browser-game site. The 'scares' are just jump-scares. There's no tension because there's no need to worry. It's just a question of click until they get too close and then shut the doors till they leave again.It just doesn't live up to the hype.			"

												Made from the people who brought us the ""Paranormal Activity"" movies and inspired by Lots-o' from ""Toy Story 3"", Five Nights at Freddy's is a 1st person game in which you play as a security guard; trying to make his way through life. Little did he know he got the job at the kinkiest bistro in the world.This game provides an adrenaline rushed experience suitable for all the family, all races, all genders and all sexualities - though with its constant lack of white supremacy I find myself constantly assessing my relationship with the game.Positives:+Great storyline.+Amazing voice actors.+Graphics.+Great character developement.+Engaging protagonist.Negatives:-Sad ending.-No DLC.-Lack of white supremacy.Overall a breathtaking game        9/10 "

The mechanics were well thought out and the game itself was fun to play even if the story was a little weak in itself. the animatronics are cleverly thought out and makes you adapt to each one of them as individual characters rather than lumping them into one big threat, for example Foxy will only come out of pirate cove if you do not watch the cameras(including his camera) often enough or watch them constantly. This forces you to watch the cameras and maintain a balance between reserving your limited power(which constantly dwindles) and keeping an eye on the animatronics lest they try and make a break for your little closet you call a security room and shove you into a costume filled with nice little sharp and point bits of metal. I look forward to the next game this company creates and I can say 100% they have made a fan of them out of me. 10/10 Ready for Freddy.			"

												Five Nights at Freddy's an original Indie game that has sprouted into 2 more♥♥♥♥♥♥games and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fanbase. I dont hate this game, I'm just very disapointed, it was a horror game that had so much potential yet finished with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ jumpscare, yes, it becomes a challenge of stress and power, but it will eventually pass on to a game with jumpscares, and the fact that somehow, it turned into furry convention 2014 is super disapointing, now I know i'll get a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ comments becuase the fanbase isnt and older that 8 but still, thats another thing, Scott, if you have a bunch of 8 yearolds playing your game and not getting scared, doesn't that make you feel like you could of done better? Do you see 8 yearolds doing role playing or being rabid fans on other horror themed things? Except for creepypastas, creepypastas don't count they're not scary. I would recomend the first game only but not the other two games, those were rushed and♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Well, what's there to say? FN@F is an amazing game. It taught me a lot of things about life. It's full of life, love, compassion, and emotion. I reccomend this for children of all ages. Its a perfect game for anyone who likes an adventure. Freddy is love, Freddy is life.			"

												From Slender to Scp, Now to this? I LOVE the Fnaf series! Its atmosphere is thrilling and heart pounding, while you're forced to sit in a room trying to survive from Freddy and his friends. It puts you through stressful situations, and includes good suprising jumpscares! I like the story to Freddy Fazbears Pizza and its Timeline. Its made me think about how good this game really is. Who wouldn't like this game? BEST INDIE HORROR GAME OF THE YEAR!			"

												Five Night's at Freddys is a horror style survival game where you play as a nightwatchman and have to last til 6am. The only catch is that you have murderous animatronics after you. This is definatley one of the scariest games I've played in a while. This game is challenging, but it is highly enjoyable. Headphones are definitley recommended for this game.			"

												If there's one thing to congratulate Five Nights at Freddy's for it's that it succeeds at being intense and oppressive even without the horror elements. The game could easily be about combatting viruses as opposed to the game's animatronics and it would still be as intimidating to play thanks to the management of power.Much as the game loves to tell you otherwise, it's actually not a jump scare showcase. In reality, FNaF is about preventing the most sharp and uneasing jump scares through your effective management of power through the use of doors, your camera and the lights which reveals nearby animatronics. The other jump scares barely warrant as ""scares"" as they're basically just warnings to make you do the equivalent of a quick time event but in a very organic way that requires you to actually think. I welcomed it greatly, as the actual jump scares are not worth the build up the game gives you (though thus far, I've only died once by animatronic, all the rest have been power outtages). The game relies on you to be able to track the activity of the animatronics which greatly contributes to the fear factor.However, tracking the activity of the animatronics essentially makes the game very much based on trial and error and the animitronics lose much of their creepiness factor once you learn how they operate. The sole animatronic to induce fear to me was Bonnie the Bunny, and it wasn't on account of his appearence (he comes off as silly in many of the camera shots), it's because he quite literally teleports to whatever room his can move into. It makes it near impossible to guess when he will show up outside the Office. Chica and Freddy have specific routes, and you manage how Foxy and Golden Freddy operate. Incidentally, Golden Freddy is a pathetic jump scare which is just unfair to new players. Lift your camera up when he shows up and you'll be fine.Leaving that aside, though, the game does a spectacular job at creating an atmosphere as well as providing gameplay that encourages constant retries. Each night only lasts between ten to fifteen minutes in real time (assuming you don't die), which speaks very well for the game given that it can very quickly establish itself. Even if marred by Bonnie the Bunny and Golden Freddy, the animatronics all have personality and do well to work with the already intense power saving gameplay. It's worth playing simply to say that you've spent a night at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza.			"

												I found Five Nights at Freddy's to be a greatly develouped game with a good concept. There are very few things I found to be unappealing to me. First, the anamitronic characters. Bonnie,Freddy,Chicca, and Foxy are good characters, but if you could add a few more distinctive traits to each of them? Like say Chicca usualy stays near Bonnie because they are friends, and Foxy stays away from Bonnie, but not Chicca. It sounds a little complicated, but if you could add in a few of those, that would be a great  guester. Thank You.			"

So, I'll use this space to discuss what I think Five Night's does well as a horror game.Five Nights takes a very simple horror premise (the siege convention)  places the character in a claustrophobic and unusual setting, and offers the player a slowly decreasing skill to fend off invaders for a specific amount of time. It really is as simple as 'keep the bad guys out' with two buttons. The catch, of course, is that the more you use them, and the more you keep track of where the invaders are, the less ability you have to use what you have to defend yourself (the batteries to those buttons and cameras slowly drain away). The success in this format is in the simplicity of this design itself. Give the player the power to expel the invaders for a short period of time if they use it wisely and sparingly. Use it too much and you'll be safe for a short time but likely perish in the long-term; use it sparingly in order to survive the long-term but let your guard down too much and perish in the short-term.Along with those very simple mechanics Five Nights includes a very creepy and claustrophobic atmosphere. Knowing that there are several animatronic creatures slowly shambling, or in one case running, towards you is itself enough to create a sense of dread. Being able to monitor that progress imperfectly on security cameras that leave some level of ambiguity as to where those creatures are heightens that tension and slowly increases it as time passes each night and the energy you're able to use to defend yourself drains away. The framework that this game is hung on is a very simple one with barebone mechanics. The attention to detail, use of sound, and slowly draining player power unify to create an atmosphere that sets you up to be startled when the creatures pop out. What Five Nights gets right is all of the above, though it's sole gimic is the sudden jump scare. What it does it does well and it doesn't try to be anything that it's not, which makes it perfect for what it is - an enjoyable game that creates tension and then delivers with jump scares. It's also relatively challenging on some of the later levels and can offer the player's a decent challenge. I haven't advanced any further in the series than this as I think that the sequels are just slight variations on this same theme and simple framework and I'm not sure if those games are something that I'm really interested in trying having experienced everything they can offer here. This is a game that has spawned a large number of similar games and has essentially created a sub-genre of simple siege style horror games that has saturated the horror market. Despite that, this is the original and is worth playing if you want to experience a few good jump scares and  see where this type of game became popular.			"

												I was like, ""A $5 dollar new horror game that was supposed to be the scariest of them all? IM BUYING THIS"" So then I got it and launched the game (It downloads like in 2 seconds) I saw Freddy on the menu and then I was like, ""This game seems fun."" I clicked new game, freaked me out, I was only on the first night. Then I was like, ""YES! I BEAT NIGHT 1! NIGHT 2 IS GONNA BE EASAY!!!"" I had a lot of confidence, although, currently, while I'm writing this, I have none at all. When I got to night 2 the phone rang and the guy was like ""You might try to actually take a peak at the cameras right now while I'm speaking..."" so I was like, ""ok."" So I checked the cameras and both Bonnie and Chica were gone. I was like, ""No biggie. Let me find them.... There's Bonnie in the dining area... Where's Chica... WHERE'S CHICA!!!!!"" And then I looked at the kitchen which is audio only and I heard pots and pans and stuff. I kind of spaced out at the sound for like half a minute and then I was like, ""Time to check up on Bonnie..."" Then Bonnie wasn't in the dining area anymore. I checked backstage because that's where he likes hiding and licking the camera or something... (dont ask) But he wasn't there. He wasn't anywhere. Then I was like, ""Let's check the lights on the doors..."" so I put down the camera and then *HORRIFYING SCREAM* and Bonnie shook my screen almost and I almost fell out of my chair. Then I said, ""Never playing this game again."" The next day I played it. Pretty much Bonnie jumpscared me again. That time I DID actually fall out of my chair. Luckily for some reason there was convienently placed cushion.			"

												I'm sure everybody agrees with this, but FNAF is perhaps one of the scariest games out so far, at least in the top ten I'm sure. Although once you get to the fourth night, everything gets a little less scary, the ambience and that general feeling of dread always stays. You know you're going to get caught and probably die, but you have no idea when, and all you can do is delay it. That's what makes it so terrifying, in my opinion, and not just the costant ability to surprise you with every jumpscare.			"

												Oooh, this game.Let me put it this way; I read up on all the info about it, looked through the wiki, watched several LPs of it, even looked at the cutesy fan art. And EVEN THEN, I had one hell of a chill down my spine JUST from looking at the PLAY button. Not even in the title screen, and I was already nervous.And rightly so.Never has keeping an eye on something been more terrifying! I swear, everytime I lost track of the robots, I was SO damn close to needing new underwear. It ESPECIALLY does NOT help my nerves when they just disable the cameras! And that's WITHOUT the fox to worry about!Seriously, this has got to be one of, if not THE best horror game of 2014 so far! Kudos to Scott Cawthon for such an amazing, and frightening, experience!

												When I first saw this game on steam greenlight I actually had very high hopes for this, a concept of horror everyone has feared once in their lives at least yet no one has ever done anything about it. Animatronics, these bloody kind you see in children's restaurants, or used to see anyway. I had given this a thumbs up and continued to look through games since this one was indeed a nice path AWAY from those darn slender clones I kept seeing, and my god how this game has grown in popularity which makes me very, and I mean VERY, happy. This focuses on a slightly new form of horror, it's not seeing something chase you, it's not running from the generi monster trying to catch you from behind or such. This game focuses on knowing there is something after you, knowing what is after you, having the item truly traumatic to the human subconscious with something we have all feared once in our lives, and probably the biggest change here. You know it's coming, you can narrow down where they usually close in but can never predict their actions, and you have not only the feeling of pure paranoia, but have this knawing feeling in the back of your head that it is never IF they find you, never IF they  get you, every IF in a scenario that goes against your progress will always become a WHEN. This game is truly outstanding, and if a sequel is truly being made as I have heard rumors of, then it certainly has my wallet on life support out of eagerness of the awaited release date. Likely what I have said might not make sense to some people since I type things a bit oddly, but to sum up what I think, This is a stupendous game, a full 10 out of the option of 10 given. I sincerely hope a sequel is in the making, and I wish the best of luck towards the maker of this game.			"

												Lets review!This game is intense, and not for your usual survival elements that make big name games what they are.You are confined to a single room. This room has a monitor which provides your only eyesight about Fazbear's Pizza, and two switches; a door switch and a light switch. Your objective is deceptively simple. Survive the night, using these three tools as your only means to see 6 A.M. alive.Might seem easy, at first. The first night will be a breeze, a true tutorial of the game to get comfy. By night 2, you might be surprised to pop open your cameras only to find out one of the animatronics is already out and mucking about.By night 3 you'll understand what real horror is. It isn't in 'Do I have enough bullets', or 'oh damn, I have to outrun this big bad oogy boogy thing'. It's in watching a power gauge go from 100%, and praying to God it doesn't hit 0% before dawn comes. Or hoping Chica will finally go away from the window, while you're trying to maintain three different things and watching your reserves just drop and drop.The jump scares are pretty okay. They'll surprise the hell out of you, and may cause you to scream loudly and in a broad, colorful stream of obscenities. But this is only the icing on a seven layer cake straight from the bakery of Hell. The atmosphere, and tension are the real key factors here. Combined with a resource management scheme that works really well, and becomes significantly harder to deal with, this is a real gem of a game!There are some cons. For instance, your neighbors next door of your apartment will not appreciate the sudden stream of slurs you echo throughout your apartment building. Also, a great deal of the A.I. is either left up to luck itself on whether or not you'll survive, or I somehow was... good, I'm not sure which. Foxy never broke out of Pirate's Cove during my five nights, though he did come sneaking out of the curtain. And Chica decided to jsut take up a five minute vigil outside of my door, which quickly became annoying and cause my only death due to dealing with her while trying to keep an eye on everything else. But at the same time, I'd chalk up such paranoia inducing shennanigans as all part of the experience.Welcome to Freddy's. It's one half skill, and the other half luck. Will yours hold out til 6 in the morning?			"

												I made this purchase after my sister in law was raving about it. I hadn't heard anything about until she opened her mouth and once I heard her words I knew I had to buy it. The game hasn't disappointed yet. I'm only on night 3 but the tension is palpable. I can hear them walking around. I check the cameras and everyone is accounted for. Then every once in a while the Camera's all black out and I'm left with nothing but my own vivid imagination. Are they outside my door? I scan all the cameras and nothing. I shine the light and nothing. It's these little moments that freak me out the most. Not knowing and second guessing myself. The power drains more. What did I do? Will I have enough power to make it through the night? I don't know. I don't know if I want to know. I keep playing though. I'll keep playing till I finish the 5 nights. I think it really might take me 5 nights. I need a day to recuperate from all the stress I feel when playing this game. I love it though. It's not just the jump scares that make it scary.  "

												Okay, so here it is:You are a night watchman at a chucky cheese that was built on an indian burial ground or something, amd the animatronics want to shove your organs into a suit. So...you have to moniter them on the security cameras, chekc the halls with lights, and if worse comes to worst, close the doors. However, every action with the exception of looking left and right, uses power. Even inaction uses power. You have to survive 5 progressively-worse nights, for 6 hours (6 mins actually). A good way to conserve power is to only use the hall lights, and use the cameras to keep tabs on the characters locations. However, run out of power, and you can kiss your♥♥♥♥♥goodbye. Oh, and at the end of the week, you only get payed 120 bucks, and overtime is an extra 50 cents. I wrote a poem to summerize the game.Roses are red,Violets are blu,Should've worked at Chuck's,Now Im ♥♥♥♥ed. "

The story is unique and utterly terrifying but quite short. out of 10 i would rate it 8/10 for it's atmospheric terror and the unique story.

Most likely a similar experience to most by panicing, repeatedly shouting ""♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥"" as i watched foxy from pirate cove run down the hallway towards my office and couldn't shut the door in time.

												NOTE TO THOSE WHO WANT TO PLAY/VIEW THIS GAME: This does contain flashing images and lights, so if you're sensitive to that stuff, then be aware. Also if you're not a fan of psychelogial horror type stories, then this isn't for you. I highly reccommend it for those who love a good scare, very unique, clever dialogue and of course, pants on fire scary animatronic creatures that'll make anyone jump out of their skin. You may never know what'll happen or whent to expect, especially on the first go. Overall, what a great game, really worth it			"

												I was not ready for Freddy. Or Bonnie. Or Chica. Or Foxy. Or this game. Or having a mental breakdown. Or buying a new laptop after I threw it out the third floor window (or at least wanting to).10/10, would be unprepared again.  **EDIT**Okay, so you saw my rather silly review of the game above, quite resembling many reviews for this game. Now, having beaten nights 1-6 without cheats, I have a more experienced and balanced view of the quality of Five Nights at Freddy's (I had only beaten Night 1 when I wrote the original review).So: Five Nights At Freddy's. We've all heard the phrase 'Easy to learn, difficult to master', and I don't know if that suits anything more than this game. The gameplay and controls are very, very simple, requiring only the pointing and clicking of the mouse. Using lights, doors and cameras to hinder the villainous animatronics, you must survive five (actually seven including the Custom Night) nights at Freddy's.The biggest two questions that need to be answered about this game are as follows: is it difficult, and is it scary. Yes, and yes. However, even more important are these questions: is it as difficult, and as scary, as everyone makes it out to be? No, and no. Let me elaborate on my  statements.When I originally purchased Five Nights At Freddy's, less than a week ago, I expected to experience one of the scariest and most difficult games ever. A few days later, I beat Night 4 on my first try, and Night 5 on my second. I'm not claiming that it wasn't hard, but I certainly expected a larger challenge. If you have a good strategy and you're quick at executing it, you should get by, though luck can always go away from your favor. It must be noted, though, that the pressure that you have as a result of the impending atmosphere most certainly makes it more difficult to effeciently carry out your strategy. It is a very difficult game, but not as difficult as people make it out to be sometimes (like saying Night 4 is impossible).Now: is it as scary as people say? Also no. The atmosphere is terrifying, the creatures are freaky and the jump scares are truly startling, but I'm afraid that this game could never be as scary as people say, because so many say it's the scariest game of all time. If you watched PewDiePie's reaction to Bonnie peering into his office, you'd think it was absolutely horrifying. In all honesty, it's just makes me give a little shudder, and get back to the game. Plenty of things in this game fall into that same category. Again, please do not get me wrong, this game is very scary. I just doubt it's the scariest game of all time. Actually, the lore and theories behind the game are probably the scariest part (watch the Game Theorist's video about it). Overall, this is a very difficult, very frustrating (in a good way), very tense and suprisingly well designed game, which I highly recommend for horror fanatics or someone looking for a challenge. 9/10, well done Scott, can't wait to play the second.

												Competitive elitists have ruined Five Nights at Freddy's for me. People should play the game how it was meant to be played... the way Scott INTENDED for it to be played, without metagaming and advanced techniques. And before you come crying to me telling me I'm casual scum, I've been playing Freddy games since the N64 days. Chances are I can beat you using the Phillips CD-i controller. If you wanna make horror survival into some kind of competition, why not try a game that is better suited for it like Silent Hill or Clock Tower, and THEN see how many tournaments you win, jerk.			"

												When I saw this game I thought ""This looks pretty cool, the Idea of weeping angel style animatronic animals is ceepy and could be great to try""............Then I remembered I had a morbid fear of; Mannequins, Statues, anything that looks humanoid that doesn't move...... but then you turn your head away. Then you blink, and oh yes it can!I completed one night with little to no encounters and I was freaking out so much, the atmosphere and the mood were amazing! I've played quite a few horror games and this is in my top list, I'm panicking when I click the play button on Steam because I know whats coming, I am currently on night 2 and I literally can't even...... It gets to a point where I start to get the shakes or I breathe heavily. Have you ever screamed so hard that you trigger an uncontrollable coughing fit, followed by serious throat pains and you then start to lose your voice.....yeah that's what happened to me after my second attempt on the second night, Bonnie the purple giant rabbit jumped me so fast you wouldn't believe, one moment he's there the next....IN MY FACE! And with the loud screech to add to the horror effect.I highly reccommend this game, It's actually great fun desptie the fact you may or may not be able to sleep at night.....or a headache from the loud screeching.... but anyway I say, hey if you want a game to test you're reaction speeds under pressure, this is most definitely the game for you.Well that's just about it really....oh! one last thing I forgot to mention....They're coming. The Mascots are coming for you, but listen -your life could depend on this- don't blink. Don't even blink. Blink and you're dead. They are fast, faster than you could believe. Don't turn your back, don't look away, and don't blink.........Good luck.			"

												When I first saw this game on steam greenlight I actually had very high hopes for this, a concept of horror everyone has feared once in their lives at least yet no one has ever done anything about it. Animatronics, these bloody kind you see in children's restaurants, or used to see anyway. I had given this a thumbs up and continued to look through games since this one was indeed a nice path AWAY from those darn slender clones I kept seeing, and my god how this game has grown in popularity which makes me very, and I mean VERY, happy. This focuses on a slightly new form of horror, it's not seeing something chase you, it's not running from the generi monster trying to catch you from behind or such. This game focuses on knowing there is something after you, knowing what is after you, having the item truly traumatic to the human subconscious with something we have all feared once in our lives, and probably the biggest change here. You know it's coming, you can narrow down where they usually close in but can never predict their actions, and you have not only the feeling of pure paranoia, but have this knawing feeling in the back of your head that it is never IF they find you, never IF they  get you, every IF in a scenario that goes against your progress will always become a WHEN. This game is truly outstanding, and if a sequel is truly being made as I have heard rumors of, then it certainly has my wallet on life support out of eagerness of the awaited release date. Likely what I have said might not make sense to some people since I type things a bit oddly, but to sum up what I think, This is a stupendous game, a full 10 out of the option of 10 given. I sincerely hope a sequel is in the making, and I wish the best of luck towards the maker of this game.			"

												The first in the series, and the most simple but also the best. Reasons why it is the best in the series:+Doesn't require third-party materials in order to actually understand it fully.+The concept was fresh at the time as this was the first in the series. (Also, custom night)+Was more difficult than the other 3 in my opinion as it was harder to conserve your power properly as it was limited.+Was more satisfying than the other 3 when you complete a night.+The story wasn't muddled and all over the place, unlike when it got to the third and fourth games.

												this game gives you the spooks and chills .... at first. after playing a few hours you get used to bonnie popping up at your window and instead of getting scared you end up just saying screw off bonnie. now dont get me wrong for 5$ i was expecting it to be short and to loose novelty after a while. although it may not scare you as much as time progresses i must admit it is fun trying to make it to the next night. if i had to label this game with one word it would be suspense because thats what it does best. The suspense is what really makes the game good. So if your looking for a full on horror game... meh... but if your looking for a suspenseful game with a hint of horror definitly buy it. plus its cheap so do it ! :)			"

												One of the most well made games I personally love. It has good use of the paranoia made from uncertainty, fear of losing and the things we are told are gonna be done to us if we lose and  of course, the jumpscares, but to be honest, behind the simplistic gameplay, is the real reason we love the game so.The hidden backstory is what got me here, along with memorable characters. I won't spoil it here for those who haven't played it, but it's movie worth. The gameplay as a movie, not so much, but the story is so darn deep, that even to this day we haven't got a solid one.Even with the prequel, it's still unclear. But the story is just too darn intriguing, and the characters are unique to me :3If you plan on getting this, focus on the story. Trust me, you'll love it :D			"

												This is one of the best horror games ever made. It's unique and terrifying. It takes out your fear for creepy dolls and animatronics. You get really stressed and that makes you more nervous and scared. I really recommend this game for those  who want to have fun at sleepovers or just playing it alone in the dark. 9.5/10			"

												As this game is designed to scare the living daylights out of you, this is a pretty good game. Basically the aim of the game is not to get caught by the animatronic characters of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza (a Pizzaria designed to entertain children) by watching the cameras to see whereabouts in the building they are. Now at first, I thought that sitting in a little office looking at cameras and checking lights outside two side doors was pretty plain, but with this game having the instructions so simple, the experience is terrifying once Bonnie (the purple rabbit character) is almost at your door on night one. Not to mention the amount of jumpscares included in this game, and all of the little sudden noises which activate your 'Paranoid Mode' because that the game mainly runs in complete silence (apart from the noise of energy and electricity in your office).Once you've had a few hours of playing this game, though, you can get used to all of the noises and jumpscares, and go through the rest of the game with ease by just having to be aware of where the characters are in the building without having a sense of fear towards it because that you're so used to it. But that can take a while, so if you want to overcome your fear of being watched, being hunted, or just of animatronics, have the bravory to play this game non stop for a long time. But if you only want to achieve getting to the end and completing this game, that's fine, I hope you're ready for Freddy.I definitely don't recommend this game for people who have just gotten into the Horror genre in gaming. Start off with something like Slender, and then maybe move onto RPG Horrors (because you're more aware of your surroundings), then probably Amnesia, and if you really want to, try this game out after that (or you could just completetly ignore my advice and play F.N.A.F. with no Horror game experience, so you'll have a much higher possibility of being effected more by the game e.g. being scared in your home because you heard a little noise like the house creaking, or having the game stuck on your head more so you believe that if you turn around, Freddy's going to scream in your face and kill you).This game really plays with your senses, and that's what I like in a Horror game, it makes you afraid to continue, it makes you feel a sense of dread, it activates your 'Parinoid Mode' much more, and (believe me) it stays activated even when you're not playing the game. This game has made me a lot more paranoid, and I really like that Scott Cawthon managed to achieve that feature in the game.I always look for a Horror game that makes you scared to move on, that makes you feel so many unwanted fear-related emotions, that makes you wonder why you bought the game in the first place, that makes you paranoid, that makes you scared to be by yourself, that makes you love the daylight more than ever, that makes you afraid of looking down a hallway or outside, or even out the door into another room.And Five Nights At Freddy's has really got all of those features, easily - well done and thank you Scott for making this game, it brought a lot of smiles and fearful frowns to people's computer screens, and we all are looking forward to Five Nights At Freddy's 2.Thank you so much for reading this review, I hope you enjoyed reading it, and I hope you enjoy/have enjoyed playing F.N.A.F. as much as I have.~Pet			"

												One of the most well made games I personally love. It has good use of the paranoia made from uncertainty, fear of losing and the things we are told are gonna be done to us if we lose and  of course, the jumpscares, but to be honest, behind the simplistic gameplay, is the real reason we love the game so.The hidden backstory is what got me here, along with memorable characters. I won't spoil it here for those who haven't played it, but it's movie worth. The gameplay as a movie, not so much, but the story is so darn deep, that even to this day we haven't got a solid one.Even with the prequel, it's still unclear. But the story is just too darn intriguing, and the characters are unique to me :3If you plan on getting this, focus on the story. Trust me, you'll love it :D			"

												From Slender to Scp, Now to this? I LOVE the Fnaf series! Its atmosphere is thrilling and heart pounding, while you're forced to sit in a room trying to survive from Freddy and his friends. It puts you through stressful situations, and includes good suprising jumpscares! I like the story to Freddy Fazbears Pizza and its Timeline. Its made me think about how good this game really is. Who wouldn't like this game? BEST INDIE HORROR GAME OF THE YEAR!			"

												When I first saw this game on steam greenlight I actually had very high hopes for this, a concept of horror everyone has feared once in their lives at least yet no one has ever done anything about it. Animatronics, these bloody kind you see in children's restaurants, or used to see anyway. I had given this a thumbs up and continued to look through games since this one was indeed a nice path AWAY from those darn slender clones I kept seeing, and my god how this game has grown in popularity which makes me very, and I mean VERY, happy. This focuses on a slightly new form of horror, it's not seeing something chase you, it's not running from the generi monster trying to catch you from behind or such. This game focuses on knowing there is something after you, knowing what is after you, having the item truly traumatic to the human subconscious with something we have all feared once in our lives, and probably the biggest change here. You know it's coming, you can narrow down where they usually close in but can never predict their actions, and you have not only the feeling of pure paranoia, but have this knawing feeling in the back of your head that it is never IF they find you, never IF they  get you, every IF in a scenario that goes against your progress will always become a WHEN. This game is truly outstanding, and if a sequel is truly being made as I have heard rumors of, then it certainly has my wallet on life support out of eagerness of the awaited release date. Likely what I have said might not make sense to some people since I type things a bit oddly, but to sum up what I think, This is a stupendous game, a full 10 out of the option of 10 given. I sincerely hope a sequel is in the making, and I wish the best of luck towards the maker of this game.			"

Yes I am a wimp.I hate jumpscares, but I love this game.  Odd combo.  It can be scary if not prepared.  I would suggest this game for those who want to have a quick scare.  I can see where this won't be scary down the road.  I think the theories for this game are more scary than the game itself, but still puts me on edge.Get the game, it is cheap and not bad at all!

												Five Nights at Freddy's an original Indie game that has sprouted into 2 more♥♥♥♥♥♥games and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fanbase. I dont hate this game, I'm just very disapointed, it was a horror game that had so much potential yet finished with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ jumpscare, yes, it becomes a challenge of stress and power, but it will eventually pass on to a game with jumpscares, and the fact that somehow, it turned into furry convention 2014 is super disapointing, now I know i'll get a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ comments becuase the fanbase isnt and older that 8 but still, thats another thing, Scott, if you have a bunch of 8 yearolds playing your game and not getting scared, doesn't that make you feel like you could of done better? Do you see 8 yearolds doing role playing or being rabid fans on other horror themed things? Except for creepypastas, creepypastas don't count they're not scary. I would recomend the first game only but not the other two games, those were rushed and♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												I didn't think I'd be scared of animatronics, but there I was,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥my pants on night one because Foxy jumped me since I was too stupid and afraid to do anything. Now I can say I'm pretty scared of animatronics. This game is great, not perfect, but it's definitely a satisfying and refreshing take on the horror genre. The controls and gameplay are simple, but it does such a good job at instilling sheer panic and paranoia, that it becomes much harder than it seems. You are forced to fight against your own sense of fear and vulnerabilty in order to save power. The story too is actually very interesting and haunting in itself, especially once you play the later games (fnaf 2/3) as well. Only 'issue' really is that it doesn't take long to learn the patterns and behaviors of the animatronics, meaning the game becomes more predictable and less scary. It's not too hard to develop a strategy to easily make it through all six nights. However, after all six nights, the game does offer a custom night mode, where you can take on the dreaded 4/20 mode if you dare. It's great because, although it is very challenging and frustrating, it adds replayability of the game and it's very rewarding once you get your strategy down and beat it. All-in-all this game is solid and I definitely recommend it. Well done Scott!			"

												Alright, so yeah after seeing this game on the market for some time and never really looking in to it i kind of just brushed it under the rug as just another indie game. Well after about a year I was watching one of my favorite YouTuber's. Markiplier, play this game. And he really got in to it so i was like ok i should try this game out. So I put down the $4.99 and got the game stayed up late in the night and started the game, and just in the opening where I click new game I was alrady feeling uneasy and hearing what the guard befor you had to say was just down right shocking. So I was watching the security cameras for about one minut or so and then I put down the cameras and there was this freaking bunny right there is my face, I jumped out of my chair and was runing for that light switch, and then I came back and hade my older brother come see how scary this game was. And of corse he did it with out seeing anything or anything jumping out at him just like freaddy was taunting me. He got up told me that this game is not scary then left. So I got back on this time on night 2 where my brother left off and all hell brock loose there where things runing around this duck was standing out side of my door and every time i hit the light switch there he was just watching me. So I shut the door's and then saw that I was out of power the lights whent out the door's opened up and there was nothing. Not a sound then there he was standing there watching me, then pow! this thing is in my face im runing for the hill's and never looking back. So yeah over all I give this game a 5 star rating and recommend this as a must buy.			"

But trust me on this, once you've passed the early scare stages, this becomes seriously good fun to play and a real challenge to beat. It take some real calculations to try and defeat the game. Bonnie and Chica are easily predicted and monitored. Freddy and Foxy however are completely different and spice the game up in their unique and random ways.Buy it and enjoy it :) It's £3.99 well spent!			"

												The first in the series, and the most simple but also the best. Reasons why it is the best in the series:+Doesn't require third-party materials in order to actually understand it fully.+The concept was fresh at the time as this was the first in the series. (Also, custom night)+Was more difficult than the other 3 in my opinion as it was harder to conserve your power properly as it was limited.+Was more satisfying than the other 3 when you complete a night.+The story wasn't muddled and all over the place, unlike when it got to the third and fourth games.

												It's essentially unnecessary for me to write a review of this game as there have been a vast number of reviews written already covering a game that is actually quite simple. So, I'll use this space to discuss what I think Five Night's does well as a horror game.Five Nights takes a very simple horror premise (the siege convention)  places the character in a claustrophobic and unusual setting, and offers the player a slowly decreasing skill to fend off invaders for a specific amount of time. It really is as simple as 'keep the bad guys out' with two buttons. The catch, of course, is that the more you use them, and the more you keep track of where the invaders are, the less ability you have to use what you have to defend yourself (the batteries to those buttons and cameras slowly drain away). The success in this format is in the simplicity of this design itself. Give the player the power to expel the invaders for a short period of time if they use it wisely and sparingly. Use it too much and you'll be safe for a short time but likely perish in the long-term; use it sparingly in order to survive the long-term but let your guard down too much and perish in the short-term.Along with those very simple mechanics Five Nights includes a very creepy and claustrophobic atmosphere. Knowing that there are several animatronic creatures slowly shambling, or in one case running, towards you is itself enough to create a sense of dread. Being able to monitor that progress imperfectly on security cameras that leave some level of ambiguity as to where those creatures are heightens that tension and slowly increases it as time passes each night and the energy you're able to use to defend yourself drains away. The framework that this game is hung on is a very simple one with barebone mechanics. The attention to detail, use of sound, and slowly draining player power unify to create an atmosphere that sets you up to be startled when the creatures pop out. What Five Nights gets right is all of the above, though it's sole gimic is the sudden jump scare. What it does it does well and it doesn't try to be anything that it's not, which makes it perfect for what it is - an enjoyable game that creates tension and then delivers with jump scares. It's also relatively challenging on some of the later levels and can offer the player's a decent challenge. I haven't advanced any further in the series than this as I think that the sequels are just slight variations on this same theme and simple framework and I'm not sure if those games are something that I'm really interested in trying having experienced everything they can offer here. This is a game that has spawned a large number of similar games and has essentially created a sub-genre of simple siege style horror games that has saturated the horror market. Despite that, this is the original and is worth playing if you want to experience a few good jump scares and  see where this type of game became popular.			"

												This is my favorite game of the whole series! 4/20 mode super hard so try if you dare. It's not that bad if you have the right strats though. Nights 1-6 are not as hard if your very quick with your camera and doors. Just don't forget the main mascot! Freddy Fazbear! Make sure to keep an eye on him and everyone's favorite Pirate, Foxy! Outstanding game for everyone. Just make sure to keep your door locked and flashlight at the ready. Are you  ready for Freddy?			"

												I was like, ""A $5 dollar new horror game that was supposed to be the scariest of them all? IM BUYING THIS"" So then I got it and launched the game (It downloads like in 2 seconds) I saw Freddy on the menu and then I was like, ""This game seems fun."" I clicked new game, freaked me out, I was only on the first night. Then I was like, ""YES! I BEAT NIGHT 1! NIGHT 2 IS GONNA BE EASAY!!!"" I had a lot of confidence, although, currently, while I'm writing this, I have none at all. When I got to night 2 the phone rang and the guy was like ""You might try to actually take a peak at the cameras right now while I'm speaking..."" so I was like, ""ok."" So I checked the cameras and both Bonnie and Chica were gone. I was like, ""No biggie. Let me find them.... There's Bonnie in the dining area... Where's Chica... WHERE'S CHICA!!!!!"" And then I looked at the kitchen which is audio only and I heard pots and pans and stuff. I kind of spaced out at the sound for like half a minute and then I was like, ""Time to check up on Bonnie..."" Then Bonnie wasn't in the dining area anymore. I checked backstage because that's where he likes hiding and licking the camera or something... (dont ask) But he wasn't there. He wasn't anywhere. Then I was like, ""Let's check the lights on the doors..."" so I put down the camera and then *HORRIFYING SCREAM* and Bonnie shook my screen almost and I almost fell out of my chair. Then I said, ""Never playing this game again."" The next day I played it. Pretty much Bonnie jumpscared me again. That time I DID actually fall out of my chair. Luckily for some reason there was convienently placed cushion.			"

												This game is like crack for jump scare addicts. Everything is incredibly basic and simple which is a nice change from of the overly complicated storylines I see nowadays. You are a night security person in an old pizzaria very similar to Chuck-E-Cheese with one startling difference. The animatronics are sentient and quite irate. Your goal is to keep them out of your security room. Easy right?			"

In BriefNope.  So much nope.Most valuable resource: the unique, disempowering game design.Of interest to: people who want a really unusual survival horror experience, or who enjoy feeling helpless.Never.  Again.  Nope.  No.  Done.This game has one very well designed feature though: upon hitting escape the game immediately shuts down, no questions asked, which is great because in my panic that is what I did, and that is the result I wanted.Five Nights at Freddy's is terrifying.  I will not be playing it again (maybe), but I give it mad props for being the most innovative, creative, inspired take on survival horror at a time when there are so many games out there just trying to be Amnesia or Slender.  Five Nights at Freddy's is terrifyingly original - and that's a large part of the reason I was completely lacking in any immunity to even the most basic scares this game dropped on me and I had to quit out at 4am on the second day because I was having heart palpitations.The brilliance of the design here is that unlike every other survival horror game I've ever played, in Five Nights at Freddy's you do not move,.  You stay exactly where you are in the one room with minimal ability to change your point of view, monitoring the goings on on the security cameras, listening to noises, flicking on the lights to see if anyone's outside your room and if it's worth spending electricity to close the safety door - and through the whole experience you cannot move, you can't run, you can't hide, you can't do anything at all except stand there and wait, and watch, and listen, and know that eventually they're going to come.   It is a uniquely terrifying; in every other game you can give in to your urge to run (whether that's a good idea or not) but in this game you literally cannot.  That instinctive reaction, that self-preserving power is taken away from you, and that fact makes the game so much more unsettling, just that fact that your natural instinct is gone.  When for the first time I flicked on a light and saw an animatronic standing there, stationary, leering at me, I panicked.  In any other game I would have taken shelter, hidden, prepared to fight, whatever, but here?  I was paralysed because none of my instincts knew to do anything other than move.I have often said that indie gaming brings creativity and innovation in much the same was as structured poetry does.  When you have to work within the rigid limitations afforded by your budget and timeline, you find ways to really drill down and focus on the most important aspects, the critical features that are essential for your game.  In Five Nights at Freddy's they took a game with a simple, no-physics point-and-click interface, and handful of static visuals and a whole lot of atmosphere and made the scariest experience I've ever had in front of a computer.

												This game ruined my life 8/8 m8 While this game is good, you should buy it, put it on the begining screen, but never actually play it, it will make you look like a pro even when  you are a nub.Night one.    I do absoloutly nothing but check on foxy, check the doors, and honk freddy's nose on the poster, I was visited by bonnie twice, first time he came, I closed the door, and he left, then the next tim he stayed at the door for about one and a half minutes. Chica stayed in the bathroom/kitchen. Freddy stayed on stage, and foxy just looked at me through the curtains.Second night. Only bonnie chica, and foxy were my predators. Bonnie came first, maybe a couple seconds after the call ended. Bonnie stayed for maybe two minutes, then left. Chica game for a surprise, and I shut the door and she went and cried in the kitchen forever. Foxy made one attempt but failed horibly, because the door was already closed because bonnie had been there. Bonnie came back and stayed at the door forever, and it drained all my power. Luckily freddy's jumpscare was cut short by the ""6 Am"" Message. I also got the rare screenshot of the 3 crying children posters in the hall.Third night. First night I died, bonnie came around a lot, but never stayed for too long. While no one was around I was too dumb playing around with freddys nose on the poster to notice freddy was actualy coming fter me. After a while I realise freddy was gone, I couldn't find him anywhere, then I go out of my camera because id went out and I had a birthday surprise by Freddy ♥♥♥♥boy. Fourth night, I got seconds in and then foxy killed me, That sucked. But the next time it was too easy, only freddy and bonnie came by, freddy was no trouble and neither was bonnie, so it was pretty easy.Fifth nightI'm crying now. I've tried several times but freddy won't leave me alone. No matter how much I beg, I close the door, he doesn't leave, and I run out of power, I open them for a second, freddy kills me. I am so close, I only have a hour left, and 10% I decide that since freddy was not in the doorway I would open it. I've been opening and closing it before now, and little did I know freddy was already in the room. I check the camera, no freddy, anywhere. I knew the exact places the animetronics could appear, and freddy was either in the kitchen, or nowhere at all. I exit out of camera and kills me, it was only seconds till I could have won. I beg, I pray, I make teddy bear sacrifaces, nothing works. I honk freddys poster nose, I get a bet farther than normal, but still can't win. I've played 116 minutes. I originaly owned it just to show kids how bad♥♥♥♥♥I was, but ended up playing in front of some friends, I've screamed and cried, and even smacked a friend in the face by accident. This game has ruined my life, yet I am addicted. God, any god, or even no god, I need a lot of a help.  "

												I originally watched Markiplier and various other youtubers play it,entertaining millions with how much they got scared,and I decided to play it for myself,and after playing it some,I can see why they got so scared x)The game hardly has a plot really,it's one of those short indie horror games that doesn't really need a plot,but it centers around an unnamed worker who takes the night shift at a restaurant called Freddy Fazbear's Pizza,with some interesting(to put it nicely)things happening during the night shift.The gameplay is simple,you have a camera monitor that you can use to switch between security cameras in the place,you can close/open the electrical doors in your office to keep the animatronics from coming in,and lights to see if they're outside the room. All of these different things at your disposal are important in their own way for protecting yourself from the animatronics and surviving each night.In addition to the 5 nights in the game,there's an additional 6th Night,and even a 7th Night,where you can customize the AI to make it easy as heck or as hard as The Impossible Game.The atmosphere is REALLY well done,and it gives you a feeling of tension,panic,and anticipation,which is really effective in scaring you.The music is pretty cool,tho the game mostly relies on ambiance and atmosphere.Overall,while this game is pretty simple,it's one of those games that while simple,can still scare the crap out of you.9/10 from me :)(UPDATE Nov. 14,2014-Just watched FNAF 2 on vid for my first time ever so far,and I was ♥♥♥♥ing fearing for my life. I'll def be getting FNAF 2 when I get my laptop for Christmas ^-^)(UPDATE Jan. 1,2015: just beat night 5 :D)(UPDATE Feb 21,2015: Use this strategy on 4/20 mode that I use if you have trouble,it helped me get very far in:Keep the camera mostly on E Hall Corner,that way you won't have to shut the right door every time you check the camera,which would waste powerWhen Chica is at the door,check Pirate Cove quickly,then back to E Hall CornerAfter 2 AM, check Pirate Cove at any random time of your choosing(when you do this,close the right door so Freddy doesn't come in)If the curtains are wide open,go to the W Hall to trigger Foxy running,then go immediately out and shut the left door(also have the right door closed when you do this,otherwise Freddy will come in and kill you)Check both lights,if Bonnie or Chica is at the door,close the door,once their gone,open the door(UPDATE Feb 21,2015: Just beat 4/20 mode,I'm literally shaking)(UPDATE Feb 28,2015: Completed a""speedrun""of nights 1-5 with 1 death on night 5,end time: 54:16.04)			"

												This game is incredibly simple and that's what makes it so wonderful.You just listen to the instructions, wait a few minutes, uninstall and go cry in the corner. Simple.As for specifics,There's very few controls which means you are able to let all of your non-gamer friends play as well. [It's even on android and iOS]Just a few clicks and a few minutes later, you'll have your friends screaming and crying in the corner with you in no time.			"

Also he can only appear in the Left Side so dont forget to light the Corridor sometimes.2:Chica   -  Yellow Chicken with really big eyes.She is kinda slow and will approach your office rather slowly but then she will look at you through the glass almost forever.She can only appear from Right side so chceck the corridor sometimes...3:Foxy     - Probably the most annoying Animotronic.He is hiding in Pirate Cove and if you dont chcek him for too long or check him too much he will run across the Hallway and knock on your door if you are qucik and close them. 4:Freddy - Almost invisible motherfu.cker who is always hiding in shadows and come closer and closer to your office, until you die or light him up !5:Golden Freddy  - Just dont look at him for too long !80%Jumpscare galore with amazing Story and Characters !-Chobotik			"

Good Guy DollRemember the chucky movies?A creepy killer doll is on the loose and out for murder. It spawned a franchise spanning 6 movies (so far...)and if these movies did one thing well, it was to create the world's creepiest little plastic killer  ever! That is until now...""Chucky"" CheeseFive Nights at Freddy's places you in the role of a security guard working the ""dead"" night shift at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza.A family friendly pizza place popular for kids parties and famous for its animatronic  robots, Freddy Fazbear and his pals. These happy, clappy, little fur covered robots entertain the kids during the day but seem to have a tendency to wonder the dark and empty rooms and corridors at night.Puppet MasterThat's where you come in, the job of night security guard has suspiciously become vacant and you're the lucky applicant.Starting the game, you will find yourself sitting in a cramped little security office surrounded by CCTV monitors, a phone,  a door on either side of you and couple of light switches. It's a pretty oppressive setting to start with, but before too long the phone will ring and you'll start to get an idea of the situation you've gotten yourself into.KISS PrincipleThe game-play itself couldn't be simpler. You flick between grey, fuzzy security feeds, watching out for anything unusual. You view the empty tables, the dark corridors, the animatronics room. You'll get your first glimpse of the ""puppets"" themselves.You remember how I said earlier that the Chucky doll from the Childs Play moves was creepy?Well the unnerving smiles leering through the metal and fur present on these animatronics captures that sense of menace perfectly, but there was only one chucky, here you'll find yourself stalked by a few of the creepy buggers!The only other controls you have beside flicking through the CCTV screens, are the door controls (you can lock yourself in your office) and the door lights (CCTV doesn't quite cover the dark access to your office, A blind spot which can prove fatal.)It's behind You!Wait, did you just say fatal?Oh yes, Freddy and his friends have a habit of wondering around at night, and should they manage to find their way into your little office... well.. . It's game over man!So why don't you just turn on your lights, lock the doors and wait till morning?It's a question of power management. You only have a limited amount of electricity you can utilise throughout the night.Keeping the lights on drains power, keeping the doors locked drains power and trust me, you don't want to be out of power when you see  that creepy bear leering into the security camera just outside your office!SurpriseDon't go in expecting a triple A release here or you will be disappointed, what you essential get for your money are a series of static screens you can flick between and some creepy audio, but this bare bones description doesn't do the experience justice.With such a simple premise and game mechanics it's a surprise that this game works, but it does.This is a title that is more than the sum of its parts.The tension builds as your power reserves dwindle. You'll see the cuddly killers creeping ever closer. You'll have your  finger ready on the door lock button, just one more second, just one more second before you hit it....This game oozes atmosphere, It's as creepy as hell and it WILL make you jump!If you're looking for a cheap scare that you can enjoy over the course of an hour or so, then you can't go far wrong with Five Nights At Freddy's.Childs PlayPlay with headphones,Play in the darkPlay on your ownPlay Five Nights At Freddy'sFor the full review and others please click HERE[www.review-well.com] "

In BriefNope.  So much nope.Most valuable resource: the unique, disempowering game design.Of interest to: people who want a really unusual survival horror experience, or who enjoy feeling helpless.Never.  Again.  Nope.  No.  Done.This game has one very well designed feature though: upon hitting escape the game immediately shuts down, no questions asked, which is great because in my panic that is what I did, and that is the result I wanted.Five Nights at Freddy's is terrifying.  I will not be playing it again (maybe), but I give it mad props for being the most innovative, creative, inspired take on survival horror at a time when there are so many games out there just trying to be Amnesia or Slender.  Five Nights at Freddy's is terrifyingly original - and that's a large part of the reason I was completely lacking in any immunity to even the most basic scares this game dropped on me and I had to quit out at 4am on the second day because I was having heart palpitations.The brilliance of the design here is that unlike every other survival horror game I've ever played, in Five Nights at Freddy's you do not move,.  You stay exactly where you are in the one room with minimal ability to change your point of view, monitoring the goings on on the security cameras, listening to noises, flicking on the lights to see if anyone's outside your room and if it's worth spending electricity to close the safety door - and through the whole experience you cannot move, you can't run, you can't hide, you can't do anything at all except stand there and wait, and watch, and listen, and know that eventually they're going to come.   It is a uniquely terrifying; in every other game you can give in to your urge to run (whether that's a good idea or not) but in this game you literally cannot.  That instinctive reaction, that self-preserving power is taken away from you, and that fact makes the game so much more unsettling, just that fact that your natural instinct is gone.  When for the first time I flicked on a light and saw an animatronic standing there, stationary, leering at me, I panicked.  In any other game I would have taken shelter, hidden, prepared to fight, whatever, but here?  I was paralysed because none of my instincts knew to do anything other than move.I have often said that indie gaming brings creativity and innovation in much the same was as structured poetry does.  When you have to work within the rigid limitations afforded by your budget and timeline, you find ways to really drill down and focus on the most important aspects, the critical features that are essential for your game.  In Five Nights at Freddy's they took a game with a simple, no-physics point-and-click interface, and handful of static visuals and a whole lot of atmosphere and made the scariest experience I've ever had in front of a computer.

												This game ruined my life 8/8 m8 While this game is good, you should buy it, put it on the begining screen, but never actually play it, it will make you look like a pro even when  you are a nub.Night one.    I do absoloutly nothing but check on foxy, check the doors, and honk freddy's nose on the poster, I was visited by bonnie twice, first time he came, I closed the door, and he left, then the next tim he stayed at the door for about one and a half minutes. Chica stayed in the bathroom/kitchen. Freddy stayed on stage, and foxy just looked at me through the curtains.Second night. Only bonnie chica, and foxy were my predators. Bonnie came first, maybe a couple seconds after the call ended. Bonnie stayed for maybe two minutes, then left. Chica game for a surprise, and I shut the door and she went and cried in the kitchen forever. Foxy made one attempt but failed horibly, because the door was already closed because bonnie had been there. Bonnie came back and stayed at the door forever, and it drained all my power. Luckily freddy's jumpscare was cut short by the ""6 Am"" Message. I also got the rare screenshot of the 3 crying children posters in the hall.Third night. First night I died, bonnie came around a lot, but never stayed for too long. While no one was around I was too dumb playing around with freddys nose on the poster to notice freddy was actualy coming fter me. After a while I realise freddy was gone, I couldn't find him anywhere, then I go out of my camera because id went out and I had a birthday surprise by Freddy ♥♥♥♥boy. Fourth night, I got seconds in and then foxy killed me, That sucked. But the next time it was too easy, only freddy and bonnie came by, freddy was no trouble and neither was bonnie, so it was pretty easy.Fifth nightI'm crying now. I've tried several times but freddy won't leave me alone. No matter how much I beg, I close the door, he doesn't leave, and I run out of power, I open them for a second, freddy kills me. I am so close, I only have a hour left, and 10% I decide that since freddy was not in the doorway I would open it. I've been opening and closing it before now, and little did I know freddy was already in the room. I check the camera, no freddy, anywhere. I knew the exact places the animetronics could appear, and freddy was either in the kitchen, or nowhere at all. I exit out of camera and kills me, it was only seconds till I could have won. I beg, I pray, I make teddy bear sacrifaces, nothing works. I honk freddys poster nose, I get a bet farther than normal, but still can't win. I've played 116 minutes. I originaly owned it just to show kids how bad♥♥♥♥♥I was, but ended up playing in front of some friends, I've screamed and cried, and even smacked a friend in the face by accident. This game has ruined my life, yet I am addicted. God, any god, or even no god, I need a lot of a help.  "

Description:Five Nights at Freddy's is a horror game... but it isn't scary. In FNaF you work at ""Freddy Fazbear's Pizza"", a happy little pizza place with four anamatronics: Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, And Foxy. But you work as a night guard, and in the night, the anamatronics try to kill you.My Thoughts:Gameplay: 15/100Music: 40/100Visuals: 65/100Story: 30/100Overall: 20/100.			"

												Five Nights never really catched my attention. At first it seemed like another typical jump-scare game that Youtubers will just overreact about in videos. Once MatPat released his theory on the story, my interest began to grow. I started searching stuff about the game and at the peek of it all, I bought it on Steam.The gameplay is pretty simple, you just have to monitor the animatronics at night for 6 in-game hours and keep them out from the security room you are at. You have a camera that shows most of the building to you, 2 doors that you can close and 2 lights that you can turn on to see 2 o fthe animatronics in case you can't find them on the camera. The real kicker though is that EVERYTHING DRAINS POWER. Power is basically your best friend while playing the game and it drains at a moderately slow rate when you don't use anything. The more stressed you are and francticly try to check the camera and close the doors, the more power it drains. This makes the game an interesting combination of surviving the animatronics, while at the same time trying to not run out of time. pretty unique as far as horror games go.Speaking of horror, this game seriously has none. I am a complete ♥♥♥♥♥ when it comes to any type of scare, but this game was a walk in the park pretty much. Not even close to the scariest game ever as everyone tries to say. I will, however, say that it was mostly because of the way the game is made. It is possible to beat the game without a single jumpscare, as long as you have the skill to do it. This is good, because your own skill dictates the scares of the game. Very cool.Let's talk about the nights, shall we?The first 3 or so nights are pretty easy if you know what you are doing. When night 4 comes, it gets harder. Not only do you have to deal with Bonnie and Chica, which can sometimes overstay at your doors and drain too much power, but you have to deal with Foxy, who can quickly run at your office and can get you killed if you don't check him often. Freddy also becomes a threat and can be a problem if let to go close to your office. There are plenty of strategies out there on how to beat nights 3-6 and it's even possible to make Freddy and Foxy stay at their starting points the entire night, making it quite easy. Night 7 is a custom night that you can change to your heart's desire. It's mostly just a nice end-game addition to help you practice, but if you beat the hardest possible setup, you pretty much have beat the game 100%.The presentation is another thing where this game excells at. The dark and eerie athmosphere really has that feel of being alone at night. In the end, the game is great. I think that it's a good entry point for people who are interested in horror and it has great mechanics, great athmosphere and a story that makes you think.If you are interested, give it a go. It's not the easiest of games, especially when it comes to the later nights, but it is well worth it just for the experience. "

												Why do I have to be ashamed to admit I enjoy these games? The fanbase has gone to complete crap, and no where seems to be safe. These youngin's are trying to ruin my horror games! Seriously, don't bother trying to find a good community. Without any of that into consideration, the game is good. (Depending on who you are.) As for the horror part, it's great. It's dripping in atmosphere, and while you could call it ""jumpscare-bait,"" the jumpscares would be meaningless without a good build up. The sound design is superb, it's haunting and the game rewards you for listening closely as most of the sounds mean something. The gameplay is great and very original. It's very well thought-out, you can really tell that a lot of effort went into making all the mechanics. That being said, many people don't like it and just feels as if it's micro-management. The animatronics all move and act mostly randomly which is great and unexpected in Nights 1-4, but on 5 it just feels unfair. You can play the game perfectly, yet it'll screw you over because... why not? It feels like a fake added difficulty, when I die I should feel like I made a mistake! Not because the random number generator screwed me over!The visuals are simple and not overly detailed, yet they are good enough and give the game it's own style and character. Each room is well put together and can be really spooky, especially at night! The graphics are all pre-rendered images, and while it is rough around the edges in places, it isn't too easy to notice. It's done very well to trick you into think it's actually 3D. (Though more observant players will notice.) The story is what some would call the only part worth playing in this game. The story is presented very well, and is very mysterious. It's a lot of fun to try and put the pieces together and search for clues throughout the series. Yet, despit what some think, the story itself is very simplistic. It's not about the destination, it's about the journey.Even with all that, it is far from perfect. The jumpscares look laughably silly, and it could remove all the built up tension you had. The game is well designed, but not well made. There is no pause button. Pushing escape instantly exits the game. (Like, what?) There are no options what-so-ever. (No subtitles for people who like them) There are no resolution options, the game is not widescreen so if you play it fullscreen on any monitor that isn't decades old, it'll just stretch the image. This is 2015, widescreen should be the standard. If you can ignore it's technical flaws, the community, and want a unique and fresh horror experience, play this game. If you've seen videos and don't think you'll enjoy it, then you probably won't, so don't bother. And if you do enjoy the game, then I recommend the sequels!The sequels are great, and they don't feel like shameless cash-ins. Each game brings a new gameplay twist making each one stand out as it's own game. I say you should give all of them a try, but if you only want to try one I would say go with the fourth one. It's really good. (Unfortunatly, they all suffer from the same flaws as this one. Except for the jumpscares, those got better to the point of actually being freaky.)			"

												Its kind of like Night Trap, except rather the teenage girls running around, theres a bunch of Chuck-E-Cheese animatronics trying to get into your office and touch your butt.Which can be considered a negative or a positive depending on the kind of sick the part of the internet your on is.You sit around in your office while watching the security camera feed to see how close the animatronic animals are to touching your butt, and if they get close enough to stare at you threw the door way, you slam your military grade door that a Chuck-E-Cheese had installed for some reason right in their face. But don't screw around with the doors too much or you'll loose all your power, the doors will open ( because the doors are closed by magnet like things, that require power to function. They have these types of doors installed in military bases so if power cuts out the doors will automatically open and the people won't be trapped inside.  Or something like that. That's why the doors drain power.)and Freddy will touch your butt, and it will be game over. I didn't personally find this game scary, but that's because I didn't really grow up around the age of spooky Chuck-E-Cheese animatronics and I'm not stressed out too easily. But I do, however, enjoy playing the game as a game, as in I genuinely find the gameplay fun, challenging and creative. And I can see how people would be scared by this game if they grew up with the early 80's or 90's (Not entirley sure when the animatronics were at their most grotesque and uncanny) and they are generally a very anxious person. But there are some negatives here, such as the fact that the cameras themselves are almost entirley useless. The animatronics locations are basically meaningless, as they seem to be able to jump to right outside your office in a instant on later nights, Infact the creator of the game, Scott Cawthon, even added an animatronic in, that's entire purpose is to ensure you don't abandon the cameras. I feel like this could have been fixed by a system that would cause they animatronics to gradually become more and more active, unless you watched them all frequently and sufficiently. Also the game doesn't really have alot of gameplay too it, once you beat it there is really no point on coming back to it. Its not going to be scary and not going to be fun to play. But hey its base price is five dollars, what do you expect really. I hear alot of people complaining that this game is a ""jumpscare fest"" which is in my opinion, a very stupid statement to make. You only ever get jumpscared when you get your butt touched, or more accurately, die and get a game over. As if its a punisment for screwing up, something you had complete control of. Unlike something like Slender, where you get jumpscared for walking around a corner, or turning around.So to conclude, I don't really find this game that scary, but I do find it a fun idea excuted nicely, so take that for what you  can take that for what you will. Thanks.			"

												Five Nights at Freddy's is a simple game that banks on jump-scares.Each animatronic character that you have to monitor in this game has its own personality and behavior. You have to learn these to begin to predict where to monitor and when and at what points to toggle the door locks and lights. This requires many play-throughs to get it right.The thing that makes this game worthwhile, to me, is how much they were able to do with such a limited tool set. There's really no animation. You're just looking at still images through a camera that pans side to side. Instead of animations, cameras black out momentarily. You only ever see still images. And yet, you still get this quirky story with a game play that requires replays and observation to eventually master.If you're looking for a real horror or survival game, this isn't it. If you're looking for very deep game play, this isn't it. If you're looking for two or three hours of trying to beat-the-pattern with the occasional startle (even after the tenth time, I still get a little jolt), then it's worth grabbing. I got it at half price and it's worth that. I think the default five bucks is just about right at the limit of a reasonable price.I just find it so damn clever how much they did with so little. If you're uncertain about the game, it's still worth looking into at a lower price point.			"

												Five Nights at Freddy's is a simple game that banks on jump-scares.Each animatronic character that you have to monitor in this game has its own personality and behavior. You have to learn these to begin to predict where to monitor and when and at what points to toggle the door locks and lights. This requires many play-throughs to get it right.The thing that makes this game worthwhile, to me, is how much they were able to do with such a limited tool set. There's really no animation. You're just looking at still images through a camera that pans side to side. Instead of animations, cameras black out momentarily. You only ever see still images. And yet, you still get this quirky story with a game play that requires replays and observation to eventually master.If you're looking for a real horror or survival game, this isn't it. If you're looking for very deep game play, this isn't it. If you're looking for two or three hours of trying to beat-the-pattern with the occasional startle (even after the tenth time, I still get a little jolt), then it's worth grabbing. I got it at half price and it's worth that. I think the default five bucks is just about right at the limit of a reasonable price.I just find it so damn clever how much they did with so little. If you're uncertain about the game, it's still worth looking into at a lower price point.			"

												Why do I have to be ashamed to admit I enjoy these games? The fanbase has gone to complete crap, and no where seems to be safe. These youngin's are trying to ruin my horror games! Seriously, don't bother trying to find a good community. Without any of that into consideration, the game is good. (Depending on who you are.) As for the horror part, it's great. It's dripping in atmosphere, and while you could call it ""jumpscare-bait,"" the jumpscares would be meaningless without a good build up. The sound design is superb, it's haunting and the game rewards you for listening closely as most of the sounds mean something. The gameplay is great and very original. It's very well thought-out, you can really tell that a lot of effort went into making all the mechanics. That being said, many people don't like it and just feels as if it's micro-management. The animatronics all move and act mostly randomly which is great and unexpected in Nights 1-4, but on 5 it just feels unfair. You can play the game perfectly, yet it'll screw you over because... why not? It feels like a fake added difficulty, when I die I should feel like I made a mistake! Not because the random number generator screwed me over!The visuals are simple and not overly detailed, yet they are good enough and give the game it's own style and character. Each room is well put together and can be really spooky, especially at night! The graphics are all pre-rendered images, and while it is rough around the edges in places, it isn't too easy to notice. It's done very well to trick you into think it's actually 3D. (Though more observant players will notice.) The story is what some would call the only part worth playing in this game. The story is presented very well, and is very mysterious. It's a lot of fun to try and put the pieces together and search for clues throughout the series. Yet, despit what some think, the story itself is very simplistic. It's not about the destination, it's about the journey.Even with all that, it is far from perfect. The jumpscares look laughably silly, and it could remove all the built up tension you had. The game is well designed, but not well made. There is no pause button. Pushing escape instantly exits the game. (Like, what?) There are no options what-so-ever. (No subtitles for people who like them) There are no resolution options, the game is not widescreen so if you play it fullscreen on any monitor that isn't decades old, it'll just stretch the image. This is 2015, widescreen should be the standard. If you can ignore it's technical flaws, the community, and want a unique and fresh horror experience, play this game. If you've seen videos and don't think you'll enjoy it, then you probably won't, so don't bother. And if you do enjoy the game, then I recommend the sequels!The sequels are great, and they don't feel like shameless cash-ins. Each game brings a new gameplay twist making each one stand out as it's own game. I say you should give all of them a try, but if you only want to try one I would say go with the fourth one. It's really good. (Unfortunatly, they all suffer from the same flaws as this one. Except for the jumpscares, those got better to the point of actually being freaky.)			"

												Its kind of like Night Trap, except rather the teenage girls running around, theres a bunch of Chuck-E-Cheese animatronics trying to get into your office and touch your butt.Which can be considered a negative or a positive depending on the kind of sick the part of the internet your on is.You sit around in your office while watching the security camera feed to see how close the animatronic animals are to touching your butt, and if they get close enough to stare at you threw the door way, you slam your military grade door that a Chuck-E-Cheese had installed for some reason right in their face. But don't screw around with the doors too much or you'll loose all your power, the doors will open ( because the doors are closed by magnet like things, that require power to function. They have these types of doors installed in military bases so if power cuts out the doors will automatically open and the people won't be trapped inside.  Or something like that. That's why the doors drain power.)and Freddy will touch your butt, and it will be game over. I didn't personally find this game scary, but that's because I didn't really grow up around the age of spooky Chuck-E-Cheese animatronics and I'm not stressed out too easily. But I do, however, enjoy playing the game as a game, as in I genuinely find the gameplay fun, challenging and creative. And I can see how people would be scared by this game if they grew up with the early 80's or 90's (Not entirley sure when the animatronics were at their most grotesque and uncanny) and they are generally a very anxious person. But there are some negatives here, such as the fact that the cameras themselves are almost entirley useless. The animatronics locations are basically meaningless, as they seem to be able to jump to right outside your office in a instant on later nights, Infact the creator of the game, Scott Cawthon, even added an animatronic in, that's entire purpose is to ensure you don't abandon the cameras. I feel like this could have been fixed by a system that would cause they animatronics to gradually become more and more active, unless you watched them all frequently and sufficiently. Also the game doesn't really have alot of gameplay too it, once you beat it there is really no point on coming back to it. Its not going to be scary and not going to be fun to play. But hey its base price is five dollars, what do you expect really. I hear alot of people complaining that this game is a ""jumpscare fest"" which is in my opinion, a very stupid statement to make. You only ever get jumpscared when you get your butt touched, or more accurately, die and get a game over. As if its a punisment for screwing up, something you had complete control of. Unlike something like Slender, where you get jumpscared for walking around a corner, or turning around.So to conclude, I don't really find this game that scary, but I do find it a fun idea excuted nicely, so take that for what you  can take that for what you will. Thanks.			"

												I ignored this title when it first appeared on the Steam catalogue as it didn't really seem to be my kind of thing, but after a friend suggested that I look it up properly, I proceeded to watch the trailers and thought that it would be worth a go... why not? I had a look around the net and got it for 50% off on HumbleBundle.com.First of all, I am really glad that I took the time to play Five Nights at Freddy's, even though it's not the type of game or genre I would normally go for, it turned out to be a lot of fun and actually pretty scary, even though you know what's coming after a couple of play-throughs, the game still has an ability to keep you on the edge of your seat. Five Nights at Freddy's is a simple horror game where you take up night shifts as a security guard for Freddy's resturant, strange and frightening things being to happen when the animatronics seem to develop a mind of their own after 12AM. You have a limited amount of power and thus, very limited visibility while you struggle to decide if you want to keep the cameras/lights on or the doors kept sealed. I won't go into too much detail as I don't want to spoil it for any of you. This turned out to be a great little Indie Game and the way it has soared in popularity in such a short amount of time is astounding, but I am glad that this is getting a lot of recognition. Even though the concept is simple, the game itself is fantastic and a lot of fun, especially at 2AM in the morning with all of the lights off and volume on full. Even though it's somewhat of a short game with simple controls, it is well worth the £1.99 I spent on it (I'd say it's worth the full £3.99 too) and I am really looking forward to a sequal or any future updates. If you've been keeping an eye on this but are unsure about spending £3.99 on something short, see if you can find it on sale somewhere. Take my word for it, it's brilliant. This game proves beyond a doubt that simplicity in a game can be very effective.			"

												--WARNING--This review represents my own, objective opinion about this game. This means, that I will not praise the game for the good things and don't mention it's flawes, but I also won't talk only bad things about the game to make it look completly worthless. As far as the review goes, it will have spoilers, so i'd recommend either reading on, if you don't have a problem with that or simply ignore this review. Viewer Discretion Advised.--Introduction--Five Night's at Freddy is a Horror Point-&-Click Adventure game made by one developer (Scott Cawthon).The game reviewed alot of positive reviews by a lot of people and already was Let's Played by several big Let's Players.--Plot--The plot is very simple in the basic. You are Mike Schmidt who's going to work for the Freddy Fazzbear's Pizza as a Night Guard for a week during the summer from 12AM untill 6AM/ a day. Your Job is to watch the animatronics (the main attraction of the Pizzarea) as they are wandering around at night and are not allowed to be shut down or they will lock themselves.This and many other advises and mentions about certain events are being told by a guy on the Phone, who's the only ally for the player, you reciev every night untill the 4th night. He tells right in the first night that the animatronics might come to your office and might mistake you for being an animatronic without a costume and, since this is against the rules, you'll be forced by the animatronics into a costume, which has wires and beams, and won't fit a human body in, resulting in your death. The only defense the player has are 2 doors (1 to the left and 1 to the right), the lights near the doors for the blind spots and your camera to track them down.--Gameplay--The game is being controlled only by the mouse and the only interaction you have are the 4 buttons in your office and the monitor, from which you can switch through different camera feeds. As mentioned earlier, you control with the buttons the doors and the light in the hallways outside the doors. To make things more ""difficult"" you only have a limited amout of power you can use to protect yourself. That means that closing doors, using the lights and cameras consume power. The more things you use at the same time the quicker the power depletes. If your power is completly consumed, you die unless you are close to 6AM and still have some seconds to have a chance to get to the next night. There are a total of 4 (with ""Golden Freddy"" 5) animatronics you have to watch for and each of them are more or less unique in their aproach. The first active animatronics will be Bonnie (the blue bunny) and Chica (the yellow chicken). They will roam randomly through the building and will sometimes aproach your office. The further you get in the nights, the more active they'll get. The next animatronic is Foxy (The Pirate-Fox) who's malfunctioning and is ""out of order"" in his cove. He is the most easylie predictable animatronic if you know his pattern (although that is also random which means you wont know exactly when he is going to attack). the 4th. being freddy and, in later nights, the most agressive animatronic if not dealt with. The 5th. being Golden Freddy, but there must be certain events activated to summon him, which is in the most cases very rare and can be avoided very easy.If you die in this game, then your death will always be a jumpscare, which will be more or less predictable, and you have to start the night from the beginning. And there is no ""Pause"" function.--Things I like about this game--One thing the game is realy good at is building up tense. The feeling, that an animatronic will attack at any moment and , if you don't watch carefully you'll be punished with a Jumpscare, can happen every single moment. This works pretty good with the random mechanics, since every night is different from the previous, even on new attempts. There is also a form of balance in it to prevent abuses of certain mechanics to get through the game. The strongest element of the game is the fact, that it has plenty room for theories which can tease the player to speculate about with others.I actualy used more time to read theories and making my own theories then playing the game (which is actualy not something good, but i will talk about this later).--Things I don't like about this game--As I mentioned earlier that the game has random mechanics, they are not random enough (at least for me).The biggest problem being the animatronics attacking from the same spots (Bonnie from the left door, Chica from the right door, Foxy only approaching the left door and freddy from the right. This leads to a fair amount of predictabilitie and using ""strategies"" which are not exactly fun in my opinion. For instance: you simply have to check the left and right door with the lights and be ready to close the door for chica and bonnie, since they won't ""unexpectibly"" teleport into your office. This will make the cameras for them pretty much pointless and the camera will be used for someting more simplier and more predictable. This means you will watch a total of only 2 cameras in an entire night, and you won't even look at them for long. The cameras will be used to slow down foxy and Freddy to prevent them from attacking and to check for foxy, when he is ready to attack. Another thing is the lack of ""animation"" in the game. all (except for Foxy) animatronics simply teleport from room to room, making the cameras to watch their position almost pointless (for chica, bonnie and Freddy) since they can almost instantly teleport near your office and before you find all of them, one will be in your office, ready to attack. If the animatronics would actualy ""move"" and even attack from random doors then the camera would get a much better mechanic in the game and it is more crucial to watch their positions in order to know when and WHERE they attack. The last thing the game being to short. I didn't complet the game to 100% but i got from night 1 through night 5 (with night 5 completed) in slightly above an hour and I died only once in night 1 because I was unaware of Foxy being active in the first night if you dont watch the camera at all (I was using only the lights since I knew that only Bonnie and maybe chica are active in this night). Since one night is aprox. 8min and 30 secs I would've complete the game in less then 1 and a half hour 100% using the same strategy and I would not have to replay the game again for pure ""fun"" in gameplay. instead I would or still am speculating about theories then, which is by far more fun espacialy with the 2nd game being out. The last thing being the lac of options. You are not able to set resolutions and adjust the game volume which doesn't nececcary destroy the game, but is rather annoying and woth mentioning.--Conclusion--If the game didn't have these theories and a ""deep story"" which you have to uncover yourself, then I would probably ignore the game and the game would've been not worth at all with it's to simple mechanics. I know that it was only 1 Developer and that it would've much more difficult to animate every animatronic. But it wouldn't be impossible since Foxy is almost fully animated and the jumpscares itself are animated aswell. The Graphic style is something you can only judge subjectivly, since I don't have anything about the style. If you want to buy the game for pure gameplay, then I would reccomend you to stay away from it since this won't have enough for you to please you.I recommend the game only to those, who want to find out more about the game and be able to speculate better about theories and even start new theories.

												Everyone claims this game gets old after a while but I disagree to this statement. The game is more of a power management with horror element thrown in basically you try and survive each night with a limited amount of power and limited visibility and you are trying to not get killed by the animatrons while keeping your power levels at a point to survive till 6am each night and once you do you advance to the next night. As each night progresses it gets harder and more jumpscares but the jumpscares are not as scary as the sound effects in the game just the sheer quality of them if you play the game with headphones or really good sound system it makes you paranoid as crap and just this alone makes you feel immersed.

												Now THIS is the way that indie games should be made.  It's simple in concept, relatively minimal in execution, but is so cleverly designed that you barely notice how ""little"" there actually is ""to"" it.  It also happens to be tense as all buggery...the first few times I was accosted by the animatronic-horrors-run-amok, I literally jumped in my seat and squealed like a little girl, even as I laughed in delight/terror.  The tone, to this effect, is a perfect balance between offbeat humour and pants-wetting hysteria...it's all quite genius, really.  And not overpriced at five measly dollars, either (an unfortunate mistake a lot of indie developers are making at the moment...I mean, I loved Gone Home, but the twenty dollar price tag was stupidly steep).   Scott Cawthon is clearly a very clever man. Verdict: 9.5/10.(PS Have only made it to Night 4 so far.  Nearly got to 6am on ONE occasion.  NEARLY.  Lord, grant me the courage...)			"

												I have just completed 20/20/20/20 mode and now my full review:this game is somewhat difficult + somewhat Enjoyable everything about this game was amazing and Beating all 5 nights + the 6th night + 20/20/20/20 mode it just shows you can have games that are scary and enjoyable,I would recommend it to anyone,this game is one of the most interesting games i have ever played,even after i beat it i wanna go back and start over its that fun!i think many players who enjoy horror,or just plan something to past the time,Five nights at Freddy's is a recommendation And with the sequel coming soon i just cannot wait for it to come out now their is some downers in this game as well.for example if for some reason you accidentally hit the ESC button on your keyboard the game will exit so lets say your on 5AM on like your 4th night and then you hit esc for some reason it will shut it down immediately no ""Are you sure you wanna quit?"" thats just one i have commenly and i hope maybe Scott (the Creator) can do something to prevent that but out of all it is a recommended game a must buy i would say.Are you ready for Freddy cause i sure was.

												When I first played this, it scared the crap outta me. I don't play any horror games that much, but this game is one of the most scariest and terrifing game ever. So many jumpscares though. I think I like this game a lot. This game is about the animatronics named Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy attempting to kill you and stuffing you in a suit. So you play as the security guard named Mike Schmidt and your objective is to survive Night 1-5, 6, and 7 from 12 A.M. through 6 A. M.  without wasting powers. Like I said, the game is really scary so you might wanna try it out.Now the question is this: Are you ready for Freddy? Because I'm ready for Freddy.			"

												FNAF 1 is still an okay game but I cannot recommend this to people or horror junkies who are looking for a true survival horror experience. At first, one would think this game has it all. Jump scares. Creepy enemies. Creepy atmosphere. All in one package. But it does not live up to be a true horror experience. The main problems are that the main character only stays in ONE spot and the jump scares are EXTREMELY overused and repetitive which are not what I am looking for in a horror game. I still suggest this game for people (casuals) are who being introduced to the horror genre of gaming and who are interested in playing horror games for the first time though. FNAF is perfect for those kinds of people. Not the horror junkies or people who want to truly experience the survival / psychological horror genre such as System Shock 2, Layers of Fear, Phantasmal, Silent Hill, Dungeon Nightmares II, etc.. And about the FNAF fanbase... Well, let's not go there.5.2 out of 10			"

												It's just a below - average point and click game that attaches to the idea of jumpscares being the most rational thing to add in the horror genre. In spite of this it generated a horrific fanbase full of people that say its an amazing game simply because many people on youtube (including pewdiepie) have played it...  And thats not to mention the fact that the exact same fanbase seemed to be most interested in generating nsfw content... *sigh*Also the gameplay is really predictable and boring. Everything appears in the same places and poses and very little changes occur between the 5 nights. So whats the main reason why i downrated it?Its boring, scares are cheap, and gameplay is limited to clicking a few buttons to check a camera and close a door.So to me, it really isnt worth your time and money to play...

												I just don't know what went wrong. After trying so hard to appreciate and even like this game, I found myself having the opposite of fun and wanting some sort of hourly wage just for playing this. People finally managed to talk me into playing this ""game,"" and FNAF not only doesn't compare well to other titles I've been pressured into buying but just doesn't seem to be a game at all. The player has very little actual control and a lot is left up to random chance. Just about the only feedback the game provides the player with is jumpscares. Winning a level doesn't feel rewarding at all.The best way to win this game is by refusing to play. You can then construct the lore of an employee of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza suing the owner for wreckless endangerment after Night One, making millions of dollars in the resulting media fallout and cheesy horror movie series deal. The CIA then swoops in and has the infernal machines cold-rolled and then melted down into a solid cube to be launched into the sun by NASA. The creator of the animitronics is placed on a watch list and told to never create another machine again under threat of assassination. THE END.			"

It is such a simple, innocent plot for a horror game, yet it is scarier than any other game I have played. it is a 2D game that Scott has done an amazing job making seem 3D by making it seem like the animatronics are moving towards you. Throughout the game you may notice subtle easter eggs that reveal the truly horrifying events that took place at the restaurant, another thing about this game that makes it so great! Even now after having the game for about 2 months, I still jump sometimes. Plus, even after you complete the game, you can still play more to find easter eggs such as Golden Freddy!			"

												I recommend this game, but honestly this isn't ""single player"" game.  Yeah, it's fun to play this game alone once or twice, but then it really isn't fun anymore.  It gets old fast.  It's such a simplistic game, and it's one big jump scare.  This is basically the game you buy to play with friends.  It's only scary the first few times you play it, and it's only fun if you play it with friends.			"

												Five Nights At Freddy's, although it is a simple horror game, this game is excellent in terms of story wise, the characters and of course, the horror. I would really like to thank Scott for making this awesome game. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes horror games which are fun and simple. Some people won't like it though, as we have our own opinion. However, this is a game that everyone should try as you will not regret it. 10/10 is a rating that this game deserves. :)			"

												On the surface Five Nights at Freddy's doesn't seem like that scary of a game, and it actually isn't... that is, until you're properly immersed.I've beaten night five, and it was genuinely challenging to manage everything at once.You have a limited amount of power of which you can spend on looking through the cameras, flicking the door lights on/off, and locking the door.  It makes you manage when you look around, and how often you do it.  You can't sit with your eyes glued to the cameras because it'll drain your power just as fast as keeping a door closed.  Speaking of which, I love how all of the devices consume the same power, so there's no inherent punishment for locking down the door, and it just creates a better game flow in my opinion.True fear is created by the feeling of helplessness, and that's something FNaF gets really right.What really makes the game frightening for me is the suspense.  Not of the monsters themselves, I don't find them particularily scary.  What really gets to you is that at any moment you could slip up and blow the game in a second.  You have to keep your guard up the whole time, because at no time during the game are you safe.  The feeling of insecurity, the atmosphere, the apprehension.  Those are what makes the game frightening.Positive.+Great atmosphere / sound effects.+Gameplay makes for intense and frightening moments.+It's not flashy and over the top to ruin the atmosphere.+Challenging enough that you'll get frustrated, but not in an angry 'ragequit' way.+Freddy.  Possibly the scariest animatronic in the game, soley because when he jumps out and frightens me, I'm only half sure he's going to do it, or not expecting it at all.Negative-Graphics.  I'm not expecting it to be a triple A masterpiece, but I'd appreciate the ability to alter the resolution.  It looks crappy on my screen and is a little jarring going from my native of (1680*1050) to the game itself of (1024*768).  It doesn't ruin or detract from the experience in a major way, but it's annoying to me.-Predictable Jump Scares.  Most of the jump scares become predictable really quick, and act more as a 'Dang it I screwed up.' and creates less of a 'pee my pants in fright' reaction.			"

												Five Nights at Freddy's has a great atmospheric feeling complete with an interesting and unique addition to the horror genre. The gameplay, simple yet creepy visuals and sound design all make it a solid game designed by one man. However after a few nights in the novelty wears off and the atmosphere wears off after multiple replays of the same old jumpscare. The game should've been called 15 Minutes at Freddy's, as it eventually comes across as just a novelty for you and your friends to fool around with on Halloween night. Overall, it's not bad. It just can't really hold up as a playable horror game with it becoming repetitive too soon.			"

												After watching Markiplier nearly drive himself insane with this game and its sequel (or prequel?) I was inspired to try it for myself. I will be honest, it scares the crap out of me at times and it's nervewracking to play with the lights off, but that isn't enough to make it unenjoyable. Definitely gets the adrenaline going and the uncertainty of how to handle certain characters in the game makes this a very exciting one to play. The price for this and its sequel may be a little steep considering how short the games are, but all in all I don't regret buying it. 4/5 stars and I will be playing the second one once I beat nights 5 & 6.

												Five Nights at Freddy's is a simple game, with a very simple objective: survive the night shift for an entire week. Sound easy? Well, you haven't played it yet.The basic idea is that you are alone in an abandoned restaurant, a la Chuck E. Cheese, where animatronic robot animals power on at night and roam the halls. The only problem, is that if they see you, they think you're an animatronic that isn't inside it's suit. Why is that an issue? Well, because they'll  cram you into a suit, simply mashing your entire body against an array of gears, springs, metal wire, and whatever other horribly painful and deadly things are contained within one. Because, well, the animatronics they want to jam you into aren't exactly ""empty suits"". Between the strange hallucinations of words appearing on screen from time to time, as well as carnival music, camera malfunctions, limited power that if it runs out you die, and animatronics trying to, essentially, kill you, it's a tense ride if you're willing to get on board.Maybe it's not the scariest game in the world, but try sitting alone in the dark, playing this game with headphones on, and try not to get freaked. It's great fun, and the jump-scares really provide a good amount of amusement, if you want that sort of thing.""Not my kind of game"", you say. ""I don't like horror games; they're boring"", you tout. Yeah? Well, you're either a wimp, a 'fraidy cat, or both.Bad excuse :l""I don't have the money"".Then don't buy it. What a nice reason that would be :)Oh, and all the whiney people on the internet posting videos and shrieking? Just ignore that; you'll have a great time with this one :)			"

												At the time of this review FNaFs has already become a trilogy. Should you play the first one? Yes. It has a fresh concept that works really well with it's minimalistic gameplay. The only flaw I see is that, at later/harder levels, the blend of gameplay and tension falls apart as you will most likely have to survive by adopting a quicker pacing to your strategies. Which works well and adds more tention up until you're just clicking everything as fast as you can and you remember that you're playing a game and not just trying to elude Freddy and the gang. But otherwise, it's a great game.			"

												In realitiy I really hate walking, talking dolls in the first place. When I heard about this game I actually try to advoid it as much as possible. It wasn't until I heard the lore behind the game that really got me to actually get it. Here was I think:Positive: 1. Very Unique, compare to other horror games where you chase or run away from monsters, this you can't which really gives your the feeling of hopeless as they are trying to get you. 2. Even though jumpscares is cheesey, it always gets you all the time even when you expected it. This is the mother load of jumpscares. 3. I have an older brother who always watches scary movies............he won't play this game. Enough said on that. 4. You have to look closely and quickly but there are a few humor in this. For example, there a list of rules somewhere, reading it you'll see a rule that states ""Don't poop on floor"". I want to hear the story behind that one. 5. Creepy characters: Yes they are not scary, but you have to admit that they are pretty creepy. I'm actually scare of Golden Freddy. *Shivers* Negitive: 1. Loses it's charm: if you play it long enough it starts to lose it's charm. 2. Very repeitive. Yes I haven't played it for a while, but seeing videos and reading ""phone guy's"" dialog it really creeps me out even to this day. I recomend it to anyone who is looking for something new and something scary.  "

YouTube™ Video: SECRET CHEAT CODE - Five Nights at Freddy's 

			Views: 1,164,880		

			A secret cheat code has recently been discovered in Five Nights at Freddy's (FNAF) ! Reddit post:...		

I would definately recommend this game to anyone, even the scardey cats like me! Although I am a huge sucker for jump scares, and that's the whole point of this game, I really enjoyed playing it.Here's the breakdown!1. It was easy to understand. There isn't much to tell you what to do, but to be honest the first night kinda plays out like a tutorial. There is still some risk to losing, I assume, but that in itself would be a hard thing to accomplish (unless you left the doors closed and the lights on the whole time). In my opinion even people who don't play games too often would quickly understand that the main objective is not to run out of power!2. It's very immersive. I find that this point is one we often take for granted. How many games can you honestly say you have been completely sucked in to? So much so that you forget that the time is in fact not 2am, and you are not sitting in a creepy office blubbering and praying that the adorably creepy animatronics don't pop to stuff your body into a metal suit, counting the seconds until 6am, or machoing it up and pretending like you don't care that your power is on 1% and it's only just hit 5am!3. The sounds are creepy AF! Having worked on a few mobile games with an indie company I know first hand that sounds play a key role in any game. They can literally make or break a game. This point is also something I think a lot of people take for granted, but I have really got to hand it to the developer here! The ambience is spot on for this game, and I can't decide if I hate that fact or love it.4. It's actually scary. I don't know why, I don't know how, but I was on the edge of my seat while playing this. Sure, I've seen one or two videos on YouTube of people playing this game, but it is NOTHING compared to actually playing it. The difference between watching it and playing it is astounding.For all the positives there are, there isn't much that really brings the game down. Keeping in mind that this is an indie developed game, and there was probably no budget going into it, I can see why it has taken off and developed into a thriving series. The only thing I would do to improve this game is maybe add in a pause menu, or at least change the fact that the esc key completely terminates the game. I accidentally pressed it in an attempt to close the in game monitor before I realised you just hover the mouse over the [VVVVV].			"

												Five Nights at Freddy's what half of the internet counting me calls the scraiest game in years to come and i gotta say they are right if you want to play a very scray horror game this is the game for you so when you start the first night your in a security office and you get a phone call from the manager after the call you activate your camera and see 3 animatronic animal dolls their names are Freddy Fazbear Chika the Chicken and Bonnie the Bunny and in Pirate Cove in the curtains has Foxy The Pirate Fox and you then noticed that you have only a certain amount of power left you see thats the hard part of this game that and you need to watch the animatronics or close the doors and you can also turn on the lights and check for animatronics and keep watch on foxy or else he will come out of the curtains and start running strait to you so you only have a short second to close the door and after a while he will come back to his curtains and to beat a night you need to get from 12 am to 6 am (7-8 minutes) (4-5 minutes on mobile version) and when you beat all five nights you then see that there is a 6th night and once you beat that you get a custum 7th night which you can adjust the animatronic levels you can either go really east 0-0-0-0 or the incredibly difficult 20-20-20-20 so i recomend this game to ANYONE who wants to play a good horror game.

												You can't move around, and that adds to the general feeling of helplessness. You can close the two doors you have, look at the cameras, and turn on the door lights. It all takes energy, though. Even doing absolutely nothing takes power, so you have to be careful with how you spend it. You have a caller who tells you a little of what to expect each night, while the animatronics roam through the building. Some characters like Foxy have to be checked on (with the cameras, of course)  occasionally so that they don't move.  Overall, I really enjoyed this game, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good game to make you absolutely paranoid.			"

												This will sound like a weird intro to this review but I'm not sure when I actually got this game.  I picked it up in a bundle but it wasn't one of the games I bought the bundle for so it sat unplayed on my computer for at least a month, maybe longer, before I started to hear people talk about it.  The buzz was favorable so I fired it up.  My first impression was not favorable.  The learning curve is steep and you are thrown in without any real tutorial or anything.  I died just short of finishing the first night and was kind of frustrated by the experience.  And frustration is something you will have to get used to if you play this game.  The game is a few things, survival horror, resource management, it's also a puzzle game.  I say it's a puzzle game because there are specific rules the game follows and figuring these rules out requires a lot of trial and error.  Trial and error gameplay seems especially punishing in this game because of the simplistic controls and interface.  FNAF is a masterpiece at building tension and even though it tells you that the jump scares are coming they're effective.  The only game I can remember playing in recent memory that could get me an adrenaline rush that left my hands shaking was Dark Souls and if you venture into the infamous 4/20 mode you'll see that the unforgiving difficulty is very much on par with the worst that Dark Souls had to offer.  This is a quality game and I highly reccomend it if you're looking for a challenge, or even if you don't decide to torture yourself with the bonus modes, a creep diversion.  It's also available on iOS and Android and the iOS port is very good but it is easier.  If you're looking for the real challenge get it here.			"

												I recommend this game, but honestly this isn't ""single player"" game.  Yeah, it's fun to play this game alone once or twice, but then it really isn't fun anymore.  It gets old fast.  It's such a simplistic game, and it's one big jump scare.  This is basically the game you buy to play with friends.  It's only scary the first few times you play it, and it's only fun if you play it with friends.			"

												This is the scariest game of the videogames history, and not by the jumpscares or the very good terryfing ambient, is the creppy tension this game create during the five nights, and also including the 2 extra nights.It is so well made, and also the jumpscares are truly unexpected, if you really play this game alone, in the night, in the dark, and with headphones the experience will be better.I can't even wait the realeze of  Five Nights at Freddy's 2, i am sure the creator Scott Cawthon will not dissapoint all the fans of this game. I am sure the sequel will be so scary and awesome too, or even more.I truly recommend this game, people in my YouTube channel love it.			"

												[ Possible Spoilers ]     I've got to say, Freddy Fazbear's Pizza sounds like a failing establishment, which really adds to the atmosphere, making the player think that the animatronics are merely carcases for the deceased children to roam around in, attempting to make everything right by coming to stuff you into a suit. I also love the conservitive addition, having only Scott Cawthon perform the phone guy's voice. You can also say that this game is a step up from the usual horror game as you are a sitting duck, in one room, while in other games, you have to roam around, probably with someone chasing you. The very little issue of repitition does stand, as there are no little minigames, anything else, so when you finish the game, thats all. Out of all, I think the game deserves my following score:+-+-+-+Score+-+-+-+Originality: 19 / 20Style: 20 / 20Story: 15 / 20Compatibility: 20 / 20Control: 20 / 20Total: 94 / 100 - 5 StarsI recommend you buy this game, and also give the second one the kind of praise you would the first one.

												7/10Fun little horror game, recommend.It's more frustrating than scary, though.  Night 5 was the worst for me because Freddy is a serious troll.  I found that if you don't stress yourself out over it, then you do better and I was able to get through the first four nights without dying.  And there's a pattern you can follow to help you out.  Wish the backstory was more in your face and obvious because it's so easy to miss as it is right now.--Pros--- Great atmosphere for a horror game- Love the use of sounds to indicate the locations of the animatronic- I love the graphics, even if they are mostly just pictures- Foxy's little animation is good for catching people off guard--Cons--- Jumpscares get old really fast- Power system runs on dumb logic- Backstory isn't obvious enough- Needs more creepy imagery when you're going insane- Why do we keep coming back?

												Five Nights at Freddy's is undeniably a popular game. YouTuber's are all posting Let's Plays of them, and the hype of this game spreads far and wide. For five dollars, one must ask, ""Why?"" I mean, it's a really cheap game from a relatively unknown developer. Why does everyone adore this game?The answer: A refreshing change from the generic modern horror theme. This game offers something that isn't showcased in the majority of top dollar horror games, especially from the developers who have established a series such as Resident Evil and do not wish to deviate from the action theme. In fact, I believe this spin on modern horror is so unique in nature and mechanics that this is the core reason this game is so popular. And for good reason.I'll break it down for you.Imagine the following: You've applied and been accepted for a nightwatchman position at a local pizzeria. The restaurant is famous for its lovable animal robots, namely Freddy Fazbear, Chica, Bonnie, and Foxy. During the day, these animatronics play music for the crowd, and please the kids while they chow on pizza. During the night, things turn for the worse. Said robots are a little stressed out, and they love to walk around to ""work out the kinks"". And you're charged with keeping an eye on them with the cameras. And they are programmed to stuff any endoskeletons (you) exposed into costumes (death). And they love to stop by outside your door, and you must be aware of where they are, for if you don't catch them outside your doors fast enough, they love to pull a jumpscare on you. And you have limited power to work with; using the cameras, lights, and doors drains your power. And you have to survive 6 hours (game time). And you only get paid $120 for 5 nights. I wouldn't take the job even if it only included the last contention.The unique spin is that you never actually have the power to combat or face your foes. You are a helpless lamb; you must use intelligence and perception to survive the night. This deliberate siphoning of force from your hands is the reason why people are always coming back. And it's the reason why I defintely recommend this game to anyone wanting a refreshing spin on horror games. The only downside I could consider is the one dimensional style of play, but I definitely foresee expansions and mods coming out for this type of game.Oh, and did I mention that it's five bucks? w00t w00t.Overall rating: 4.5/5, would freddy again			"

												I got this game because I though it would help me get settled in into the horror genere. Five Nights At Freddy isnt like and normal horror game, ya' know, walk around some random place, dont get killed by the many creatures that lurk the area, and once you escape, you win. Five Nights At Freddys however, is alot diffrent however. You are stuck in a room with limited power, and once that power runs out, Freddy Fazbear (as I like to call him, Freddy Fagbear), will come to end your long night. This game REALLY builds up tensity, because half the time I press escape (if you didnt know, the button that instantly closes the game), and most of the time I just keep flipping the camera to kinda help slow down the anamatronics in there position. A few flaws though is once you know how to tell an anamatronic is is your room, or one is running to your room, it isnt as scary, but still, it makes me extremely tense. Hope this reveiw helps you decide weather you want to buy the game or not, and I hope you have a nice day :D			"

												This is probably the best horror game of the year! This game uses new mechanics combinded with a awesome concept. Never have I seen a game based on animatronics in a pizza parlour. The idea is original and great to build story and lore off of. The end of the game leaves you clueless and makes you wonder what happened in Freddy Fazbear's Pizza before you got your job there. It's surprising that only one man had worked on this as it would have taken alot of time and talent to make such a great game. This game didn't follow in the footsteps of the sterotypical first person horror. The jumpscares were not cheesy and jumpscares were sometimes not even needed to scare the player. Gameplay was always interesting thoughout the whole game as none of the animatronics had a set path making it very scary and intense to not know what they might do next. It was great to add in the feature when you thought you had finished the game on the 5th night you actually hadn't. Also finding some of the hidden lore and easter eggs in this game makes the player more interestered in the story. If you are reading this and you haven't bought this game yet, Immediately scroll upwards and buy this game! For $5 this game is worth it. The community can't wait to see what else this game has to offer when the sequel to this is released. I approve of this game.Keep up the good work Scott Cawthon!			"

												It seemed an original concept, very creepy animatronic dolls create massive jumpscares.Playing this you'll become crazy paranoid :pHowever you just sit in your chair, clicking cameras, there is nothing to explore or do.It's a must play to try out for the unique paranoid feelings/experience this game brings, but not something I would keep playing.Imagine going on a haunted house ride at the funfair everyday, it's funny the first time, but that's it.Seen this, done that, move on.Watch my gameplay video of the first time playing below:

												In realitiy I really hate walking, talking dolls in the first place. When I heard about this game I actually try to advoid it as much as possible. It wasn't until I heard the lore behind the game that really got me to actually get it. Here was I think:Positive: 1. Very Unique, compare to other horror games where you chase or run away from monsters, this you can't which really gives your the feeling of hopeless as they are trying to get you. 2. Even though jumpscares is cheesey, it always gets you all the time even when you expected it. This is the mother load of jumpscares. 3. I have an older brother who always watches scary movies............he won't play this game. Enough said on that. 4. You have to look closely and quickly but there are a few humor in this. For example, there a list of rules somewhere, reading it you'll see a rule that states ""Don't poop on floor"". I want to hear the story behind that one. 5. Creepy characters: Yes they are not scary, but you have to admit that they are pretty creepy. I'm actually scare of Golden Freddy. *Shivers* Negitive: 1. Loses it's charm: if you play it long enough it starts to lose it's charm. 2. Very repeitive. Yes I haven't played it for a while, but seeing videos and reading ""phone guy's"" dialog it really creeps me out even to this day. I recomend it to anyone who is looking for something new and something scary.  "

YouTube™ Video: FEMALE JUMPSCARE? | Five Nights at Freddy's - Nights 1 & 2 

			Views: 130		

			I really am scared of watching horror movies, so let's see how I go with the most horrific game of 2014! Five Nights at Freddy's, as fun as it is, scares me to the brink of pressing the escape key!		

I would definately recommend this game to anyone, even the scardey cats like me! Although I am a huge sucker for jump scares, and that's the whole point of this game, I really enjoyed playing it.Here's the breakdown!1. It was easy to understand. There isn't much to tell you what to do, but to be honest the first night kinda plays out like a tutorial. There is still some risk to losing, I assume, but that in itself would be a hard thing to accomplish (unless you left the doors closed and the lights on the whole time). In my opinion even people who don't play games too often would quickly understand that the main objective is not to run out of power!2. It's very immersive. I find that this point is one we often take for granted. How many games can you honestly say you have been completely sucked in to? So much so that you forget that the time is in fact not 2am, and you are not sitting in a creepy office blubbering and praying that the adorably creepy animatronics don't pop to stuff your body into a metal suit, counting the seconds until 6am, or machoing it up and pretending like you don't care that your power is on 1% and it's only just hit 5am!3. The sounds are creepy AF! Having worked on a few mobile games with an indie company I know first hand that sounds play a key role in any game. They can literally make or break a game. This point is also something I think a lot of people take for granted, but I have really got to hand it to the developer here! The ambience is spot on for this game, and I can't decide if I hate that fact or love it.4. It's actually scary. I don't know why, I don't know how, but I was on the edge of my seat while playing this. Sure, I've seen one or two videos on YouTube of people playing this game, but it is NOTHING compared to actually playing it. The difference between watching it and playing it is astounding.For all the positives there are, there isn't much that really brings the game down. Keeping in mind that this is an indie developed game, and there was probably no budget going into it, I can see why it has taken off and developed into a thriving series. The only thing I would do to improve this game is maybe add in a pause menu, or at least change the fact that the esc key completely terminates the game. I accidentally pressed it in an attempt to close the in game monitor before I realised you just hover the mouse over the [VVVVV].			"

												The Five Nights at Freddy's series is one of my personal favorites. I don't believe what others tell me. It has a unique story line, along with very different game mechanics. It is a fun challenge to defeat, but I love everything about it. When I found out it was made in Clickteam Fusion 2.5, I got excited. I wanted to figure out HOW Scott Cawthon made the game. Eventually, with research and my own work, I figured out how. But, I still haven't released any of my FNaF fan games as of May 31st, 2015. I recommend this game, even though I haven't spent too much time on PC, I did on my other iPad.			"

I would really like to thank Scott for making this awesome game. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes horror games which are fun and simple. Some people won't like it though, as we have our own opinion. However, this is a game that everyone should try as you will not regret it. 10/10 is a rating that this game deserves. :)			"

												I never owned a game that I was truly afraid to play...  Not even as a child.  Sure, I had games that were a little disturbing or the imagery was a little graphic or things just sort of popped out at you and made you jump.  But I never had a game I was truly afraid to play.  That is until about an hour ago after I bought this...I'm still going to play it and work my way through all the days and even try again for day 6.  Heck, I even have plans to buy the sequel.  But that's not to say that this game doesn't really scare me.  It's a controlled scare, sort of like riding a really intimidating roller coaster.  However, the scare is in a much different way.  The game plays with you.  It makes you start questioning every little thing that happens or that you think is happening.  It really make you contemplate the next time you wanna play it.  In fact, I want to do another round of this, but instead I chose to write this review since you do need a sort of emotional cool down after getting into this.I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of survival horror...  Or if you just like to be scared and don't want to do something idiotic like walk down dark alleys in downtown.  It's a game that's supposed to make you feel arfaid/paranoid/unnerved and it does a top notch job of it.			"

												Five Nights at Freddy's what half of the internet counting me calls the scraiest game in years to come and i gotta say they are right if you want to play a very scray horror game this is the game for you so when you start the first night your in a security office and you get a phone call from the manager after the call you activate your camera and see 3 animatronic animal dolls their names are Freddy Fazbear Chika the Chicken and Bonnie the Bunny and in Pirate Cove in the curtains has Foxy The Pirate Fox and you then noticed that you have only a certain amount of power left you see thats the hard part of this game that and you need to watch the animatronics or close the doors and you can also turn on the lights and check for animatronics and keep watch on foxy or else he will come out of the curtains and start running strait to you so you only have a short second to close the door and after a while he will come back to his curtains and to beat a night you need to get from 12 am to 6 am (7-8 minutes) (4-5 minutes on mobile version) and when you beat all five nights you then see that there is a 6th night and once you beat that you get a custum 7th night which you can adjust the animatronic levels you can either go really east 0-0-0-0 or the incredibly difficult 20-20-20-20 so i recomend this game to ANYONE who wants to play a good horror game.

												Well constructed scary atmosphere which draws on your childhood fear of clowns and chuck e cheese, a very basic resource management angle which is somewhat forced into place but does its job, and simple mechanics and setting which do a good job of making you feel helpless while drama unfolds. Many people may be turned off by that helplessness, but for those who dont mind it this is a fun little experience. Made me scream like a little girl.Recommend you buy if you like animated shorts in the horror genre or otherwise dig horror games, and don't mind shelling out 5 beans for something with relatively little replayability.

												To be entirley honest, as i look at all the sequels that have come out to this game i realize that the franchise is starting to become a little milked, but i still have to give this game credit for what it did.Even if your a fnaf hater even you have to admit that the idea behind this game was brilliant, to take something average that would normally not be seen as scary and making it into something terrifying.  I think that the lack of movement in this game also adds to the experience, because the feeling of helplessness forces you to rely on your cameras which is argueably the games greatest strength. by using these cameras it creates an atmospheric kind of scare rather than cheap jumpscares (which are in this game i should note) but for me what really stood out was the way that this game portrays this childrens pizzeria, and makes it into a place that looks like it could be home to a slasher villian.this game is a little limited in gameplay but its very atmospheric and the animatronics are all memorable and in an odd way have their own unique behaviors.  Although the game has several flaws, such as a stupidly low power meter, and doors that open when the power goes out for some reason, the overall experience comes off as being creative and fresh for the horror genre. p.s. much better than any of the sequels in my opinion			"

												Five Nights at Freddy's is...the most terrifying game I have ever played. I can hardly even press the continue button now. The title screen freaks me out as well. On the first night, it wasn't too bad; the animatronics were not active for the duration of the first call of the Phone Guy, which saved me a couple of hours. (The only thing I did during that time was listen to call, get used to where the cameras are located, and getting to know the controls). But on the second night...I didn't even get past 50%/3 AM. Bonnie made me scream. I died horribly. After I returned to title screen, I just quit. The most scary thing about this game is that you are alone, and it is EXTREMELY quiet (Apart from footsteps, banging noises, etc). And you know that you are going to get jumpscared when you LEAST expect it. Do I recommend this game?If you have played many, many horror games, and are used to being jumpscared, then why not? But if you have not played a ton of horror games, and/or have some sort of fear of creepy dolls coming to life, then no. At least not at first. Overall, amazing game, great mechanics, and awesome design. Rating: 10/10Note: See you on the other side...(If you get there)			"

												Five Nights At Freddy's is a fantastic game! I myself am quite a fan and I love the unique take it has on the survival horror experience. With so many games of the same genre, you have to run and hide, but here there is nothing you can do to escape. And even with a pair of doors, camera system and lights, your power is a concern you must always remember to take into consideration. While the horror quality can degrade after playing it for so long, like I have, the tension is always there to complete every night alive. The most dramatic parts for me are when I am at 5am and my power runs out. I sit still, trying to delay Freddy's attack, hoping and praying to hear the familiar children's cheers as the night ends. Overall, a great game experience, but not for the faint of heart, atleast on the first few attempts. Because no matter how good you think you are, no matter how much you know the multitude of fan theories surrounding the backstory of this game, you are going to die atleast once when playing this unforgettable masterpiece.

I have a big fear of mascots/animatronics so this game is probably my worst kind of game but yet, I ADORE it!  The controls are so simple but beautifully crafted into the dark and dank atmosphere of ""Freddy Fazbear's Pizza""!  Every time, no matter how safe you may be, you never feel safe AT ALL.  You are always on edge, you want to give up but you really want to make it to Night 5 (Or Night 7) so you can proove you can beat the game!Hats off to Scott!  Very simple yet effective game, looking very forward to its sequel!(Only flaw is the jumpscares, they're cheap and mean.)			"

												Do you enjoy being scared? Do you like video games? Do you feel your nightwatch security gaurd should be completely immobile from the waste down? Then Five Nights at Freddy's is a game for you. In Five Nights at Freddy's you are the new nightwatch security gaurd of a haunted Chuck-E-Cheese knock-off. You are a man/woman of few words and you are there to do a job. A job that quite frankly, no one else was desparate enough to do. You will find yourself desparately trying to manage resources as you slam doors in the faces of murderous animatronic animals, and try to survive till your shift ends at 6:00 am. Watch those cameras, don't forget to check those doors, and pray you don't fall short on power. Sit in your office and survive the night or rather 5 of them, here at Freddy's.Pros:+Keeps you on the edge of your seat+Genuinly stressful (But in a good way) once you get into it+The story is hidden, but it's there and it's pretty good+Atmosphere is great and has that feeling of terror that one would experience being helpless, alone, and hunted +Affordable: $5 is less than that grease burger meal at that fast food restraunt you visit way too often to be healthy+Doubles as a minimum wage simulatorCons:-The games concept may have crippled itself in it's simplicity. That being said, it could also be argued that it's what makes the game good. Eh-Quite a few holes in the gameplay that make you say ""Why don't you just ..."" (sometimes you have to say that's just the way it is. And get past it to enjoy the game)-Sometimes it's just impossible to win. Every once in a while the game will get a wild hare up it's butt and just put you in situations you didn't have the resources to handle in the first place-The game is made of jumpscares.All in all I'd give this game 70/100			"

												I never owned a game that I was truly afraid to play...  Not even as a child.  Sure, I had games that were a little disturbing or the imagery was a little graphic or things just sort of popped out at you and made you jump.  But I never had a game I was truly afraid to play.  That is until about an hour ago after I bought this...I'm still going to play it and work my way through all the days and even try again for day 6.  Heck, I even have plans to buy the sequel.  But that's not to say that this game doesn't really scare me.  It's a controlled scare, sort of like riding a really intimidating roller coaster.  However, the scare is in a much different way.  The game plays with you.  It makes you start questioning every little thing that happens or that you think is happening.  It really make you contemplate the next time you wanna play it.  In fact, I want to do another round of this, but instead I chose to write this review since you do need a sort of emotional cool down after getting into this.I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of survival horror...  Or if you just like to be scared and don't want to do something idiotic like walk down dark alleys in downtown.  It's a game that's supposed to make you feel arfaid/paranoid/unnerved and it does a top notch job of it.			"

												Five Night's at Freddy's is a delightful and unique approach to the horror genre. I generally love point and click adventures and use them as a bit of a timewaster. A prime example of this is Pajama Sam: No Need to Hide When It's Dark Outside, a story about a kid who goes into his closet to find the ""Land of Darkness"" to capture ""Darkness"" (the main antagonist) and put him in a lunchbox. This is a prime example of a fun and enjoyable point and click adventure. This point and click adventure will have you on the edge of your seat as you try to stop 4 (maybe 5) animatronic creatures murder you in the dead of night at your low paying job. Needless to say, I love this game in the weirdest way possible. And if you don't mind having a few sleepless nights, lash out and pay the $4.99 ($2.49 at the time of writing this review) so the developer can create the sequel that everyone is hoping for to this extremely good game.8.5/10			"

Dark and Stormy, noises, your character is breathing so heavy you'd think they ate way too much cake in one sitting. Well, not Five Nights at Freddy's. I've gone all around horror games, from Slender to Amnesia, so I can say that FNaF is something I've never had a chance to really experiance. Now, with most horror games, the goal of the game is to make you feel like you're there, like you're in real danger, and Freddy takes the cake for me. I feel like I'm in the room, checking the cameras, looking at the doors and flipping the lights, but saving power so I don't end up in a costume. This game was so well made, and It's so simple.

												Yep, I've waited a long time to be able to review this, and now, here it is.I would reccomend this to anyone who wants the spooky/paranoia experience without the blood and gore that you see in stuff like Neverending Nightmares. While blood is acceptable and expected, it isn't something you can have around slightly younger audiences (Not toddlers, but 4th grade through middle school.) However, this game is NOT, I repeat, NOT for everyone.It all depends on how you look at horror games.If you start this game up expecting another Amnesia or Slender type get-chased-by-monster game, then you WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. This game is NOTHING LIKE THEM. In this game, you play as the night guard for a run-down soon-to-close pizzeria with animatronic animals that come to life at night and try to kill you. Think of it as if Chuck E. Cheese and Night at the museum had a baby raised by Satan.In FNaF, you cannot run. No, you aren't running around the Pizzeria trying to not get caught from 12 to 6. You work form a tiny office with 5 ways to interact: Close 2 doors, Turn on 2 lights, and check the various cameras to track Freddy and Co. throughout the building.To sub-quote the mighty BrutalMoose ""Essentially you are in the center of a giant Pac-Man maze trying to keep the robots out.""This game relies on the creepiness of it's environment as opposed to being scared of Freddy himself. And it does that well. This game changes everything you know about horror games and twists it, and you may or may not love it. It also may or may not be worth the 5 american bucks you spent on it. Fortunately there's a mobile version that's cheaper.			"

												One of the greatest horror games there are. It's a great game where the animatronics characters come to life at night. You're the night watch, you'll have to survive the five nights. You look through your cameras to see if everyone is in place. You can close the doors and turn on the lights on the side of you to check. If you don't like pop up games, don't play this. If you're in your camera too long when you exit one will get you. It's a very popular youtube game, many famous youtubers play this. Overall it's just a great game, I reccomend it.			"

												Probably the most over-hyped indie-game of the year, but with good reason really in my thoughts. For the super low price that it is as of today, 5 Nights is definately worth a pick-up as it's easy to put back down again after your BPM exceeds a sprinting pace. And pick back up again til you achieve bragging rights status in saying ""I survived 5 Nights at Freddy's"".			"

												""There is no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it.""  -Alfred HitchcockIf you can understand that quote then you can understand to a certain level why this indie game has garnished itself such popularity. Its cleaver and simple mechanics makes it easy for anyone you know to pick-up and play. For a full experience you'll need to play Five Nights at Freddy's yourself, alone in the dark, for maximum spookage. For the scares which this game has contributed, this vampire, The Queen of Screams, approves!			"

												There is nothing to fear except fear itself.And Foxy. I forgot about Foxy. You definitely want to fear Foxy.Oh, probably Freddy too. Yeah, he's pretty deserving of your fear.Five Night's at Freddy's is cheap and cheerful scares for the whole family (assuming no-one in the family is of a nervous disposition or suffers from heart problems). It's not going to give you 60 hours of deep, meaningful play, but what it WILL give you is a rather urgent need for new underwear at a price that's probably cheaper than most prescription laxatives.The name of the game here is jumpscares aplenty and enough nervous tension to fill an entire season of American Horror Story. You carefully manage your resources (in this case power) whilst trying to keep a collection of terrifying animatronics from turning you into puree, providing an interesting psychological battle between the player's desire to conserve power for dire situations and the rather more primal need to check the damn cameras every two seconds in order to keep tabs on the ever-advancing enemy. In theory it's easy, in practice? Slightly less so.The biggest drawback would be the low production values (although at £3.99, I'm not sure what people were expecting) - the lack of any graphics/resolution options is a bit galling in today's gaming environment, and if you're nitpicking, gameplay is little more than a cross between a point-and-click game and a slightly more complex version of rock-paper-scissors - once one knows the attack patterns of the bots and the initial terror starts to wear thin, an organised player should have no problem beating the game.At this price though, it's hard to really find fault with a game that does such an effective job at raising the player's pulse whilst also guaranteeing they'll never be able to watch Sesame Street again. If you're a fan of the build-tension-until-jumpscare style of horror, or you just really enjoy falling off your chair and swearing, this is a must-buy.			"

												This game is worth the purchase.  Only a couple of minutes into the game and my palms started to sweat with fear.  I have a big fear of mascots/animatronics so this game is probably my worst kind of game but yet, I ADORE it!  The controls are so simple but beautifully crafted into the dark and dank atmosphere of ""Freddy Fazbear's Pizza""!  Every time, no matter how safe you may be, you never feel safe AT ALL.  You are always on edge, you want to give up but you really want to make it to Night 5 (Or Night 7) so you can proove you can beat the game!Hats off to Scott!  Very simple yet effective game, looking very forward to its sequel!(Only flaw is the jumpscares, they're cheap and mean.)			"

												I got this game because I though it would help me get settled in into the horror genere. Five Nights At Freddy isnt like and normal horror game, ya' know, walk around some random place, dont get killed by the many creatures that lurk the area, and once you escape, you win. Five Nights At Freddys however, is alot diffrent however. You are stuck in a room with limited power, and once that power runs out, Freddy Fazbear (as I like to call him, Freddy Fagbear), will come to end your long night. This game REALLY builds up tensity, because half the time I press escape (if you didnt know, the button that instantly closes the game), and most of the time I just keep flipping the camera to kinda help slow down the anamatronics in there position. A few flaws though is once you know how to tell an anamatronic is is your room, or one is running to your room, it isnt as scary, but still, it makes me extremely tense. Hope this reveiw helps you decide weather you want to buy the game or not, and I hope you have a nice day :D			"

												Five Nights at Freddy's is undeniably a popular game. YouTuber's are all posting Let's Plays of them, and the hype of this game spreads far and wide. For five dollars, one must ask, ""Why?"" I mean, it's a really cheap game from a relatively unknown developer. Why does everyone adore this game?The answer: A refreshing change from the generic modern horror theme. This game offers something that isn't showcased in the majority of top dollar horror games, especially from the developers who have established a series such as Resident Evil and do not wish to deviate from the action theme. In fact, I believe this spin on modern horror is so unique in nature and mechanics that this is the core reason this game is so popular. And for good reason.I'll break it down for you.Imagine the following: You've applied and been accepted for a nightwatchman position at a local pizzeria. The restaurant is famous for its lovable animal robots, namely Freddy Fazbear, Chica, Bonnie, and Foxy. During the day, these animatronics play music for the crowd, and please the kids while they chow on pizza. During the night, things turn for the worse. Said robots are a little stressed out, and they love to walk around to ""work out the kinks"". And you're charged with keeping an eye on them with the cameras. And they are programmed to stuff any endoskeletons (you) exposed into costumes (death). And they love to stop by outside your door, and you must be aware of where they are, for if you don't catch them outside your doors fast enough, they love to pull a jumpscare on you. And you have limited power to work with; using the cameras, lights, and doors drains your power. And you have to survive 6 hours (game time). And you only get paid $120 for 5 nights. I wouldn't take the job even if it only included the last contention.The unique spin is that you never actually have the power to combat or face your foes. You are a helpless lamb; you must use intelligence and perception to survive the night. This deliberate siphoning of force from your hands is the reason why people are always coming back. And it's the reason why I defintely recommend this game to anyone wanting a refreshing spin on horror games. The only downside I could consider is the one dimensional style of play, but I definitely foresee expansions and mods coming out for this type of game.Oh, and did I mention that it's five bucks? w00t w00t.Overall rating: 4.5/5, would freddy again			"

												Now look, horror games now are pretty popular, but it's all the same, isnt it? Dark and Stormy, noises, your character is breathing so heavy you'd think they ate way too much cake in one sitting. Well, not Five Nights at Freddy's. I've gone all around horror games, from Slender to Amnesia, so I can say that FNaF is something I've never had a chance to really experiance. Now, with most horror games, the goal of the game is to make you feel like you're there, like you're in real danger, and Freddy takes the cake for me. I feel like I'm in the room, checking the cameras, looking at the doors and flipping the lights, but saving power so I don't end up in a costume. This game was so well made, and It's so simple. Please, pick it up, play it, and you'll understand what fear it.Oh, and also, I hate that ♥♥♥♥ing Chicken... "

												Hello everyone! No one's even reading this is my best guess but if you are reading thanks and I hope you enjoy. So I know you want to read about Five Nights at Freddy's so if you like getting the crud scared out of you this is your game. What the game is really about is this guy named Mike is the new night guard at an old run-down pizza place. What happens is that you get all these phone messenges from the old night guard but he is never named so fans call him by the name of Phone Guy. What Phone Guy states helps you through the entire game he says that you must conserve power because you have a limited amount. You have cameras to check on the four animatronics ( Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy ). The animatronic that you HAVE to check on the most is Foxy who is located in Pirate Cove because if the cameras are on the animals they can't move but Foxy is able to run down the hall into your office. If you close a door it takes away power if you turn on a light it takes power. The animatroinics that are the most active are Bonnie and Chica I love this game you should all try it.			"

Bunny got out of the chamber, me switching cameras hastily. 2 rooms away he is but now found. So I gaze into him, almost in faith he is stopped. What's that, noise covering all the camera?!...It's down. So I compare with other cameras. There's nothing. Almost. Where did I hear this tune, like the show or something.

												Yep, I've waited a long time to be able to review this, and now, here it is.I would reccomend this to anyone who wants the spooky/paranoia experience without the blood and gore that you see in stuff like Neverending Nightmares. While blood is acceptable and expected, it isn't something you can have around slightly younger audiences (Not toddlers, but 4th grade through middle school.) However, this game is NOT, I repeat, NOT for everyone.It all depends on how you look at horror games.If you start this game up expecting another Amnesia or Slender type get-chased-by-monster game, then you WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. This game is NOTHING LIKE THEM. In this game, you play as the night guard for a run-down soon-to-close pizzeria with animatronic animals that come to life at night and try to kill you. Think of it as if Chuck E. Cheese and Night at the museum had a baby raised by Satan.In FNaF, you cannot run. No, you aren't running around the Pizzeria trying to not get caught from 12 to 6. You work form a tiny office with 5 ways to interact: Close 2 doors, Turn on 2 lights, and check the various cameras to track Freddy and Co. throughout the building.To sub-quote the mighty BrutalMoose ""Essentially you are in the center of a giant Pac-Man maze trying to keep the robots out.""This game relies on the creepiness of it's environment as opposed to being scared of Freddy himself. And it does that well. This game changes everything you know about horror games and twists it, and you may or may not love it. It also may or may not be worth the 5 american bucks you spent on it. Fortunately there's a mobile version that's cheaper.			"

												One of the greatest horror games there are. It's a great game where the animatronics characters come to life at night. You're the night watch, you'll have to survive the five nights. You look through your cameras to see if everyone is in place. You can close the doors and turn on the lights on the side of you to check. If you don't like pop up games, don't play this. If you're in your camera too long when you exit one will get you. It's a very popular youtube game, many famous youtubers play this. Overall it's just a great game, I reccomend it.			"

You have access to security doors for saftey, lights outside your office and a camera system to monitor what's going on in the pizza place.The kicker:  You have limited power, and everything you do or don't do drains power.  You basically need to keep the doors open as long as possible and only close them when absoultly necessary to see yourself to 6amIf you like getting the crap scared out of you, get this game.

Knead until a smooth, soft dough is formed, about 3 minutes. Add more flour if dough is too sticky.4. Place more flour on cutting board, cover dough with bowl, and let rest for 15 minutes.5. Cut ball of dough into eight equal parts and cover until needed.6. Roll out balls of dough either by hand or with a tortilla press.7. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place flattened tortilla in skillet and cook until it begins to bubble, about 1 minute. Flip tortilla over and cook for an additional minute. Flip again and cook for 1 more minute. Repeat with remaining dough.			"

												Five Nights at Freddy's; People are calling it the scariest game of the decade, and frankly I kinda' agree. FNaF has a perfect balanced system of suspense and jump-scares to where you can never really expect what's going to happen, which leads me to my next topic; Audio. If you get this game, make sure you have a quiet household and/or headset, because the background sound effects pertain to when someone's moving or not. An example being Freddy's deep disturbing laugh, this indicates that Freddy is no longer on the stage and is coming out for you. Anyway, In conclusion...This game is awesome; great to play with family(scare them to death); Great to play with friends or watch the react to the game-play; and just a cool game to play that's always keeping you on the edge of your seat.RatingsStory: 7/10Gameplay: 9/10Scare Aspect: 9/10Finale: 4/10			"

												Five Nights at Freddy's is by far the best horror game I've played. It is the very definition of paranoia.You play as a night watch security guard for Freddy FazzBear's Pizzeria (because 4 bucks/hour is pretty cheap). Your job is to watch the security cameras and make sure that the 4 animatronics stay in line. You have control over the security cameras, 2 doors, and lights to see just outside the doors. Using any of those causes your power to drain quicker. You switch on your camera to find that the bots are all where they are supposed to be...Except what if they aren't?In this alternate universe, the bots are set to a 'free roam' setting. They wander around the building on their free will. If they happen to make it to your office, they recognize you as a bot without a costume. They will stuff you in a tiny little suit filled with animatronic gizmos. Nothing to worry about though, you have doors right?In case you forgot doors use power. If you use up all your power, you have to sit there in the dark, and wait for your (very terrifying) death... You literally HAVE to expose yourself to danger in order to survive, which is what bothers most of the people who play it.So was it a $5 well spent? YES YES YES YES!!!!!!!! Obviously yes there are only 5 levels, but you can play those levels over and over. There are so many different scary ways you can die, and every single one fills my pants. Yes 11/10. Done. Finished.

												At the time of this review FNaFs has already become a trilogy. Should you play the first one? Yes. It has a fresh concept that works really well with it's minimalistic gameplay. The only flaw I see is that, at later/harder levels, the blend of gameplay and tension falls apart as you will most likely have to survive by adopting a quicker pacing to your strategies. Which works well and adds more tention up until you're just clicking everything as fast as you can and you remember that you're playing a game and not just trying to elude Freddy and the gang. But otherwise, it's a great game.			"

												Stop. Think about what you are doing.""Oh this game isn't scary. Pffft its just a bunch of jumpscares! I can handle it.""No. You are wrong, because that is exactly how I felt when I bought this game. I'd watched the trailers and the lets plays. Then I actually tried it from behind the keyboard and I couldn't even do it. Its not wrong to say that this game is mostly jumpscares, and jumpscares are widley regarded as the lowest incarnation at horror. However Five Nights at Freddy's does something different than other horror games. In most horror games the jumpscare is just a one-and-done, a little one trick pony to startle you and which is totally ruined if you see it coming, and ruined even further in the context that in games jumpscares usually don't kill you.In Five Night's at Freddy's, the jumpscare is the lose condition, it is the game over screen. You know the jumpscare is coming, and the game has given you all the tools to prevent the jumpscare. Thats why this game is scary. Its not the jumpscare that gets you, its the anticipation, the stress and the anxiety that gets you. Ben Yahtzee from Zero Punctuation once said that most horror games can be summed up with ""A man in a scary mask jumps out and yells 'Aboogiewoogiewoo!' while in a good horror game, the man in the mask is behind you. You know he's going to jump out and yell 'Aboogiewoogiewoo!' but he doesn't he's just stays behind you and lets the fear sink in.""Thats this game. This game isn't about the jumpscare at all. Its about the fear you feel when you know the jumpscare is coming and your frantically trying to avoid it.So DON'T buy this game because you think it won't be scary, or because you think you'll impress your friends by showing how brave you are. Buy this game because its scary, because you WANT to be scared.And if this game doesn't manage to freak you out even once, I would love to talk to you personally because I need to know your secret to managing stress and anxiety.

												After watching Markiplier nearly drive himself insane with this game and its sequel (or prequel?) I was inspired to try it for myself. I will be honest, it scares the crap out of me at times and it's nervewracking to play with the lights off, but that isn't enough to make it unenjoyable. Definitely gets the adrenaline going and the uncertainty of how to handle certain characters in the game makes this a very exciting one to play. The price for this and its sequel may be a little steep considering how short the games are, but all in all I don't regret buying it. 4/5 stars and I will be playing the second one once I beat nights 5 & 6.

												What a fantastic and freakin' shocking game!  I LOVED this game.  The developer clearly has a good mind for creating a disturbing and scary environment while writing a very challenging yet believable beatable algorithm.The graphics ARE very basic, but I find that it lends a great deal to the grittier and disturbing feeling of the game.The sound design is exceptionally thought out, despite having a few sfx that seem like they could have a bump in overall quality.The jumpscares are epic, and the overall panic-inducing experience of playing this game is exhilerating.  You'll know what I mean when you first lose track of one of the animatronic characters after seeing all of them standing on the stage for the first half of the night, only to find them grinning at you through the door way a moment later.All this for a surprisingly low price.I look forward to more games by this developer.  DEFINITELY pick this game up wether it's on sale or at the full whopping price of $4.99.			"

												This is probably the best horror game of the year! This game uses new mechanics combinded with a awesome concept. Never have I seen a game based on animatronics in a pizza parlour. The idea is original and great to build story and lore off of. The end of the game leaves you clueless and makes you wonder what happened in Freddy Fazbear's Pizza before you got your job there. It's surprising that only one man had worked on this as it would have taken alot of time and talent to make such a great game. This game didn't follow in the footsteps of the sterotypical first person horror. The jumpscares were not cheesy and jumpscares were sometimes not even needed to scare the player. Gameplay was always interesting thoughout the whole game as none of the animatronics had a set path making it very scary and intense to not know what they might do next. It was great to add in the feature when you thought you had finished the game on the 5th night you actually hadn't. Also finding some of the hidden lore and easter eggs in this game makes the player more interestered in the story. If you are reading this and you haven't bought this game yet, Immediately scroll upwards and buy this game! For $5 this game is worth it. The community can't wait to see what else this game has to offer when the sequel to this is released. I approve of this game.Keep up the good work Scott Cawthon!			"

												One of, IF NOT THE SCARIEST, game I have EVER played. Five Nights at Freddy's is a blast! It really puts you in the HORRIFYING shoes of a night-watch security guard who is making taking care of the pizzaria over night. My top 3 rules about FNAF for the full effect of terror are as follows:1. Play at night when noone is around or maybe one other person that is watching you, but make sure its quiet everywhere else in your play location.2. WEAR HEADPHONES <<< I cannot stress enough how much scarier it is when the sound is condensed and blasted into your ears only!!!3. Stay calm and the nights will become a breeze once you have gotten use to the way each animatronic works and thinks.HAPPY NIGHT-WATCHING ALL !!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME!!!!!			"

												This is the single worst pizza place I have ever visited.We arrived on a saturday evening for a childs birthday party only to find out that they had lost our reservations.We had to sit in the bar area for allmost 45 minutes for a table to make up for it. The staff didn't even offer us a free drink or anything to make up for THEIR mistake! It wasnt until we FINALLY sat down for our meal that we noticed how run down the place looked. The decor looked very old and dated, The carpet was matted and the place STANK of old. It honestly looked like it hadnt been cleaned since the 1970s. Despite not even getting a ""Sorry for you're wait"" from the waitress, we were pressured into ordering our food as soon as we sat down. Me and my partner both ordered a Pepperoni while our son got a plain cheese. When the food EVENTUALLY arrived it was awful. The pepperoni may aswell have been called 'plain cheese with a hint of pepperoni' and neither of them had been cooked all the way through. They were more like FROZEN pizzas than resturant quaility pizzas!After finally paying out bill (which we were BLATANTLY overcharged for) we made straight for the exit. But to make matters worse one of the anamatronic animals jumped off the stage, bounded straight for my husband, ripped his skin and flesh off before stuffing his bloodstained skeleton into a furry rabbit suit. Right infront of mine and my sons eyes!B+			"

												As with most things that receive so much hype that they're made out to be the holy grail, you may be asking whether Five Nights at Freddy's lives up to that hype. Now I want to make it clear, I do think it's a pretty good game but I don't think it's the masterpiece people make it out to be. People are of course welcome to think it is and it's understandable why, as the game certainly has its fair share of great merits. I will address both the good points and bad points of this game. Keep in mind while reading that I do have an overall positive opinion on FNAF.One of the most important factors of a horror game is obviously whether it's scary. FNAF is scary... to an extent. The atmosphere is most definitely there. The player fills the role of a security guard working the nightshift at a family pizzeria inhabited by animatronic characters. The sounds are largely what make the atmosphere so amazing. From faint tunes apparently coming from attractions within the building, to ambient spooky noises, to even the whirs of the security cameras, the sound design is absolutely excellent in building suspense. The animatronics look terrifying simply standing there on the stage, in the dark, looking a far cry from the delightful entertainers they're supposed to be. One can't help but feel the fear build as they become aware of these characters beginning to skulk the halls, simply roaming, with no programmed objective, thus making them unpredictable.So where does the horror fail? In what it all ultimately builds up to. It's actually something the game points out when it starts up. To me, it's like the game's announcing a major flaw that it doesn't actually see as a flaw. I am of course referring to jumpscares. They're not inherently bad but by god can a work of horror fall back on them too much and FNAF certainly does... not just a little bit, quite a lot. Fortunately I do personally think two of the common jumpscare game overs aren't badly done - these being Foxy's and one of Freddy's (if he catches you before the power goes out.) This is because the animatronics in question look horrifying while doing the attacking. They look nothing like cuddly mascots, only wretched husks of metal and plastic, horribly failed attempts at endearing characters... just as the creator of the game no doubt intended.The other common jumpscare game overs unfortunately don't pull this off in my opinion. The animatronics attacking in those game overs... really do just look like cuddly mascots. It's a delicate art making colourful cartoon animatronics look and seem scary. The game succeeds most of the time but it almost looks like the creator didn't try during those jumpscare screens. Of course jump scaring is a lazy tactic that doesn't require any effort in the first place, so it needs some kind of scary imagery to go along with it. But there is nothing really off about the animatronics during these screens. Arguably Chica looks a little off but I don't feel it.That is the horror of FNAF at its core. Absolutely brilliant build-up, so-so execution due to the far, far too common practice of all horror works - jumpscares. It's just fortunate the game wasn't spoiled altogether by the jumpscares. It's also worth noting, there is a story to the game, both immediately obvious and not so obvious. Those who like to theorise and investigate should like it. That is, if the godawful community doesn't spoil the story for you. I'm also fond of how the game gives you the very brief ""pauses"" between the horror. The only thing that could possibly be considered something of a break in the horror is the guy who leaves a phone message for you every night. They're short, and in parts creepy in themselves, though usually there's still some lightheartedness to the creepiness. I don't know whether the creator intended for these phone calls to be something for the player to latch to due to there being nothing else to distract from the horror but it certainly works well. Unfortunately if one tries the same night more than once during one game session, the phone call no longer activates, so they have to restart. This is something I'd personally like to see patched.I have a few other issues with the game. First of all, its ending... if it can be considered that. FNAF is in a lot of ways a fairly simple game that one can get a lot out of, so a simple ending works in theory. But for all the effort that one has to put into this frankly very challenging game, the ending kind of feels like a slap in the face. I'd have preferred a bit more, even if it was short. As for the difficulty, I do feel it's somewhat too difficult for a horror game. It ends up making retrying the night feel like routine and the horror starts to fade as a result. Kind of like Slender: The Eight Pages but NOWHERE near as bad. Again, only SOMEWHAT too difficult. Finally, the lack of an option to adjust the screen resolution or any other option for that matter. This is probably why I had to restart my computer to start the game the first time. Why exclude such basic features?So those are my thoughts on FNAF. A pretty good horror experience that could serve to be amazing with a few tweaks here and there. Certainly a thrill to play, however and I would recommend it. It's also quite cheap. If you like horror and generally like what you've heard about this game, there's no reason not to get it.			"

												Fantastically creepy and off putting premise for anyone who has been to Chuck E. Cheeses's. This game relies on a slowly developing plot, mystery, and its chilling atmoshpere to put the player in a tense mood. There totally aren't any jumpscares or anything. It's not like if you lose track of any 1 of the 4 animitronic death machines a giant puppet will pop up in your face and trigger loud sound effects. Definitely a game for children. It teaches kids the importance of doing their laundry. 10/10 - Jarate Simulator 2014			"

The lack of animations and depth of gameplay is also a complaint... But don't get me wrong, I enjoy this game it's fun but it's full potential wasn't reached... like i said average. So would I recommend it? Yes. It was fun enough and the game actaully does have alot of interesting atmosphere and backstory to figure out. So yeah, It's not a masterpeice or anything revolutionary just a fun way to pass the time and worth it if you have 5 bucks.			"

												Interestingly enough, I have a very...prominant hate for jumpscares, and that may add to why i like this game so much. Let me explain. The whole point of the game is to prevent the (sometimes inevitable, it seems) jumpscare that will end your game. Now, I know that may sound bad, but as long as you keep your wits about you, you really have nothing to worry about. The game is a stress management game, really. the more you use up your resources the more likely you are to be murdered, but at the same time, you cant just sit there and do nothing or you will be murdered eventually anyway. The part of this game i like, is the uneasy feeling you get through the whole thing. I like scary games, but not the ""pop out at you"" kind. i like the ones that get in your head and mess with you, and this game, to an extent, does. not to mention a few easter eggs here and there. That can never hurt, right?			"

												Five Nights at Freddy's is an Indie, Point-and-click, Survival Horror video game.Although it came out recently, this point-and-click novelty game has a few nasty tricks up their sleeves. In this game, you're a security guard who needs to watch the animatronics during the night shift from 12 to 6 AM. The only problem is that the animatronics tend to wander around after dark... and try to kill you. All you have to do is check the cameras to see where they're at, lighting the hallways to check the blind spots and shut the doors to protect you at all cost, all under a power limit.This video game is quite literally an anxiety manager with it's atmosphere, ambiance and feeling of brutal tension. It is considered a ""fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying"".It it praised for its unique take on the horror genre. It's also praised for it's minimalistic presentation, especially on the audio and lack of music, for the terror of the game. With the fact that the nervous impulses of the repetitive gameplay that can reach almost OCD-type levels, this tense game is horror done right.			"

I have a big fear of mascots/animatronics so this game is probably my worst kind of game but yet, I ADORE it!  The controls are so simple but beautifully crafted into the dark and dank atmosphere of ""Freddy Fazbear's Pizza""!  Every time, no matter how safe you may be, you never feel safe AT ALL.  You are always on edge, you want to give up but you really want to make it to Night 5 (Or Night 7) so you can proove you can beat the game!Hats off to Scott!  Very simple yet effective game, looking very forward to its sequel!(Only flaw is the jumpscares, they're cheap and mean.)			"

												Five Nights At Freddy's is a fantastic game! I myself am quite a fan and I love the unique take it has on the survival horror experience. With so many games of the same genre, you have to run and hide, but here there is nothing you can do to escape. And even with a pair of doors, camera system and lights, your power is a concern you must always remember to take into consideration. While the horror quality can degrade after playing it for so long, like I have, the tension is always there to complete every night alive. The most dramatic parts for me are when I am at 5am and my power runs out. I sit still, trying to delay Freddy's attack, hoping and praying to hear the familiar children's cheers as the night ends. Overall, a great game experience, but not for the faint of heart, atleast on the first few attempts. Because no matter how good you think you are, no matter how much you know the multitude of fan theories surrounding the backstory of this game, you are going to die atleast once when playing this unforgettable masterpiece.

												Five Nights at Freddy's is  a one-note joke, a single mechanic, and a single location and manages to take it to a hilarious extreme. Despite the overall lack of depth in gameplay and frustrating difficulty, I still find this game to be a unique experience. It's refreshingly simple and does a good job of breaking free from a lot of the cliche's of modern horror games, especially once you realize that this game does not take itself seriously. At all. The game is simple: you are a security guard at a pizza parlour that includes animatronic animal entertainers. You work the night shift. The animatronic animals like to ""roam around"" at night. You have a limited amount of power with which to use security cameras to keep track of them, and keep the doors to your office (the only physical location in the game) closed when the animals get too close. If you don't keep track of their movements and they enter, then you're dead. Power tends to run out pretty fast, so the main aspect of the game is that of resource management. It's a simple mechanic, yes, but it will have you frantically switching between the cameras as you lose track of one of the bots, and as panic mounts you'll realize that HE'S RIGHT OUTSIDE THE DOOR! I can see this game being a big hit if played on a big screen at a party or something, considering how fast it plays and how simple it is. As power drains and tension rises it can be hard to focus on conserving power, and when the end comes it is usually hilarious.My main problem with the game is that it's a one-note joke that wears thin after awhile. If you are wanting to play this as a serious game, then move on. It's a gag that will entertain you for 3 hours max, until you let someone else play and don't tell them anything about it. Then you'll get more enjoyment. And probably fewer friends :DFor five dollars, I recommend this game. I think it's a good price for something that's a light-hearted, more competent and slick version of the scary maze game. It tells me that the makers understood what they were doing and didn't want to make the game out to be anything more than it is. And for those of you that think you shouldn't buy it because you've seen a youtube video of it, I'd give the game more credit than that. You don't know what it's like until you're sitting in the security office panning frantically between cameras, hearing them singing ominously in the dark halls of the pizza parlour. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE, MAN!			"

												Five Nights at Freddy's is by far the best horror game I've played. It is the very definition of paranoia.You play as a night watch security guard for Freddy FazzBear's Pizzeria (because 4 bucks/hour is pretty cheap). Your job is to watch the security cameras and make sure that the 4 animatronics stay in line. You have control over the security cameras, 2 doors, and lights to see just outside the doors. Using any of those causes your power to drain quicker. You switch on your camera to find that the bots are all where they are supposed to be...Except what if they aren't?In this alternate universe, the bots are set to a 'free roam' setting. They wander around the building on their free will. If they happen to make it to your office, they recognize you as a bot without a costume. They will stuff you in a tiny little suit filled with animatronic gizmos. Nothing to worry about though, you have doors right?In case you forgot doors use power. If you use up all your power, you have to sit there in the dark, and wait for your (very terrifying) death... You literally HAVE to expose yourself to danger in order to survive, which is what bothers most of the people who play it.So was it a $5 well spent? YES YES YES YES!!!!!!!! Obviously yes there are only 5 levels, but you can play those levels over and over. There are so many different scary ways you can die, and every single one fills my pants. Yes 11/10. Done. Finished.

Five Nights At Freddy's is a work of art in that your very nervous the entire time and if you fail to operate correctly you get a large jump scare.

												[ Possible Spoilers ]     I've got to say, Freddy Fazbear's Pizza sounds like a failing establishment, which really adds to the atmosphere, making the player think that the animatronics are merely carcases for the deceased children to roam around in, attempting to make everything right by coming to stuff you into a suit. I also love the conservitive addition, having only Scott Cawthon perform the phone guy's voice. You can also say that this game is a step up from the usual horror game as you are a sitting duck, in one room, while in other games, you have to roam around, probably with someone chasing you. The very little issue of repitition does stand, as there are no little minigames, anything else, so when you finish the game, thats all. Out of all, I think the game deserves my following score:+-+-+-+Score+-+-+-+Originality: 19 / 20Style: 20 / 20Story: 15 / 20Compatibility: 20 / 20Control: 20 / 20Total: 94 / 100 - 5 StarsI recommend you buy this game, and also give the second one the kind of praise you would the first one.

For a full experience you'll need to play Five Nights at Freddy's yourself, alone in the dark, for maximum spookage.

												This will sound like a weird intro to this review but I'm not sure when I actually got this game.  I picked it up in a bundle but it wasn't one of the games I bought the bundle for so it sat unplayed on my computer for at least a month, maybe longer, before I started to hear people talk about it.  The buzz was favorable so I fired it up.  My first impression was not favorable.  The learning curve is steep and you are thrown in without any real tutorial or anything.  I died just short of finishing the first night and was kind of frustrated by the experience.  And frustration is something you will have to get used to if you play this game.  The game is a few things, survival horror, resource management, it's also a puzzle game.  I say it's a puzzle game because there are specific rules the game follows and figuring these rules out requires a lot of trial and error.  Trial and error gameplay seems especially punishing in this game because of the simplistic controls and interface.  FNAF is a masterpiece at building tension and even though it tells you that the jump scares are coming they're effective.  The only game I can remember playing in recent memory that could get me an adrenaline rush that left my hands shaking was Dark Souls and if you venture into the infamous 4/20 mode you'll see that the unforgiving difficulty is very much on par with the worst that Dark Souls had to offer.  This is a quality game and I highly reccomend it if you're looking for a challenge, or even if you don't decide to torture yourself with the bonus modes, a creep diversion.  It's also available on iOS and Android and the iOS port is very good but it is easier.  If you're looking for the real challenge get it here.			"

												I know this game has been reviewed a bunch, but I'd like to share my take on ol' Freddy and his crew. I've played a good number of scary games, but none have made me feel as helpless and paranoid as Five Nights at Freddys. When you start playing and watch the animitronics move around, it's one of the most intense experiences you can go through. Just sitting there, unable to move, and the fear of a robot animal sneaking in at any second to kill you, the fear filling yu with each second. Every time you look at the time, it feels like your chances of survival slip every more quickly as you realize it hasn't even been an hour since you last checked that clock. No other game has made me feel like turning on all my lights and huddling in a corner like this one. Now, this doesn't make it perfect. One of the big flaws for this game is the repetitive atmosphere. If you sit there for a few hours and play this, the fear just dies, because you figure out when your threatened and when you need to use that valuable power. And the big rule in horror games is that when you lose the atmosphere, you lose the player. With this in mind, I still enjoyed this game. If you want to capture what it's like to be near helpless while a bunch of murderous robots are stalking you, buy this game!			"

												What happened to the horror genre? Did it die? Was it replaced with mindless mass appeal action with a horror theme yet no actual fear factor? Yes... and no. The horror genre has been placed in the hands of indie developers and in those hands it still thrives with games like this. The indie gaming industry proves it can continue to add new ideas to the genre while still providing that heart-attack inducing fear we felt the first time we played Silent Hill, Resident Evil or Eternal Darkness. Amnesia showed us first person games don't always need guns and weapons, it also proved that if you've already evacuated your bowels while playing the next scare will bring out unprocessed food.Five Nights at Freddy's shows us that heart attacks are can happen to people of any age.... okay all jokes aside this game really does stand out in the horror genre. You don't actually do anything, you aren't walking around or looking for clues. No instead you just sit there... knowing something will happen and you don't know when it will come or what will come at you but you know. It's a feeling of dread and fear that I... honestly havent experienced in a horror game before. Something about these ungodly abominations just toying with you, gives you the sense of helplessness as if you're at the mercy of these things. Usually these types of indie games don't appeal to me. Like all those knock versions of Slenderman.... actually I didn't even like Slenderman. But this, this is not some indie horror game from the quick and easy production line up of such games like Spongebob Slendypants... no this is a stand out title. Almost like a point and click adventure but without the adventure. The person/people who made this game knew what scared people and they utilized that with game mechanics that require you to think clearly and react to what you see and hear. Which is extremely hard to do when your having a bowel evacuating heart-attack. Nonetheless I love this game and it's something I hope to see more of.			"

If you use up all your power, you have to sit there in the dark, and wait for your (very terrifying) death... You literally HAVE to expose yourself to danger in order to survive, which is what bothers most of the people who play it.So was it a $5 well spent? YES YES YES YES!!!!!!!! Obviously yes there are only 5 levels, but you can play those levels over and over. There are so many different scary ways you can die, and every single one fills my pants. Yes 11/10. Done. Finished.

												I got this game because I though it would help me get settled in into the horror genere. Five Nights At Freddy isnt like and normal horror game, ya' know, walk around some random place, dont get killed by the many creatures that lurk the area, and once you escape, you win. Five Nights At Freddys however, is alot diffrent however. You are stuck in a room with limited power, and once that power runs out, Freddy Fazbear (as I like to call him, Freddy Fagbear), will come to end your long night. This game REALLY builds up tensity, because half the time I press escape (if you didnt know, the button that instantly closes the game), and most of the time I just keep flipping the camera to kinda help slow down the anamatronics in there position. A few flaws though is once you know how to tell an anamatronic is is your room, or one is running to your room, it isnt as scary, but still, it makes me extremely tense. Hope this reveiw helps you decide weather you want to buy the game or not, and I hope you have a nice day :D			"

C'mon...""- *plays with controls*  ""So... I'm stuck here?  I can't move, all I can do is check the camera and shut the doors...""- *plays with camera* ""Man this place is creepy... wait WHAT?!  What is that thing doing there?  Wasn't it in the other room?""- OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG someone is laughing or screaming or something- Presses the blessed ESC button- *uninstalls game*  NO THANK YOU- ... *reinstalls game half a day later*  Why am I doing this to myself...

												I recommend this game, but honestly this isn't ""single player"" game.  Yeah, it's fun to play this game alone once or twice, but then it really isn't fun anymore.  It gets old fast.  It's such a simplistic game, and it's one big jump scare.  This is basically the game you buy to play with friends.  It's only scary the first few times you play it, and it's only fun if you play it with friends.			"

												I had been wanting to play this game for a long time. I watched a few YouTube gamers play it, such as Markiplier and PewDiePie, so I had a pretty good idea of how the game's mechanics worked. This did little to lessen the impact of the game. It is still the most frightening game I have ever played.Do not let the incredibly simple mechanics fool you. Five Nights at Freddy's is surprisingly challenging. The power supply is stingy and the anamatronics can be very persistent in catching you. It gets a little old if you play it for too long at a time, but it is a fabulous game!			"

												Probably the most over-hyped indie-game of the year, but with good reason really in my thoughts. For the super low price that it is as of today, 5 Nights is definately worth a pick-up as it's easy to put back down again after your BPM exceeds a sprinting pace. And pick back up again til you achieve bragging rights status in saying ""I survived 5 Nights at Freddy's"".			"

												This game is much different from other horror games out there. Not being able to move and looking at these 'lifeless' dolls really creeps me out. The controls are easy and are explained through phone guy who really sets up tention between you an the game. The grafics are kind of bad but no game is 'perfect'. The one thing alot of people hate about this game is that the jump scares suck. I will admit that they really can only get you acouple times but that doesn't ruin the game. This is a game that once you start you have to finish.Pros:Great atmisphere Lots of easter eggsGood story easy controlsCons:Jump scared can really only get you one timeThe community is terrible. So many haters to the point that you make a joke they all jump at the chance to say something negative to you.  Another thing i want to cover that i hear alot of people blab about is that this franchise is just slender woods (Idk what the game is called) but with animatronics. Not true. In that game you move and the tention comes from being able to see him staring at you all the time. With fnaf its a little like that but the sounds play a bigger role in it. All in all its really fun and i am currently on night 5. I suggest getting it. "

												I have a love/hate relationship with Five Nights at Freddy's. I orginally thought that this would be a fun little time sink styel of game; a couple of jump scares, some jokes about greasy pizza and a game over screen, not something that would friggin' haunt me. Granted, it doesn't have sparkling graphics, but FNaF proved that you don't need it to make something genuinely spooky. On the downside, I now get a little unconscious jolt of panic whenever I see a draining battery symbol. On the upside, I no longer need to go to the bathroom.Just for the record, Scott, you owe me a new pair of pants.As the restaurant's (apparently suicidal, from how many times you go back) night guard, it's the player's job to keep a close eye on the animatronics after dark and keep things under wraps for the company. However, with the dark corners and blind spots perfect for a mischevious bunny coupled with energy resource management, this quickly went from a slightly eerie quick game to play to a legitimately unsettling and really freakin' tense experience, made all the more nerve wracking by the 'crew' and their tendency to violently invade your personal space at a bowel-evacuatingly frequent pace. Probably my best (worst?) and first experience with Bonnie resulted in a couple of broken computer accessories and very sore kneecaps. Seriously, the rabbit might not appear all that from a distance, but that's no ordinary rabbit. Just look at the bones, he's got a vicious streak a mile wide.All in all, I definitely don't regret buying this game, nor do I regret playing it.I do, however, regret not being ready for Freddy.Definitely worth a play or fifty, whether you're prepared or not.

												To be entirley honest, as i look at all the sequels that have come out to this game i realize that the franchise is starting to become a little milked, but i still have to give this game credit for what it did.Even if your a fnaf hater even you have to admit that the idea behind this game was brilliant, to take something average that would normally not be seen as scary and making it into something terrifying.  I think that the lack of movement in this game also adds to the experience, because the feeling of helplessness forces you to rely on your cameras which is argueably the games greatest strength. by using these cameras it creates an atmospheric kind of scare rather than cheap jumpscares (which are in this game i should note) but for me what really stood out was the way that this game portrays this childrens pizzeria, and makes it into a place that looks like it could be home to a slasher villian.this game is a little limited in gameplay but its very atmospheric and the animatronics are all memorable and in an odd way have their own unique behaviors.  Although the game has several flaws, such as a stupidly low power meter, and doors that open when the power goes out for some reason, the overall experience comes off as being creative and fresh for the horror genre. p.s. much better than any of the sequels in my opinion			"

												Five Nights at Freddy's is...the most terrifying game I have ever played. I can hardly even press the continue button now. The title screen freaks me out as well. On the first night, it wasn't too bad; the animatronics were not active for the duration of the first call of the Phone Guy, which saved me a couple of hours. (The only thing I did during that time was listen to call, get used to where the cameras are located, and getting to know the controls). But on the second night...I didn't even get past 50%/3 AM. Bonnie made me scream. I died horribly. After I returned to title screen, I just quit. The most scary thing about this game is that you are alone, and it is EXTREMELY quiet (Apart from footsteps, banging noises, etc). And you know that you are going to get jumpscared when you LEAST expect it. Do I recommend this game?If you have played many, many horror games, and are used to being jumpscared, then why not? But if you have not played a ton of horror games, and/or have some sort of fear of creepy dolls coming to life, then no. At least not at first. Overall, amazing game, great mechanics, and awesome design. Rating: 10/10Note: See you on the other side...(If you get there)			"

												One of the things I have noticed about this game is the fact that the 4 animitronics behave differently. No matter how you play it there will always be one of the animals who screw you over depending on what you do. Doesn't matter if you just check lights or the cams or you sit with the doors shut the only way to win this game is to stick your neck out and know when to pull it back. And since this game really imerses you into it so well you have to be emotionless or VERY jaded not to freak out and thats another thing to the only way you really lose is if you freak out use too much power then die its got that silent hill 2 quality of being really suspensful and oh what are you doing still reading this just play it!

												7/10Fun little horror game, recommend.It's more frustrating than scary, though.  Night 5 was the worst for me because Freddy is a serious troll.  I found that if you don't stress yourself out over it, then you do better and I was able to get through the first four nights without dying.  And there's a pattern you can follow to help you out.  Wish the backstory was more in your face and obvious because it's so easy to miss as it is right now.--Pros--- Great atmosphere for a horror game- Love the use of sounds to indicate the locations of the animatronic- I love the graphics, even if they are mostly just pictures- Foxy's little animation is good for catching people off guard--Cons--- Jumpscares get old really fast- Power system runs on dumb logic- Backstory isn't obvious enough- Needs more creepy imagery when you're going insane- Why do we keep coming back?

It gave me so many spooks and I wanted to play it so bad. I downloaded the demo and screamed like a little girl when Bonnie jumpscared me. Now, I have every FNaF game. I beat 20/20/20/20 mode. Now I'm hyped for FNaF World (I really like RPGs). They're in the production of a movie. Now, Scott released a novel! I can not beleive how far this game has come! 10/10 Would start over, again.			"

												Five Nights at Freddy's is a refreshing take on the survival horror genre.  You work the night shift at a children's pizza restaurant akin to a Chuck-E-Cheese; however, that is where the similarities stop.  Fazbear's Pizza has a shady past, and a few ""malfunctioning"" animatronics seeking your inadvertent death.  You have to survive the nights with only your cameras, doors, lights, and quick click reactions.  Don't be too hasty or your limited supply of power will run out!There are three unique aspects that make this a must play--the simple design/gameplay mechanics (you are stuck in a room--no escape just survival), sinister environment (camera features and sounds play with your sanity), and the constant suspense (you see them coming closer and CLOSER).On the other hand, the jumpscares get tiresome and the gameplay repetitive, but that doesn't overpower the great aspects of the game.  I'm looking forward to the next installment.			"

												Probably one of the few times I was legitamately scared in a ""horror"" game. You have no way to actually fight these animatronics, all you can do is shut the doors and even then, you losewhat limited powers you do have. That said, there's not much to the game, it's basically just checking cameras and waiting for the evil robots to come to the window, so you know to shut the door. Even so, it's a scarry, fun time and the price is right, only five bucks.			"

This game scared me so much, it slowly killed from inside. 2 days ago, my house was taken away from me, after my family left me. I now live on the streets and without any clothing except a loincloth, which is brown and yellow, I have nothing left anymore, This game has ruined me forever. 10/10			"

												This game is very unique, and downright terrifying. I first found this game a few months ago when only the demo was available. I played it, and I had no idea what I getting myself into...This game is terrifying, it's a point and click game but it has a crushingly terrifying atmosphere, because you could be jumpscared at any moment. In this game, you play as a man who got himself a job at a kids pizza store named Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. You have been hired to work the night shift and you begin the game at Night 1. You cannot move in this game, you can only operate the door lights, peek up at your security cameras or shut/open your doors. You are unaware of the fact that the animatronics you are looking after (which are basically animal robots which are mascots to the store) actually move around at night, and if they find you...they will kill you.You spend the five nights of this game constantly peeking up at the cameras making sure all of the animatronics are in place, and when they move you must keep track of them otherwise they will get into your office and horrifyingly jumpscare you. That is basically how you survive in this game, you keep an eye on the animatronics and when they get near your office, you just shut the doors so they can't get in. Sounds pretty easy huh?Well, these animatronics cut off your camera when they move around, which means that you have no idea where they are and they could have just ran straight next to your door without you knowing and get you. Also, if you're late catching them they will cut off the power to your doors, meaning certain death. If that wasn't enough however, you have a power bar which means that you must be careful with the amount of power you use. (You lose power by looking at your camera, using the door lights and shutting the doors.) And once that percentage hits 0, you have only a matter of seconds to live before Freddy comes and finishes you off. There are various ways you have to handle the animatronics in order to survive, and they all work differently but I am not going to tell you how to handle them because then the experience just won't the the same for you! The jumpscares will make you jump, and will make you scream and it WILL happen so if you're going to buy this game, make sure you know what you're getting into! The couple of negative things I could say about this game is that it does get tedious because once you know how to survive, that's it! That's it for the rest of the nights and you'll be safe, once you know the way around the game you will breeze through it. Another thing is that, after a certain amount of jumpscares; you do get used to them and they will not scare you so much, which does ruin the atmosphere a bit and may just frustrate you if you fail.Overall, I'd definitely recommend giving this game a try and it will be challenge to complete all seven of the nights (yes, seven!) Just make sure you're prepared before going on this rollercoaster!			"

Oh, well then be prepared to have some!Honestly one of the most terrifying games out in today's market- and a simple concept at that! If you wear a pair of  headphones the sounds in the game can make the expirience much more realistic and you'll get sucked in more... panicing ever more slightly as you hear footsteps outside of the office- but which side?Also, Chica plays with pots and pans like a child- 10/10 listening to birds make music with pots and pans simulator 2014.

												This game is both painful to play and absolutely boring to play.In this game, you sit around. Doing jackshit and then a bunny rabbit jumps at you.Your only defence is closing doors.The characters are:This blue rabbit that looks like one of Bill Clintons sex toys.A chicken? Pidgeon? Something like that anyway. It looks like some hybrid of Donald Trump and a penguin.Bill Cosby. Sorry Freddy. A brown thing that likes to sing and play around with little children and jump on them at night.Jimmy Saville, with an eye patch, it tends to hide behind a curtain with a kid until the kid dies and it chases after you.Golden Bill Cosby. Basically Bill Cosby but you can't hear him coming.I rate this game 2/10.Lost virginity in mass orgy of Bill.			"

												Although the game might seem as a cheap jumpscare type game,it only jumpscares you as a punishment for messing up.This game offers no weapons at all to fight,so you feel defenseless,adding to the stress.This game really builds up stress to make you mess up,and god if it isnt hard.Its hard in a good way though,pretty challenging.This game requires alot of concentration since in later nights,1 single messup can ruin the night and get you killed.The community has come up with really interesting theories about the game.

												if you don't know what suspense is.... I suggest you play this game.Some reccommendations for this game will include:Playing at nightPlay with headphones (medium - loud volume) play by yourself for nightmares or play with friends over for hilarity... or a few extra pants to throw in the washing machineA few things I would like to see in this game would be.A radio that you can click on to play some music/talk radio stations on, -- But that takes away power as usual -- talk radio stations would have stuff like news relating to the pizza place you work at, like; ""In other news, the man who went missing was last reported at his night job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria"" or something along those lines...On the custom day (Day 7), you should be able to have an optional ""Infinite Power"" cheat.A special ending for completing 20/20/20/20 on the 7th day.... or an acheivement or something...All in all it's a great game to play if you're bored and want a good scare 8.5/10			"

												Here we go.  I love this game, but do not associate myself with this fanbase.  It's unique to different horror games, as in a fear of simple animatronics.  Others find sitting behind a desk flashing a light and closing doors thoughtless and boring.  It's a good game in my opinion though, look at other reviews before making a decision though.			"

												Five Nights at Freddy's is a nice little 2d click-and point game that is NOT for the faint of heart. It has tons of jumpscares, so if you don't like those, then don't play this. It has a nice backstory with many easter eggs, including (nope). Some become obvious after a while. This game has spooky ambience, so if you quit right as you start the game (like I did multiple times), I wouldn't be suprised.			"

You'll die. Probably not literally, but your life expectancy will be shortened.			"

												This, from the moment I first saw gameplay on Youtube, was destined to become one of my top 3 games. I. Love. It. It's a refreshingly new kind of horror that makes you think. No blood or gore, just strictly psychological. I'm obsessed. I have hours logged on the app version on my ipad, but find the PC version far superior. Once. my friends told me the rumors behind the game, I became even more curious. It is basic, difficult, and thrilling. Which how such a basic game can create hours of horrific fun. 10/10, 100/100 double thumbs up!!!			"

												If you want to know why people love this game, play this, not the new games. As I played through blindly the first time I was horrified, it gave me shivers.If you go back and play it however it isn't as scary but if this is your first time playing a FNAF game, go in without watching videos and do not buy the sequels.Also stay away from the fanbase, it gets pretty weird.

												Wow what a game! A game so simple to do yet so terrifying! Well not that simple, the game does get a little unforgiving the further you go into the game. Besides that the game is super creepy, dark, and scary which every gamer should have a night-light in their room (You'll thank me later! xD) Great job Scott, not only were you able to scare the crap out of me but I will never be able to look at the animatronics at Chuck-E-Cheese the same way ever!10/10 Would never go to Chuck-E-Cheese ever again.

												Scary? Yes.Horror GOTY? No.Five nights at Freddy's, although I have not gotten very far, is scary. It's not the kind of game you'd like to play at 3 am in a dark room. But is it a horror title? Not really. The atmosphere of the game is moderately creepy, and you're more just waiting for the next jump scare, than afraid of every moment. The characters are creepy, and will make you seriously consider ever going to Chuck-E-Cheese's again. There are many games out, which fully immerse you in the story, such as Outlast, or Amnesia, but this is not comparable. This game goes for something completely different than they do. Those games are jump scares mixed with a lot of atmosphere, and fear of turning the next corner. Five nights at Freddy's is not an uncomfortable atmosphere. Chuck-E-Cheese's is not scary, sure, it's creepy, but not scary. The location is about as non-creepy as it can get, short of having all the lights on and kids running around. The only thing that makes the game scary, is the characters. You're watching for the 3 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s the whole game, and focusing on their locations versus the atmosphere of the location itself.Although all of that, this game tries to be something new, and it succeeded. It doesn't follow the norm of what the horror category is, and because of that, this game is getting big. Now that there's a bit more funding, I can't wait to see #2! Long live Freddy's.			"

												I love this game. I even beat the legendary 4/20 mode. And I have to say, the game is good.......ok i can't.....this is probably the new slender trend or something because there is something about this game that just makes it unique. And the creator put sooooooooooooooooooo much hidden easter eggs or hidden lore into the game the game still has theories to this day. And the jumpscares are really really f***ing good. Sure you can get used to them and expect them after a few times but if your not expecting it, it WILL get you. And then there's freddy..........I have the utmost respect for this character out of all of them, not my favorite, but the most respect for the main character. all the characters I like but never really fear them, then there's freddy, i don't fear him but every time i hear that laugh.......the♥♥♥♥♥♥gets real. And his jumpscares/deaths are the most unpredictable out of the whole game. after his song, could kill you instantly, a few seconds, or could make you wait for like f***ing 20 seconds. Then when he's in your office, pretty much same thing but much sooner. So for all those people who say this game is nothing special or is not scary, go mann up (see what I did there?) and buy the game or go try it at another friends house, I will guarantee that you will not be ready for freddy.100/10 for game. 1000/10 for entire series.

												Here we go.  I love this game, but do not associate myself with this fanbase.  It's unique to different horror games, as in a fear of simple animatronics.  Others find sitting behind a desk flashing a light and closing doors thoughtless and boring.  It's a good game in my opinion though, look at other reviews before making a decision though.			"

Five Nights at Freddy's ReviewA security camera controlling horror and timing game.In Five Nights at Freddy's you play as a security guard working late shifts in a restaurant filled with animatronics. The restaurant is very much like the American diner ""Chuck E. Cheese's"". The games is scary, I couldn't even survive two nights. This game is by far the best horror game of this year. The great aspect of it is that you're isolated, trapped in one position. In most horror games the goal is to run away from the ghost or monster or creature or whatever the scary villain be in the game. However, in this game, you can't run, making it even more scarier...Yes, plenty of jumpscares. Honestly, I really don't like the stereotype of playing a horror game in the dark alone. Yes, it makes it creepy but it's honestly better to play with a friend sat next to you. You just have to trust me on that one! There's also a few easter eggs you can catch a glimpse of in the game so that's good for all you easter egg hunters. Overall one of the best horror games of 2014, a must-have for horror fanatics. Be warned though, most of the fanbase is obsessive and irritating and most of this game's sequels are awful.			"

												Me and some of my friends play horror games during school at lunch sometimes. My friends really wanted me to buy this so we can play it. I thought the game was over hyped and didn't see what was scary about it. After playing I found out its rather scary. The gameplay is simple yet it works perfectly. Just sit in a room, watch the cameras, close the doors, flicker the lights and wait for your night to end. Watching the animatronics is very creepy as one second they'll all be there and the next ""ooh, wheres Bunny gone?"" and you'll find her right down the hall from where you are. The little hallucinations that happen to you can be very scary as well. The pre-rendered graphics are pretty cool and Freddy and the rest of the animatronics models look really neat. Now onto the not so great stuff. From what I've played and how I've been playing, the power seems to not last very long. I can get rather scared at times so maybe its from me just looking at the cameras too much. The jumpscares can be predictable and if you've seen some one else beat the game there isn't really any reason to buy it. Its nothing groundbreaking and the game is a little over hyped. Made it to night 6. I have now worked out how to save more power. The animatronics move a lot more and it can be rather frightening. I'm not as scared of the jumpscares as I was when they firsted happend, mainly because if you listen you can hear them behind the cameras. Also, night 6 is tough. Like really tough. The animatronics move more often and you ALWAYS have to make sure Foxy hasn't moved, because if he comes running you'll have only a few seconds to close the door before you hear what the fox really says as he shoves you inside a suit. I used to get bullied by my friend because I was scared of the jumpscares. I'm not scared now though so HAH, suck it Felix. *ahem* anyway, Five Nights at Freddy's is an excellent (a little over hyped) indie horror game that I highly recomend you get. I think the game would possibly be better on a WiiU or with a tablet hooked up to your computer to be used a the camera monitor. It would make the experince more immersive in my opinion.So yeah, if you've seen your favorite youtuber complete the game don't bother getting it. Its just not as fun.But yeah, I like this game and can't wait for FNaF 2 to be realeased.9/10			"

												I've compleated the game and in my opinion once you learn how the A.I. works you notice that the game isn't as scary as you thought it was the first time you played it and you figure out that the A.I. isn't that smart (not giving any spoilers).When I first played this game i wish i never bought it and saw it as a waste of money but once i played it bit by bit it became a wole lot more fun and enjoyable.

												I've seen horror games... horror games that you've seen... But you have no right to call this a bad game. You have a right to be scared of the game, you have a right to do that. But you have no right to judge it by its jumpscares. It's impossible  to put into words to describe what is necessary to those who do not know what a horror game is. Horror... Horror has a face... and you must make a friend of horror. Horror and moral terror are your friends. If they are not, then they are enemies to be feared. They are truly enemies. I remember when I was playing Slender... seems a thousand centuries ago. I played at a friend's house to just get it over with. I left the computer because I had to eat dinner. After I fin-OKAY, OKAY, I'll stop ripping off Apocalypse Now for Now and just say that this is easily, EASILY, the definitive horror game of 2014 (In... case you didn't know that already). Five Nights at Freddy's is the product of indie video game developer Scott Cawthon, and his first attempt at a horror game. From my knowledge, he did make some games in the past, and weren't necessarily bad either, but did, on occasion, get some negative feedback from players complaining that the character movements in those games resembled those of animatronics. Fast forward a few years later and Scott decides to USE this negative feedback to make his own original game about, you guessed it, animatronic anthropomorphic (animathopomorphnic) animals out to kill you and you have a limited power supply, limited vision, a security camera, and a FAN (*shudders*).... Oh, and also it's actually the 4th restaurant in a series of restaurants that all closed down because one closed down because of a murder of a child outside FredBear's Family Diner, and the second one (Fazbear's Pizza) closing down because of multiple parents complaining of the smell of the animatronics, comparing them to reanimated carcasses, and the third one closing down because of a certain Bite of '87. So... yeah, bad history. I could go more in-depth with this plot (Puppet is behind everything (probably)), but I'll save that for the FNaF wiki.Now, gameplaywise, THIS game is what I call a break in the horror timeline. The typical indie horror game of 2013 or 2014 was very simple. You're a person whom you don't know the name of and you're trying to escape an asylum, or maze, or house, or-- and you're treated to cheap jumpscares, Unity graphics, lame story, bad voice acting, and general 2013-14 horror game logic: it's not scary. BUT, Five Nights at Freddy's changes this completely. It's a game with generic, yet unpredictable jumpscares (especially during the 1st and 2nd Nights), and that makes them very effective, EXTREME rising tension, good replayability, simple, but original graphics, ENGAGING AS ♥♥♥♥ backstory, and a guy on the phone who talks to you every night. Think of him as George Clooney from Gravity: he's there to relieve your stress for 3 minutes.With all of these components in place, Scott Cawthon made a game that probably changed the horror gaming industry for a while. It's honestly the very first horror game that I've ever played that I keep coming back to nearly every day to have another shot at that ♥♥♥♥ing 20/20/20/20 mode. And with that said, if my review wasn't descriptive enough, and you've NEVER seen any footage, information, or talk about this game at ALL, go on YouTube and check out Markiplier's complete playthrough of the game (you won't regret it).tl;dr While jumpscares, and difficulty can lead to the game eventually not becoming scary at all, Nights 1-3 in Five Nights at Freddy's were the scariest 3 days of my life, and, potentially, my most chaotic. Pay the man your 5 dollars and play this game.Also: return of the honk.19.87/20			"

												Hello, Miss Pauling says me reviewing would be good for something called ""P.R"", I will do as instructed. I think this game is silly, baby bunnies and stupid chickens come at me, but I crush them like stupid B.L.U mercenaries, the pay is terrible but I guess killing stupid robot bunnies is easy enough money. You should play this game if you wish to laugh at stupid cowardly robots or if you're a tiny baby man who is afraid of tiny little bunnies.7/10, I enjoyed watching baby scout soil himself playing this game.

												Me and some of my friends play horror games during school at lunch sometimes. My friends really wanted me to buy this so we can play it. I thought the game was over hyped and didn't see what was scary about it. After playing I found out its rather scary. The gameplay is simple yet it works perfectly. Just sit in a room, watch the cameras, close the doors, flicker the lights and wait for your night to end. Watching the animatronics is very creepy as one second they'll all be there and the next ""ooh, wheres Bunny gone?"" and you'll find her right down the hall from where you are. The little hallucinations that happen to you can be very scary as well. The pre-rendered graphics are pretty cool and Freddy and the rest of the animatronics models look really neat. Now onto the not so great stuff. From what I've played and how I've been playing, the power seems to not last very long. I can get rather scared at times so maybe its from me just looking at the cameras too much. The jumpscares can be predictable and if you've seen some one else beat the game there isn't really any reason to buy it. Its nothing groundbreaking and the game is a little over hyped. Made it to night 6. I have now worked out how to save more power. The animatronics move a lot more and it can be rather frightening. I'm not as scared of the jumpscares as I was when they firsted happend, mainly because if you listen you can hear them behind the cameras. Also, night 6 is tough. Like really tough. The animatronics move more often and you ALWAYS have to make sure Foxy hasn't moved, because if he comes running you'll have only a few seconds to close the door before you hear what the fox really says as he shoves you inside a suit. I used to get bullied by my friend because I was scared of the jumpscares. I'm not scared now though so HAH, suck it Felix. *ahem* anyway, Five Nights at Freddy's is an excellent (a little over hyped) indie horror game that I highly recomend you get. I think the game would possibly be better on a WiiU or with a tablet hooked up to your computer to be used a the camera monitor. It would make the experince more immersive in my opinion.So yeah, if you've seen your favorite youtuber complete the game don't bother getting it. Its just not as fun.But yeah, I like this game and can't wait for FNaF 2 to be realeased.9/10			"

												This is it, your chance to get paid! so you...work at a Pizzeria? dafuq? dude, you could have been a cashier! alot safer ya know? anyways, your role is the Night guard, Mike Schmidt watching over Freddy Fazbears Pizza. the cast stars Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie the Bunny, Chica The Chicken, and the 4th broken down animatronic, Foxy The Pirate Fox. these 4 can roam around freely during the day, but to keep their servos from locking up, the company leaves them on over night. this is a problem for you cause that means they can get into your office, and after hours, they won't know your a human and instead will think your an endoskeleton missing its costume, and will try to stuff you in one. or in simpler terms...KEEL you.You're not allowed outside of the office, and must stay there. this adds a feeling of helplessness to the situation. What you have are 2 doors, the cameras, and lights for the doors. you watch the cameras to make sure you know where the animatronics are. Bonnie and Chica go for your doors, and you can catch them in the blindspots(Right outside your door!)if you check the light and you cant find them anywhere. when you DO catch them in the lights, SHUT THE DAMN DOOR! there is one big thing many players die from. the POWER meter. the building is on limited power during the night, and keeping the doors down drains that power quickly. same with using both lights and doing ALL AT THE SAME TIME WILL GET YOU ♥♥♥♥ING MURDERED. so only close the doors when you have to, and only check the lights once every time you pull down the cameras. One big flaw to this strategy is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ himself, FOXY. keep those cameras off for too long and Foxy comes running down the west hall(yes RUNNING instead of actually just ♥♥♥♥in standin there)and instantly ends your night. you CAN block him with the door if you got lightning fast reflexes OOOOOR you know he's coming. he WILL take a bit of your power from banging on that door though, so try not to trigger him and keep the cameras on frequently but not too frequently.Freddy FAZ♥♥♥♥ over here is the ultimate troll. he gets active on Night 3 and will hide in the dark so you usually wont see him until he enters the East Hall Corner. AKA near your door. no one truely knows how Freddy Fazbear works in this game, and thats the reason why the MANY, MANY deaths on night 5 were infact caused by mr FREDDY FAZ♥♥♥♥. he can also kill you with the power out. lose all that power on ANY NIGHT and he will play ""Toreador March"" for a random time. the longest possible windup is about 1 minute, but most players were ""Saved by the bell"" when 6 AM hit DURING Freddy Fazbear's Toreador March. so what do I think of this game? Great! its a great addition to the horror genre and while it isn't very scary nowadays, it still gives me those chills from time to time.Grade:A-ACTUALLY, THERES GOLDEN FREDDY TO. I HOPE YOU CAN FIND HIM :3			"

												Jump scares do not typically scare me. I need a slow tension kind of fright to really get me.This game provides the best of both of those worlds.Jump scares for me are normally too predictable. This game is unpredictable so it's actually able to provide the thrill of a real scare.It's actually quite difficult as well, it does require the player to be quick to react at times. That said, it IS worth 5 dollars. No more than that. I wonder about the replayability of it though.			"

												I love this game. I even beat the legendary 4/20 mode. And I have to say, the game is good.......ok i can't.....this is probably the new slender trend or something because there is something about this game that just makes it unique. And the creator put sooooooooooooooooooo much hidden easter eggs or hidden lore into the game the game still has theories to this day. And the jumpscares are really really f***ing good. Sure you can get used to them and expect them after a few times but if your not expecting it, it WILL get you. And then there's freddy..........I have the utmost respect for this character out of all of them, not my favorite, but the most respect for the main character. all the characters I like but never really fear them, then there's freddy, i don't fear him but every time i hear that laugh.......the♥♥♥♥♥♥gets real. And his jumpscares/deaths are the most unpredictable out of the whole game. after his song, could kill you instantly, a few seconds, or could make you wait for like f***ing 20 seconds. Then when he's in your office, pretty much same thing but much sooner. So for all those people who say this game is nothing special or is not scary, go mann up (see what I did there?) and buy the game or go try it at another friends house, I will guarantee that you will not be ready for freddy.100/10 for game. 1000/10 for entire series.

												Me and some of my friends play horror games during school at lunch sometimes. My friends really wanted me to buy this so we can play it. I thought the game was over hyped and didn't see what was scary about it. After playing I found out its rather scary. The gameplay is simple yet it works perfectly. Just sit in a room, watch the cameras, close the doors, flicker the lights and wait for your night to end. Watching the animatronics is very creepy as one second they'll all be there and the next ""ooh, wheres Bunny gone?"" and you'll find her right down the hall from where you are. The little hallucinations that happen to you can be very scary as well. The pre-rendered graphics are pretty cool and Freddy and the rest of the animatronics models look really neat. Now onto the not so great stuff. From what I've played and how I've been playing, the power seems to not last very long. I can get rather scared at times so maybe its from me just looking at the cameras too much. The jumpscares can be predictable and if you've seen some one else beat the game there isn't really any reason to buy it. Its nothing groundbreaking and the game is a little over hyped. Made it to night 6. I have now worked out how to save more power. The animatronics move a lot more and it can be rather frightening. I'm not as scared of the jumpscares as I was when they firsted happend, mainly because if you listen you can hear them behind the cameras. Also, night 6 is tough. Like really tough. The animatronics move more often and you ALWAYS have to make sure Foxy hasn't moved, because if he comes running you'll have only a few seconds to close the door before you hear what the fox really says as he shoves you inside a suit. I used to get bullied by my friend because I was scared of the jumpscares. I'm not scared now though so HAH, suck it Felix. *ahem* anyway, Five Nights at Freddy's is an excellent (a little over hyped) indie horror game that I highly recomend you get. I think the game would possibly be better on a WiiU or with a tablet hooked up to your computer to be used a the camera monitor. It would make the experince more immersive in my opinion.So yeah, if you've seen your favorite youtuber complete the game don't bother getting it. Its just not as fun.But yeah, I like this game and can't wait for FNaF 2 to be realeased.9/10			"

												When I first saw this game, I though it was the dumbing thing ever, worse than Slender. But, after playing the first few nights. It's pretty scary. Not the jumpscares, the Atmosphere is scary. After you beat all 7 nights, and 20/20/20/20. There is nothing to do. I wish the game had Trading Cards, Emoticons, or Achivements, at least something to do after you beat it. The story feels like a mess, at first it sounded simple, the we had a person killing kids, then there's the whole bite of '89 thing, and The sequel is a prequel. The games story is one of the most confussing stories I've ever heard. I have learned the story, and man... It's ♥♥♥♥ed up.8/10			"

												Five Nights at Freddy's is a first person, survival horror, point and click game. You work at Freddy Fazbears pizzeria, a place were the main attraction is Freddy Fazbear and his three friends. They are animatronic robots programmed to please the crowds, but have an unpredictable behavior at night. You are the night security guard, unfortunatly, and have to keep an eye on these animatronics while making sure that they don't get into your office and ""forcefully stuff you into a Freddy Fazbear suit"".The gameplay is simple, you are stuck in your office and have the ability to control the lights and doors to your office. You can also monitor the building through the cameras scattered around. To spice things up a bit, you have a limited amount of power that gets drained everytime you use the lights, doors and cameras, meaning that you have to leave yourself exposed in order to survive. The game also gets progressively more difficult after each night.This game has all the ingredients to make you extremly paranoid, due to the lighting, sound effects and creepy animatronics. The game awards you for remaining calm and using your recourses efficiently, and punishes you if you screw up and start to panic. It's also worth mentioning that the game will occasionally attempt to ruin your concentration by, among other things, flash detailed 3D images of perticular animatronics (notably terrifying).The story is very appealing. Scott Cawthon (the creator of FNAF) left us few clues, notes, messages and easter eggs for us to add up, only to find a creepy story that fits perfectly well into the game's setting.I really enjoyed playing this game at first during the first nights, it was a unique yet terrifying experience that few games has given me. But during the final nights the game was so difficult, it made me use a boring and repetetive strategy called ""rinse and repeat"" in order to complete the final night, which took away my freedom of choice to complete the game ""my way"". I didn't feel like playing the extra nights because it felt like a chore.This points out the biggest flaw and possibly the only flaw this game has, you need both skill and luck to complete the game. It could be a pro that adds to the experience or a con that ruins it.Anyway, this is a superb horror game that i would recommend to anyone who is interested in horror games. I can almost guarantee that you will scream like a little girl at least once while playing this game.10/10 would get stuffed into a Freddy Fazbear suit again.Are you ready for Freddy?			"

												This game is a more mild scary game, which I like, and it is scary because it has creepy animitronics that do creepy things. The game it self requires some strategy, survival of your life, and horror... lots of horror. You play as Mike, (a security at Freddy Fazbear's Pizzaria) and your goal is to make sure nothing goes wrong there at night, ""WHAT COULD GO WRONG?"" the magazine says. If you know what you are doing, can you pull it off is the real question, are you ready for Freddy? I recommend this game!			"

												A game with a good premise.  Prays on the fear of being alone with a bunch of freaky animatronic robots.  On top of that, you have a limited amount of power to use in order to keep track of them, to keep doors shut, or to turn on the lights.  When you run out of power, bad things tend to happen, though sometimes good things happen, like beating night 6 as someone with a big smile plays you a pleasant tune.  The game gives you minimal instructions on how it actually works, such as what the lights do, but does give you hints about what you should be doing.  Once you figure out a solid strategy, things mostly fall into place, though sometimes a good friend still slips into the room.  The game isn't that long, took me around 2 to 2 1/2 hours to finish all 6 nights plus play a custom game.  Got a couple of frights out of it.  Also, listening to Bebop scream like a girl as he was murdered on night 3 was worth the price of a little over a buck.  Overall, 7.5/10			"

												Hello Hello! Welcome to Freddy F-bears pizza factory of hell! Just wait a moment as the Animatronics decide to feast on your very soul if you make the wrong move even once!I am of course refering to 20/20/20/20 mode!Hey guys, Shallow here with this great news update! We come to you live with living proof of my beating nights 1-6 in just one day!Yes, this is completely true! Whether or not you believe it, that doesn't matter! All that matters is that I know for a fact that I did!Five Nights at Freddy's really dives into the instant scary horror jumpscares. Even the first damn night you have the potential to die right as the night begins! (Which is around 1-2 AM if you were wondering!)This game offers a stressful environment In which even the first wrong move wiil lead to your downfall!Bonnie in the right door? Don't worry! With your trusty flashlight and door closing ability, you can keep the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at bay as you comtemplate exactly why the hell you are playing the game in the first place! Oh, and don't even get me started on Chika!She'll pop in every now and then to give you a warm hug! Don't notice her by your right door? Well don't worry! Bonnie is on your side with his epic ability to SCREW YOU OVER! With his button disabling ability, you can no longer keep Chika and Bonnie at bay, with will lead to the death of yourself!On night three? Foxy to the rescue! With his shy nature and high speed, he will screw you up within the hour!Oh, did I mention he was camera shy? Keep the Camera's away from this beast, he might just kill you or take away some of your power!Oh, and don't even get me started on Golden Freddy! He just wants a hug as he sits next to your desk and DESTROY'S YOUR LIFE! Don't have a fast enough reaction speed? He'll just pop on in and KILL YOU WITHOUT MERCY!Well, you thought it was over didn't you? Night 3 is just the beginning. Come night four, you'll find yourself dying over and over again if you don't have the right strategy!Oh, did I mention that not only do you have to keep an eye on Foxy in case he'll bang on your door, that you ALSO have to keep an eye on Freddy on the show stage?That's right! Call now and we'll put 'Freddy's screwing machine' into play! All you have to do is not look at him the entire night and you'll find yourself dying faster than you can say; ""OH SH*-But don't worry! As long as you check him constantly, he'll never move from the stage! That is to say that you're fast enough to check Foxy and Freddy within less than a damn second!Oh really?!?!? You beat night 5? Well guess the hell what!? YOU HAVE A SIXTH NIGHT!And you thought that night 5 was bad, this takes night 5 to the EXTREME! Constant dying over and over again if you mess up even once!Don't forget to check the door lights first before closing or opening the doors/camera. Bonnie and Chikc don't like waiting for you as you glance at your camera wondering to yourself: 'Where the hell did they go?'AND BOOM! YOU ARE DEAD JUST LIKE THAT!I'm sure after the 30th try that you'll finally beat it!HOLY DEAR LORD! YOU BEAT NIGHT 6?!?!?!? WELCOME TO THE CLUB!Now you've reached my level of play! I have no more advice to offer except that there is a 7th night! Good luck on your damn journey of DYING MORE THAN 100 FLIPPING TIMES!You beat 20/20/20/20?????!!!!! GOOD FUC*ING JOB! Now you have 3 stars, and a lot of wasted time!But, that's not all! THERE IS A SECOND GAME!Pros -Constant stress - Really brings out the jumpscares.Amazing AI attitude. - 4/20 is impossible without the right strat.Nice Jumpscares - No matter how many times I've seen them, I still jump when they show up!Cons -A bit...repeating. After night three, just do the same strategy from night 4 to night 6 and you can beat that part of the game easily.No extras menu - Not much of a con really. It'd just be nice to have that same option to see all the jumpscares among other things.Anyway, that's all! Shallow tuning out with a 9.7/10!			"

												Ooooooh Five Nights at Freddy's... How do i start? At first, the Game was Scary as HELL! And even now, when i know when they'll jumpscare me (when you watch alot of Let's Plays, and read the Wiki, it's easy to predict when they'll jumpscare you), i'm still scared, 'cause i don't want to lose my progress xDBut, to be honest, i really like this Game, not because it's popular, but rather because it's diffrent from the other Horror Games. I like the Camera System, and the System with the Doors and Lights. But really, after a while, it's not scary anymore. You are just a bit stressed, because you want to go trough the Night, you don't want to die when it's 5AM, am i right? (Happend way to often...)Well, i don't think this game is for everyone, and it might be overhyped, but for me, it has good Gameplay, Graphics are good too, and it helped me get a bit away from my fear of Jumpscares! (But... It didn't really help a lot xD) "

The Pizzaria's reputation is bad due to the murder of five childern and ""The Bite Of '87"" thus the Pizzaria is going bankrupt. Your job on the other hand is simple, work from 12AM to 6AM every night while avoid dying from the Animatronics (Endoskeletons) ""Bonnie the Bunny"", ""Chica the Chicken"", ""Foxy the Pirate"", and ""Freddy Fazbear"" Himself. [LET'S RECAP] Main Protagonist: Mike Schmidt. Main Antagonist: Freddy Fazbear. On your First Night, another watchman will call you to tell you about your job, the only thing you have to work with are, a Tablet, Metal Security Doors, and Door Lights. The Tablet shows your camera feed, the doors lock anything from coming in to your room, and the door lights light the area outside your door. Because of Buget cuts, your limited to a certen amout of power each night (starting with 99%) anything you do runs down the power so the player needs to limit on what he or she does with it. doing very little things will keep your power from running down fast, having too much stuff active will run the power down fast. There's more i can say but if you have no idea how the game works then ill let you figure that out (im pertty shure there's grammer issus with this review) -The Most Valuable Thing In The World: Infomation			"

												Five Nights at Freddy's is an indie psychological horror game. It is full of strategy, power management, and jumpscares. Lots of jumpscares... At first glance, Five Nights at Freddy's looks pretty silly and not frightening what so ever. I assure you, this isn't true. As I said, it is a psychological horror game. There is a lot of suspense, causing a lot of tension. You'll sit there for a few minutes without a single thing happening, then suddenly one of the animatronics are gone and you begin in panic as you look for it. You have to be very quick, as you don't have much time to react. And in some cases, if you make one mistake then its all over.The storyline for Five Nights at Freddy's is very intresting, as it isn't all given directly to you. You only get pieces of the storyline, and you have to make observations in the map to learn more. For example, you'll see newspapers and such hanging on the walls that go more in depth and show the story behind the place. The story is pretty dark, and is quite sad if you think about it.I would definitely reccomend Five nights at Freddy's to anyone who likes puzzle or strategy games while being able to enjoy a bit of jumpscares.Thanks for reading.

												My first night really creeped me out since I did not know what to expect. The map is set up in a way that makes you feel surrounded and paranoid that one of the animatronics will come through one of your doors. After the third night the game becomes less scary and more strategic, I really like this about the game. The fact that it is a horror game that requires you to know what you're doing to get past all the nights.			"

												Ah yes, Five Nights at Freddy's...The imagry in this game as well as the concept and idea's that truly are scary. though what makes this game truley great is the atmosphere. it's scary, freaky, unsettling and brings the nervousness into play.The game adapts to your playing style and will only kill you if you screw up by not noticing the tells of the animatronics, thus keeping you on your toes.My playing style was so erratic where the game was unable to properly mess with me like it did Markiplier and SomeOrdinaryGamers, so I had only gotten killed once in the game the entire time and that one time was due to how I forgot to check the doorlights which caused Chica to sneak into the security station and scream in my face.This game has some great atmosphere to it which actually made my skin crawl, I got very nervous on the first night due to Foxy surprisingly popping his head out at me with that contemplative look on his face on if he should charge me or not... that's when you KNOW some bad♥♥♥♥♥♥is about to go down when you see a animatronic pirate fox peeping out at you and thinking to himself, ""Swiggity Swooty, Imma commin fer dat booty~""This game is a definite MUST HAVE for ANY horror enthusiast's collection!And now to wait patiently for a demo of Five Nights at Freddy's 2 or the full game to get even MORE terrified than I already am! :D10 killer animatronics out of 10!

												Five Nights at Freddy's is a first person, survival horror, point and click game. You work at Freddy Fazbears pizzeria, a place were the main attraction is Freddy Fazbear and his three friends. They are animatronic robots programmed to please the crowds, but have an unpredictable behavior at night. You are the night security guard, unfortunatly, and have to keep an eye on these animatronics while making sure that they don't get into your office and ""forcefully stuff you into a Freddy Fazbear suit"".The gameplay is simple, you are stuck in your office and have the ability to control the lights and doors to your office. You can also monitor the building through the cameras scattered around. To spice things up a bit, you have a limited amount of power that gets drained everytime you use the lights, doors and cameras, meaning that you have to leave yourself exposed in order to survive. The game also gets progressively more difficult after each night.This game has all the ingredients to make you extremly paranoid, due to the lighting, sound effects and creepy animatronics. The game awards you for remaining calm and using your recourses efficiently, and punishes you if you screw up and start to panic. It's also worth mentioning that the game will occasionally attempt to ruin your concentration by, among other things, flash detailed 3D images of perticular animatronics (notably terrifying).The story is very appealing. Scott Cawthon (the creator of FNAF) left us few clues, notes, messages and easter eggs for us to add up, only to find a creepy story that fits perfectly well into the game's setting.I really enjoyed playing this game at first during the first nights, it was a unique yet terrifying experience that few games has given me. But during the final nights the game was so difficult, it made me use a boring and repetetive strategy called ""rinse and repeat"" in order to complete the final night, which took away my freedom of choice to complete the game ""my way"". I didn't feel like playing the extra nights because it felt like a chore.This points out the biggest flaw and possibly the only flaw this game has, you need both skill and luck to complete the game. It could be a pro that adds to the experience or a con that ruins it.Anyway, this is a superb horror game that i would recommend to anyone who is interested in horror games. I can almost guarantee that you will scream like a little girl at least once while playing this game.10/10 would get stuffed into a Freddy Fazbear suit again.Are you ready for Freddy?			"

This game does not even remotely deserve all the hype that it gets. It's not that good of an idea. It's hardly even a game. Bottom line Do not buy it. Even if you are curious.

												This is a game like no other. Its one of those rare games that will make you so paranoid, that you might just♥♥♥♥♥♥yourself. Or rather for me, smack your hands so hard against the table that you ache for hours. The atmosphere is so dark and dreary, the characters are well designed to terrorize you and the noises will haunt you even after you turn the game off. It’s a well-crafted playable nightmare. And you're going to get F!@#$% alot. So prepare to be scared. For the gameplay, its simple. You are an underpaid guard working at Freddys pizza joint & the animatronics for some reason think you need to be stuffed into a animatronic suit. Stripping off your skin and crushing your bones trying to get you inside one of those things. The game will start you off in a office room. There are two doors with buttons for closing & a security camera to check rooms with. You might be confused at first since you cannot move around, only look, click and check cameras but this is what makes the game so thrilling. There are so many unique mechanics in this and each character does something different and will appear at different doors. This is where strategy comes into play. You need to know what to do & how to prep yourself for each animatronic. This game will keep you engaged and with each night, pose a new threat and a greater challenge for you. And don't forget about all those lovely jumpscares! Even if you die a great # of times, you still get freaked out whenever Bonnie throws his face at you. So terrifying... For me, i honestly don't like getting scared & have never played too many horror games in my life. I tend to enjoy watching other play, but i couldn't stop loving this game, even if i tried. It was well made, i enjoy the characters even tho they want to stuff me into a suit & i want to know more about the background of how & why they are somehow alive! Overall i'd happily play this over & over again. (Tip: Don't try beating all 7 nights in one day, it will ruin your experience. Do this overtime!)10/10! - Must Play!			"

												This is a game like no other. Its one of those rare games that will make you so paranoid, that you might just♥♥♥♥♥♥yourself. Or rather for me, smack your hands so hard against the table that you ache for hours. The atmosphere is so dark and dreary, the characters are well designed to terrorize you and the noises will haunt you even after you turn the game off. It’s a well-crafted playable nightmare. And you're going to get F!@#$% alot. So prepare to be scared. For the gameplay, its simple. You are an underpaid guard working at Freddys pizza joint & the animatronics for some reason think you need to be stuffed into a animatronic suit. Stripping off your skin and crushing your bones trying to get you inside one of those things. The game will start you off in a office room. There are two doors with buttons for closing & a security camera to check rooms with. You might be confused at first since you cannot move around, only look, click and check cameras but this is what makes the game so thrilling. There are so many unique mechanics in this and each character does something different and will appear at different doors. This is where strategy comes into play. You need to know what to do & how to prep yourself for each animatronic. This game will keep you engaged and with each night, pose a new threat and a greater challenge for you. And don't forget about all those lovely jumpscares! Even if you die a great # of times, you still get freaked out whenever Bonnie throws his face at you. So terrifying... For me, i honestly don't like getting scared & have never played too many horror games in my life. I tend to enjoy watching other play, but i couldn't stop loving this game, even if i tried. It was well made, i enjoy the characters even tho they want to stuff me into a suit & i want to know more about the background of how & why they are somehow alive! Overall i'd happily play this over & over again. (Tip: Don't try beating all 7 nights in one day, it will ruin your experience. Do this overtime!)10/10! - Must Play!			"

												This game is both painful to play and absolutely boring to play.In this game, you sit around. Doing jackshit and then a bunny rabbit jumps at you.Your only defence is closing doors.The characters are:This blue rabbit that looks like one of Bill Clintons sex toys.A chicken? Pidgeon? Something like that anyway. It looks like some hybrid of Donald Trump and a penguin.Bill Cosby. Sorry Freddy. A brown thing that likes to sing and play around with little children and jump on them at night.Jimmy Saville, with an eye patch, it tends to hide behind a curtain with a kid until the kid dies and it chases after you.Golden Bill Cosby. Basically Bill Cosby but you can't hear him coming.I rate this game 2/10.Lost virginity in mass orgy of Bill.			"

												This game is one of the best games in my library. of all the horro games there is nothing like this (well the fangames don't really count) I love the fact that they only move when your not looking it make it even more creepy (foxy breaks that fact when he is coming for.) well the thing with the game is ether you like it a lot (like me) or you hate every thing about it like a few others. well if your new to this game you shoudld see more stuff about it on youtube. you will also  see a few nagative reviews saying bad things about the game but i thing you shoud see it for yoursefl and maybe even make your own review. but my piont is i had lots of fun playing this and some times it gets really hard like the later nights. well the game is really good if you want to buy it go ahead or you coud see youtube videos like i did befor i got this awesome game. also don't read alot of the nagative reviews becuase it could give you rong ideas of this game and lots of them are really stupid. also lots of people like foxy but i perfer Freddy Fazbear. oh befor i finish this bewere of Golden Freddy.  gameplay: 9/10plot: 10/10 caraters: 10/10 "

												The game is addictive and fun. If you like strategy and horror games, I recommend you buy this game. Do not buy this if you have epilepsy or if you can't handle the jumpscares. Though, I still don't understand why this game was updated to version 1.131. Hmmmmmm.......Very mysterious........			"

												I am a huge fan of the series I have to say. Five Nights at Freddy's (FNAF for short) is a very popular indie horror game series. The game well know for youtubers (who I refuse to mention) overreacting to the game. The game is full of cheap jumpscares. These jumpscares may make you jump once or twice but not nearly as much as Youtubers made it out to be. It's overrated. The gameplay is simply. Check door lights , check a few rooms , and wait for the night to end. The game makes you a nervis reck though. When you have 6 percent power and an animatronic is wandering right outside your door ready to attack it really puts you on edge. The characters may sit outside your door for hours and it makes you crazy because you keep checking the light when they are not there. You never see the bots move ( except for one character) and are almost like sweeping angels because they only move when your not looking. There is so much that I wanted to say but I don't want to spoil. But you are most likely not going to figure out the story by just playing. But be observent because there are many easter eggs that will hint the story but you're most likely going to have to do some research to figure out the story. The jumpscares will probably were out by night 3. The fear of the unknow does too. And the game seems repetitive sometimes. But it still is a must check out game but it is still pretty overrated. Don't look up gameplay before playing and playthrough the whole game blind. Trust me. The game is different from a lot of horror games. But the game gets hard very fast and the fear goes away fast. Also listen to the phone. Sorry if my grammar is horrible. I struggle with that and I'm pretty lazy :/			"

												Great game for some jumpscares! And for a fun Youtube video!My first playthrough:Apparently I needed a job and wow! An easy job at a kid's pizza fun place!For a kid's pizza fun place, this place is a dump. Why do people come here?Some♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥said that there is nothing to worry about after he said that the animatronics walk around and hinting that they will kill me. The moron says that they are on ""free roam mode."" What kind of bulls*** is that?First night done! They DO walk!Second night, holy sh**!! Bunny is prejudiced against me. It came to the door several times!The same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ from last night called to warn me about a fourth animatronic...no sightings yet.Power went out....6am chimed and I jumped for joy.Third night, screw you Bunny! Ha ha! He tries to get in the most. Foxy? Is that its name? Whatever. It's that fourth the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on the phone warned me about. IT CAME RUNNING!I shut the door in its face. Bunny wouldn't leave. Power went out again. 6am rolled in to save me.Fourth night. Why am I still here? Oh right, the only place that would hire me. That dumb*** on the phone again...THEY GOT HIM!?! WTF!!! Where was he anyways? Well, Freddy and his crew seems a bit more p***ed off more than usual. Foxy became more active. Bunny and...Chica?...they were double teaming me. Power was getting close to 0% and I think Freddy is at a door...HOLY F***EN S**T AHHHHHH!!!!!!!..................He-he-he-he.............Damn it Freddy!Second try starting at 4th night....Getting double teamed again by Chica and Bunny. Bunny is relentless. Hasn't left the door for 5 minutes!I swear Foxy was going to run for me. Freddy is staring right into the camera, he doen't have those bugged out eyes on...Power's dead, I'm screwed. Freddy appeared at the left door, his eyes were lighting up as his song played. I sat still...the desk lights went out, I can't see anything.......6AM BABY!!!5th night.1amFoxy runs like hell, Bunny won't go away half the time, I think Chica wants to eat me, Freddy stares at the camera.3amPower is about dead, Bunny is camping at the door again, Freddy and Chica keep switching places, Foxy is making me paranoid.5amPower dead, Freddy at door doing his flashy eye thing......Completely dark........AHHH!!!

												This game is by far the most scariest game I have ever played. I tell other people to play the game because I get a laugh out of how scared they get. I let my best friend play the game who loves scary games. He kept hitting the escape button because he was getting so scared and jumpy. Hitting the escape button closes the game and I wish I could unbind it but besides that a great game.			"

]What is ""Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria?""  A magical place for kids and grown-ups alike, where fantasy and fun come to life! Literally.  You are a security guard with a night shift at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a place similar to Chuck E. Cheese's. There's 4 animatronics, such as Bonnie Bunny, Chica Chick, Foxy, and of course, Freddy Fazbear. They're nice little friends for children to form their childhood with. Unfortunately, at night, things are a bit different.  These animatronics come alive. Yes, ALIVE. And they're out to... k-k-k-k-kill you! (Reference!)  Trying to conserver power, stay alive, and come out with enough time is not an easy task. Maybe it's not worth the minimum wage they're offering.			"

												No.and now to make this a tad bit more elaborate, this game grows to become more strategic after you are used to the jumpscares, i love this game due to the fact that i have to adapt as new animatronics make their show and screw me over, (f*ck you freddy) the game generally becomes something like this,i need to check on the fox, but the bear is outside my door and will get in if i do look at the fox, what do i do?a) close my right door then proceed to look at the foxb) look at the fox with my right door open, ultimately putting trial and error as the primary tacticc)dont look at the foxincase your wondering the answer is A as not only do i stop the bear from invading, but i also stop the fox from bumrushing me.Enjoy your $4 an hour job, relish it m8			"

												This game is more of a novelty than a full-on survival game. It's something that you should definitely pick up as it's only 5$, and you'll get in a ton of good screams. It's more of a point-and-click type of game, as you won't need to use your keyboard at all to play this one. There's not really any skill involved either, it's more of just getting down the technique of the game and making choices that depend on the location of the wandering animatronic robots. It's almost a puzzle of sorts, but you'll need to make gambles as well. risking your precious power, which is always decreasing. It's definitely a fresh take on the whole horror genre, and will also make for a great Twitch/YouTube game to broadcast. There are definitely richer experiences on the Steam Store for the same modest price of 5$, but this is a game that is very unique and deserves your time.  I really do recommend you try to survive Five Nights at Freddy's, but I can't guarantee you'll make it past the first.Score: B+			"

												Okay, so I've had the same review for Five Nights at Freddy's for a while now, and I wanted to change it as it was getting old in my mind, and it didn't really make sense to me after a while.First of all, let me get this out of the way...Five Nights at Freddy's is a singleplayer game. That means that the community has nothing to do with the content of the game itself. No matter how much you say the community is ""Autistic"", that's not going to alter the game in any way, as the last time I checked, the Fanbase did NOT alter or try to hack into the game to make it crappier.And no, I'm not a FNaF Fanboy. I prefer games like Portal, Garry's Mod and Terraria more. I just find it a bit annoying when people judge a game by its community. Especially when it's singleplayer.Anyways, onto the review. Story Five Nights at Freddy's is a short, fun, indie horror game made by Scott Cawthon that takes place in 'Freddy Fazbears Pizzaria'.  You're the security guard who pulled the short straw and works the nightshift, however. You must survive an entire week in the pizzaria, wiether you need the pay or you're forced to stay. Seems simple, right? Well, not exactly. There are 4 animatronics that are progreammed to entertain the children in the daytime. Well, what about the nightime? There are no children to entertain, so the workers set the animatronics to freeroam at night, so that their servos don't lock up and they won't be broken for the next day. Why the animatronics aren't always set to a freeroaming mode might seem obvious to you, but there's a bigger reason than just ""They're killer robots. They come and try to kill me every single night."" There was an incident placed in the year 1987, at a previous Freddy Fazbears Pizzaria resulting in someone's frontal lobe being bit off by an animatronic, although unknown to the player which one. This incident is simply known as ""The Bite of '87"". Gameplay With the first in the series, your goal is to survive until 6 AM, for a week. You are sitting in an office with entrances on both sides, both of which have a light button and a door button. Your goal is to survive until 6 AM, for a week. Both buttons on either side are toggleable, which is great, as when they're on, they drain your power supply, of which you have a limited amount of. When the power goes out, both the lights and doors deactivate, leaving the doors open and the lights off, which leaves you vulnerable to the several animatronics in the pizzaria, Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy, designed after a bear, bunny, chicken and fox respectively. If you run out of power, as said before, your lights and doors won't work, and Freddy will appear in the left doorway playing a tune that sounds like it's being played out of a music box. Eventually, the tune will end, most likely being cut short, and the very dim light allowing you to still see your desk will darken, leaving you in a pitch-black office. After that, at a random time, Freddy will pop up and kill you, unless you're lucky enough for the time to roll over to 6:00 AM. While the power is still on, Bonnie, Chica and Foxy can attack, and Freddy can still move around and attack, although not in the way he does when the power's out. Bonnie and Chica just generically move around the facility, while Foxy can charge at your door when you either give him too much or too little attention, although that will only delay him. Foxy's charge is inevitable, and will almost always happen at least once on the later nights. Finishing Touches Five Nights at Freddy's is a neat, small game that can be played on most computers (MOST, not all) and can provide a couple hours of something to do. The animatronics aren't programmed in a way that you can just memorize which animatronic attacks when, which is something that can add some replayability, although not much. I will still support this game and reccomend it however.Thank you for taking time out of your day to read my review! I hope that you understand why I recommend it, and if you're one of those people who hate FNaF because of the community, maybe I changed your mind? Although unlikely, it could be possible. Have a good day!			"

												""Five Nights At Freddy's will put you in terror and have nightmares like never before. "" 11/10 - IGNBut let's be serious here, FNAF is one of the most scariest games I have ever played. Oh and believe me when I say I played 100's EVEN 1000's of different horror games. This one really makes your heart race, palms sweat and just overall terrified. When I first saw this game, it didn't look scary to me at all. I thought ""this looks boring....NEXT"" but as I'm glad I contiuned to watch more I realize how truly scary it was. Oh god....when I played it for myself I had nightmares for 2 straight weeks. Now let's talk about the concept of this game. Well, it's unique and very simple. All you do is feel isolated in a room, check the cameras so often, use the lights and doors on either side. That's basically it. You may say ""OH DATS SOUNDS SO BORING UGRH!"" But as you see and hear these creepy animantronics getting closer to you. You have no choice but to wet your pants. But...since the concept is so good, devs are trying to steal Scott's idea. What amazes me is, just pictures put together with a very simple concept can make a game truly terrifiying. FNAF 2 has been greenlit. I'm indeed looking forward to the game. I love the new animantronics. I love the new room that you are now isolated in. I love the brand new mechanic, which is you can put a mask on to fool the old animantronics. But since the new animantronics have better technology, they can see you as a human unlike the old and slighty broken animantronics. But the thing that worries me the most is that FNAF 2 will get boring and won't be scary after about 1 hour like FNAF. I still find FNAF slighty scary but not as scary when I first played it. So if FNAF 2 manages to keep you on the edge of your sit at all times, then we will be wetting more pants.  But I am really looking forward to FNAF 2.  The time when I'm writing this, it's Halloween so HAPPY HALLOWEEN FNAF and all of you guys too. If you did actually read my review, thank you ^^ HAVE A GREAT NIGHT SLEEPING.			"

												This game is more of a novelty than a full-on survival game. It's something that you should definitely pick up as it's only 5$, and you'll get in a ton of good screams. It's more of a point-and-click type of game, as you won't need to use your keyboard at all to play this one. There's not really any skill involved either, it's more of just getting down the technique of the game and making choices that depend on the location of the wandering animatronic robots. It's almost a puzzle of sorts, but you'll need to make gambles as well. risking your precious power, which is always decreasing. It's definitely a fresh take on the whole horror genre, and will also make for a great Twitch/YouTube game to broadcast. There are definitely richer experiences on the Steam Store for the same modest price of 5$, but this is a game that is very unique and deserves your time.  I really do recommend you try to survive Five Nights at Freddy's, but I can't guarantee you'll make it past the first.Score: B+			"

This game is bad.So how about an Egg White Meringue Recipe?Separating Eggs:Cold eggs separate more easily than those at room temperature because the whites hold together better. separating egg yolk and egg whiteTo separate an egg: Crack the egg and hold the shell halves over a bowl. Transfer the yolk back and forth between the halves, letting the white drop into the bowl. Do not cut the yolk (whites containing any yolk will not beat properly). Transfer the yolk to another bowl.The tiniest bit of fat or egg yolk will wreck a meringue, as fat interferes with the formation of good foam. When separating eggs, if a speck of egg yolk falls into the egg whites, lift it out with an empty eggshell half. Do not try to fish it out with your fingers; the oil on your skin will prevent the egg whites from expanding.Avoid letting your fingers touch the areas that will come in contact with the egg whites. That way, you'll avoid leaving oils from your hands on the utensils you just washed.Room Temperature: After separating, bring egg whites to room temperature to ensure volume when beating (as warmer eggs whip faster than cold eggs). Egg whites right out of the refrigerator will not whip well. The ideal temperature to whip a common meringue is room temperature, about 70 degrees F. (21 degrees C.). Usually 30 minutes is adequate to obtain room temperature.A beaten egg white can foam to 6 to 8 times its original volume if the egg whites have been at room temperature for 30 minutes before beating.Bowls and Utensils:Copper, stainless-steel, or glass bowls work best for making meringues. Avoid using plastic bowls for whipping egg whites as they can often harbor traces of grease or fat, which prevents the whites from getting stiff. Whichever type of bowl you use, be sure it is spotlessly clean. Make sure that all your utensils are immaculately clean, completely grease-free, and completely dry. Meringues are very sensitive and they don't like any moisture.Place the egg whites into a large, tall bowl and set your mixer to medium-high speed. NOTE: I would not hand beat a meringues (too much work). Beating or whisking causes the protein in the egg whites to unfold, forming films that trap the air bubbles, and the sugar stiffens the foam. As the mixing time increases, the bubbles become smaller and more numerous; this increases the volume and makes a more-stable structure.Adding Sugar:Do not add sugar before whipping the egg whites. Adding sugar at the beginning can double the time you have to whip the egg whites to get a foam. Add the sugar at the very end when the whites have formed soft peaks.I like to use superfine sugar when making meringue because it dissolves faster than table sugar. When beating egg whites and the recipe calls for sugar, Gradually add the sugar, a few spoonfuls at a time and beating the whole time.As a general rule, add a total of 1/4 cup of granulated or superfine sugar for each egg white. Do not make meringues that have less than 2 tablespoons of sugar per egg white. If you use any less, the foam will not set and the meringue will shrink. To tell if the sugar is dissolved when you are beating egg whites for meringues, rub a bit of the foam between your fingers. If it feels gritty, the sugar is not dissolved, so keep beating for a few minutes. It should feel completely smooth when the sugar is dissolved.By varying the amount of sugar in the final mix, you control how hard or soft the final meringue will be:For soft peaks - Place egg whites in a clean glass or metal bowl (not plastic), and beat with an electric mixer on medium speed or with a rotary beater until egg whites form peaks with tips that curl over when the beaters are lifted. For stiff peaks, continue beating egg whites on high speed until they form peaks with tips that stand straight when the beaters are lifted.For stiff peaks - Continue beating egg whites on high speed until they form peaks with tips that stand straight when the beaters are lifted. Once you start a making whipped egg whites, continue it straight through and finish it off. Do not stop halfway to take a break. The meringue is done when it is not runny and when you can hold a spoonful of it upside down and none of it drops off. Also when you swirl a spoon through it and the swirls hold their shape indefinitely. Using Meringue:Make the meringue first - then prepare the filling (such as pie filling).Place meringue on the piping-hot filling to begin cooking the bottom of the meringue. The residual heat carried by the filling cooks the base of the meringue ever so slightly, making it less prone to leaking or shrinking. Make sure the meringue completely covers the hot filling right up to the edge of the crust. This helps the bottom of the meringue cook and stick to the filling so it will not slide off the when it is cut. Use a small spoon or spatula to make high peaks and decorative swirls in the meringue before baking.Baking Meringue:Meringues will become more done if you bake them at a lower temperature for a longer time. Bake the meringue at 325 degrees F. for 20 to 30 minutes or until a cooking thermometer registers 160 degrees F. Remember a hot filling is importantCutting Meringue:To cut baked meringue into serving pieces, use a knife dipped in cold water.Enjoy your delicious Meringue :) "

												This game became wildly popular recently, and I liked the visuals of it, so I got into it pretty fast - and I watched a LOT of videos of people playing it. The gameplay is pretty simple, but deceivingly so - I had to have watched at least ten different playthroughs of this game, and I thought I would be completely unphased once I started playing.This is not the case, however. This game is about managing resources, surveying your surroundings while trying to defend yourself, constantly being on the defensive, all while the forces of RNG, programmed AI, and straight up paranoia cause this to be a much more daunting task than one would expect.This game contains jumpscares, but honestly those aren't the scary part (and for those who have seen videos of this game, for some reason people turn the sound up to ridiculous levels... you can turn it to a reasonable level and the jumpscares aren't so dang loud.) I like them when they happen, because they're pretty well done and only occur when you've failed, but the really scary thing about this game is sitting, waiting, panicking while trying not to run out of electricity, and hearing something moving around, which could be any number of things, all of which might be close enough to kill you within seconds.I like being terrified by horror games, and this one definitely gets to me, and I love it. I think playing this game is legitimately the first time I've ever been happy to be nauseous from how panicked I got.(I also love the designs of the animatronics, they're fun to draw, but that's not exactly relevant to a video game review.)

												No.and now to make this a tad bit more elaborate, this game grows to become more strategic after you are used to the jumpscares, i love this game due to the fact that i have to adapt as new animatronics make their show and screw me over, (f*ck you freddy) the game generally becomes something like this,i need to check on the fox, but the bear is outside my door and will get in if i do look at the fox, what do i do?a) close my right door then proceed to look at the foxb) look at the fox with my right door open, ultimately putting trial and error as the primary tacticc)dont look at the foxincase your wondering the answer is A as not only do i stop the bear from invading, but i also stop the fox from bumrushing me.Enjoy your $4 an hour job, relish it m8			"

												Not that scary until you get past night 3, and even after that the game just runs off of jumpscares... But I would still consider this a good game.			"

												This game is really good because i like how its different from all the other horror games, In all the horror games they make you scared because they make your do stuff you dont want to do but in this game you let the monsters get to you nad the high pitch sound is really surprising. But 1 thing, if you play this game for long you kinda know when they are in your office ready for the jumpscare. The hidden lore if really cool aswell like the bite of 87 or the 5 missing children and the changing posters. I recommend this game for someone who wants something different in horror games and likes hidden lore that YOU have to find out			"

]What is ""Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria?""  A magical place for kids and grown-ups alike, where fantasy and fun come to life! Literally.  You are a security guard with a night shift at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a place similar to Chuck E. Cheese's. There's 4 animatronics, such as Bonnie Bunny, Chica Chick, Foxy, and of course, Freddy Fazbear. They're nice little friends for children to form their childhood with. Unfortunately, at night, things are a bit different.  These animatronics come alive. Yes, ALIVE. And they're out to... k-k-k-k-kill you! (Reference!)  Trying to conserver power, stay alive, and come out with enough time is not an easy task. Maybe it's not worth the minimum wage they're offering.			"

												This game is by far the most scariest game I have ever played. I tell other people to play the game because I get a laugh out of how scared they get. I let my best friend play the game who loves scary games. He kept hitting the escape button because he was getting so scared and jumpy. Hitting the escape button closes the game and I wish I could unbind it but besides that a great game.			"
