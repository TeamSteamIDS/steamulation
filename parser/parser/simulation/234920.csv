												Okay the main thing I think people need to know when they buy this game is that your experience will be comprised of a LOT of SHORT but very, very different play-throughs. I didn't know that, so when I played it the first time and I finished it in 15 minutes I was like ""wow is that really it?"", but then I did it again and got a wildly vastly INCREDIBLY different game experience. So like, it may seem really short and almost bland at first, but that's only because you'll play through the whole game three times in one sitting and every game will be.... an entirely different game.Great for casual gaming! Laid back. Not a lot of fighting, just a lot of decision-making.			"

												For CYOA lovers who loved reading every possibility. The games graphical style and aesthic is its strongest asset, and there's some good elements of story telling here. But some of the CYOA elements don't work well with the main story, and character shifts will be off putting. Not a lot of gameplay, but that's not the game you would be buying if you picked it up.+:-Art style and different locations play off fabulously.-Branching paths, a lot of different story elements-The ability to rewind a day to try something new-Some likeable characters, and good dialgoue between the two.-:-Inconsistencies with story telling, in particular, with character trials and reacting reasonably to a situation given what they've gone through-Rapid character changes at times don't make any sense.-A lot of guesswork, think Maniac Mansion/Sam and Max type of logic at time.-Lack of interaction, even for a CYOA there's little stuff you're actually doing. In the end, a game to consider in terms of CYOA fans out there, but maybe to pick up on the cheap for those who don't need the experience right away.For some more first impressions and gameplay footage:

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Dyscourse Original Release: 2015 Genre Tags: Choose-Your-Adventure; Casual; Simulation; Quirky My Overall Grade: B+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 4-12 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Casual gamers  I received an activation key of this game from a press kit for the purposes of writing a review.  This did not affect my opinion; I will only recommend games that I like. If I do not like a game, I will not recommend it. Period. View my mission statement.REVIEWDyscourse is a choose-your-adventure style story told through the medium of a video game (as opposed to the traditional method of a book).  And that is exactly how it plays.  The story is good, but not great; the true identity of the game centers around its quirky nature.Technically: it is an “adventure game.”  But it doesn’t really have the typical features of an adventure game.  There is no inventory, and there are really no puzzles or minigames to be solved.  The game truly boils down to a quirky narrative, where you make choices via dialogue that then have consequences on the ultimate path of the story. The depth of gameplay consists of exploring different choices and seeing how they pan out; doing so will allow you unlock all the “stamps,” (read: in-game achievements).  There are various branching-points to the narrative that can be explored; but ultimately nothing drastically different really happens.  The game has a “day-rewind” feature which can be used to rewind the story to certain points and then explore different choices— without having to start the game over entirely.  Nevertheless, you will probably need to restart the story entirely a few times if you want to really see all the different paths and unlock all the achievements.  The feature works well with the quirky nature of the game.  Having said that, I still personally would have rather seen a handful of save slots where you can make your own “rewind” points, rather than being at the mercy of the game’s; but the “day-rewind” feature does help contribute to the overall identity of Dyscourse.The peculiar art style, the catchy music, the mumble-language voice acting, the silly dialogue, and the eccentric characters all mesh together and contribute to the quirkiness at the heart of the game.  It is these qualities that make the game enjoyable.  The actual story is pretty bland and played out; but that potential sour point is definitely bailed out by the entertaining style in which it is told.  The idiosyncratic characters and their interesting backstories also contribute positively to the overall experience. I would say Dyscourse would mostly appeal to someone who enjoys choose-your-adventure narratives and who will enjoy a quirky experience centered almost entirely around storytelling.  There aren’t really any puzzles to solve, and there isn’t really any thinking required.  If that sounds like your kind of thing: check out Dyscourse.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												It's cliche, but if you know Choose Your Own Adventure, you know this style of game.  Done well, it can be really engaging, and provide a lot of replay value in going back and finding different outcomes.Unfortunately, this one didn't really resonate with me.  On a mechanical level, the game is fine, with frequent decisions (some timed) that appear to have a substantial impact on the narrative.  It's the narrative itself I take issue with -- the characterization is very one-dimensional, with each character serving as a simple stereotype.  A bit of personality shorthand is fine for a short game, but these characters are mere caricatures, where every single line is a repeat of their one overriding personality trait.  It makes the game farcical, which removes a lot of (well, all of) the weight from the decisions; when someone gets hurt or killed, it's difficult to sympathize when everything they've said to that point has been the same exaggerated characteristic over and over again.  Couple this with humor that borders on slapstick and emotional responses that seem sociopathic and it's hard to take seriously.To me, for a game like this to work, the decisions have to be something I care about -- the tension comes from wanting to make the correct decision.  Unfortunately, the relative silliness on display here in combination with the flat characters means that ten minutes in the decisions start feeling fairly arbitrary as I click through for my ending.

												Dyscourse is my newest favorite choose-your-own adventure game. I thoroughly enjoyed combing through each path to unlock the variations of each possible ending. I found myself often looking back in time at least 2 or 3 times per playthrough to find out what went wrong. With that said, a lot can go wrong (and that's a good thing). Small details matter in this game especially if you want to aim for 100% of the achievements. I also want to note that the art style is very easy on the eyes. The characters dialogue is also well-written. Personally, Steve was my favorite out of the group with his bleak outlook on life and his trusty stapler.If you want something to compare it to, I'd say it is like a slightly longer and more evolved 'Monster Loves You'. I definitely recommend this game for those who enjoy adventure games. Even if you don't normally play adventure games, this is actually a good starting point for the genre.			"

												A short choose-your-own-adventure type game with a interesting art style.  Pros:Art direction and graphics are good for what they areStory is decent - new aspects found after more playthroughsCons:Very shortNo strong desire to complete multiple playthroughs to see different outcomesSome story arcs don't make the most sense and seem contrived.  Possible spoiler: Poisonous gas magically formed in a cave with previous life in it and killed part of my party?  WTF?Overall:  The game is too short and simple to be worth the $14.99 asking price.  The price for the deluxe edition would be crazy.  Pick it up if it's half price or less.  Otherwise, watch a let's play on youtube and you'll quickly see more money would be a waste.Grade: C-			"

This game was reviewed using a code sent by the developer.Dyscourse is an interactive choose your own story. Literally every single choice you make in this game has a consequence, and most of the time, it ends up being a horrific consequence. The main character is a art college graduate, who now works in a coffee shop. You were in a plane crash while traveling to an art event, and you meet five other stranded survivors along the way. The game play is very point and click adventure, only that you can roam around each scene without being restricted to just clicking on interactive objects. This gives you the opportunity to explore this beautifully crafted stylized world that has been created. Talking with the other survivors broadens your knowledge of the crash and their circumstances, you will form your own personal opinions about them, and your feelings towards them will change as you play through the story. I wasn't kidding about every choice making a difference in this game, selecting a different choice will result in your ending being different to everyone else's. Some of the responses are timed forcing you to make an instinct decision while others you have the time to ponder your choice. There is no real difficulty to be seen in Dyscourse, you will finish the game eventually, it's more about playing the game for the store behind it - and it's not just about finishing the game, there are tons of different endings, different story plots to be found in this game. You can play it ten times and still have a completely different story and ending each time. I have only finished one playthrough at the time of writing this review. One run through the story takes about one hour, so given that there are at least another nine to experience, you are looking at at least ten hours of unique content.Another technically well made game, zero issues running the game. You can choose to lower the graphical options if you desire, but the game could very well be ran on a potato if you wanted. Now, excuse me while I have another play through this awesome choose your own adventure game!If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												Dyscourse is a really different any intresting game, overall its a solid game but has some flaws. The pros:Its like if 'Lost' had choices that YOU choose (Similar to Life is Strange or The Walking Dead), the artwork and atomsphere is really well done. Every moment in the game I feel nervous and eerie and the amount of outcomes and choices are so hearttearing. The characters a realistic and have their pros and cons, there is no one character that is perfect or evil.. which I love because they're not cliche. For instance one guy is super nice but is always paranoid and it gets annoying, one lady is kind but doesnt make the right choice and it a bit of a critic. The timer when you make choices also adds to the tension and is great, after every choice you instantly feel like you made the wrong one which was perfectly done. The varity of deaths are also really cool and it has an amazing amount of reply value, I want to reply it to get every single outcome. The middle:There is some stuff to say in the middle, the beginning is pretty aburpt and i'm not sure how I feel about it.. it doesnt pull you in the first five minutes of playing and takes awhile. The puzzles are generally simple which is a con and a pro, there was only one puzzle I struggled with and it was unique which was good, so the puzzles are unique but simple. I'm also mixed on the soundtrack, it was good but I feel like if the devs went a little further on the soundtrack it could have improved the game.The cons:I actually dont have a lot of cons, I wish they did voice acting instead of mumbling and exploring your area can be fustrating sometimes because the controls can make it awkward to move around. Sometimes the choices confuse me though, for instance I gave food to one lady one day and didnt give her food another day and then she died from starving.Overall: Overall this game is solid, if you enjoy games about choices and point & clicks this is for you.  I'd give it a solid 8/10.			"

												This game is absolutely dreadful, and I really wanted to like it. I tried my hardest. I guess the best way to break down my distaste for it would be to list the Pros and Cons.Pro:Interesting art style: The game looks fairly nice. It won't blow you away with graphics, animations, or character designs... but the art style itself is a change of pace from what one would typically see. Soundtrack: Whatever else I may say about this game won't detract from the fact that it has a pretty stellar soundtrack. I always enjoyed what I was hearing in regards to that.Disky: There is one twist ending that made me kind of chuckle. I'll give that due props. Cons:Terrible Characters: I disliked every single character in this game, passionately. For a strictly story driven game like this, that is a cardinal sin. All of the characters were hyperbolic annoying familiars of one character stereotype or another. And since they all spend the entire campaign b--ching, whining, complaining, fighting with each other, and generally failing at whatever task you delegate to them (though there were some successes in that regard), I found it very hard to find any character that I could truly align myself with. Absence of Gameplay: Its pretty tough to call this game a game, there isn't really anything game-like involved with it. Most of the time you are crawling through dialog, and in those rare moments when you can control a character, you have an extremely limited range of movement within a restricted area, and your actions are only ever temporarily extended beyond doing nothing into picking up a couple of objects. Once you pick up those objects though, you're done ""playing"" anything game-like here. Its back to the story. Which would be fine and all, were it not for the above grievance combined with the below...Absence of Choices: The game bills itself as a Choose Your Own Adventure style game, and I dig that. But for a game whose focus is on story and choices, you don't seem to have a whole lot of decision points. You make a choice here and there and then spend the rest of the time watching everybody react to those choices. Sometimes, the distance between making a decision on something is so large that I forgot what kind of game I was playing for a bit. Its really like an elongated cutscene. When you get to the moments where you make decisions, most of the time they are pretty milquetoast (choose who finds the water, choose who gets to eat, etc). For a game with interest points far and few between, you'd think they would make all the decisions you would have to make be a bit more.... exciting. I went to look at other story driven mobile games just to compare, because I felt I wasn't being fair to Dyscourse with my expectations. I played a story driven game on iOS where every other sentence my character said was a decision point; I had the ability within the game to completely drive the conversation, and as such, the direction of the story. More to the point, even the minor choices I made felt like they carried more weight; they informed my character and allowed me to respond to situations the way I would respond. It may be unfair to compare to Dyscourse, but for a game devoid of any real gameplay and focusing on story and choices, I could have certainly used more. A lot more.Petty Storytelling: There were a number of times in the game where the storytelling just felt.... petty. For instance (Spoiler Alert, I guess...), there was a moment I encountered on a mountain where I had found 3 eggs in a nest off of the cliff. I was able to get two of them, but couldn't get the 3rd. With 3 of us in the party, I had to make a decision: who gets to eat these two eggs? Well, one of the dialog choices presented to you is ""All 3 of us will share the eggs"", which is an easy thing to do with eggs. But then you are told ""No we can't do that, you must choose between 2 of the 3"" for no real reason whatsoever. Its obviously a Sofie's Choice moment, choosing who will live and who will die. The petty part is, I had made great strides getting to this point in the game without any characters dying, and I was literally on the last night before rescue. There was NO reason for anyone to die other than the game just said ""Nope someone's dying lol"". What am I playing this for? This was only 1 of several examples within this game.Dull: All in all, the game is just dull. The story is horrendously generic (plane crash, desert island, etc), and none of the characters to a lick to improve on that. As stated earlier, they are all annoying characters. Add to that, they all speak Simlish. Not normally something I would say is a bad thing, but when you have annoying characters in a dull game talking about dull things (do I really care about George and Jolene's marriage?), the Charlie-Brown-teacher-wompwomp effect only helps to underscore the appropriate level of attention I end up paying to the whole thing. Wompwompwompwompwhatever lets move this along so I can get to the next decision point.Short: Maybe this should be a positive considering my feelings on this game, but for a 15 dollar ""game"" of nothing, being able to complete it in less than an hour seems... borderline criminal. That iOS game I mentioned earlier provided me a much more robust storytelling and decision making experience at the same length, for free (for the first episode, the 2nd costing about 2 bucks, which is still substantially cheaper than this). Why is this game so short? Its not at all worth 15 bucks for the litany of reasons listed above, but even ignoring all that, 15 bucks for less than an hour of playtime is a steep, steep price to pay. Is this an early access game? No no, that's not a good excuse. I've poured countless hours into Darkest Dungeon and other early access titles. I just don't get it. Maybe the lame, rote, predictable, cliched, boring story just doesn't lend itself to a long lifespan of playability. Whatever the case may be, its a quick burn, so be prepared for that.Ending: I don't really want to spoil the ending.... suffice to say that if you like looking at corkboards, you're in for a grand treat.OVERALL: I cannot NOT recommend this ""game"" enough. I am honestly completely baffled and dumbfounded by the positive reviews its been getting. I don't get it at all, not even a little bit. I can usually understand one way or another how popular games I don't like are at least popular with others. For Dyscourse? Its as much a mystery to me as the island itself.			"

												In Dyscourse you've crashed landed on a desert island that is full of dangers. Every choice you make has some repercussion. Be careful in what you do and who you send to do other things, because your fate may ultimately depend on it. You're joined on this quest by a cast of zany survivors with their own quirks that make this a very entertaining story.Dyscourse is a point and click adventure game with a heavy story influence. Everything you do changes the story in some way. Find and discover all of Dyscourses secrets... if you have the stamina to do so.Sound: The music in Dyscourse is pretty appropriate and I actually enjoyed it: the first 3 runs through the story. After that it kinda faded out and I didn't really notice it so much anymore. Didn't get annoying, just tuned it out.Graphics: Honestly, I'm not really a fan of the art style in this game. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, it's just not my particular taste. Though the longer I played it, the more it grew on me. That being said, it's still done well even if I don't really like it myself. However, it does seem as if it could have come from a mobile platform originally.Controls: Simple and easy. Point. Click. Repeat.Gameplay: The gameplay is rather interesting, nothing that is actually difficult. I played many times to see various changes to the story based on what I chose. There are a couple main branches that are interesting to discover. However, the achievement hunting aspect is really kind of annoying. There is no way to fast forward through the text once you've seen it for the umpteenth time. Sure you can click click click, but only as fast as the dialogue boxes complete their animations. So that's kind of frustrating later on. Overall: 7.1/10 - This game was definitely fun and enjoyable at first. There is a lot of replaybility, but probably better to do it on different days, rather than in one massive sitting. My annoyance level rose for the above reason relating to not being able to speed through text you'd seen multiple times before. That being said, the characters are vastly entertaining and amusing, and you'll have a good time. Price wise? A bit overpriced in my opinion. Get a discount and you'll be pretty happy.			"

												Heyyo,So the game's out now and it's even better than the betas. There's some funny choices you can make especially in the later stages of the main campaign heh and it is fun to explore different outcomes. Don't feel stressed and feel like going back to main menu to try and reverse your changes on your first playthrough because once your story comes to an end you unlock ""Day rewind"" so you can just rewind your save to a certain morning and then try different things and see if you can get more of the achievements. Some of them are hilarious like Disktatorship. :P***NOTE! I don't know why my review doesn't say ""Early Access"" but it is since the game isn't out yet***Heyyo, a really neat game by Owlchemy Labs. So far I enjoyed the limited early access... waiting to see what the future holds for this one.To extend my review? It's essentially a game of choices. You make a choice and your group either benefits or dies... It's very much like an adventure game kind of like Walking Dead by Telltale games, where forgetting something important or favoring one action over another will have consequences. It's so far very short but very promising.Right away you'll notice one of the things that sticks out about Dyscourse is the art style. I saw that on the Kickstarter campaign and was definitely interested. If you wanna learn more about Dyscourse? Maybe check out the Kickstarter page. It'll give you a little more info than what I can cram in here. :Phttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/owlchemylabs/dyscourse-survivors-choose-wiselyOwlchemy labs has made a really neat game in the past that you may or may not know of.. Smuggle Truck... which was banned from iOS devices lol, so they re-released a version with teddy bears called Snuggle Truck. That is a crazy fun little game about speed runs and trying to prevent illegal immigrants or Teddy bears depending on your version from falling out of the back of the truck as you try to race across the American boarder, or into the Zoo if you're playing Snuggle truck. I highly recommend you check out that game too which I also believe is on Steam. :)			"

												Bouncing around among broad thin choices without much rationale for why I'd pick any of them doesn't feel like a very good use of my time.

												8.8/10 - Choose Your Own Adventure Slam Dunk!This is an exceptionally well done choose your own adventure game. Too often, when a Choose Your Own Adventure is short the repeat plays are boring; it’s not the case this time! Each time you go through your choices impact the group’s survival.You play as Rita, a young girl who crashed on the island like a few others. Your choices will determine who lives and who dies!The graphics and character interactions are both different but refreshing and definitely welcome! After finishing the game you unlock the ""rewind"" option which allows you to rewind to any chapter to change your choices. I really love this feature for those who don't want to play through the entire game, but still trigger those alternate endings.Realistically I'd pay $10.

												Nice and short game about surviving on an island after plane crash. That is the whole story or challenge you will have to face. The clue: there is not only one way. When playing the main story, you will be in control of Rita, a survivor of the plane crash. After waking up you meet other survivors. From here on every choice you make will directly or indirectly influence the story. Sometimes your choices will make a survivor as your friend or enemy. Maybe they get killed by your decision.After you played through the story your first time you get the ability to rewind to a certain day. That is really awesome to play with other decisions. Try to rescue other people, try complete different approaches.The graphics are nice, the sound is good too, just gets a bit repetative after playing the story over and over again for all the achievements.The bonus story is funny. Here you play an indie developer on the island, trying to save other (famous) indie developer.			"

												You'll definitely like this game if you like choose your own adventure games, or just adventure games in general. Going through the story once hasn't taken me more than 2 hours, but don't let that make you think this game is small-- it's packed with tons of different paths to take in the storyline, with each path revealing a different part of the story. I found myself replaying to piece together the whole picture, favoring some characters over others to get new information out of them. If you find yourself having trouble committing to a long video game, or forgetting where you are in the game, Dyscourse might be a good match for you, as it was for me.Additionally, the style of the game is beautiful and very quirky, and the colors are a nice balance of saturated and subdued. Very easy to look at for long periods of time if you find yourself playing for hours on end. Music adds a lot to the mood of each scene, and the writing is smart and charming. Pay close attention to what you read! And choose wisely. ;)Overall: Buy this game. Throw your money at it. Play it forever.ALSO: There's a cute cat with fluffy ears in the game. Do it for the cat.

Story and gameplayThe story starts off when a passenger of Dysast Air, Rita Locket, wakes up on a deserted island after a crash landing. She soon comes across the other remaining survivors, and together the group of six must find a way to survive; and hopefully make it off the island.Dyscourse is marketed as an interactive choose-your-own-adventure, and after spending some time with the game, it feels like a fitting description. The most prominent game mechanic is the many choices you're presented with, which you respond to by selecting one of two or more dialogue style options. Of these choices, the most basic ones are selecting a group of people to perform a specific task or choosing your next destination, but there are more and different variations on this concept. One is the action choices, which have a time limit and can be triggered by things like being attacked by wild animals or being trapped by fire. There are also other, less frequent types of choices and a few of them are very puzzle oriented.During the game you get some limited conversation opportunities with the other members of your group. I've talked to and started digging into the stories of some, but so far it feels like I've only scratched the surface. It's apparent that care has gone into fleshing out the backstories of the characters, and I'm curious to learn more about them. It's not straight-forward, as the timing isn't always right for a talk, and you might not even get another chance, as death is always imminent on the island.As you make choices, the game starts branching out. Often as a very direct and noticeable consequence of your choices, but the effects of an early choice can sometimes take a while to unfold and it's not always apparent what causes certain events to take place. During the first few days the main story branches won't branch out far, and you'll go through the same main events. Though when you get to a certain point in the game, there are three main paths you can choose between, which each take the story in very different directions.ImpressionsSomething I really like with the game is the day rewind feature. It is available from the menu when continuing a game and gives you a nice visual representation of the status of your survivors, including their injuries. Using it you can step back through all the days you've survived so far and start over from any of the previous days. Note that doing so will overwrite any progress after the point you choose, but if you feel like you've screwed up your current playthrough, you'll get a chance to attempt to improve the situation. I didn't touch this feature at all on my first run of the game, but I used it several times on my second playthrough and I found that some of the choices you make can have a pretty significant effect on which locations you'll see, how the story unfolds, and ultimately who survives.I have played through the game two times so far and I'm currently on my third playthrough. Getting to the end took me about an hour both times, and the playthroughs were surprisingly different.At the end of each playthrough you're presented with a bulletin board with various clippings related to the members of the group. These vary a bit depending on how the story unfolds, and they act as a nice wrap-up of your playthrough. The most prominent element on this bulletin board is the newspaper frontpage with a headline covering the incident, where you'll see character portraits for each member of the group, with a short text describing their fates.On the technical side, I haven't had any major issues while playing the Linux version of the game, except that on my first session with the game the desktop cursor remained visible in-game. The cursor was also locked to the center of the screen, something that still is an issue while Alt+Tab-ing out of the game. I haven't seen the cursor in-game on subsequent sessions and opening up the Steam overlay unfreezes the cursor on Alt+Tab, so for me these are minor issues. I have reported this as a bug through the handy in-game bug report form.ConclusionAll in all, I'm enjoying the game so far, and though there are some repeated conversations and events, I find that there are still many things to explore. I'm also curious to find a way to escape the island without anyone dying or getting seriously injured; something that has turned out to be pretty challenging so far. The game is not by any means as punishing as the somewhat similiar Gods Will Be Watching though, and should have a much bigger appeal to casual gamers.Note, this is a small rewrite of a review I wrote for GamingOnLinux.com: https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/casual-survival-adventure-dyscourse-is-now-available-our-review-of-the-game.5157 "

												Good game.It's a decisions game, you're in an island with a little group of survivors after a plane crash, for some reason they have chosen you as their leader and well, every decision you make affects the story. It has a lot of posibilities for you to choose. You can have a good time trying to get them all.  Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

												I've already finished my first playthrough and I can't say I did too well. What I can say though is that I'm really liking what I've played so far! It's a fun interactive story and I look forward to seeing how many different ways there are to play all the way through!The only downside I'm seeing so far is it's a fairly short story if you only plan on playing through it once.My second playthrough lasted a bit longer than my first, I guess I made better choices!Post second playthrough thoughts:I'm really enjoying the humor in the game, both the lighter side of it and the darker side. Every choice has a consequence, which is a great feature… especially since in your next playthrough, it may seem like potentially bad choices you made may have been the better! Let's try again!I will post more updates for this review as I play more!			"

												While evidently lacking some of the emotional resonance of, say, the Telltale Walking Dead games, Dyscourse more than makes up for this in sheer lunacy and a genuine feeling of choice-and-consequence to your actions.  Some of the decisions are made carefully, at your leisure, while others are made under frantic, time-pressured circumstances.  A single playthrough is super-quick (under an hour), but it's pretty obvious from my single playthrough thus far that there's oodles of replayability.  I got through my first run with three alive and three dead...well, three humans and a cute lil' kitty cat, so technically that's four out of seven, so ♥♥♥♥ it, think I did pretty well for the first time all things considered!      Genuinely endearing characterisations, kooky graphics, and a fantastic sense of humour which successfully straddles the thin line between the light 'n' frivolous and the dark 'n' just-plain-bleak!  All in all, a very, very smart game. Verdict: 9/10.			"

TLDR: Short overpriced game with different endings, but the variety alone doesn't make up for the seemingly unpredictable consequences of your choices.Yes, the game is quite short and can be done under one hour. And yes, there are a lot of different endings. But does it matter in the end?Let me just say that the first playthrough was a lot of fun. I carefully chose my decision and there were very major consequences for each of them.After the first playthrough? After, you notice how some of your choices have unexpected consequences that no one could predict, which really makes your choices matter less.  One example was tasking one of my companion to do a menial job, and he overreacts and hurts himself. How was I suppose to predict that?Lastly, while there are different paths you can take, the ending depends on your  previous choices and items you found. That wouldn't be a problem, except, remember that part about the unexpected consequences? Basically, it boils down to luck. You make a choice and get an item A, while the opposite choice would you get item B. Then you choose path X or Z. If you take X, you can use item A, if you take Z, you can use item B. But you can't really predict if you're gonna need item A or B, or even what choice will get you which item. It's like choosing left or right, but if you choose left you get mauled by a bear, and if you choose right, a tiger claws your face. Different endings - check.			"

ReviewDyscourse is a short (< 1 hour) interactive choose-your-own-adventure where you must lead a band of plane crash survivors in an effort to brave the unknown and discover a way off the island. The stylish artwork and music will help immerse the player into the struggles of these misfits. Quite a few choices are presented throughout the experience that change how you will ultimately leave the island, and who you will leave the island with (if any even survive). Some of these choices are time-sensitive and yield extreme or abrupt consequences; however, this adds to the replayability greatly.Unlike VNs, there are no save states, preventing the ability to observe the consequences and redo an impactful choice; however, upon achieving your first ending, you will be presented with the ability to perform a Day Rewind which essentially serves that purpose. There are 3 major endings to discover and death triggers to learn in order to keep your crew alive. The most noble or selfless choice is not always the best one.A couple random observations I wanted to take note of:  The game utilizes stereophonic sound (easily observed using headphones): the music emulates a 3d environment using multiple audio channels. Although this adventure will take you through multiple environments commonly seen on an island, at any point in time, the screen can seem a little restricting/claustrophobic.  The developers seemingly credited every single KIckstarter backer in the ending credits (so much text). Everything about the game is really well polished and smooth. VerdictAlthough there isn't as much depth as many other choice-based adventures, Dyscourse manages to create a lot of interest into the fates of these characters while moving at a fast pace.

												Dyscourse is a pretty cool game where you make decisions and carry your character and influence what other will do. Every decision affects what will happen. Many things are possible, one run is pretty short (1 hour for the first, and half an hour when you're used to it). What's fun about the game is trying to find some combinations, clues, and learn the story of every character. Of course there are 31 achievments for the lovers, some of them are pretty tricky to get.			"

												Day 1: You think you'd be playing a survival game.Day 2: You have beaten the game for the first time (after an hour, tops).Day 3: You realize that survival simply falls into your hands. Gameplay is reduced to a minimum - in reality, Dyscourse is a Telltale adventure light, or a visual novel with the ability to walk around if only to glue it all together instead of adding any meaningful mechanics this way.Day 4: So, since gameplay takes a backseat in this game, you'd want to play it for the story, right? Too bad you have already beaten it once, with the general setup of the (usually) 10 days you spend on the island staying the same throughout each playthrough. Oh well, there are still locations and major plot parts to discover. So you stick with it a bit more.Day 5: Plodding through the same lines of dialogue repeatedly becomes a chore, so only the prospect of achievements keep you motivated. However, all of them are hidden without ANY hints given. In addition, they are highly inconsistent. For example you get an achievement for losing an arm to the cold or to a jaguar, so you'd think losing an arm to a shark would reward you with an achievement, right? Unfortunately not. Your survival is made up of a pretty large number of decisions, both small and big, and they lead to all kinds of different outcomes. Some of these have seemingly randomly been chosen to trigger achievements, while others haven't. There is no rhyme or rhythm to this, so you either try out EVERY single possible path to take or resort to a walkthrough, thus killing any sense of exploration a deserted island could possibly hold.Day 6: You decide to hunt down all the achievements with the help of a guide and yet you still manage to get annoyed by Dyscourse and start cursing at the screen. Text takes far too long to skip. Minor decisions can suddenly (and days later) block you from unlocking an achievement. You can only rewind time by entire days, which is far too wide a timeframe especially in the early days. Big decisions are often made at the end of a day, which is painstakingly bad game design in combination with my previous sentence. Another example for bad design? When making a decision you are often asked again whether you stand by that decision just seconds after, but the order of your options is switched. So for example you are asked if you want to ""A: rescue X"" or ""B: Secure the food"". Right after, you are asked again, but this time ""A"" will let you secure the food and B lets you rescue X. This game just doesn't value your time. You keep trudging through the same lines of dialogue again and again with minor variations you simply don't care about anymore.Day 7: You die of dysentery.Dyscourse isn't all bad. Visually and acoustically it's pretty nice and I certainly enjoyed some of the dialogue, but fans of survival games won't find anything to like here and fans of story-driven games are also bound to be disappointed.

												This is a really great choose your own adventure.  The issue with a lot of games with choice is that the flowchart of choice comes down to a diamond: opens in the middle but comes down to one simple ending with some variation.  Dyscourse, however, is a very open game with some surprising outcomes.  You could think you're doing the right thing, then suddenly your choice backfires on you and everything falls apart.  A really, really fun and open game with an amazing art style.			"

												What makes Dyscourse good, is its story. The fine detail of each action affecting the next chapter of the story. Discovering more about the characters or maybe even new decisions. A story that you will decide from beginning to end. Developer Owlchemy Labs puts the lives of adorable survivors in your hands. Don't let the graphics fool you though. Jaguars, natural disaster and the very elements are out to kill you. You will lose some battles and win others. The true enjoyment comes in the replay value of Dyscourse though. Instead of turning left, find out what happened if you would've turned right. Maybe things would've of been better or worse. With great dialogue, quick playtime and adorable artstyle. Dyscourse is a fantastic choose your own adventure style game. Oh and lets not forget the coming soon, Indie Island!! Can you survive?I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

												Dyscourse is an adventure game where you have to make a choice for every single decision. You find yourself on an island after a plane crash with some other passengers. It's up to you to figure out how to survive and get rescued while trying to keep everyone alive and happy! The game is interesting in that every decision creates an action and therefore creates a reaction and it's fun to see how that unfolds throughout the game.There are numerous endings and choices, but the game becomes extremely repetitive in order to see everything because you are not allowed to skip action-scenes or bypass large chunks of dialog so you find yourself sitting there seeing the same dialogue over and over. The game is fun for the first couple playthroughs but after that it becomes very boring (even using the rewind feature by picking the game up from any played day and not from Day 1 again).			"

												Dyscourse is a fun little roguelike-adventure game. It's arguably a little short and insubstantial, but it's fun while it lasts, the story is nice, the characters are memorable, and there's definitely some replayability. To its detriment, however, sometimes the consequences of your choices seem slightly arbitrary, with choices rewarded or punished when you had no evidence on which to evaluate the options. Still, I had fun playing it, so still recommended.

												I backed Dyscourse and have been eagerly awaiting its release for over 2 years, and it does not disappoint; I played and beat it like 4 or 5 times in the week since it came out. Be forewarned that It's a VERY short game -- each playthrough took me about an hour on average? -- but that's not where its appeal lies. Its appeal is its endless replayability, and seeing what different results you can bring about. This is for people who love choose-your-own-adventure books, and perhaps wanted to see more branching/diverging endings from Telltale Games, or every game with the illusion of choice. Things do change drastically depending on what you do, and I'm still not even sure if I'll ever be able to get off the island with everyone alive. After playing it through enough times, you start to learn what the consequences of each action is, but there's enough variety that I'm still delighted so far.There is hardly any gameplay. But if you like making decisions that affect story; funny dialogue; a unique art style; and getting too attached to your survivors as they perish, then you should play this game. There's a few emotional moments, too, as you learn about the other characters: if you speak to them enough and spend enough time with them, you slowly unravel details about their backstories. I still don't really have all of it, despite having played it so many times. More, more.			"

												This is what we need more of! Essentially a 'choose your own adventure' game, sure, but it's witty, stylish, and focused - short repeatable story with a ridiculous number of branches in it. Like something out of Lost, you wake up on an deserted island after a plan crash, and have to find other survivors, supplies, and eventually escape.The beauty of it is repeated plays - each playthrough is short, but the story stands up to multiple journies, and has a genius 'rewind' option at the end of the game where you can rewind to a particular day in your last playthrough to see 'what if' you'd done it differently.Smart graphics, smart presentation, smart story!

												A very short game (about an hour) that banks on you wanting to replay it many times in an attempt to rescue more people than before. Unfortunately, it gets so bogged down in the dialog and the ten thousand times you seem to have to hit the ""more dialog"" button that after getting rescued an hour into playing, I had absolutely no interest in revisiting the game. A clever idea with a nice art design that suffers a lot from the tedium of its mechanics.			"

 Dyscourse  This is an interactive game based on our choices.We play as Rita, which is one of the survivors of the plane crash. Together with other survivors, our objective will be to survive and escape from a deserted island. The game has the main storyline but also additional campaign ""Indie Island"". The history of the main character will be based on our choices so you can get different endings. I highly recommended this game, it may not be the title of AAA but the game has an interesting graphics, good soundtrack and nice story but the biggest downside is that the game is not too long and there is no voice acting.

												Dyscourse is a bit unusual as a ""decisions matter"" style of adventure game because the unofficial tagline should be ""MAKE ALL THE DECISIONS!!!"".You awake from a plane wreck on a remote island and quickly come across a group of survivors. You need to choose ""wisely"" to help the group survive, but once you complete the game you gain access to a day rewind option which will allow you to attempt pushing the story down different branches until you are literally pushing other survivors down branches just to see if they will fall and die because why not? This really is the main point of the game, and it's fun for a while but I got to a point where I was satisfied that I'd seen everything I wanted to see. According to the achievements list I've only seen 41% of all possible story events, but it just seems like it would be punishing to attempt to unlock every minor event. I'd rather put Dyscourse down while I still feel like it was a refreshingly unique game rather than grind my way through every possible arc just so that I can say I saw it all.6 out of 10, it wasn't a total plane wreck ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)			"

												A narrative game with cool stylized art, Dyscourse's tagline advises you to Choose Wisely - but really all you can do is Choose Randomly. In most situations, you're not given enough information to make a real choice, so you can only pick whichever sounds good at that moment. Being punished or rewarded for a 'choice' of this nature feels arbitrary and unfulfilling. Where Dyscourse shines is when your choices are effectively a puzzle to be solved. Unfortunately, you'll see a nonchoice like ""go left into the unknown...or go right into the unknown??!"" far more often.			"

												I knew that Dyscourse was a choose-your-own adventure game where the choices you make actually matter, but until I played it and watched others play it, I had no idea what that truly meant. Another person in the same scenario as yourself may still have different outcomes depending on timing, which is a result of the individual decisions they have made in their game. Dyscourse is a game that you MUST experience for yourself. Good storytelling in a game is 100% necessary for me, and I kept asking myself, ""What's going to happen next?"" and even when I was finished with my run, I wanted to know MORE, such as the details of a character's back story that I hadn't gotten to know due to their unfortunate... well, no spoilers.The art style and colors are masterful, and the original soundtrack is beautiful. It looks and sometimes seems cartoony, but you WILL find yourself wrapped up in the plight of these characters in mere minutes. Give it a try!			"

Oceanic Flight 815Do you remember the TV show “LOST”?It revolved around a group of passengers from a doomed Flight which went down somewhere between Australia and Los Angeles.Climbing from the wreckage the rag-tag survivors found themselves stranded on a beautiful and terrifying island with mysteries and supernatural encounters lurking around every corner.Like a lot of people I watched that show every week without a clue as to what was going on, there were polar bears, bunkers and even a black-smoke monster, it was great!Part sci-fi, part survival and part supernatural, If you’ve never seen the show, think Bear Grylls meets the X-Files and you’re part way there.It wasn’t just the otherworldly mystery of the Island which made the show riveting either, the disparate mix of characters forced together; each with their own unique personalities and wildly different take on events formed the backbone of the series.There was Hurley with his “cursed” numbers and Locke with his “blessed” legs.Sawyer was a conman, Sayid was a torturer and Kate was  a murderer.Every character had a past and a part to play on the island, but why am I reminiscing about LOST whilst I should be reviewing Dyscourse?Well, Dyscourse is set on a remote island, it starts just after a plane crash and it revolves around a group of very different characters as they struggle to survive the island and await rescue.Sounds familiar doesn’t it?Bossy BaristaDyscourse places you in control of Rita, professional coffee maker and amateur plane crash survivor.She  also seems to have the uncanny ability to convince total strangers to do what she tells them, which is handy as she quickly sets about fulfilling her unspoken Jack Sheppard  fantasies by taking charge of the group of stranded survivors  and bossing them around with varying degrees of success.Dyscourse or Dat CourseYou see, with Dyscourse, events almost never turn out the way you expect them too.The very first decision you're faced with in the game involves two other survivors, some ""evil crabs"" and (If  you found it in the wreckage) a frying pan.Which survivor you try to save from the perilous pincers and how you go about your daring rescue is up to you.If you're armed with the frying pan you have the option of trying to squish the salty nippers into crab pâté, alternatively you could try shouting and waiving your arms around in a fierce display of anti-crab sentiment.Whoever you try to save and whatever method you choose is going to change how events unfold.You 're decisions genuinely matter here, every choice you make will push the story in a new direction and the story you forge for yourself is what Dyscourse is all about.Fireside DyscussionsThe game itself plays as a pretty simple point and click adventure,  most days begin and end with your band of survivors gathering in your camp to complain about how awful everything is and squabble about  what  the group should do next.It's these conversations that form the backbone of Dyscourse as you listen to the bickering castaways and decide who to agree with and who, inevitably, to ♥♥♥♥ off.Your input will influence the upcoming events in both obvious and subtle ways, assigning tasks and choosing which errands to help out with yourself can lead to some pretty surprising outcomes creating a very entertaining (if somewhat short) story to enjoy.Going the DystanceYou're probably going to get through a single play through of Dyscourse in less than 2 hours, maybe a lot less if you're in a hurry, but don't let that put you off, you will almost certainly play this game again, probably more than once, just to see the vastly different outcomes resulting from your choices.Different survivors will live and die, you'll explore different areas of the island, you'll discover  more about the insanely quirky characters stranded with you, I'd even go so far as to say you'll find your second play through a deeper, more fulfilling experience than your first.Dystinctive VisualsThe graphics are as colourful as the characters and they're perfectly functional in their own stylised way, but they're not going to be to everyone's taste.Whatever you think of the ""zany"" cartoon graphics they undeniably fit the mood and feel of the title.Dysparate CharactersFrom the very beginning Dyscourse feels like your decisions really matter, events can change so dramatically based on your choices that you'll find yourself trying to anticipate what the possible outcomes might be, you'll also grow to like some characters more than others which is likely to affect your decision making process too.Don't go into Dyscourse expecting a great character driven piece of narrative though or you'll be disappointed, this is an indie game, it's not a Bioware title, for the most part the characters are two dimensional stereotypes,  you're not going to lose yourself in empathy with your fellow survivors, but there is enough depth there to pull you in a little, just enough to make you care who lives and who dies, and just like the island in the TV show LOST, there are plenty of opportunities in Dyscourse for your new friends to come to a sticky end.Dysappointing DyscoveryAs I wrote earlier, Lost was a mind boggling show, the continual mystery of the bizarre events on the island kept everyone hooked, you had to keep watching to try and figure out what was going?The sad thing is, it turned out that the writers didn’t know what was going on either; they had no master plan, no outline, and no grand conclusion to tie everything together.They were just making it up as they went along, which was very evident in the shows final episodes.The same can be said of my first play through of Dyscourse,  the unexpected events and offbeat characters kept me hooked, I had no idea where it was going to end and as far as my decision making goes, I was definitely making it up as I went along.Dystilled ExperienceHowever, unlike Lost, which went on for far too long and had a controversial (and arguably disappointing) ending, Dyscourse provides a quick fix of Castaway goodness which never outstays its welcome.

												Dyscourse is a game about surviving on a remote island, with a branch of random people from a plane crash. Sound like the interesting concept? Well, this game has ruined it in many ways...Every character in this game is so annoying! If you really involved in this chaotic situation, then you might expect to find others have a great will to stay alive, or no will to live at all! This game presents you with indecision people who really can't tell whether they want to live or not! If they want to live, why they don't try harder to do things? Or if they think they're doomed, why they still help you out? I think this conflict is the main course that pulls back this game.The characters are also foolish! Let them live without your guidance and they will do nothing! Find water? No. Gather more food? No. Explore area? No. Defense themselves from animals? No. Salvage goods from a crash site? No. Chitchat at camping area? YES!It's like they're not in a plane-crash-on-remote-island situation anymore! Everyone seems to think they're on a vacation! Are you a gamer? Please, go ahead and hallucinated yourself that you're actually in a magic dessert. Working for secret government project? It's ok to think aliens shoot down your plane!These behaviors will develop you, a player, with a perspective toward this game (and maybe toward this kind of situation in a real world): It's OK to be ALONE in order for YOU to stay ALIVE.And when you realize that, you start playing this game heartless style. Want to get some water from a swamp? Send your least favorite guy to explore that area first. Suspicious about a damaged bridge? Let the heaviest guy try it out.The saddest part of this game is when someone falls, you feel no sorrow at all. Instead, you just thought ""thanks god, that's a less weird guy to annoy me"".I think this experience, for a survival simulation game, is very bad. Take a look at XCOM franchise, if someone dies it's mean a big loss that you might need to restart the whole game. Or at lease, you should be tense all the time like when you play This War of Mine.Despite this major issue, you may be aware of:- Art style: Most people like it, but I'm not. Why render everything so rigid and so square? Pentagon frying pan! Square shape airplane body?- Inhuman speaking: Every character has its own voice, or rather a noise, because you can't understand it! That's hardly developing compassion toward them.- Joke: I know you can't stress out all the time, but seriously, at this time you still play those lame joke?- Price: $15 is too much for a very short game. It's true that this game is replayable, but as I said about annoying character design, I hardly find reasons to play it a second time.By all of these, I can not recommend this game to anyone.			"

												The island is alive. It speaks to you through the actions of others, gauging your response, judging your actions. There is no right decision to make, because there is no decision to make at all. Your actions are predetermined and irrefutable, masked by choices you believe you are making independently but which only serve to dissuade you from discovering the truth of your fatalism. Every attempt to change your fate is little more than a divergence onto a different path leading to the same place, one you will either reach or die trying to find, death being your only truly disruptive action along your path to being rescued. But alas, the island refuses to allow you to die. Your companions may perish but you, you must live. Without you there is no story, no allusions to choice, no reason to continue moving forward. So you must begin again, repeating your path, altering what you can, performing your duty as participant in the islands grand performance. This, is Dyscourse, a tale of island survival and the folly of static choice.Dyscourse is, structurally, a choose-your-own-adventure book repurposed as a mildly interactive paper-craft narrative experience. You play as Rita, a disillusioned barista now marooned upon a desert island after a fluke plane crash. Joining you are your fellow survivors, each with a personality large enough to support the interpersonal drama at the center of Dyscourse’s narrative. Whether through the ramblings of a paranoid ex-government conspiracy theorist, or the nihilistic reflections of a middle-aged office worker, Dyscourse excels in playing to the eccentric, reality TV nature of its plot, stirring up tragedy and disagreement among its cast so as to better position you, the default mediator, to make “meaningful narrative decisions”.As a proof of concept, Dyscourse could be considered a success in how it has managed to craft an adventure in which you have some semblance of control over how the story unfolds. Your choices have a clear, dramatic effect on the overall narrative, and altering those decisions in repeated playthroughs can drastically influence the way that particular story unravels. But for all the ways Dyscourse attempts to make you believe that you are in control of, or at least have an active role in its narrative, it inevitably runs up against the same problem inherent to any game in which perceived player choice is privileged above everything else, that being that there can never be any true choice within a fixed environment.Your actions in Dyscourse are only meaningful insofar as they serve to position you upon a predetermined narrative pipeline, each decision effectively serving to open and close different paths until you arrive on one which is so narrow as to remove the possibility of choice altogether. You are never truly making a free choice, only deciding where the story goes, and it always has to go somewhere. Decisions in Dyscourse become more and more binary with each new playthrough as the more you understand about how its model of choice works, the more limiting and arbitrary it becomes. Every choice might have ramifications, but those ramifications are always system driven, decisions devolving into immovable numbers with no room to compromise. There will always be only enough to feed two, always only time enough to save three, always a binary choice between who lives and who dies.One might argue that choose-your-own-adventure books, as a medium onto themselves, were never about choice but only participation. The point wasn’t so much to change the story so much as guide it, as within a finite number of pages there was never any illusion that you, the reader, could actually alter the words upon them. Choose-your-own-adventures then become predominately about seeing the ways the story can change if you follow different paths, how characters shift and plotlines diverge, as if to preemptively answer the “what ifs” of readers and give them a larger understanding of the ways a particular world and the characters within it function in relation to one another.If we apply this way of thinking to Dyscourse its predetermined nature becomes less inherently frustrating, though no less arbitrary. It isn’t unreasonable for Dyscourse to have limits, but how it defines those boundaries often feels intentionally antagonistic for the sake of propelling the player forward. You are unable, for instance, to ever choose not to take action when presented with a choice. Even after building a SOS signal, you can’t merely wait along the coast to potentially be rescued. You instead much follow where the game points you, only getting a say insofar as you can attempt to control who lives and dies. If Dyscourse is wholly about emergent, player driven narratives, it seems odd that so many of the most important decisions within the game force the player’s hand.Games like Telltale’s The Walking Dead or Heavy Rain work as choice driven narratives primarily because they are framed first as interactive stories. Complete control isn’t expected, thus when the limits of your decisions become apparent they don’t serve to discount the impact you’ve had on the narrative as a whole. Dyscourse in comparison is wholly about the ways in which you are actively shaping the story’s progression. Its narrative is entirely in service to its mechanics, with it not mattering so much what your decisions lead to only that you were given a choice in the first place. This prioritizing of player over plot causes every outcome to feel weightless and inevitable. With no reason to care about these characters the narrative is little more than a checklist of variables. Action A produces effect B; characters X and Y survive in one run, character Z another.There is some entertainment to be had in seeing how far you can push Dyscourse’s plot within what little freedom you have to direct it, but the novelty soon wears off when you are given no reason to care what the eventual effect may be. Why should I care if my group is rescued when their survival is merely the predetermined result of each of these actions? Why do I care if I am rescued at all when I have no way to go about doing anything but getting rescued? Dyscourse is a game of choice, but without a compelling reason to find meaning within these binary decisions, I was left with little reason to care about the outcome.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												This is one of those games that needs a 'maybe' rating for the review.It's a good idea. Plane crashes on desert island, you, the sensible person, have to lead a group of idiots to survival over the course of a few days, while waiting for rescue.Simple as that. Works rather well too, in the sense that choices certainly do affect the outcome of the story somewhat. But it is rather simple, and figuring out all the different 'pathways' and variations of those pathways can be a fun thing to do. However, it isn't as in-depth as people make it out to be, you can have a husband and wife be rather blase about one or the other committing murder for example, even when their relationship is absolutely rock bottom, where the expectation is for some actual 'reaction' to happen, to push them over the edge.Where Dyscourse fails is in its characters and the direction the game takes with them. As I mentioned, the idea of the desert island survival story is a sensible one. But the characters are something out of a poor hack's comedy show. There's the husband and wife, who seem relatively normal. The absolute bat-snot insane conspiracy theorist, tin-foil-hat, rage inducing idiot ""Teddy"" who will spout off all sorts of ridiculous rubbish about THE NANOMACHINES! and the ALIENS!!!!!! And omg the sand has ears... Oh shut up, you delusional nutter.There's the 'gamer', and I use that term ever so mockingly because apparently gamers IRL would go out in a thunderstorm and suggest a lightning strike means a Black Mage is nearby. Wut? Dude, get a grip. And then the office jocky, who seems to have an unlimited amount of cigarettes, who mopes like that one friend who tries to find a negative in absolutely everything? ""Good morning!"" ""Nothing good about it, oh woe is me, I wish some rock would casually stone my brains out."" ""Jesus Christ mate, all I said was good morning!"" ""And wooooooooe I am still alive, to listen to your mundane voice, please kill me now!""If you find that sort of thing absolutely, knee slappingly, hilarious, then Dyscourse is right up your alley, a survival game with absolutely ""hilarious"" characters.If, like me, you find that sort of thing absolutely moronic, then Dyscourse is probably not quite the game for you, and it is a shame because the idea is a relatively simple, safe one that really should work no matter what, and yet the developers somehow managed to actually make it almost unbearable to get through. (Additionally, turn the 'voice effects' sounds off, it will save your sanity.)So yeah, get it on sale if you absolutely must. Don't bother if you feel those characters I summed up above are unlikable people, unless you want to buy it just to kill them, which some of you will, so go for it. (Game rating: Mixed.)			"

												I had the chance to try Dyscourse in advance, thanks to the devs, and I loved every minute of it that I've played so far, actually I can't wait play again!. The first thing that I really enjoyed was the art style of the game. AWESOME. I love ""low polys""-ish games ( I don't really have a better way to identify the style ) but this one is even better. it's a feast for the eyes. ( I particularly enjoy the nights. IMHO the graphics really shines there ) The game is extremely humorous. All of the principal characters ( which are 6 ) represent 6 different stereotypes: you have the depressed office worker, the conspiracy theorist, the nerd, the football mom ( she's not a mom, but that's the closest stereotype that I could think of :D ), the cheerful middle aged guy and finally there's the 25 years old protagonist. you will chuckle a lot! Now on the gameplay, You have really the freedom to act like you want. You want to impress the others as a hero? You want to act like an toxic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? You think the only way to survive is to keep the morale up? You can do all these things! I'm close to ending my first run and I'll be honest, I feel like I just scratched the surface. Differently than other story-driven games ( I'm looking at out Telltale ) the choices that you make really change the outcome of the story. You don't get just a couple of different talks where a npc is happier or more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at you. This makes the game EXTREMELY repayable. I can't help but suggest you to buy the game. It's a bit pricey, but the replayabilty value makes it worth in my opinions. It's definately a new and interesting experiment Each run is around 60/90 minutes long (that's what the devs told me), so you can try a lot of stuff out without having to play a ♥♥♥ long story each time!

												One of the few games I played with sound on, loving the amazing voices going on. Play it through completely and you get the rewind ability which means that you can go back to specific days and change crucial decisions, it also more importantly means you can see the depreciation of all the characters as they slowly start to fall apart.Excellent game, although some of the moral choices not everyone in my household agreed with on my pursuit of a perfect game, but definitely worth a few hours of your time. The newspaper articles at the end are quite interesting too depending on who you save and don't save.You also find yourself deliberately leaving certain people into the worst of fates as well, in my case it was poor Teddy, he died a lot for the others...Also Disky is an utter Disktator if you let him be...

												Just letting it be known, I got the game off of ♥♥♥ as a random steam key for 5 bucks. That being said, I would've paid full price for it.  It's a very engaging Choose Your Own Adventure game so if you're in to that kind of game it's definetly worth a buy. I really enjoyed the soundtrack and think that was worth the money alone. It adds to the enviroment and helps immerse you into the game.  While playing my first playthrough I couldn't help but love some characters and hate others.  Some decisions came very easily and others i had to think about for as long as I could.  All in all I think the game is very worth the money and everyone should give it a chance.			"

												Excellent little choose your own adventure style title. The game presents itself as a series of difficult choices. You control the fate of a small group of plane crash survivors, each with their own skills and opinions on the best way to move forward. The art style is excellent, and each character is distinct and interesting in terms of looks and personality. As a sort of de factor leader of the group, you will make decisions about how to proceed that may (and probably will) get people killed. There seems to be a sort of mysterious (possibly fourth wall-breaking) story to it all which will require multiple playthroughs to fully explore.This is a short game, and may not be for everybody. But if you like the idea of watching a character-oriented story in the vague vein of Lost unfold based on your decisions, this is a great game for you.			"

												(Based on a review code I got from the developers.)A visually beautiful game that doesn't take long to finish, but it has almost infinite replay value thanks to the choose-your-own-adventure format and the huge variety of paths your choices can take you. For such a short game (one playthrough takes an hour), its attention to detail and its ability to successfully flesh out six different characters with very different personalities and with only the most rudimentary voice acting (that's nevertheless really fitting to the whole format) is really, really commendable. The only thing that's possibly 'bad' about this game is that the ending feels kind of abrupt and certain sequences in the game can feel a bit repetitive once you've played through them once or twice, but for such a short game, and a game that's really, really good in every other way, that really isn't such a huge deal. I can't WAIT to play through the free update Indie Island and see how long it'll take me to accidentally get Tim Schafer killed.			"

												This is a game about making choices and living with the consewunces as you attempt to get survivors of a plane crash off an island safely. It's fun and there is some real reward/penalties on the horizzon for those who make the wrong decision, but it is very short. Which is disapointing, because the characters and overall feel of the game is quite enjoyable. It's the short of game that has to played multiple times to see the different outcomes to get the most out of it, one play through doesn't really satisfy, thankfully a couple more playthroughs spread out of time hold up well.Probably not worth full price but that is debatable.

												This is an enjoyable, little distraction. I've played this game through a few times now and it's fun to see how different choices play out (i.e. who lives and who dies horribly). It could probably be completed in a single setting in roughly two to three hours, but I would usually do it in a few one hour increments (it saves whenever you exit and picks up again right where you left off which is nice). Each castaway has their own odd back-story to be discovered and it has a nice amount of humor. Worth a try, especially if it's on sale.			"

That being said, if you're looking for a game to play through once and be done, don't waste your time on Dyscourse. The only way to truly appreciate this game is to play through multiple times and discover all of the different outcomes.

I also like the other verison of the game that lets you play as an indie game designer and meet and struggle with other game designers that may have made your favorite game. I would reccommend this game to any of my friends!			"

												This game is great, haven't played much yet but I am still trying to escape the island with more people alive! My current record is 4 people.I have noticed a few inconsistencies. Like, for example (Spoilers Obviously):In the Cave, if Garrett pulls you to the side to talk about the chocolate bar, if you eat in secret, if you build a raft and get on the raft with Teddy and Garrett, Teddy will accuse Garrett of hiding things, Garrett will say something like ""The chocolate bar, I know"" and Teddy says something like ""Not that"" even though Teddy shouldn't know about it.I have noticed this and a few others but I'm sure they will be fixed, and it's a minor problem anyways.

												ok so, i was patient and got it half off so for 8bones I have a steal on my hands. I think its worth the price. It was kind of short the first play through but it opens up the more you muck about with it. The game tells me every choice has a consequence, I just wish there were more choices through the story. If you ever watched the tvshow Lost, I can see how it draws so many comparissons to that. I'd call it short and sweet which usually suits my adhd but I was fully engorssed in this story. Its pretty polished for what it is and its got a lot of love tucked in around its details. 8/10 would let my fellow survivors perish again.			"

I've played through the main story twice and the little story once with plans to play both a couple more times to make different choices.  That being said, for a game that's whie fun, a little slow paced, it's expensive at full price.  It's good, don't get me wrong and I 100% reccomend it to anyone who thinks it look kinda cool.

												You wake up on the beach after your plane crashes.  You band together with five other survives who make you their impromptu leader.  The choices you have to make have some major consequences in this dire fight for survival.  Their lives rest in your hands.  Do you have aptitude to make the right choices to save everyone?This game is all about cause and effect.  When a boar steals what little food you have do you try to hunt it down or stay put?  When the storm threatens your shelter should you make do or wander blindly into the night and hope to find something better?  Even choosing who to feed with your limited food supply is a tough choice.  Maybe someone is injured and you feel badly and want to feed them.  On the other hand, maybe you give the food to a more fit candidate to give them some energy to help you forage.  Maybe you just decide based on their attitudes and personalities.The story and the level of emotional attachment in this game is through the roof.  The characters all feel so real.  You have Teddy, a super paranoid tech wiz, who thinks this is all one big planned conspiracy.  Jolene, a demanding yet surprising optimistic women, who is losing interest in her husband and fellow survivor George.  Then theirs Steve and Garret, a depressed office worker and a gaming addict.  Rarely have I found it this easy to remember characters names, its just their personalities and so strong and believable you really feel connected to them as time goes by.The art and sound effects are really unique and fit the game so well.  The game has a really pretty, colorful and slightly cartoony, paper-craft look to it.  The story can get dark at times and I'm glad its not too realistic looking, I feel that could have made it even more gloomy than it already is.  The characters all make funny and super charming voices when the talk.  You can read what they say but all you hear is them mumble with their different accents that fit their personalities perfectly.This game isn't very long, in fact it only takes a little over an hour to complete.  Please don't not write it off just for that, for what plays in an hour feels like days as you immerse your self in this game.  Not to mention there are so many different paths to take the replay value is very high.  Watching my sister play and make different choices vastly changed the direction of the game and let me see lots of things I didn't in my play-though.  If you enjoy the TellTale games like the Walking Dead or the difficult choices likes those in the Mass Effect series I believe you'll really enjoy this game.  So tell me, are you ready to step up and make the though choices?			"

												Basically you're stranded in an island after a plane crash with a couple other survivors, and the gameplay is making choices every day like whether to gather food or build signals, and who you pick for each tasks. There isn't really an epic story other than trying to survive and knowing other characters, and each playthrough would be pretty short, but you'd want to see what other choices or what assigning other people to other tasks would do. The game has good stylistic graphic and production value, and isn't actually that expensive, so might worth it to some people, but I got this in a bundle, and eventhough I'm happy with it, I don't think I'd buy it in full value.

												It's is cute, but...that's about all I can say.The gameplay is about an hour, but is meant for you to replay to get different results. I've played three times (and my sister played it half-way through once.) The thing is, the game lacks tention and can be really tedious--especially afer the first playthrough. The graphics are sweet, but not impressive--its like a children's cartoon. There are far too many points where you are waiting for nothing to happen. Like waiting while your charcter passes out water to other characters--no dialogue, no story bulding, not even something pretty to look at...just waiting. Some of the dialouge is funny, but not the majorityIf anything can be said for it though (minus the first 15 minutes) the choices you make do actually change how the story is told and determine who lives and who dies. Unfortunately, I never felt strongly about any charcter or situation, so all the excitment that should have been in making a choice was lost.I guess the game is interesting, but not impressive and not exciting. If the game is ever on steep sale, maybe pick it, but for $15....for $15 I want my money back.			"

												Tired of games not letting your choices affect your ending? Enter Dyscourse: where every decision could mean life or death for your cast of characters stranded on a (beautifully colorful) desert island. While playing to the end may seem short, the real meat of Dyscourse lies in your ability to replay the game and see how vastly different your outcomes can be (someday I'll leave that island with everyone). With a fun story, great visuals, endearing characters, and a kitty, Dyscourse is a fun and unique chose-your-own-adventure game.			"

You won't 100% achieve this in one go, but it's casual enough that you can grab some achieves and see part of the story and come back for more later.

That said for you 100%-ers you should be able to do it in a few dozen run through and there are guides / walk throughs that will help with that.	

As an added bonus there is the indie mini-game staring one good dev and a few jobbers .... I'll let you decide who's whom.  This could be fun for 2 or maybe 3 trys to get everything but that's about it.

And now the downside.  The story is fun, the graphics are fun, but after 4 hours it starts to get very old as you just try to get the last achieves.  And then there's the price. $17 CDN is a little steep for the 2 hours of fun your going to get and another 2-4 hours of achievement hunting.  I'm not saying it's not worth it, I'm just saying on a $ / hour fun basis there are better deals on Steam.

Wait till it's on sale (66%+) or in a bundle.  Then clear 2 hours and enjoy.

boring branching-path narrative with AWFUL charactersRemember how the great writing and voice acting in Telltale's Walking Dead game really conveyed the tension among a group of strangers trying to work together to survive the zombie apocalypse? Dyscourse is basically a VERY poor imitation of that, with no voice acting and TERRIBLE writing.The biggest problem is that none of the six characters has any real depth, and two in particular are ridiculous, cartoonish stereotypes. The conspiracy nut's CONSTANT paranoid interpretation of the most innocuous things (""Cats are evil robot spies!"") could work in a game with a lighter, silly tone, but people DIE in this game! It also could have worked if the other characters discussed whether this obviously delusional man under extreme stress was a threat to them (like the Wal-Mart worker in Telltale's Walking Dead game), but no, they brush it off. And then there's the GAMER character, who makes Law and Order's episode about Gamergate seem respectful in comparison. He relates EVERYTHING to video games, which again could have worked if he were portrayed as severely autistic, but instead he's as silly as a witness in a Phoenix Wright game, which does NOT fit Dyscourse's tone.The writing is also frustratingly bad, with characters doing stupid, nonsensical things (when you find a small pond that's your only source of fresh water, one guy inexplicably JUMPS INTO IT and ends up covered in leeches) and seemingly NO ONE in the group has even a basic common sense understanding of how to survive. For example, one character is insistent on the importance of coming up with a way to signal any passing plane or ship. The obvious choice would be to get a signal fire ready, but instead they only make an SOS out of driftwood on the beach, which would only be seen by a plane flying low overhead during the day. Your characters also come across an easy source of meat, but choose to go hungry instead.The only silver lining to this game is the bonus campaign where a bunch of indie game devs have been stranded on the island. It's actually somewhat funny because it has a silly tone, so all the moronic characters and game references work.			"

												► Dyscourse ◄Likes:→ Multiple endings→ Drama→ Thrilling & exciting with a mixture of anticipation.→ Simple controlsDislikes→ Tedious→ Texts→ Set PathThis game is great, and I would recommend, but what I don't like about it is the fact that there is not an option to skip texts that the gamer had read before. If this option was available, I believe that the game would be a bit better than how it currently is. Without the skipping text option, it makes the game feel a bit tedious and time consuming in my opinion. The set path is not really something to dislike though it might be something that people might not like. I would have prefer if the game had a bit of randomness instead of a set choice, but I don't think it would really matter anyways since it's still an enjoyable and entertaining game.			"

But........... why cant a group of 7 face one jaguar OR BARALELY EVEN A BOAR without one person being killed? Legitmately, I love the writing and dialogue of all the characters but this group must be the most incompitent bunch of saps ever. If there were ever a group of plane crash survivors on a island it defintely would take the course of 3 days to make a signal, check the site, and find water, THAT ♥♥♥♥ WOULD BE DONE IN THE FIRST HOUR OR SO. Plus every freaking pair/treeo of characters that your not apart off can't accomplish any task AT ALL DAMN. Just some constructive critism, I think the game is still amazing and I will always continue playing it but the sheer limit of the groups functions and compitance frustrates me at times because I get so involed in the story when I'm playing. PS. please please I beg of you please make building the signal easier. Dragging wood to make fire is fun because its fire but its just a crappy sos sign that would be awesome if we could customize with materials we find, and depending on how well its made or how flashy the more chance of rescue (just spit ballin at this point) ty and keep on keepin on			"

												Really fun and fantastic game, although some of the ways you can or others can die are pretty unrealistic and ridiculous, really, but that is only a minor pet peeve. Other than those small things, I found it quite enjoyable and have actually replayed it quite a few times now.---SPOILERS BELOW---The ways I'm speaking of are even just the characters being terrified of crabs and dying by them is possible too. They're just crabs - even the main character, Rita says so at some point. Another way is starvation - of course starvation is realistic, but the fact a character will die because they didn't eat for one day at certain points in the game is kinda ridiculous.  "

												This was one of those games that once I started I had to know what all the possible endings were, what all the combinations would be; and I could not put down the game until I had done so. Even through some frustration and some repetitive parts I did it, and overall really enjoyed it!I recommend first playing through not knowing much about the game, choosing decisions you personally would make. Going back and seeing the differences I think would be more satisfying then. My view of it would be a bit different if I had paid the full price instead of getting it in a bundle. The artwork was lovely, and getting to know the characters was fun, but 2 days later (and all achievements unlocked) and I'll likely never play this again, at most I'll show some friends.			"

												What an incredible, incredible game. The choices that define your playthrough are of genuine consequence, making each decision a process of deliberation and emotion. The results can inspire genuine excitement, happiness, or regret, more so than many other games I've played before, which is odd considering how little time it takes to complete one playthrough. I found myself become either attached or alienated from certain characters based on their actions and my own prejudices.

												This is essentially just a Choose Your Own Adventure game. Although you can explore different branches of the decision tree, the gameplay itself is quite limited and the story really doesn't change much (though the particulars do). It is definitely fun for one playthrough, and achievement hounds may get some added enjoyment from unlocking all of the scenes.

												What an incredible, incredible game. The choices that define your playthrough are of genuine consequence, making each decision a process of deliberation and emotion. The results can inspire genuine excitement, happiness, or regret, more so than many other games I've played before, which is odd considering how little time it takes to complete one playthrough. I found myself become either attached or alienated from certain characters based on their actions and my own prejudices. This led  to a moment in which I was forced to make the immoral decision to kill one of my fellow survivors who was attacking another survivor, in order to repay the favour to the other survivor who saved my life earlier on.

												Dyscourse is a wonderfully unique little game, with gameplay somewhere between a ""Choices Matter"" consequences game and a CYOA/Visual Novel with storyline branching, character affinity, and multiple endings. That said, it's not quite like any other game on Steam. The art/animation alone is beautiful and different and well worth checking out, and the humor and character of the game is charming and enjoyable. Dyscourse is a game about crash landing on a deserted island, and the choices you make affect who survives and who makes it off the island. Also, things get weird.A single playthrough is short, but it isn't the point; you'll play this game many times, going different routes and making different decisions to experience all the island has to offer. And there is a lot; you won't be replaying the same game every time. It took me about 10 hours to do everything in both Dyscourse and Indie Island. You could do this a bit faster if you did every route perfectly, but I love this type of game and I had fun exploring everything. Important for this type of game, Dyscourse has day rewinds, so you can go back and try different things without having to start your save all over again.The achievements are lots of fun to try to go after, and the Indie Island bonus game you unlock after beating the game is very cute. In that, you crash land with a lot of well-known indie game developers and have different strange adventures trying to get rescued with them.Dyscourse isn't a big game, but I love it very much. Months after having finished it, it's still one of my favorite games on Steam.			"

												This game is in a Humble Bundle right now (with the DLC included), so get it through there rather than in-Steam. Not sure if I would recommend paying full price for it, but if you do get it, the DLC is an absolute MUST. Do you want to see Tim Schafer's ego ruin everyone's life? or Edmund McMillen battle cave monsters with tears after you tell him how much you hate Super Meat Boy? Then you'll like the DLC campaign about indie devs stranded on an island on the way to a copycat GDC event.What is Dyscourse? It's an exploration in truly divergent narrative branches. The main story/campaign is super short (I spent 30 minutes my first time through), but with dozens of decisions that create butterfly effects that ACTUALLY DO follow through in future consequences, you're intended to quickly go through multiple playthroughs, each with vastly different outcomes. Steam achievements thrive in abundance for many of these decisions, both small and significant, so there's additional motivation to seek out unusual combinations of choices and dialogue options.Unlike many big-budget, popular choose-your-own-adventure games, like Life is Strange and anything ever made by Telltale, Dyscourse proves that significantly branching narratives are actually feasible to produce, but only within the constraints of a much smaller scope than we usually expect in our games. ""Don't bite off more than you can chew"" is the moral of this metaphor about being repeatedly stuck on the same deserted island, playthrough after playthrough. None of the endings ever feel like a writer was just trying to tack on alternative endings for the sake of ""choice."" The outcomes feel as legitimate and logical as the decisions you made leading up to them.			"

												Really great game~It's a bit of a social experiment, but if you liked Choose Your Own Adventure games growing up, you'll love this.The premis is simple, you and 5 others are stranded on an island after a plane crash. Depending on what you do, who you side with, and how you choose to survive (or not, as the case may be), you get different endings.But you also find out more and more about the people you're trapped with as you go.And you find out even more at the end, based on who lives and who dies.$15 may seem kinda steep (and honestly, if it were the equivalent of only one book, it would be)BUTThere's a bit on the intro screen implying they're going to be making more stories for this as time goes on!I think that's definitely a reason to support it.Overall, the gameplay is smooth. Some parts are slow, surely, but important things are in text that help you make decisions later. And as people start to die and time goes on, you have to make faster and faster decisions, resulting in snap judgement calls that may not always be the best option...The animation is pretty, albeit stylized, but I think that's a plus because I like highly stylized games (Binding of Isaac, Super Meatboy, and Don't Starve ring any bells?). Overall, I'm likely going to be playing it over and over again in attempts to try and get the alternate -- and hopefully find a perfect -- endings. Even if it's not really your thing, it's a nice game to have in your arsenal. 10/10, would reccommend!			"

												I played once at the time of this review but I am just in awe. This game like a lot of text based games, this toohas a lot of different endings. And by the end of my first play through I thought about the tough decisions and all that COULD have resulted from it. AND Considering this game still is the least non-linear text based game I've seen I personally kept myself away from any videos of this game because I wanted to see the full experience and it's 100% worth it, especially for the price I bought it at (5.94 CDN). It's terrific I don't know anything else to say about the gameI give Dyscourse a almost perfect score of 9/10   it does suffer with some character development and deaths that are a bit cheap and coincedental and just try to fit the story.

												A fun & funny game where your choices really DO matter. Stranded on a desert island following a plane crash, your goal is to help your ragtag band of survivors... well, survive. Virtually every decision you make has its consequences, & you make a LOT of decisions. Friendships are formed & broken, sacrifices are made, people die... people ALWAYS die. But just who, & how many, is entirely in your hands.No two playthroughs of this game are the same. That's not to say it doesn't sometimes get tedious to replay, but the achievement system in place is a really good motivator to unlock particular paths. Also you can ""rewind"" to any day in the story instead of having to start fresh every time you want to change something. It even shows you who died or was injured on each available day, making it easier to go back & ""save"" characters by making a different choice, if you're feeling guilty. I did sometimes find myself wishing for a ""fast forward"" button for many of the scenes, though -- things get a bit desperate when you're onto those last two or three achievements.I didn't like the artwork at first, but it grew on me (the backgrounds are great, but the character designs I'm still not fond of -- WHAT is Rita wearing & WHY does she have claws?). The writing is really entertaining; the humorous dialog combined with the cartoonish style definitely help to keep the mood light, even when you're dealing with stuff like murder & cannibalism. The voice acting is... well, it can be turned off, fortunately. As for the DLC story ""Indie Island,"" it was way too meta for me; I only went through it once.Overall this is a clever, well-made game which really does hide a multitude of secrets. So do yourself a favor & start DYSCovering them today!!! (That was really bad, sorry.)			"

												What if 60 Seconds was actually good? That's the best way I can describe discourse. Its a Telltale type ""which way"" story with a ton of branches. The characters are lovable. The dialouge if fun. The action is intense which is great because of the art style. The choices are interesting. Only an hour in and I'd rate it a 10/10 experience.  So far, I only have two tiny grips about the game.1. I often find that the ""Do X"" yourself option is ALMOST always the best case. 2. There's some character specfic events, but I wanted more and for them to be consistent. For example: very early in the game, someone's cigarette causes jet fuel to ignite. However, when I later needed matches to ignite another object, the character was of no use.			"

												     One of the best choose your own adventure type games that isn't purely text based. In my opinion the art style is absolutely amazing; you can decide for yourself by looking at the screenshots. There are enough branching paths to warrant multiple playthroughs and the relatively short game time (around an hour) makes it perfect to play in a single session from start to finish each time. Bottom line: Dyscourse is a beautifully stylish game of meaningful choices.			"

												A Fun game with some really funny touches and humourous content. This game is something between a browser game and a full character immersion game, it's not a big budget HD title that will take you to another world for dozens of hours, but it is also far more than a single frame web browser game, The game can be played through in approximately 1 hour but there are numerous different stories to unfold, so reaching the end of a story arc is not the end of the game. Things I loved:Comedy writings and clever interactions. The cat. Things I liked less:That you can do so few things per day. The music isn't great. It was also somewhat odd that there was no mouse! I got used to it, but was a little surprising, but this is a very good indie game. For small monies and for lighthearted couple of hours this is great. Thanks.  "

												Dyscourse is a game that can be played countless times and never get old, there are so many different options on what to say, where to go, what to do etc. The game's wide variety of gameplay options means that almost every time you'll get a different result. I've expirenced some very sad endings and with them some really funny or odd things happened, just to spice everything up. The characters all have such believable backstories and it makes it fun to learn about them throughout your time on the island. Definetly rating this an 8.5/10 - No doubt.			"

The length of the game is also good considering that it is not particularly deep, but it lasts just long enough. There are multiple ways to end the game if you wanted, which leaves it open for multiple playthroughs. I even liked the characters in the end.

												Never before have I seen a game like Dyscourse. One thing that had caught me off guard was how short one run was, but that didn't bother me. The real challenge isn't surviving, oh no, that's easy, it's trying to figure out the backstories and mysteries behind each character before they die. And this game doesn't fail on that. Everything is vague, yet detailed enough to leave you wanting more. Your choices do matter.To be short; it's a fun game, with simple yet interesting gameplay, an awesome art style, and an intriguing story.I would certainly reccomend this to anyone who is interested.

												First playthrough half of us eat rotten pig and get food poisoning, I watch as someone gets struck by lightning, choose to let someone drown in favor of saving the food supply, bash in another person's head when they try to kill another, and finally get rescued.Second time I decide to do things abit differently. So I gather water, save half our food, and decide to relocate to a cave for shelter. Unfortunately a jagaur attacks and kills someone, and then someone else gets picked off by the animal while scavenging for food, and finally the same damn jaguar comes into the cave and eats a third person. Now the last three of us decide to build a raft and escape, which results in one death by starvation and another by shark attack.

If this option was available, I believe that the game would be a bit better than how it currently is. Without the skipping text option, it makes the game feel a bit tedious and time consuming in my opinion. The set path is not really something to dislike though it might be something that people might not like. I would have prefer if the game had a bit of randomness instead of a set choice, but I don't think it would really matter anyways since it's still an enjoyable and entertaining game.			"

												A very interesting, entertaining, immersive, and emotional (at times) experience. After my first playthrough I sat and stared at the final scene, reading all the newspaper snippings, and realizing how much I could have done to change how it turned out. I went into this game not expecting much and was absolutely blown away.So here is a little summary:I woke up confused I searched around trying to find clues. Found Steve and Teddy. My stupid decision led to one getting hurt.We went back to camp. I met the others. George and Jolene quickly became my favorite. I learned of there marriage issues and I felt for them. I made a vow then that I would get them both of the island. Which I did, but at much loss of life.My first death came when a storm had rolled in. I had chosen to stay in fear that if we left we would have lost the supplies that so many of us got injured for.I woke up to a flood. Teddy was pinned under a tree with the waters rising fast. I swam out to grab the supplies instead of returning to help.Teddy drowned.We moved inland, found a cave. And soon found a kitten, which Garrett named Bruce, I had hoped that Bruce would fill the empty whole in my heart where Teddy once sat. Garrett loved that cat to the point where he wanted to give it some of our rations. I disagreed. When I passed out the rations I chose George and Jolene because they seemed to be genuinely good people. Then I went to Steve. And then I thought... Garrett with his cuts and the bump on his head and him slowly becoming insane, he wouldn't be helpful for tommorow. ""Since I'm scavenging I'll need the strength."" I ate the last ration, feeling guilty immedietly...The next day, since Steve wasn't getting along with everyone I brought him with me, I decided not to head back to shore in fear that I would have to come face to face with Teddy's dead corpse... and after a day out in the sun and the sight of seaguls, or vultures... I didn't want to have to relive my guilt. So I went to investigate the trees. Lucky I did because we were able to find valuable food. We spent the night out because it got to late.When we returned I noticed gasses coming out of the cave, seeing Jolene, George, and the kitten I was instantly relieved, but then I thought. Where is Garrett? I thought the game would try to make a joke like maybe Garrett farted and they had to leave the cave... but no, the reality was more dark. The cave filled with poisionous gas and Garrett, sinc e I didn't give him the rations, was too weak to make it out. Garrett died in his sleep.And in the confusion we lost the supplies in there too... so Teddy's and Garrett's death has been in vain.Feeling guilty and angry the next morning I had to come up with a plan to escape. I wanted to investigate the light offshore to honor Teddy after I ignored him and pushed all his opinions aside, only for him to die later that day... But I was reminded that it could have been just a shiny rock and since it was during day it seems plausible... also all three of us being on a raft would most likely be a death sentence if nothing was found. So I chose to head inland.During the long walk Jolene's dark side came to light and I regretted keeping her alive. Hearing her plan to kill Steve made me sick. I refused... but instantly I knew I should have threatened her... I decided to stick close to her side on the next foraging trip. When she approached Steve with a rock. I didn't attack her... I warned Steve, he ran... but unfortuantly right into an old tribal trap.Steve was impaled with a wooden log.I gained George's trust on the matter and we tied Jolene up. Continuing the walk we came across an old tribal camp. I locked Jolene away and me and George lived there for a couple months until one day a helicopter came. I convinced Geroge to help me signal the helicopter. And I deicided to bring Jolene back rather than leave her locked away to starve... She escaped her murder charges.In the end  George and Jolene got divorced, George became a professional fisherman. Jolene told her lies about he event to everyone and anyone who'd listen. Even though Teddy had a memorial statue built for him and Garrett got a virtual memorial celebration for him I saw that Steve's company paid his family... but it wasn't even enough to pay for funeral exspenses.I started at the screen for a good ten minutes, thinking, regretting choices, and just feeling overall guilty.This game has taken the expression ""Hindsight is 20/20"" to seriously. I will play this again and hopefully save my fellow survivors. I just need to figure out how.9/10, will contemplate life again.My only downside to this game:Some things seems unrealistic to where for example, Teddy wanted help to build a SOS signal... but since no one was helping him he decided to not do it... but how hard is it to line up stones to for an SOS signal? Also the writing in this game is a bit cringy at time with Garrett... it feels like the devs are trying to hard for humor is some areas. All that aside this game was very very well done and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to sit back and play a game that actually makes you think. I've not played a game in a while where I had to use my brain... I like this and I can't wait for more :)			"

												An incredibly short game but you get to have many decisions that can radically change the game's story so the game definitely has a lot of replayability and it has some charm too.I sugest getting this when only on sale, still think the price is a little too much for something so short6/10			"

												Dyscourse is a fun and interesting little game developed by Owlchemy Labs. It uses pretty interesting stylized graphics that is pretty different from anything I've seen before. It really is a pretty game.That aside, this game delivers an interesting story - you play as Rita, who crash landed on a deserted island  with five other people - George, Teddy, Steve, Garret, and Jolene, Their backstory is delivered throughout the course of the game (Unless unfortunate circumstances occur first!) and it helps give depth to the game.This game promotes multiple playthroughs, each one having different outcomes and events, as well as survivors - based on  the choices you make. It's a fun, short little game.All of that said, I cannot agree with the price too much, it's far too short really to be worth 14 dollars (you can beat it in an hour!) and once you play through it a couple times you'll have no real reason to go back to it again. $14.99? No... $9.99 maybe, better if on a sale. I am not saying this is a bad game, just the price seems a bit much for what you get.			"

DyscourseOverall Score: 8/10Short Summary:You play as Rita, a survivor from a plane crash. Togather with some other (weird) survivors they try to pass the time (survive) in the island until they get rescued (IF they get rescued).Estimated gameplay hours: 1 hour to complete it in first time, 4-10 for multiply storylines/endings.Let's just say this game offers you a great storyline to complete. How you complete it is completly up to you. I strongly recommend this game.You're more than welcome to also check my screenshots for this game [link below] to see what this game has to offer.http://steamcommunity.com/id/xDMikeW2k14/screenshots/appid=234920&sort=newestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewallNote:I recommend checking out the 100% Achievments guide if you're intrested in completing some achievments. Because by doing that you will also encounter different paths & choices you didn't know about.* Skip it.** Not Recommended.*** Give It A Try.**** Recommended On Sale****** Recommended On Full Price.

												4/10 - Not my kind of storytelling game and absolutely not a survival game.Dyscourse is a cute little game about teamplay and clicking on dialogue options. I dont want to beef, but I expected a storytelling survival game, not a storytelling-game about survival. The atmosphere really supports the storytelling and the character design, but I just kind of didnt like that atmosphere. The characters are always ♥♥♥♥♥in about your decisions waht led me to murdering almost all in my first playtrough. The game gets pretty dark at some points but on the other hands, the limited options and decisions you have to make seem childish and totally unworldly. I mentioned that the game is cute, and thats only because of the tinker-styled graphics, nothing more. Gameplay - 3/10Atmosphere - 4/10Storytelling - 3/10Graphics - 6/10Playtime - 3/10Total: 4/10 - Although i always try to stay neutral in my reviews, this game was just annoying after the first playtrough and isn't worth the full price of 15 bucks.

												                              WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!Thanks to the develepers (Owlchemy labs) I can play this game and I was baffled on how anyone could have negative veiws on this work of art. The story might be Cliche But its ""Good Cliche"" if that makes any sense. Most people also complain about charecter development and  can Kinda agree because i have had multiple moments where My party just fight each other but thats predictable with the diversity of each and every person all having their own ""Life"" I suppose you can say.The Pros! - To be honest this game has a lot of areas it perfected and i cannot explain them all so here are some i guess.The gameplay is smooth at 60fps on my 1.3Ghz LAPTOP! Thats rediculous and how it does that is beyond my knowlege. The second thing i love abut this game is the killer soundtrack, I dont have the delux edition and no i dont have the album but i have listened to all the songs on youtube and they where amazing and defenately made the moment in most dramatic scenes. I also love the charecter development in the game and how polished and perfected it is! Honestly I felt attached to most of them (Except the crazy one) And there is only 8 days. But my favourite thing about this game is the art style. Holy Sh*t does this game look amazing! The ""Paper"" Style of the whole game is Breath-taking, and the shadows, Oh the shadows they are perfect make my babies.The Cons - It was hard but here they are!The game is f*cking short as sh*it! It took me about 1 and a half hours to complete this game with two different endings, although i can excuse them for how good it is it still could have been another hour longer at best by adding another week. The charecters die just because of the plot which i found unlikable and i wish they would have lived longer and stayed on the island or something I dont know. I also dont like that even though its free the dlc ""Indie island"" Is EVEN SHORTER! I counted about half an hour! Thats faster than a bullet train! It is although free so i cant hate or whatever. :/In Conclusion! - No spoilers here I promiseWould i recommend this game? Yes i would, If it was cheeper. and thats all to say. Thanks for reading!

												not worth the $15 price; wait for it to go on sale to get it.beat it in less than an hour; had one of my characters die off screen without any choices that i could have made to save him which was annoying. game just kinda decided to kill him off.the characters themselves dont even express a whole lot of emotion for when another character dies, either, they just say something along the lines of 'oh, i miss so and so. well better go to sleep' and then never mention the character again,  which is bothersome. the game couldve had great emotional baggage if the characters just expressed something other than being bored all the time.i dunno. still liked it though. worth the summer sale price of $5 at least.

												To be honest this game could've been done a lot better.It is very short, way to short for a price point of 11.3$(or your regional equivilant). Only thing that would make this game worth the money is if you replay the game until you have gotten every possible outcome, and no one is going to do that for any other reason than Steam achievements or because you're planning on continuing until you have all the trading card drops.I was only a bit interested while doing my first playthrough of the main story.And to be honest, even in my first playthrough of the main story it got a little boring, actually, it got very boring.The game claims to have replay ability but it doesn't unless you're entertained by reading the same lines of text 500 times.This game is one of the 'Chose your own adventure' games where almost non of your choices have any impact on the game, even though the game claims that all choices matter. Only some choices have impact, and it's ovbious which ones they are.The game is extremely repetitive and also has a lot of meaningless filler-content.You also don't get to make a lot of choices, at least not reasonable ones. If you're stuck on an island, starving and while your scavenging for food and you come across a cat(in the middle of the desert for some reason), are you going to kill it and eat it so you don't die or are you going to let it live and contiune to starve to death? I think the answer is ovbious, yet you're not able to chose that ovbious answer.The art style is great, yet the actual game does not hold up.The game tries to be funny and silly, it is definetly silly, but funny? No. Neither is it entertaining and after 20 minutes of playing you will start to mindlessly click through the dialog to get to the end.4/10.Good concept, horribly executed.			"

												What can I say about this game that isn't negative....Uhm....Well. This game is the cartoon version of Dead in Bermuda. I spent less than 40 minutes in my first (and likely only) playthrough, and I don't have much desire to replay and try for different endings or more achievements. If you're a collector of those things you may enjoy this game, and I imagine that getting the ""perfect"" ending (assuming there is one) would take time and effort. That's time and effort I'm just not interested in giving, however. This game is mostly a snooze-fest. I only stayed awake because I had to constantly smash the spacebar. My fingers hurt. Your choices matter in this game, but they're highly illogical--you won't ""outthink"" this game. I played to Day 7 and my game then skipped forward to Day 62. Some people had died in the interim, in pointless and ridiculous ways. This game wanted to be a quirky fun comedy, and sadly, it just misses the mark for me. The dialogue is stilted and the options, though they matter, are bizarre and have far-reaching consequences. Also, random panther attacks. TL;DR: This review is longer than the actual game, and more interesting.			"

												Concept-wise, it's a shorter, sillier, uglier, less interesting and generally worse take on Until Dawn. You could try it, well, for cute menus, or the quite unique feeling that talking with anyone always helps. But then the only real value of it comes after many replays. And there's really very, very little incentive to replay anything after you've done. Plus... the looping sound of helicopter hangs forever after you restart; a very basic bug in the quite critical mechanism that suggests that maybe not enough love was put into the title.			"

												Not a fan. Did not like any of the two given stories to play through. I'd say that the main story line would be fine, if the game wouldn't cost bloody 15eur. And don't get me started on the side story. It just seemed that the devs tried too hard to make everything a cliche or a reference to a game or smth.

												I didn't feel like this game was a good representation of choice-and-consequence games. You play as Rita, a barista stranded on an island with five other survivors after a plane crash, and are put into the position of the group's ""leader"" in order to help yourself and the others survive.Let it be said at this point that I only played the game once, and  I appreciate that its charm would lie in the different playthroughs and outcomes, but I was put off of playing it again after the first playthrough and the extra mini game attached to it.First of all, the storyline is simple and engaging enough. Nothing narratively impressive. The characters are fun and colourful, but a little too archetyped to add any depth to the already relatively shallow narrative. The art style is nice. Refreshing art work, good design.Why is the group following the player characters decisions? We get asked to decide for the group, but our character has in no way proven to be qualified to lead. Suddenly being asked to decide for this group of desperate survivors resonated with me as unrealistic and killed the emmersion. We are only in charge because we are the Player.The decisions we get to make seem to reflect on relevant issues in the situation. Do we search the wreckage, or build a signal? do we look for food or water? Do we abandon base to search elsewhere? Whilst this issues are relatable and realistic, the outcomes of your decisions do not always reflect the players logical thinking. The game creates issues where in realty, a simple solution could have been found, and as a player I felt cheated by that.You may for example decide to do one task with only half of the group, and the other will, for no particular reason, decide to do nothing all day. These often occuring non-issues result in death and major problems, but the player had no way of knowing how to deal with them better. Characters die in these awkwardly created situations. The way the player character and the other survivors deal with this killed the immersion for me entirely. They simply don't care. As the dialogue goes, they might as well have gone: ""oh what a shame. Whatever. Moving on,""The mini game that comes with ""Dyscourse"" seems entirely unrelated, and appears to make ridiculous characters out of other indie game developers. Either I missed the point, or it is just bashing other devs.For 15 euro, I could not recommend this game. It could have done a lot better with its original idea.			"

P.s. vale is also doing this crap of taking some money from fan made items just saying.			"

												I didn't feel like this game was a good representation of choice-and-consequence games. You play as Rita, a barista stranded on an island with five other survivors after a plane crash, and are put into the position of the group's ""leader"" in order to help yourself and the others survive.Let it be said at this point that I only played the game once, and  I appreciate that its charm would lie in the different playthroughs and outcomes, but I was put off of playing it again after the first playthrough and the extra mini game attached to it.First of all, the storyline is simple and engaging enough. Nothing narratively impressive. The characters are fun and colourful, but a little too archetyped to add any depth to the already relatively shallow narrative. The art style is nice. Refreshing art work, good design.Why is the group following the player characters decisions? We get asked to decide for the group, but our character has in no way proven to be qualified to lead. Suddenly being asked to decide for this group of desperate survivors resonated with me as unrealistic and killed the emmersion. We are only in charge because we are the Player.The decisions we get to make seem to reflect on relevant issues in the situation. Do we search the wreckage, or build a signal? do we look for food or water? Do we abandon base to search elsewhere? Whilst this issues are relatable and realistic, the outcomes of your decisions do not always reflect the players logical thinking. The game creates issues where in realty, a simple solution could have been found, and as a player I felt cheated by that.You may for example decide to do one task with only half of the group, and the other will, for no particular reason, decide to do nothing all day. These often occuring non-issues result in death and major problems, but the player had no way of knowing how to deal with them better. Characters die in these awkwardly created situations. The way the player character and the other survivors deal with this killed the immersion for me entirely. They simply don't care. As the dialogue goes, they might as well have gone: ""oh what a shame. Whatever. Moving on,""The mini game that comes with ""Dyscourse"" seems entirely unrelated, and appears to make ridiculous characters out of other indie game developers. Either I missed the point, or it is just bashing other devs.For 15 euro, I could not recommend this game. It could have done a lot better with its original idea.			"

If you like story driven games check it out!I'd say the flow is much smoother than the Telltale games and the choices are much less obvious.

												Honestly, I don't know why this game is getting such rave reviews. Besides the artistic graphics style, I found this game tedious.For fifteen dollars, I expect much more gameplay than this. To me, this is more like a visual novel. Which is fine, but I would never spend fifteen dollars on a visual novel. Heck, I can get those for free. As far as story line goes, I never found myself wondering how the story would pan out or heavily considering my decisions. The days were far too short, same goes for the game as a whole. I'm sorry that I'm really negative, but this is my honest opinion. If this game was five to ten dollars, I would like it much more than I do now. Definitely a rip off.			"

												Very similar to The Walking Dead game, but not especially good.I bought this for $7.50 and found it almost worth that. After the fun first playthrough (about 1 hour), I was not especially excited for a second time through. I did do a second playthrough and feel like I've gotten all I will out of it. So, this is 1-4 hours of gameplay.The gameplay is some dialog choices along with some very simple puzzle elements. The dialog presents you with some interesting choices. For example, deciding how to divide your party for various tasks or deciding which character to protect from an attacking animal. These choices seem a bit more developed and interesting than The Walking Dead's.Unfortunately, the results of my choices seemed pretty arbitrary. For example, when I protected one character from an animal attack, the result was that a completely unrelated character got harmed. Similarly, the interpersonal choices had pretty arbitrary and unimportant outcodes. Most of my dialog choices didn't produce any clear effect (something like ""Teddy became intimidated"" or ""Steven suspects that I stole that food""), This made my choices feel nearly meaningless. It didn't  matter whether I was a demanding bully or a selfless enabler, because either way arbitrary things lead to an arbitrary outcome.I passed an happy hour playing Dyscourse. The game suggests some excellent possibilities for player choice in video games, but it didn't deliver very well on them.			"

You play as Rita, an unfortunate art school grad turned barista, who is now stuck on a desert island with a crew of oddball travelers after a plane crash. That last choice you just made? It may end up being integral to your group’s survival, or it may lead you down a path to murder and cannibalism! Stories in Dyscourse are emergent, and choices made in the game directly tie to the survival or downfall of the group. As players get to know their fellow castaways and make critical and interpersonal decisions, drama dynamically unfolds, and your choices author your own unique story. - Recommended!			"

												This game personally wasn't for me. If you like branching narratives and want to see how it all connects, that's great! This game does a good job of having distinct paths. I couldn't bring myself to like any of the characters, and the music was pretty grating by the end. I also didn't like the bizarre proportions on the characters; it made them less relatable to me, but that's just an aesthetic and I can't harp on that.

												Very rare I can't finish a game.  I tried so hard, got so far and then got so fed up and bored that I just gave up on it.  I just didn't care about the characters enough to finish.  Save your money.  The mechanics of the game are literally clicking through lines of boring dialogue and then choosing which of the boring character you want to talk to about their miserable, depressing lives and issues.  Occasionally you get the opportunity to pick up a stick or click on something.  Probably the worst game I have ever played.  Kind of saddening, as I had looked forward to this for a while, luckily I picked it up cheaper on another website, so I didn't pay the full price, thankfully.  I can't say I've ever played a game before where I wanted the characters to die so the game would end.			"

												This game is an interesting experiment with choice and consequence mechanics that, unfortunately, falls short. The lack of emotional impact when making a choice or dealing with its consequences contrasts with its superior compeitors from Bioware and Tell Tale Games. Unfortunately, it is not very funny nor is it very touching, despite subject matter and dialogue that suggests that it is trying to accomplish both of these things.I do sincerely hope the creators will continue to work on more story and choice based games in the future, as I think video games have vast untapped potential in story-telling, but I can't honestly recommend this as an example of succeeding at that goal.

												The game (taking my time) took me less then an hour to complete. I found the characters flat and the choices somewhat non-sense...things just sort of happened regardless of your decisions. I think the idea is cool and maybe for 2 bucks the experience would have been worth it, but for what I paid and what I got I wasn't impressed. I get the whole point of the game is to play it multiple times but after about my third play through I just couldn't stomach doing the same parts over and over just to see every little twist. If the characters had been more interesting and if my choices were more dynamic and had clearer outcomes I think I would have enjoyed this a lot more. Cool concept just wasn't a fan of the execution.			"

												Dyscourse is a weird game. It tries to force the player to make hard choices about survival, while attempting to be light and easy to play through. Each character is more of a cartoon than an actual fleshed out, relatable person in the story. Dyscourse felt a bit confused about what it was trying to achieve. A short ""choose your own adventure"" with funny dialog? Or a serious, thoughtful narrative? Owlchemy failed at both, which is really unfortunate because I liked the way the game itself was structured. Easy puzzles, lots of dialog and a solid art style.I will not be recommending Dyscourse at this time, but who knows? Maybe the upcoming Indie Island DLC will be more confident about its identity.

The short days (1 day consisted of feeding 2 people and sleeping) and poor story telling deterred me as a player.All characters are incompetent and heavily dependent on the player.

												Why is this review negative!? Well, heres why.You may be suprised to know, I love this game. I saw PewDiePie play it and had to get it for myself. The choices really do matter and really do affect the story quite dearly. For example, there are quite a few character deaths, but they can be prevented with the right choices. These characters that you saved with your choices can stick around til the end of the game, so it isnt a TellTale desicion where the character dies one or two episodes later. With all these positives, what could I possibly be giving Dyscouce a negitive review for? Well, I dont know if its just my computer, but, there is a scene in the game. This scene is quite a good scene, and frankly, I'd love to finish it. So what happens is, I am awoken by thunder and am alerted there is flooding going on near my tent. One of the characters, Teddy, suggests we leave our flooded site, and find new ground. The rest of the group, Steve(If you saved him) Garret(If you saved him) George(if you saved him) and Jolene(if you saved her) attempt to shut Teddy up. You have a choice to agree with Teddy and tell the group to pack up, or disagree with Teddy and stay. Now, I do not know what happens with either, because likewise, each will end up crashing my game with a few simple words ""Rita go get a torch"". If we stay, Teddy will be crushed by a tree and Rita, the player, will have to go get a torch. When going to get the torch however, my game will crash. Same goes with the other choice. If we attempt to leave, Jolene will tell me to get a torch. My game will crash on the way there. If the creator of the game sees this, please help me and I'd be happy to give you a wonderful review. A review this fantasitc  game deserves. BTW, I have a Windows 7 Laptop. Thank you.			"

However, the game is pretty much just a choose your own adventure/visual novel. You can move around and interact with one or two items, but otherwise its Click through the Dialogue then make a choice. Click through more dialague and make another choice. Meh.

												Dyscourse is a survival-themed choose-your-own-adventure with plenty of difficult choices. During your playthroughs you'll eventually find some new items or paths to further explain the backstories of the characters. The biggest reason I even decided to play this was the art. It's beautiful.On the other hand I didn't enjoy the music. It was very repetitive. Also, getting attached to the characters was pretty difficult. They don't try very hard to make you like them. But that's ok.Your ""teammates"" aren't very proficient in surviving, so if you want to have something done, SPOILER: do it yourself. Otherwise it'll get someone killed or they get nothing done.

												The game is cute, if limited in scope. The story of the game itself is necessarily short due to the fact that it is ""emergent"" but ultimately I don't think I like having 100 different choices over 10 different choices in a more gripping, original story. The story is no more complex than a kids' cartoon, you and some other people are stranded on a desert island and have to survive. It feels more like a really nice looking and sounding tech demo. Easily worth the amount I paid for it in the Humble Bundle but I don't think I would buy it at full price. The decisions you make are incredibly arbitrary, much like a typical Choose Your Own Adventure book where what seems like the right choice will suddenly lead to tragedy for no reason. With choices like that, it's more like trial and error to get the best possible ending, as you will likely not get it on your first try because it's just so random.While I am sure a ton of work went into the game, it's really more like a mildly interesting diversion than something you would call incredible.

												Very short but very nice. Don't expect anything dramatic like telltale games, but the writing is nice and solid, and the game branches in really different directions depending on what you decide. The characters are not one-dimensional as you can think at first, but in order to findout more about all of them you'll definitely have to go through more than one playthroughI don't raccomend it at full price though, 'cause it's really short and in 6 hours (minus time I spent afk) I got all the achievements.Una trama ben scritta che si differenzia a seconda di quello che il giocatore sceglie, non drammatico come i giochi della telltale, ma vale sicuramente la pena giocarlo.

The consequences of your choices usually do not make sense. I'm also disappointed that  you cannot save all the survivors within the same playthrough. ever.  "

												Fun little game, not wort the $15. It has some replay value and the games sometimes makes you feel like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for making your choices. Takes about an hour to complete the story,			"

												I'm reluctantly giving this a thumbs up, because it had pretty graphics and there was some enoyable content. However, the game is pretty much just a choose your own adventure/visual novel. You can move around and interact with one or two items, but otherwise its Click through the Dialogue then make a choice. Click through more dialague and make another choice. Meh. And while you can change your choices by replaying, the game is still way too short imo. I'll probably play it again to unlock some achievements, but I'm glad I bought it on sale and didn't pay full price.			"

												Do you remember the choose-your-own-adventure books? Well, this is the video game version. I loved the choose-your-own-adventure books, and I love this game. One play through won't take you long (less than 1 hour), but the addicting part is going back and figuring out all the different outcomes; how each individual choice shapes (or doesn't shape) the final outcome. The art style is unique, and gameplay is relaxed. Watch how each choice you make allows for the survival, injury, death, or rescue of your group of plane crash survivors stranded on a tropical island. Recommended for casual gamers and lovers of choose-your-own-adventure books.			"
