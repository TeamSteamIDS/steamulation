												A rather complex grand strategy game, you pick a country to control starting from the year 1444 all the way to 1821. There isn't any fixed objective to aim for: it's  a good idea to try to get the achievements offered (such as world domination), as most are a real challenge to earn. Each country is divided into provinces, allowing movement of you armies from one to another in real time - nothing here is turn based. Battles aren't controlled by you, as in total war: you make your army walk onto the same province as an opposing army, and the battle outcome is decided in part by random dice rolls, and in part by factors you can influence, such as generals, terrain, morale of troops. The same can be said for naval battles, where different types of ships behave differently depending on what sea province you are fighting in, if they are in the open ocean, or in a closed sea (such as the Mediterranean). Diplomacy is fairly well fleshed out, countries can have a number of different governments, such as feudal monarchies or merchant republics, all that give different bonuses and maluses, and some (such as republics) offer the possibility to choose what type of leader you want, so as to give you more of a certain type of monarch points. You can offer alliances, royal marriages, support rebels, create false claims on provinces you don't own to give you a ""casus belli"" (a reason to go to war) among other things, the list is really really huge.Monarch points are a ""limiting factor"" in the game, you have 3 different types of monarch points (Administrative, Diplomatic, Military), each that serve different purposes. For example, military points can be spent to buy a new general, or to treat a province harshly if rebels are likely to rise up there. (As of the Art of War update, rebel mechanics have changes slightly. Instead of each province possibly spawning rebels depending on a percentage, now each rebel faction has a counter that goes up or down depending on your country's stability and province modifiers, such as nationalism, culture or religion. Once the counter reaches 100%, multiple stacks of rebels spawn). Other points can be used to change your capital, annex vassals, gain provinces in peace deals, create buildings and much more. The gain of monarch points depend on your ruler, that can give from 0 points each to 6 point each month. By spending some of your income, you can also hire advisors, that can add to your monthly monarch points income, and grant you some nationwide bonuses. Trade is also a large factor in the game, you have merchants and you can choose to send them to various trade nodes, and you can choose if you want them to try and collect money from that node with a malus, or to send the money that you collect upstream, to a different node where you can collect from. Having colonies and trade agreements with other countries helps your trade income, while being embargoed reduces your trade in nodes that the country embargoing you controls. As of the ""Common Sense"" update eu4 has a revamped fortress mechanic, given out for free. Now fortresses are placed in various provinces in your country (you can also choose to build them once you have the money), and they exert a ""zone of control"". Provinces without forts on them are very easy to conquer while in war, while provinces with fortresses on them have to be seiged or assaulted to fall under the attackers control. Forts now block enemy units from advancing, allowing the defending nation to have some space to reorganize and prepare defences, while the attacking nation has to carefully choose how and where to attack so as to lose the least amount of troops. Unoccupied forts also have a ""zone of control"": If you conquer a province next to a fort, but leave the fort to itself, the fort will free any occupied neighbouring province while at war. I love these changes, especially if you play a large nation, as it adds a whole extra layer of strategy to how you build up you nation's provinces.Paradox has created a lot of DLC for this game, but with each DLC comes a vast amount of free content as well, so it might be advisable to buy the base game before buying DLC, so as to see what you think about the game before commiting too much. If you choose to play online with a friend that owns the DLCs, even without owining the DLCs yourself, the game activates them, so its possible to try them out before you buy. It would also be a good idea to try and watch a tutorial beforehand (Arumba on youtube comes to mind), as the game doesn't do a great job of explaining all it has to offer. It's a very time-consuming, and occasionaly frustrating game, but I found that the more I played it, the more I enjoyed it: I'm constantly learning new things I can use to my adantage, and the game is becoming more satisfying due to that.

												Sadly due to the rapidly globalized economy and world we live in, exploiting indigenous populations is not nearly as easy nor profitable as it used to be. But thanks to the fine people at Paradox Interactive, I can unleash the inner beast that resides within all white European christians and do my part for humanity. Once I get bored from ousting the filthy Turkomans from Constantinople (not giving it back to Byzantium because ♥♥♥♥ orthodoxy Pope #1 forever get rekt bearded priests) I can turn my furious and just gaze across the atlantic and kill lots of savages (not my fault those filthy natives were living on Burgundian Florida). Soon the whole world will be swathed in burgundian colors, or all thats actually worth ruling (not ruling africa because africa and lots of zulu rebellions plus mosquitos).This game is best played with a warm cup of Folger's coffee in your hands, so you can actually smell the oppression while you relive the greatest period of time of all time. The period when white people discovered the world, and decided they didnt like it.			"

												Never thought that a strategy game would be the most thrilling gaming experience I have.But scrupulous, hour long planning and carefully forging alliances and marriages, while keeping an eye on which direction rival countries are sending their diplomats to, because one wrong move can turn your plans to dust, is much more addictive than you might think. The relief you feel, after a long term plan of yours is finally set into successful motion, is not describable.One of the few games where careful planning and thinking is actually rewarded. No simple rock-paper-scissors battles like in other strategy games. Even though my enemy may have the bigger and more advanced army, I might have won the war through logistics already. Everything that needs to be said about this game, has actually been said already, but I just can't pass on the chance to show my appreciation for it. I'm +90hrs in, and I'm still finding new ways to play this game, everytime I start it up. It's complex, deep and rewards the player that thinks on a larger scale. One of the best purchases I made in years.			"

												After playing Civilization 5 for quite a long time, I have started to become interested in a deeper gameplay with deeper political consequences, better religions, and more interesting colonize mechanics I couldn't do in Civilization. Of course there are plenty of mods to extend the gameplay for Civilization, but a new game, where everything is new, is fresh and exciting.So let’s shall begin with topics I want to ""review"".Music Most of the times are peaceful songs whistling in the background, but the music dynamically changes when going to war with another country, which is trying to boost the morale of the player, which usually works. The weird part about the peaceful songs are, that they are somewhat forgettable, but will stick to your head so that you may find yourself whistling a tune of a melody a week later.DLC’s There are many... Way too many DLC's that did come out for this game.Luckily they are usually units getting a better design, for 2€ each so you are not missing out on too much. The ones which are more expensive have definitely more going on. For example the ""new"" DLC ""Conquest of Paradise"" enhances the colonization mechanics which were, at the beginning of the game, a bit lackluster, but more on that later.Countries The country’s themselves are from the year 1444 to 1821, the interesting part about them is, that you are absolutely free to choose which date you are going to start, that means you can play against revolutionary French as Austria or play as Portugal to colonize the new world.AI The AI has a certain points of intelligence made out of preference, there are militaristic, diplomatic, passive and colonizing leaders for each country with their accurate ruler of that time. That is, until you start playing and the heirs will be completely different than actual history of course. The human player gets treated just like an AI to other AI's, if you conquer they will hate you, if you don't have any alliances they are going to attack you, that's why there's that certain point of risk of alliances with the AI, which can make your AI ally to an enemy faster than you might think. Just never trust them too much...Ideas The idea system is a way to put more of your own preference into the country that you are playing, there are currently 71 unique idea groups for specific country’s, 18 group ideas for country regions (like Italy) and 8 possible slots for your own idea groups to choose which consist of another 7 ideas. That sounds like a lot, and it certainly was a pain for the creators, but it was well worth it. It gives most of the countries just their own specialty. But I'm not going to go into that sort of stuff.Colonization The new made colonization concept is a simple but innovative one. Get exploration ideas, Colonize more than 5 provinces in a certain region and a colonial vassal gets created. The colonial vassal is just like another country, but he has to pay taxes and can't attack you. You can control these taxes on your own, but never set these taxations too high, because you know what happened with the USA and Great Britain at that time. Independence wars definitely can get a strain on you, if you know that you have to travel across the Atlantic Ocean to fight a war.There are certainly way more things I could try talking about, but I just want to bore the casuals and try to keep the strategic fans interested, especially the fighting mechanics and monarch points, but I don't want to tell you everything. There is that certain interest I wanted to awake in some people, so that they are going to try this game for themselves, and not get ultimately bored because I just told them everything of the game.For most of the people the Price is going to be the main issue with this game, 40€ certainly is quite a lot in the steam shop, but that's why special sales exist. If it's getting 50% off I can definitely recommend it.The game managed to keep my interest for other 265 Hours now, and hasn't even bored me a bit so far.It's probably a game what you are going to get in touch and love it, or try it and hate it.I hope I managed to get some peoples interest, and if you are still reading this, thanks for reading my first proper review. It means quite a lot to me.MfG Artjom "

												Decide to go hard mode for first game and play as the Huron Native American tribe.Start date is 1444.Things go well for first 150 years.Conquer and assimilate other tribes into federation.Feels wrong but i know i have to do it or else I'll be too weak when the Europeans arrive to fk everything up.Iroquois, Shawnee, Machican all fall to me.Spainish colony shows up in southern Texas.""No biggie"" I think ""that's really far from my borders."" (Ohio and the Great Lakes regions)I finally get colonists and start gaining territory for myself.Begin exploitation of natives even more backward than me.Feels so wrong, but i know i have to do it or else I'll be too weak when the Europeans start really ♥♥♥♥♥ everything up.France colonizes Northeast, Netherlands colonizes Middle States, Britain colonizes the South.I manage to Westernize, so gaining new technology costs like 200 points and not 2000.Choose not to become Catholic, and keep the Totemist ways of my ancestorsWage war against Netherlands with newly gained musket infantry while they're at war with Austria back in Europe.Still have weaker troops, despite having 30k more men in each engagement.Tens of thousands of proud Huron die to make menial gains.Manage to besiege every settlement in the New Netherlands colony, but Brandenburg shows up and saves their ♥♥♥.Hastily make pay a ton of money for a peace treaty. (I'm surprisingly rich, since I control nearly all trade in Ohio River)Realize about 50000 men died for nothing and shed a single tear.Time passes - 1680sFrench expand north from Louisiana, Spain has all of Texas and California, Vinland wins independence war from Norway and becomes Canada.I gain an alliance with Great Britain since we both hate French.France declares war against Britain cause they want Puerto Rico.We beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of them, and Britain negotiates it so I get a province on the Louisiana-Huron border (thx GB)Things are looking good for Huron, since with my superpower buddy Britain, I wont get fked up by Europeans.Win a war against Canada, but again tens of thousands die to kill a few thousand Canadians since im still behind in tech.Time passes - 1780sCanada declares war to get back that province i previously took.""No biggie,"" I think ""I beat them once, I can beat them again.""Realize theyre in an alliance with France.Moments later I get a message telling me Great Britain has dishonored our alliance and wont be helping me.Realize I'm alone in a war against two technologically superior opponents who dramatically outnumber me.Can only watch in horror as the French and Canadians ravage my country.Shed a single tear and realize this is what my people did to the natives in real life.Cry in guilt.10/10  This game taught me more about Imperialism and why it was a terrible terrible thing than my high school and college history classes combined, and made me relate to minorities more than any bleeding heart activist ever could.its all a prank guys			"

												There is a button in EUIV that allows you to ""change culture"" in a province. It costs Diplomatic power based on how deeply rooted the culture is in that province, and once it is completed you will have instilled your nation's primary culture in the province. The game tells you that the benefits of having your nation's culture in all of your provinces include higher taxes received from your citizens, and lower risk of revolts. So, of course you click the button. Who wouldn't want that?What you may not realize is that by clicking that button, you are not introducing the local people to your nation's way of life. You are systematically wiping that culture off the map. You begin the slaughter of an entire people.Genocide is literally a click away. And you, as a leader, don't even give it a second thought. That is the kind of power you experience firsthand in this game.10/10 would destroy an entire people and their way of life again.			"

												Whilst some companies face a period of decadence and incompetence, Paradox Interactive is showing everyone else that real time grand strategy games are a commitment of theirs. Edifying a refined formula that will make you delve countless hours, you’ll be faced with many challenges, such as conducting successful military campaigns, achieving diplomatic brilliance, backstabbing your enemies and even your allies, mastering perfidious intrigue, spreading your influence, dealing with religious strife, provincial management, colonial affairs, reforming your state, all is within your reach, can you carry your legacy throughout the sands of time?Needless to say the game is a technical marble with many years of support ahead, the gameplay is both complex and very addicting so much that you’ll want to change your daily routines to quench your thirst for this illustrious nectar, if you have good ear then you’ll fall in love with the memorable soundtracks Andreas Waldetoft crafted.If you are willing to take your time and learn the many complex mechanics this game possesses, forgive the occasional lag and the confusing interface that needs improvement, you’ll be selling yourself to one of the most enjoyable experiences ever!9.5/10			"

												Ah yes, Europa Universalis IV, what is there to say about this game that hasn't already been said? History becomes your plaything as you choose among any country that existed in the year 1444 and until 1821, not just in Europe in spite of what the name suggests, but also in Asia, Africa and the Americas. You can play as one of the big boys or you can opt to play as a smaller country and try to carve out an empire as you tangle with the big fish. Be advised that the game has a steep learning curve. Even I, in spite of my several hundreds of hours of playing this game, still do not fully understand certain aspects. The game just keeps throwing new things into your face, and considering how often Paradox releases expansion packs and update patches, the game will continue to have enough stuff to interest you for a long time to come. Whether you're an achievement hunter, a master strategist or just a casual with an interest in history, this game has something to offer you if you're willing to invest the time to learn it. The choices you can make in this game are nearly limitless; create the world's largest land-based empire or rule the seas (or both). Control the flow of trade, or ignore it and focus on the production of goods in your lands (or both). Colonize the Americas, or play as a Native American tribe and crush the colonialists. Conquer India as a European power, or conquer Europe as an Indian power. Wage holy war against the heathens and heretics of the world, or leave them be. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. If you feel really daring you can do some truly ludicrous stuff. Play as an islamic Papal State, or create a Catholic Arabian empire. Or relocate your country to another part of the world entirely (Portugal in India, Norway in Canada, Ireland in New York, Georgia in Georgia, if you can imagine it, it is probably possible).  In Europa Universalis IV you are a painter and the entire world is your canvas. So go on, and paint the world your color.			"

												In Europa Universalis IV you play a powerful sorcerer that acts as the ""guiding hand"" for the nation.  The spells you cast draw on three mana pools: Paper Mana, Bird Mana, and Sword Mana.  Bird mana is used to make peace deals, genocide cultures, and stop your people from whining about war weariness.  Paper mana, in combination with a gold sacrifice, can be used to cast construction spells, in addition to making a province you gained two years ago a core part of your nation somehow.  Sword mana is used for enchanting rebel factions to keep them in line.  You generate mana for these pools by sucking the life essence from your monarch and his cabinet of advisors.  Be careful, though, as the ones that generate the most mana tend to die rather quickly.  You'll frequently see your 6/4/5 monarch die by age 30.You'll notice that most of the spells are involved with either war or keeping your people from whining about war.  Don't worry, that's by design.  There's nothing to do if you aren't at war.10/10 it's okay			"

												One of the best games I played. Europa Universalis IV is meant for thousands of hour of play time and the amount of replayability available is incredible. You could just add thousands of hours into just by the vanllia version but no it doesn't stop there.There is even a bigger mod community in Europa Universalis IV then the predecessor (Europa Unversalis III) so be prepared to play until the next Europa Universalis game.+ all the expansions they could make for Europa Universalis IV will be even a better game then now.My rating 10/10I would advise you to buy it if you're into Strategy and history and *What if scenarios*Edit: A new expansion is coming out called Conquest Of Pardise which will give us more land to and more native tribes to conquer + A new system will be input for when you conquer or when you are colonising. New nations will appear for example if you are playing as England when you are colonising Mexico English Mexico will appear. + New colonial countries will be enable to reble against you if there liberty is high enough and if they have all the requirements they might be able to form the USA or Mexico+ You will have a option to randomize North American and South American as a option which is very strange for Paradox because they usually try and make everything historically accurate but it's a nice twist for players that are sick of the same old continent of North American and South American			"

												Iam sorry Paradox, but i have to write this now. I realy like Europa Universalis IV, as i played now over 1600 Hours. You can have fun with these games, spend hour after hour with it. I also played Multiplayers in a bigger scale for over two years. I will not say the game is bad or not worth a bit of money...but there is a big argument against this game, or i would say against the DLC-Policy of Paradox. It is just insane how this is managed. Just take a look at the numbers...Steam tells me all DLC cost more than 230€ now. Okay lets say half of that is stuff you dont need, content packs etc...still 130€ plus the game for 40€. Iam no new player and played from the first years on and bought everything when it came out. But do you even know how stupid it is if you have friends just starting the game and telling them which DLC they need and stuff? They release a new DLC every few months with a few new things. Often they are good and iam very exited. But the are not everytime worth all the money. And they must be making alot of money thinking about the price. And i know...they say we put out new DLC to get some money to further develop the game and the game will get new content as long as the people buy the DLCs. Okay, that may sound good at first. But how do other game studios manage their stuff? Do they need to get out new DLC every few months for 20-30€(DLC+Contentpack)? NO. And that is almost the price of the whole game. And a DLC might bring some new stuff but not half of the game. So it is just too expensive.But it does not stop there. Iam a real Paradox-Freak you could say. I play almost all their big titles, Victoria, Crusader Kings, Stellaris, City Skylines, Hearts of Iron...you name it, i played hundreds of hours. And almost everywhere it is the same b*llsh*t!!! I want to play some Crusader Kings? Have to buy 2-3 DLCs to be on the newest Version. Stellaris the same. HoI4 the same. Skylines the same. What is that? I was so hyped about Stellaris. And the game was only half done, felt hollow and now they probably want to go the EU4 way and fix it over the years with tons of DLC. I just cant stand it anymore. After these many years iam frustrated and angry. I dont want to support this any longer. And what i hate the most about it, that maybe in a few months, i have some money, theres a sale and i will buys this freakin DLC anyway. BUT I HATE THEIR POLICY! AND I STILL WANT TO PLAY THAT STUFF! THEY GOT ME AND THEY USE ME! Combining all their game i probably payed them over 1000€ already. *Put a bad word here*!But they could do it differently. Why not bring out REAL DLC or a decent Add-On. Or Victoria 3. Where the hell is Victoria 3? Victoria was the best game they made in my opinion. But whatever. Someday Paradox will see that their way is the wrong way. Many people i know think the same. They are ruining these great games.tl;dr:If you are looking for an advice...the game is fun and you will probably like it. But Paradox has a real ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLC-Policy. After a few years you will hate them, just like me.EDIT (from Commentsection 07.04.2017):I like the game and i have fun. Iam only using this review as the only form of protest i have besides not buying the DLC.I hope it has an impact, but iam not sure.Iam happy to see, that they have bigger Bundles now that combine different DLCs.So the packages are bigger now. That is a step in the right direction.I think this was partly done because people like me, who love the game, complain and are not brainwashed like the fanboys. Just because a game is very good, that does not mean you cant say something critical about it.I will give a positive review when iam happy with the the way the next DLCs will be.			"

												EU4 is simply the best strategy game ever made.Prior to putting over 1000 hour in EU4 I was a hardcore Civilization player. All Civ games (1-5) were a day 1 purchase for me, putting in hundreds of hours in each game. After a friend introdued me to EU4, I realized how much more a strategy game could be, and how EU4 makes games like Civilization feel obsolete. The amount of options can be overwhelming for new players, but the satisfaction of mastering the system and understanding why things happen is much more gratifying.An important factor everyone sees when they hear about EU4 is the amount of DLC / expansions the game has. So i figure i'll point out what's useful.All of the unit packs are entirely optional, but the larger DLCs range from game changing to near pointless (depending on your choice of country)Group A - Must have, game changing.1. Art of War - The single most important DLC, transfer seiges and more peace deals options. Every war is different if you have this DLC.2. Common Sense - This DLC is to peace-time as Art of War is to War-time. Develop your provinces, more government and subject options. National Focus. Group B - Noticeable, not 100% necessary1. El Dorado - If custom nations is huge point for you, this could be moved to Group A (I'd aruge the game gives plenty of options, but custom nations are super fun too!) Colonization is made much better and randomised world.2. Wealth of Nations -  Trade companies, National Focus ( if you don't have Common Sense), Privateers, Extra Religion Options3. Rights of Man - Great Power options, improves the late game.4. The Cossacks - Estates, Horde UnityGroup C - Rarely impactful but still can change the game under certain conditions.1.  Mare Nostrum - Sailors, Espionage2. Conquest of Paradise - Getting to play as a Colonial Nation3. Res Publica - The netherlands and Poland DLCI undertand how people play the game can change which DLCs are important to them, so everyone wont agree with this list, but for a new player this is what i would recommend.The game and DLCs go on sale often, no strategy fan will regret the purchase.

												Europa Universalis IV is the best game I've played throughout my whole life.Pros:-If you like History, this game is going to be your new way of understanding history and it will develop your comprehension of the exterior world. -You will learn a lot about the history of nations and civilizations in this game, especially about the European History.-If you have ever thought that you knew what a strategy game is, this game will change your way of thinking about strategy games in Pc platforms.-This game is beyond a classic, its originality is what strengthens its superiority as an historical game. You will feel challenged many times throughout the game.-You will have immense empires yet you will feel weak, you will own only a small town yet you will feel strong-You will start to question the essence of power in history throughout this game whether it is military, trade, diplomacy, administration, navy, technology, religion or any other concept.-There are nearly infinite scenarios that you can come up with, but you will see that the game will converge to a certain point where today's strong nations yield a hefty source of power, and the game allows you to interfere into history by enabling you to come up with an alternative one; if you are capable of it.-You will never be satisfied with what you have done so far in the game, because there is always going to be another way of doing things right-The game is evolving, and it is hard to keep up with the pace of changes in the hardcoded AI strategies, the AI is as powerful as if it is cheating. Forget about the insane bots in fps games, these bots will crush you so bad you will want to delete this game.-Some recent minor changes in the structure of the game mechanics is disabling you to overexpand quickly, if you are a player that has aggressive strategies, you will have a hard time playing this game; it is a game that requires patience.Cons:-The Pope is never reasonable.-The Holy Roman Emperor is always demanding. And he just marries consorts.-Turks don't care about anyone, they just right click on you and declare war and suddenly you find yourself preparing for higher technology to flee to Mars.-Franks always start the matches 1-0 ahead.-Italians never unify, they just build lots of ships and play a monopoly game of trade.-You can ignore the Commonwealth region as if it is a huge grassland with lots of horses-The horses are selected through a breeding process, therefore they tend to be old and experienced and legitimate.-Russians love to colonize frozen land, they just love to make the circumnavigation through land.-Spaniards enjoy discovering poor natives. But they are good catholics.-The British is unpredictable as usual. Lots of ships and pride all over the world, attention to the Royal Navy though, just kite around it. They are so Royal they will never split so you can always escape from those 500 ships somehow.-The Dutch is the Pandora Box of the EuIV.-The German Princes are angry.-Plus they like upsetting the pope.-The Scandinavians butcher each other for 500 years.-No one know what happens in India.-Same stands for China.-Same stands for Middle Asia.-Same stands for inner Africa.-Ulm has joined a coalition against us.WORRISOME!Overall, I recommend this game; even though how try-hard it might get, it is still challenging and fun.

												Guys, this DLC policy has to stop. $27.99 for the newest expansion and the content pack? Does anyone think there is enough being released with these packs to justify the price? More to the point, why does Paradox think is a good price? I would bet they'd get far more sales from a $10 expansion and a $5 content pack.Right now with the current sale it would cost a new player nearly $160 to buy the game and everything they've released alongside the game. Without the sale the price is well over $200. Abhorrent. Even worse, the base game costs less than what they want for many of the packs at the moment: $9.99 for EU4, and $13 for the Rights of Man expansion. Now compare the fact that the base game costs $40 without a sale and they want $28 for the newest content. Nearly 75% of the asking price for the main game, for the tenth ""expansion.""I love Paradox's strategy games, they're some of the most played games in my library - but I can't support this anymore. And you shouldn't either. If all of us said enough was enough, they would have to listen. We are their consumer base, our purchasing power counts.			"

												Listen to a person who loved this game and played it for over 1200 hours so far... This game is really amazing BUT... Paradox's DLC policy has ruined it because it continues updating a game which was perfect right from the start. Now the DLC policy consists of giving a free patch along with a new DLC almost every two months, forcing us to invest more and more money to have a complete game, because THE FREE PATCH BREAKS THE GAME AND MAKES IT UNPLAYABLE IN SOME AREAS OR TOTALLY BREAKS SOME MECHANICS UNLESS YOU BUY THE DLC COMING WITH IT wich costs 15 to 20 Euros. I'm really getting sick of this since the developers announced that they ""have a lot of ideas"" for at least the upcoming two years and they want to release more DLCs"". Really, I spent around 40 Euros simply to buy the game with 3 DLCs and I am truly convinced that it was not worth it. 20 Euros for a DLC that adds so few content is really a shame and I hope that the developers will make a step back selling those DLCs for 5 Euros (I'm not saying free, because I want to evaluate their job, but 20 or 15 Euros are seriously an insult) because they are doing a scam towards the people who are trying to have the complete game that they like and played a lot.

												This game is a hell of a lot better than Civilization. I've been playing it for... I don't know how long, a few weeks. From the time I wake up until the time I go to sleep, eating between wars, literally dreaming about my kingdom and after about 200 hours playing I haven't got tired of it yet.But perhaps you'd like to hear a story. Maybe a tale of woe, of blood and vengeance...Austria, 1653. IronMan mode.My King was yet another re*ard in a long line of mentally challenged Habsburgs. Administration was difficult, for he didn't know how to count from 0 to 10 by the age of 46. Pen and paper were alien artifacts for this man, who considered burping after a meal with international envoys a diplomatic act. I was proud once, when I learned he loved guns. And forever ashamed when I found out he couldn't fathom how to work a trigger. He became a General as soon as he turned 15 and then, for the first time, he was good at something... no, I'm  kidding, he was terrible. I'm sure his kind mother put that one star over his head. She didn't fool anyone. Well... no one but the king himself, of course... silly kid...So, as a good christian overlord, I was patient-- and spent 30 years trying to kill him, spearheading the ""special"" monarch into the most challenging battles. Soon I started to fear he had been blessed with immortality to compensate for his almighty uselessness. The damned French on my western border had a 6/4/6 sadist on their throne. My neighbor's lawn was greener than mine. I was desperate.Hence came the time when I, the Holy Roman Emperor, accidentally enacted a cursed reform that wouldn't allow me to wage war against the Empire's members anymore, bringing my struggle towards unifying the HRE almost to a halt. But I had hope in my heart, for if no tragedy happened and I managed to keep peace, the 170 years left to play should be enough for me to gather 150 Imperial Autorithy points to fulfill my objective. I had 3 provinces left under foreign rule waiting for the taking and that should guarantee my success-- so I demanded what was rightfully mine.I went to war against my oldest friend and ally, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Again. They were so scared that even with their half-russian-size territory they didn't put up a fight-- literally not one, while I went on rampaging through their territory. I needed one more point for them to accept my peace offer and return the Empire's provinces when it happened...They sent forth a 62 regiments army against me, a 3 star general leading it. They didn't stand a chance against my 130 invading regiments, of course, which was about half my army at that time. But they were brave, and chose to forfeit their lives for the sake of their homeland. So a massive battle began-- and it unraveled quickly. The fight went on for less than a month when... my f****** s** of a b**** piece of s*** excuse for a King died in it. Yeah, sure, I was euphoric for a moment. But no, it turns out those weren't good news because...With his demise I lost the elections to be the next Emperor-- for the first time, mind you-- so I didn't get the 10 Imperial Authority bonus. A few days (or seconds) later, after the previously mentioned battle was won and so was the war, the Empire's territories were proudly returned by me. And then I learned you can only gain Authority if you are the current Emperor. The new guy at the office, the Holy chairman of the ancient Roman Empire, the 15 year old King of a useless single-province kingdom, laughed at me. I felt it, I swear. I'll remember that moment until the day I die... possibly even longer than that...So after about 10 minutes screaming at my computer and one more hour cursing inside my head, I recovered my sanity once again, kept it cool, and decided to wipe the Holy Roman Empire from the face of the Earth. I'm halfway there, but the more than a million rebel soldiers spawning everywhere across my kingdom are delaying my war efforts. Still, I shall have my vengeance. Sorry, I had to put that out there. A 15 year old Saxe-Lauenburgian kid as the Holy Emperor... what a joke. I'll give him his first shave with a flying cannonball.EDIT:With inhuman effort and, of course, the help of God himself (thank you, Pope) I reverted my situation and finally managed to unify the HRE. Now, in 1753, from the edges of a long-gone Hungary to the borders of Spain, Europe is under my rule.But you wonder: ""Why does that matter?"" And I tell you: because it means if I had been born in 1444 there would have been no World War I, this review would be written in Deutsche (or maybe I would have brought latin back, who knows?), and my grandson¹³² would rule Earth. Knowing that, I can finally sleep in peace. I feel my entire life had a meaning, and now a whole new purpose... to play Castile next. (After becoming a junior partner in a Personal Union under Spain, winning my independence alone against them and England, vassalizing the Ottomans and succumbing to a Civil War caused by the sudden, premature death of my first independent king made me give up on returning my westernized Byzantium to it's former glory-- by the 17th century again, obviously the worst hundred of years in human history)			"

												I have written this review to negate some of the unfair reviews that give this game a negative score. I do admit the last couple of dlcs have been lackluster (Mare Nostrum, and The Cossacks specifically), however if the dlcs are not giving enough content for their price do not buy it. It is your choice if you decided to pay fifteen dollars for a lackluster dlc and the opinon of the dlc should not be the determination for the base game's score. There are many excellent expanions released for eu4, that in my opinon would negate any negativity from the last two expansions .The base game in itself is a game that I would reccomend playing. I have played many hours in vanilla itself. The game is a grand strategey with much more depth than games like the civ series. You play a nation of your choosing, and attempt to do as best as you can with it. Some nations are easier than other due to this game being based on history ( France is stronger than a Native American nation). The game is like a puzzle, many hours will be spent figuring out alliances, truces, aggressive expansion opinon modifiers, religion to be able to conquer the world without destroying yourself in the process. There are national ideas and events which make many nations unique in their playstyle, and there are idea groups which you unlock which give you various bonuses that can further specalize your nation. One thing that is amazing about this game is whenever something happens that could ruin my game it is always my fault, and it is something that you can learn from and choose to never make the same mistake again.The DLC is one thing that is essential to review, there are a lot of dlc for this game. Don't judge the game on the the price of every dlc combined, many DLC are just cosmetic and music addition packs. There are a few dlcs that are expansions to the game ( Res Publica, Wealth of Nations, Conquest of Paradise, Art of War, and Common Sense) which in my opinon are all essential and worth every penny spent on them. If you are scared of the hefty base price of these dlc combined, don't be scared as they frequently go for sale up to 75% off, so you can get all these expansions for less than 10 dollars if you wait for good sales. If you wait long enough the recent dlc (Cossacks and Mare Nostrum) will probably be given huge sales as well.I would not reccomend this game who are looking for quick fun, this is a game you sit down for hours at a time to plan and fail, and then restart the game over, and then fail but do a little better, then fail fail fail, and then you may finally perfect your game and do way better. A single playthrough can take around two weeks to get through, while it may take a lot of time it is really satisfying when all goes to plan and you acheive your goals. I would reccomend this to people who enjoyed civ games but are unsatisfied by the lack of depth or strategey in those games, I would reccomend this to people to have enjoyed playing Risk. In fact I reccomend this to most people I have met.tl:drA lot of reviews are being unfairly negative about this game to their opinon that the recent two expansions are overpriced for the content they delivir (I share this sentiment). However this game has a lot of other expansions that are really good that balance this out. The vanilla game is in itself really good. Don't expect a fast game, or something that you can just pick up and play I have played around 700 hours and am considered a intermediate player. While a bit diffcult to start it is an amazingly satisfying game when your plans come to fruitation. 10/10			"

												Just as a warning, I own every DLC (Costs a lot of $$$ but this studio deserves the support) and have played this game pretty extensively.Europa Universalis IV is a game focused around war, trade, and exploration.  What it really excels in is war, the other two 'focuses' of the game have been improved over time, but the game still revolves around war.  This wouldn't be a problem if with every patch they wouldn't make conquest more tedious.  From the 1.7 to the 1.8 patch (Art of War, released in November 2014), conquest was made much, much easier, and completing World Conquests (A particular feat, being the only independent nation left in the world) was made much easier.  From there, Paradox has been adding roadblock after roadblock to conquest.  This is okay, though.  If conquest was as easy as point and click, and no thought has to be put into it, then this game wouldn't be such an engaging, addicting, and fun experience.This game's learning curve is interesting.  I can't remember much of my early experience but you're given a complex yet simple interface, tooltips that don't mean much (which has been helped with some semi-recent patches), tutorials that also don't help much, and, of course, the shock of ""What am I supposed to do?  Is there a goal?""  The answer to those questions is both simple and intimidating, and it slaps you in the face rather abruptly.  It depends.  You do whatever it is you like, there is a score system but it doesn't really mean much.  That means that short of being in 1st place at the end of the game (which is rather easy for most nations), there is no goal.  You take control of your nation, you embody it.  That nation is you.  It took me about 4-6 hours to understand how to play the game, and another ~100 to 'git good'.  I stopped improving as a player (much) at about 1500 hours.In short, this game is about entering the renaissance, takes a huge time investment, is super fun, and hard to learn.10/10 -IGN.			"

												I love the game but I hate the ever rising cost if you want to play with expansions.  I would have given it a thumbs up but the DLC cost is getting stupid.  It's hard not to be lured in by the DLC as without buying it, you get a nagging feeling that your game is now incomplete, but it's getting beyond insane to try to keep up with the costs of playing.  I have other paradox games and it's the same thing, DLC DLC DLC.  I'm actually starting to miss being frustrated with my NES and constantly blowing into the cartridges to get them to work simply because a game had to be complete before being released as a ROM.  It had to be bug free or it didn't sell once word of mouth got out.  Sure the games were simpler but I do recall actually having fun playing them.  Now it's getting to the point that they are simply becoming increasingly expensive timekillers.  I wish there was a mixed button instead of just an up or downvote as I would click mixed at this point.  I want to click a thumbs up kinda, but every DLC that comes along just emphasizes,more and more, to me that the game just wasn't finished at launch.			"

												I will expand my review as someone found it probably unclear, i really loved this game from the 500+ hours of gaming you can see it, it is one of the most complex strategy games ever created.The huge issue here is the policy of the software house that developed it after the realease that i personally consider nothing less than criminal.When they realease a major dlc (expansions) the add new interesting mechanichs in the game, this would be perfect if at the same time they didn't brake some basic mechanics of the base game without that dlc. A perfect example of that is territory developement, if you don't have the dlc you cannot develop buildings in a country, which is a function of the base game that you could use before the dlc, and therefore i already bought with the basic game. That is nothing less than a theft.At the moment this can be a wonderfull game, but only if you are ready to spend 100€/$ on expansions dlc after buing the 50€ broken basic one.			"

												It’s taken me a while to wrap my head around what I now believe to be the reality that Europa Universalis IV is not a strategy game. It is an exquisitely detailed and complex simulator. Certainly you apply strategy to it to be successful within the simulation, but the point of the game is not to win. It is to explore possibilities, only a limited number of which are actually owned or even impacted by you. The smaller your nation or sphere of influence, the smaller impact you have on the world simulation.As a result, you can find yourself often just letting the history of the game take its course for a while without making any meaningful decision. It’s a game where you often drop a stone in the water and watch for the ripples. Yes, the game has an unbelievable number of systems, but you need to approach it from a context almost like playing with sliders to see what happens as opposed to making winning or losing moves. When you see that, you’re able to begin to unlock what the system is trying to show you.The easiest way to feel like you’ve failed at a game like EUIV is to play it like a traditional strategy game. The more you force your own ideas about external goals onto the game, the more challenging and resistant the game becomes, which, to be fair, is a fairly accurate representation of history as well. There’s a reason guys like Napoleon, Hitler or Alexander never win in the long run, and it’s because the more you impart your own will of domination on the world, the harder it becomes to maintain, control and stabilize.This game never lies to you, but it allows you to lie to yourself all the time. You can fool yourself, as so many tyrannical leaders have before, that you have amassed supreme power and that your ascension is a destiny and foregone conclusion, only to find yourself torn down low almost at once. It’s an illusion fostered by so many strategy games that came before. The difference is, in other games, the bigger you are, the bigger your base of power from which to exert domination. In EUIV, being bigger makes you strong, but potentially fragile, unstable and absolutely a target. "

												I generally like this game but there´s something ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off and prevents me from buying future titles of this franchise. The DLC policy is simply impertinent. Not only are the costs greatly exaggerated, the game is also forcing you to buy certain DLCs. There are some gamebreaking mechanics in the game which only get fixed by DLCs. Example?: You want to conquer a province. You get a claim on it. You declare war with your allies. Allies take the wanted province. Now you can not cede this claimed province to you during the peace talks because your allies have occupied it (aka you were not fast enough) unless you have The Art of War DLC.You are also unable to improve your economy which is a turn off for every smaller country. Your development level is fixed for the entire game... unless you have Common Sense DLC.			"

												At first, they made a few DLCs, and with every new DLC they also put out a free patch, and the really important features were included in the free patch, not in the DLC, so ""everything was fine"". In the meanwhile, they made cosmetic and historical content DLCs for the more passionate players, and even though anyone who enjoys the game would also enjoy those things, they still did not impair core gameplay, so ""everything was fine"".Then, they started making fundamental gameplay changes and delivered core new game features with the DLC, and the patches that accompanied the DLCs were merely balance tweaks and were made with the new DLC in mind. So now core gameplay features are behind a DLC paywall, plus whether you have said DLC or not, you get the game version which is balanced around the DLC, so you're screwed anyway. They did it once, and anyway they go on sale often, so ""everything was fine"". By when they had done it five times, you either gave in every time and paid for the new DLC, or by then the amount of core gameplay elements that you were locked out of by the DLC paywall was so big, and the balance of the game so focused around that, that you found yourself with a broken game you  couldn't effectively play anymore. A game that you loved, but now held hostage by around 150€ of DLCs. Blackmail much?You used to be different Paradox. I guess getting bigger has changed you for worse. Too bad.Edit: guys don't get this review in a wrong way: I still play the game and I still did buy most of the DLCs when they were on a 66%-75% sale. The problem is that Paradox used to be different and now they have become very unfriendly to their loyal fan base. It's not just the ludicrous amounts of DLCs and the shift from delivering core game elements via free patches to locking them behind a paywall. If you've ever been on their forums you know they have zero interest in the community feedback, just like you know there are bugs that have been present since day one of this game and haven't been fixed, and so on.My negative recommendation is for possible new players: if you're new to Paradox games I suggest you do not get into them at their current state. Currently they are a huge money sink, and a source of frustration due to bad game design decisions made ignoring community feedback and huge bugs left unfixed.			"

												Hello Gamers! PET here and I'm here to recommend you  Europa Universalis IV.EUIV is a Grand Strategy Game. That means it's pretty hard to pick up. It's something pretty unique. You start as early as 1444 and you can play with any country in the world. Yes, you head that right. ANY country in the world! The game also does not give you a purpose which makes the game a bit difficult. Some people find it hard to play a game when you don't know exactly what to do.So this is the thing. You pick any country in the world and you do whatever you want. You can pick Portugal and try to colonize South America. Hell, you might go directly for North America. Or hell, you can even start a war with Catalunia (later Spain). No one is telling you what path to follow and this is what makes this game amazing.Really, it's a complex game so I recommend for you to check my video & tutorial down below. I guarantee that after you watch that video you will be able to pick up EUIV and you will not regret this!Full video review & tutorial here:

												Dev keeps making the game worse. Locks features that should be free updates behind paywalls for rediculous prices and now is adding mechanics purely to punish the player for attempting to do well. They are on a crusade to stop the conquests of an elite few and instead turn the game into a snooze fest for the average player. They are completely out of touch with their player base at this point and I am incredibly disapointed in the latest few ""additions."" This was once easily my favorite game and now I weep at the sad thing it is becomming.This is coming from someone with over 1.5k hours played and 115 plus achievements with all the DLC. Get it on sale, but prepare to be disapointed by Johann (who should be fired for how horrible they mismanage) and the ""improvements"" they add to the game all for the low low price of $100.			"

												A steep steep learning curve, but so so much replayability and engaging gameplay to be had. Incredible depth and the game is continously supported and updated by Paradox.The only real knock on the game, is that there's no real victory condition to aim for, just an end date and the game is very free form, in that you essentially have to choose what you want to try and achieve in each playthrough. But there are a lot of steam achievements that can provide inspiration for interesting game ideas.Do note that by now there's a lot of DLC out, and buying it all at full price in one batch is a daunting prospect I'd imagine. But there are quite frequent sales (every couple of months) of 66%/75% discounts on most of the DLC. By now they really should permanently discount some of the older DLC and the base game.			"

												After this long playing Europa Universalis 4 what do I have to say about it?It has too much DLC.The game is in an ever evolving state because the developers keep working on it to create new DLC.  And while this is good, expanding on weak points and increasing players' options.  It also detracts from the game by forcing players to upgrade every so many months.  It is like a game you purchased for full price coming with a subscription that if you don't keep up with your game will start getting screwy.This screwiness comes from the half-availability of aspects of each DLC, making it so that there are things you cannot do without the requisite DLC, but the game fully expects you to be doing.Aside from that ever expanding problem is the tutorial, which does not keep up with the DLC.  A new player is royally porked by the tutorial as it is largely wrong and often broken.I have enjoyed it, a lot.  The game is not bad by any stretch.  But the way the DLC has gone I have become increasingly displeased with Paradox as a company and more and more I am content to just not buy anymore of these monday to friday DLC for this monkey financing games.  I will not be getting Hearts of Iron 4 until it is complete in its development cycle because of the way DLC has been handled by CK2 and EU4.Deep, rich strategy combined with deep gouging DLC...  I would skip it until you are getting the Complete pack with everything included.  Unless you are a 100% gung-ho grand strategy fan it is just not worth keeping up with the Cardassians.			"

												Honestly, givein half a year or so, I would have most deffinatly reccomended this game. I have quite literaly sunk weeks and weeks into this game, and thats because it was Fun! , however its slowely turned into a massive waste of money. With almost each and every single minor or major patch a 15$ or more DLC comes in store, and while I woulden't complain if it was, say, a optional little add-on to just amplify the fun of the game, yet its almost anything BUT THAT . Its become nothing but a long Scam , and its gonna so far to include essentail parts of the game that make it either unplayable, or downright garbage without it, Paradox may say EUIV is a 45$ game, but in reality its a 45$ game with an extra 65$ to make it fun. And its getting even worse, for the last 2 update were hardly a month between each other (both of which came with DLC, incase you coulden't tell)Now that is outa the way, the next is about the Patch(es) itself, ever since Paradox went full con-artist with the half-♥♥♥♥♥ ""patches"" and non-optional DLC's, the patches are either insignigificent, or simply ruin and/or downgrade the gaming experince. This is starting to become a Serious problem because you dread when the next horrible broken update will come to destory all of your hard work and make you re-learn a worse and worse game. So to give a summary, a Really Good concept and okayish game, screw'd over by a greedy and downright awful money-grabing company, using awful practices and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reasoning to mess with the product. 4.5/10 without DLC (which will change with more and more updates, most likely for the worse) and a 6.5/10 with DLC, at the cost of my wallet			"

												If you're into strategy, history, domination, diplomacy, and 4x's in general, then there's a lot to like about Europa Universalis IV.  It starts in 1444 and goes all the way to 1821, following the proto-country you pick through an almost 400 year history.  There are over 100 Nations to choose from, among other formable ones once the proper conditions are met; such as Prussia, Egypt, and the Netherlands to name but a few.The game is in real time, not turn-based, but you are able to pause the game to issue orders and deal with your affairs, or slow the game speed down to settings 1 or 2 (of 5, 5 basically being as fast as your computer can handle).  You build your armies and determine its makeup (out of Soliders, Cavalry, and Artillery) and this affects how battles will go.  A lot of Nations have special bonuses to certain things (like Poland gets a bonus to its Cavalry), which also affects the outcomes of battles; which are based on dice rolls (sort of like Risk) which are greatly affected by the general you have leading the army.It is a complicated game with a great deal to learn (it makes Civilization seem arcadey), but if strategy, simulation, and history are your thing, it's easily worth the time investment and should provide countless hours of fun and content (it's on Steam Workshop and there are a ton of mods for it, not to mention Paradox often releases expansions and extra DLC artwork for it as well).  The game can also feel very fresh based on what part of the world you're playing in and as what Nation, as strategies will vary wildly depending on that.It's very easy to recommend this game to fans of the genre.

												Great strategy game, so much depth and replayability. I'd love to give it a thumbs up for that, but unfortunately, I can't. I don't know why everyone lets Paradox get away with how they price their DLC, but it's ridiculous at this point. If you want all the DLC you are looking at upwards of $200, upwards of $100 for the main expansions. They have the ebook common sense by Thomas Paine listed on here for $1.99, something you can get for free anywhere on the internet, they literally just copied and pasted the book in, they at least have the decency to say it is in the public domain.There are so many skins and music DLC's that could really be combined into one pack each for $10-20, instead of god knows what it costs to buy it individually. I'd actually be willing to pay that. The same goes for the DLC, they could probably combine two of them and charge the same price, that might be somewhat more reasonable. I'd love to play with the main expansion DLC's, i just cannot justify paying over $100. This game is desperately in need of some bundles or DLC pricing revision. Who is buying this stuff I don't know, but they've got money to throw away, I can tell you that. So I'd love to tell you about how great the game is and why you should get it, but I cannot recommend it because of the blatant and greedy DLC gouging. I don't want this to be the norm, and it shouldn't be. I like hearts of iron too, but I know it will be the same story with that. I like to get the full experience, but I won't be duped into paying that much, and it honestly has me thinking about quitting Paradox games all together. Reasonably priced main game, amazing grand strategy to get you hooked, and then truckloads of overpriced DLC to milk the cash out of you.It is a good game though. That's why it sucks so much to see them spoil it by doing this kind of crap.			"

												After being a long time fan of this series, I am dissapointed in the new direction they are taking with this product. The goal now, is to simply monetize every single aspect of this game, and make it unplayable unless you buy all the DLCs... This is unnaceptable Paradox.For example, they patched the core 'vanilla' version of EU IV, to add a 'region development level' feature to the game. However, you cannot actually raise the development level of a region, unless you buy another dlc called ""Common Sense""... Really!?! Why are you forcing this feature onto the vanilla version, if you need a dlc to fully play it? Pardon the pun, but it makes no sense.Paradox is essentially going back, and making a game you bought in the past, unplayable. It's sad how how patches meant to fix bugs, and add positive features to a game, is now purposefully breaking it so you have to pay more money to fix it.To quote Game of Thrones, SHAME!			"

												I love the Europa Universalis games, i have played since Eu1 and it's been a blast. EUIV is better than the previous games in the series but it have been broken by greed. Eu3 had 4 pretty good expansions if i remember correctly and they gave you a good amount of game for the money you invested. In IV Paradox said ♥♥♥♥ it and started to milk us with dlc's that is not only way to expensive but also very weak in terms of content.Not only that, but your game is de facto broken if you do not pay their ransom(for dlc's) and that is a almost criminal, do you not have any shame in you? Why is it that when i have bought a game i'm punished until i buy a handful of sort of crappy mini additions? It used to  be that an expansion was a expansion, something one could buy and get so much more as an upgrade to the original game! An expansion did not break the original game and force you to spend money to fix it. I used to love you guys. You were reasonable and had a focus on getting as much quality into your products as you could with the small resources/manpower you had at hand. But somewhere on the way you became corrupted by the idea of milking your consumers wallets dry. Because of this i cannot leave a good review on this game nor can i recommend anyone to buy it in its current state. I will not buy any more of your games until you stop doing this to your fans and to yourself. The whole situation makes me sad actually, you used to be the best.Eu IV is a awesome game (if you buy a ♥♥♥♥tondidedelie worth of dlc's, to get it playable) and it brings endless fun. A solid 10/10 (provided you own all addons). (this is my second ever review, am i doing it right?)			"

												A fantastic game, however the rebalances in the new Common Sense DLC has made the base game virtually unplayable without it, and given it is not on sale it rases the question of if it is ever going to be playable without what amounts to a subscription every time Paradox releases a DLC.Seriously guys, if you are going to make a major change like the development system for provinces, don't put it behind a paywall, and let us actually use some of the features you implement in the patches.

												Another awesome game from paradox! A great improvement from EU3. But CK2 is still my favourite!Amazing game that really makes Civilization 5 look kind of boring in comparison.I'm a big fan of strategy games but have always found it hard to find that special sense of satisfaction towards the end game. Many times conquering or in other ways dominating the world can be a repetitive and somewhat boring process. The Europa Universalis-series have been one out of a very few games delivering and with the latest version the team over at Paradox has made it easier than ever for new players to jump in. That said, this isn't a game for the casual player and the amount of information clearly surpasses games like Civilization. But for me, who don't mind some learning, planning and strategic thinking, it's as close to a PC-game blessing as is possible. The satisfaction of transforming an insignificant little European country in nowadays Germany or Italy into the worlds most powerful nation is immense.			"

												One of the best Grand Strategy games I have ever played. Warning: there is a lot here, it is super complex, and it will take time to learn all the different systems. However, it is well worth the time.The only complaint that I would have is that, true to its name, Europa Universalis is heavily Euro-centric, to the point of game mechanics that stunt and even cripple non-European nations. I understand why they did it, but I think a better way could have been found.On the other hand, if the Eurocentricity of the game concerns you, you can always go to the Steam Workshop - I am amazed at how open the devs have made the game; almost anything can be modded or tweaked to however you want it.

												I love this game, its my most played game on Steam, but as of the Common Sense DLC/Update I no longer feel like playing it. So with this DLC coming out you have 2 new options in regards to the building system. You can be limited to having 1-6 buildings (varies depending on province) per province, with no way of leveling up the provinces to put more buildings in. This means, that at a certain point in the game, when more that 6 buildings become available, you will not be able to do ANYTHING unless you pay $15 (USA) to unlock the development feature. This honestly pisses me off because it should be in the core game to begin with, but instead they make you pay for an essential feature. Apparently it slipped by the devs minds that this game is getting very ""pay to win"" because without the DLC the game is trash, honestly. The DLC is bug fixes and ♥♥♥♥ that should have been in the core game, but locked behind a paywall. IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO BUY THIS GAME, PLAN TO BUY ALL THE DLC WITH IT!!!7/10 get your act together, Paradox			"

												Pro's: - Perhaps not as deep or intricate as its predecessor (at least from what I've heard), but certainly more captivating and immersive than the vast majority of strategy games on the market. - Excellent replay value if you're willing to stray from your tried and true strategies and set interesting goals for yourself.- Updated relatively often.- Tons of fun with friends.- Great for acquainting yourself with basic geography.- Sandbox style makes it a history enthusiast's best friend for ""What If?"" scenarios.- Custom nation designer with the El Dorado DLC makes it even more replayable.- Feels like you are truly managing an empire, unlike some other titles which shall not be named that focus way too heavily on military and not nearly enough on diplomacy or the economy (you fools!).Con's:- Some nations are lacking in flavour, though you can't blame Paradox for not being able to flesh out every single one of them.- AI drops the ball fairly often, but it's honestly no worse than you'd find in any other strategy game. The human brain is OP.- DLC is a little expensive, but worth the investment most of the time.- If you're a fan of Total War or similar games, the military aspect of the game will not appeal to you. Combat is simply numbers on the map, rolls of the die, and various modifiers (it is much more complex than that, but I'll let you read up on that in your spare time).Verdict - 9.5/10 Would blob again. It's the most played game in my Steam library.			"

												I originally wrote an EU4 over 2 years ago, but I feel like a new review is appropriate since ive played it much more since then. The following is the original review, but edited to account for changes since version 1.7 when I originally played it, to version 1.18 it is on now. Additions are in bold, subtractions/edits are with strikethrough.""I'm sure everyone has at one point had that power fantasy of wanting to be some supreme ruler of a country, whether that means you are a kind and benevolent, or a cruel-hearted demon of a ruler is a different story (Rulers now actually have personalities now, so you can have a cruel or kind leader which is appropriate). Well with Europa Universalis IV (EU4), you can be either of them if you so desire. In fact, it is more than just that, much much more, with expanding your borders, and crushing your enemies, the game comes alive to the player in numerous ways.Well the first, and most obvious way is the aforementioned power fantasy fulfillment. Play as any sovereign nation state, and see the rise (and possibly fall) of your empire over a span of over 350 years. Play a diplomatic, a heavily military game, or a trade heavy game, and begin to cut out your own little slice of the world. Play upon alliances, and take down common threats, then come back and backstab your previous allies when you want their land. Customise how your nation focuses it's tech, and use that to push your nation's strengths to new limits, allowing you to potentially be an empire worth fearing. Turn a backwater into a thriving metapolis the envy of the world, be the origin of the the world's greatest advances in civilization and guide history in the direction you desire.This does not come at the expense of player accessability although. The game falls into that simple mantra of easy to learn, hard to master. With its relatively simple and watered down mechanics (compared to the other paradox strategy games of course), it provides great depth with a minimum of actual work in any one area. Within a few hours, you will understand how to run your nation (probably through trial and error, but still useful), and even if you fail, it is not the end. One lost battle or war is no reason to quit, besides lost troops or land, there is always room to come back and defeat those who beat you. The game is not cruel, it is fair to the player.Except in one area I have noticed. The game has a problem with making the AI cheat, and when I say cheat, I mean really cheat. No fog of war, more manpower, no loan penalties, more money, a lot less aggressive expansion penalties, and war happy. So you will find them declaring war out of the blue, just because they feel like it, even if you far outmatch them in some cases. This is very notable with one nation, France. France is, without a doubt, the most powerful nation in the game, with the highest concentration of high wealth provinces, and with excellent starting armies, generals, manpower, and position. In addition to unique french events, and traditions, france is an absolute powerhouse in the early, mid, and late game unless you can form a more powerful nation and can manage to crush them. AI, outside a few minor things the AI can't properly assess (fog of war, and naval attrition), doesn't cheat. Some nation positions and minor differences in regional troop types can give vastly different outcomes in terms of things such as war.EU4 really excells in many areas and mechanics, two of which are it's ideas system and war system. Ideas are essentially specialisations for your nation you can take over time, and will guide your nation state's direction of how it approaches the world. It can give you a vastly better military, or be geared to making you more money to just buy friends (or troops from other nations to fight for you). It makes every nation feel and play uniquely in their situation, so it is never boring playing as two different nations and using the same ""build order"". War is also incredibly in depth, with dozens of small factors and things that can be used to optimised fighting and tweaking troop's fighting ability. It is incredibly easy to understand, but as ive said before, takes a while to master all the intricate details that influence how well troops fight. The satisfaction of setting up a perfect situation, executing that military plan, and crushing your opponent into the ground, is second to none. Despite that major gripe, it is does not detract from the positives that EU4 has. Seeing your nation which you have been through hundreds of years of war and technological advances, slowly  grow larger in most cases grow in influence, as well as the social changes that happen over one of the most important parts of human history, is very satisfying to see. But after all that, it is sad to say goodbye to your nation which you, in some cases, raised from infancy all the way to adulthood. But in the end, that is something that must happen, and there will always be other nations you can rule over to perpetrate the cycle anew.See more reviews by following this group - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/JSJaRG ""			"

												As it stands right now, this game is broken unless you buy Common Sense (which the devs seem to be lacking as of late). I love this game, it is quite frankly my favorite game, or more accurate ""was"" my favorite. Core features gutted from a previous version that worked wonderfully, was fun to play, and allowed you to challenge yourself now is less useful then a cat. Want to build buildings? Good luck, that lovely city that is your capital can hold 3 buildings! Six if you're super luck (major, major, major if). Want to get more manpower? Good luck with that, you can't spend those lovely Monarch Points on anything but technology, coring, annexing, stomping on rebels, or ideas. If you thought you had overflowing amounts of Monarch points previously, you've seen nothing yet!In all seriousness though, they've managed to take a favorite game of mine, and ruin it. Also, to those who say, ""oh, hey, you have the DLC!"", I do to test and see what major changes it did bring. Spoilers, nothing. All it added, and I wish I was kidding, was the ability to improve provinces WHICH WAS ALREADY A PART OF THE CORE GAME. No, I'm not joking, and I very, very rarely use capslock, but that's it. They basically broke their game, hid a key feature that was already present in the game previously behind a paywall, and then gave a big middle finger to their audience.			"

												Europa Univesalis IV is a game about managing a country through the time period from 1444 to 1821. Of course, that's like saying Half-Life 2 is a game about walking from Point A to Point B: technically true, but not very enlightening. Managing countries in EU IV is a very involved process, involving juggling over a dozen interconnected systems.The most important facet of nation-managing in EU IV is warfare. War allows you to expand your country and provides the most interesting and in-depth part of the game. Planning and executing a masterful plan of war, fighting and winning several wars simultaneously, or outwitting and outfighting a significantly larger opponent provides a thrill few things can match.The economic side of your country cannot be neglected, however, lest your ability to wage war be seriously hampered. The trade system can be quite complicated, but mastering it will provide you with money beyond your wildest dreams, not to mention your enemies' ability to compete.Make no mistake, this is not a simple game; I was a good forty hours in before feeling like I had a firm grasp on the majority of the systems. Study of the game is richly rewarded, though—I have over 700 hours in it at the moment and anticipate hundreds more. The wiki provides a lot of guidance, and the community is always willing to provide help and advice. Check it out if you're interested; if you're ready to take your strategy gaming to the next level, grand strategy games may be for you.			"

												The game is good, but 130 $ of paid updates makes it impossible for me to recommend this game. Here is how the Paradox marketing scheme works : 1 - Release a vanilla game that is as stripped down as possible2 - Release major features of the game in a series of 20$ paid updates (and call them ''DLC'') 3 - End up with a game that costs 44 $ and a ''DLC'' list that amounts to 245 $ 4 - Enjoy the profits			"

												I hate that I love this game, it is frustrating beyond belief but I have had more fun in this game than any other I have ever played, the game CAN and WILL annoy the ♥♥♥♥ out of you but when you win, when you suceed it gives a fine sense of satisfaction, you'll need to be patient you can be the strongest empire in the world and it all fall apart because you declared war prematurely, you can play in historical scenarios, build a trading empire. The DLCS are great, El Dorado has given me so much enjoyment from the game. I have owned it for a short amount of time but I already have about 100 hours on it, to be brief, is this game annoying: yes, is the game fun: It's complicated but it is very fun if you have the time to learn the rules. Is the game sometimes a ♥♥♥♥ING WAITING GAME: 100 TIMES YES! But it'll provide you with hours of joy, I know people who have played this for over 1,000 hours, it's worth the $40.00, trust me.			"

												I've loved Paradox games since HOI2, putting god knows how many hours into them.  Even when the launch product is kinda bad (ie every game except CK2), Paradox patches/expands them up to a great state.  Hell, Victoria 2 just got a new patch a few months ago, and that game is 6 years old!Problem is, starting with CK2, success went to Paradox's head.  First, they moved their new games to Steam exclusivity.  Then Johann and Frederik saw how much money they were making, then looked at how much money Clash of Clans was making, and realized just how dumb their prior business model was--and how dumb Supercell was at the same time.  ""Why should people buy a game once, or be given it for free, when they can be made to buy it forever and ever and ever?Welcome to DLC hell guys, where the DLC NEVER STOPS COMING!			"

												Take a fairly solid grand strategy game, filled to the brim with unique mechanics and indepth ricing strategies to get the highest score as fast as possible. The game has a steep learning curve, but learning it is rewarding. You never feel cheated; every loss in battle is on you and every wrong move is your fault.Now, take that same grand strat, but remove the more selective unique mechanics and lock them behind a paywall. Remove the ""cheese"" strats that reflected knowledge of the games inner mechanics by means of arbitrary checks that only serve to prevent any ricing at all. Keep the learning curve, but make it far less steep and remove any reward for learning at all. Make sure the player feels cheated on the sole principal that they rolled a lower number than their opponent when it came to their battles and hit them with a random -1 stability every twenty-or-so years. You now have Europa Universalis IV.At one point, I had abandoned this game and forgotten why I did so. 2016 Summer Sale rolls around, and I find numerous DLCs on my wishlist to be about five bucks a piece, even if they were 66% off. After dropping twenty seven dollars on features that should be in the base game, I open a Pandora's Box that I forgot I had closed for good reason.My first wall came to enabling Ironman Mode, an option in the game that allows achievements. The mode would refuse to allow me any achievements, claiming that I was running mods or playing with an altered savestate (neither of which were true). The only fix I found after searching through Paradox Forum posts involved manually deleting all files, reinstalling all files, and verifying that all files are accounted for, as the game would occasionally choose checksums that it did not ""like"". Whatever; I fixed that problem eventually. Maybe finally I could play my game.My second issue is pretty nitpicky, I have to admit. The fact that the game will remove a current instance and relaunch the game if the player presses the ""Main Menu"" button is nothing short of annoying. To my understanding, Paradox implemented this feature to save time for those who crashed regularly from clicking the previously mentioned button instead of actually fixing the problem at hand--the fact that there are people crashing because they press a button. This fix is lazy and something of maybe an indie developer's method, not a professional company such as Paradox.My next complaint is about something that nearly everyone complains about: game balance. Historically speaking, France and England and the like completely dominated the time period, leaving other nations in the dust. In other Paradox games, such as Crusader Kings 2, the player can throw history out the window and make some sort of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized nation of Viking Muslims and declare Jihad on Charlemagne if they're lucky. This is not true for EUIV in the slightest, as the game regularly limits the activities of One Province Minors and smaller nations and even grants bonuses to the ""Lucky Nations"" of the time period. It's fairly annoying, because if you even try to play a minor nation next to one of the grand blobs of history, you will most likely die if you do not form an alliance (based on RNG if they like you or not) immediately.Over time, Paradox has also had the need to add arbitrary and outright stupid features to make the game more difficult that usually don't make any sense while ignoring features that need to be fixed. Shattered Retreat, for example, will still lead your army from one end of North America to the other instead of to a safe province away from the enemy. It's also unavoidable; a Shattered Retreat will always happen unless if there are no troops to fortify or if the troops have no morale left. Instead of maybe fixing this feature, they add other unnecessary blockades to play, such as the argument between states and territories and the god-forsaken diceroll mechanic that sweeps early game with an arbitrary fist. It's also good to see that the player can lose a single battle in war and lose the well-being of their nation to fortify only four-thousand men, but the AI can throw about their manpower willy-nilly and recuit mercs with practically no repurcussions because they literally don't care about anything else but removing the player.I tried to like this game. I really did. I just can't bring myself to play it past all the lazy mechanics and excuses that are already in play.EDIT: 11/26/2016Ok, good news and bad news; good news is that Johan decided to make Scandinavia stronger so everyone at Paradox could give themselves a little more auto-fellatio action (in the properly named ""Denmark"" Patch), but bad news is that  they screwed over everyone in the immediate Baltic, North Germanic, and Russian areas because now Scandinavia is an unstoppable freight train of ♥♥♥♥. This fact became especially prevalent in my Riga game where, for absolutely no reason at all, Denmark would enforce peace on every single one of my wars. I thought to myself, ""Maybe it's a fluke. Maybe Denmark just has an extreme hate for Theocracies!"" And boy, was there any more way I could be more wrong. Practically anyone in that area is EP'd by Denmark, and the worst thing is: they usually EP right around when you have the winning advantage. Apparently, you can stop them from taking action if you have positive relations, but I have yet to see that feature work at all.In other news, Paradox felt the need to make One Province Minors even weaker, such as poor Albania, who is now split in half. Terrain no longer limits combat width, which means that mountainous nations can no longer defend themselves in their territory against a Great Power. Also, there are now random wastelands thrown across the map for the sake of geography, but I'm pretty sure that people could climb mountains, just not super easily. They also serve no purpose, considering that  terrain only effects the diceroll now, meaning that your Hungarian chokepoint is worth jack.In terms of bugs, I've observed that the attack will switch to being the defender and vice versa in instances of combat, and with the flip-flop comes the ""-1 Terrain"" effect, which can vary substantially depending on your general, especially if you employ your 3/3/0/1 to hold a defensive position and he eats a pile of ♥♥♥♥ to a 1/1/3/0.The AI is also unbelievably stupid now. If you thought ""Prussia Patch"" AI was bad (like I did), you will absolutely HATE the new AI, which runs their 8 stack into a 14 in hopes that Johan's holy dicerolls will grant them victory.Overall, ""Denmark Patch"" is the equivalent to sticking yourself with an iron nail and high-fiving the nearest wall.

												Europa Universalis IV is a grand strategy game that provides unparralled levels of control over a nation. In most strategy games of this scope, say the Civilization or Empire series, you have control an economy dictated by resourses collection and expenditure and diplomacy that involves little more than trade deals and defensive pacts. What makes EU4 the grandest of all the strategy games is the depth of control you are given in virtually every aspect of gameplay.If you like trading, you can get to the nitty gritty of trade steering, production management, and manipulating node control to yield far more money than otherwise possible. Perhaps you just like to smash stuff with a massive army; you can even tactically manage your fighting armies through precisely timed reinforcements or through careful manipulation of combat width. The level of diplomacy available is exemplar as well, allowing for everything from royal marriages, to trade embargoes, to papal excommunication, to building spy networks and destroying an enemy's reputation.The bottom line of EU4 is that it is what you make it. Everything is there - everything. So this can be a game of world conquest or it can be a game of financial domination or it can be a game of influence and family. There are so many possible play styles and nations to mix and match that the 500+ hours I have logged have only scratched the surface of what is possible in this game.Not only is EU4 my favorite of grand strategy games, it is one that has brought many bonds into my life. As with most games like this, EU4 comes with a community.			"

												EU4 is an advanced level grand strategy game loosely based on the board game. The game is played in real time but with the ability to pause at any time and the need to pause often it often has the feel of a turn based game. There is no first person view like in Total War games and this is not an entry level strategy game like CIV5. So if your looking for eye candy, cool action scenes or a game that you can easily get into and learn you will not find it here. That being said EU4 has an easier learning curve than most of their games and that's due to it's top notch informative and slick UI. Information is easy to find and the Wiki is kept updated by it's devoted fanbase.The difficulty levels can be changed in the settings but difficulty if mostly based on what starting country you choose. Also, the AI is well done and will give you headaches so expect a harsh learning curve. Patience and learning from your mistakes will be needed but once you get going you will fall in love for months if not years.This is not a world conquest type game. Sure it can be done but that's for the elitists and die hards and is not what the game is built for. EU4 is a sandbox historical simulator of sorts. Historical events and themes influence playthroughs enriching the gaming experience for history buffs. This is a game where you set your own goals and make your own path. Don't expect the game to tell you where or what to do because it won't. Paradox is a good Swedish company that is always putting out free updates and patches but on the flip side their major updates and expansions can be rough around the edges filled with bugs which can drive players mad. That being said they are very good at patching and improving their games. It just requires some patience from us beta testers err I mean gamers occasionally.If you're a board game enthusiast, history buff and/or just wanting to step up to a more challenging but rewarding grand strategy game than I highly recommend EU4. Check out the free demo to get a taste.			"

The Common Sense DLC and update basically made this game barebones, now I had to mod the game (e.g. Complete Colonial Control, Extended Timeline, etc.) to actually have fun. When the Art of War DLC and update came out I was actually OK with it, because it didn't ♥♥♥♥ up the game at all.

Some of the DLC really adds to the game, but most of it not so much, only talking main DLC not cut out cosmetic BS (have and will never buy any of that).People were ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about Chaos (7,5 Euro) being cut out of TWW, and rightfully so, yet they accept Paradox charging twice the worth of almost every DLC for EU4. Some of which you can barely play the game without in the long run since the AI have the benefits of the DLC, ""Common sense"" (another 15 Euro) province dev feature anyone?

												Not for everyone. The learning curve looks a bit like Mount Everest, especially with the DLC.DLC you need to access all the depth of the game: Art of War, Common Sense.Wealth of Nations and The Cossacks add a few more nice but optional features, and it can wait until you're tested the waters and seen if you like the game. Everything else you can ignore until you're hooked, then it becomes like crack and you'll want everything.Give it a try if you're into strategy, it's worth it.			"

												If you were to ask me if I would recommend this game a year ago, I would wholeheartedly say yes. However, the game in its current state is abysmal.The devs continue to punish the player for what the AI lacks. Instead of improving the AI in order to make the game more interesting, Paradox continues to introduce handicaps into the game; handicaps that make it no longer fun and and introduces more and more micromanagement aspects into the game.EU4 has changed from an interesting and fun alternate history game into a chore.Complaints that I have:- The AI is never affected by money or monarch power problems- Because the AI is never affected by money or monarch power problems, their ability to stay in a war is stupid good. The AI ran out of manpower? No problem, just buy more and more mercenaries- The AI is too dumb to effectively wage war against players? No problem, just give them arbitrary bonuses against the player- Small AI nations are able to field way too many troops; an example of this is Burgundy's vassal swarm providing them with nearly 20,000 troops- Estates are pointless and useless micromanagement features that don't make the game more indepth or fun- The amount of aggressive expansion you can earn for taking a province in Western Europe is ridiculous and it's even worse if it's a province that's in the HRE- Truce timers take way too long. Basically, if you go to war with a nation, you're not going to be able to go to war with them again for another ten years at least- Rebels pop up CONSTANTLY if you take a province from another country it's not even a question of ""if"" anymore but a question of ""when"". In order to prevent rebels from popping up, you have to sink monarch points into preventing rebels, slowing you down.It's like playing Monopoly with only one dice while everyone else gets to use two. It's not impossible and it's not the worst thing in the world, but why would anyone find that fun?			"

												So, time to write a review. I own all gameplay DLCs so your experience might be a little different if you only own the core game. So, what exactly is Europa Universalis 4? It is a game where you are playing a nation on its path between 1444 and 1821. Your goal is to make the nation prosper through conquest, colonisation, technological advancement and diplomaty. Each game is different, depending which ""nation"" you play. If you start as the Duchy of Anhalt (central Germany) you won't be colonising and as a Mongol Horde your diplomats will only be used to declare wars and demand land at the end of them. You can play anyone, from a random indian Tribe in Oregon to a Japanese Warlord.The game has no story mode because you write your own. You want to restore the Roman Empire from the brink of destruction? Than that's your story. You want to crush everything under the boots of your Prussian infantry while struggeling against the Austrian crown for hegamony over Germany? Go for it. You want to defend cristianity by driving the Saracens from the Holy Land and reinstate the Kingdom of Heaven? You want to recreate Leif Eriksons jorneys and start a Norwegian colony in Canada? You want to rule a Japanese Empire spanning from California to Capetown? You see, the posibilities are nearly endless. And if you think you are not creative enough to come up with something to callange yourself there are always 185 official Achievments to get. Their difficulty varies from ""press a button"" to ""it's only here to find new exploits and impossible without much cheese"".Now be warned, it takes more time to learn this game than most other games and below 200 hours you are considered new. This game is not hard to play well but to do some crazy stuff like form Germany as Mayor of the Free City of Frankfurt you will need practise and patience. You will always find new stuff. A single playthrough takes at least 10 hours, 20-30 is more realistic. This game is somewhat historical and if you want to you can force things to happen similar to history. There are a couple ways the devs made sure that at least some historical accuracy is in place. But consider that your actions have a lot of influence on the way the events unfold. If you backstab Austria they won't be able to keep the Ottomans in check and you doomed Eastern Europe. So get ready to fight the Turks to drive them out of Poland or they will come for you next. Now about the DLCs. Yes, they are expensive. However, you can get everything for 60 bucks on sale and that's around the price of an AAA game which offers 30 hours of gameplay. Or simply play Multiplayer because only the Host needs to own the DLCs. So let's sum it up:Positive:- Offers hundreds, if not thousands of hours of entertainment. I have clocked 768 hours and not even played 10% of all possible nations.- Stable (I had maybe 2 non mod ralated crashes within 768 hours)- No big bugs- Increadible mod support. There are total conversion mods, from Game of Thrones to Witcher and of course a lot of gameplay enchancements.- The devs listen to the playerbase and communicate a lot. There are weekly dev diaries. - There's still a lot of content (free and paid) coming.Neutral:- Could use a little more visualisationNegative:- High initial price (with all DLCs)- Takes away all your time and it's suddenly 1am.

												Mare Nostrum broke the combat system. Before the dlc came out the game was 10/10 now after i've played with the dlc i've experienced revolts regenerating almost a thousand men at 1459 and teleporting rebels who could kill my army of 10 thousand with only 6 thousand and they didn't even have a general. I've also experienced 10,000 troops from holland destroying 33,000 austrian troops in a farmland, i have a picture of this happening on my profile.			"

												Last patch and DLC made the game unplayable and devs don't intend to fix it. Devs, please listen to your customers :(UPDATE (December 2015) This company got greedy. Last DLC is 20 bucks, but it's not even worth 15.UPDATE 2 (December 2015) Shocking. Now the game will automatically restart when you exit a campaign. Been a videogamer since 1992, and never seen anything like this. Not even close.			"

												If you are interested in history/geography/economics and that sweet sense of accomplisment, then look no further! There simply isn't any alternative to what Europa Universalis IV offers.However, beware of the leaning curve. My story began back in 2013, I read about it somewhere and was so hyped and the moment it came out in local game store, I bought it. It is worth mentioning that this was my first Paradox Interactive game and that I really had no clue what to expect. So I installed it, chose Teutonic Order for my first playthrough (guess knights seemed cool enough), and got destroyed by Poland. So I restarted it several more times to no avail. It really felt like I was playing with Microsoft Excel compared to Total War games I have been actively playing before. So I chose France then as it was highlighted as a beginner nation, and I failed miserably again. After that I rage quit and uninstalled the game.It wasn't until year later that I installed the game again and decided to actually do my best to understand the basics. And I started as Castille which greatly helped me learn a thing or two about EU4. Ever since then, I am an avid fan of this game, it's by far the best strategy game there is, in my opinion.Pros:1. You get to pick any country which existed during this period and that includes a vast amount of countries. I guess the most obvious choice is to start with your own country if it exists and try to bring it to its greatest historical extent.2. You pick your own goals. There really is not predefined goal. Sure if you start as Byzantium, you are bound to face Ottomans or if you are one of Irish nations, England is not going to make your life easy. But what I mean is that there is a vast array of choices you can make in this game and change the history. Make Ottomans convert to Christianity, conquer all of Russia as let's say The Golden Horde, become the biggest colonizator as Songhai etc. Anything is really possible.3. Achievements. Unlike most of other new games, this game has some quite tricky achievements. And they give you a sense of direction should you not make your own goal. Also that way, you are being encouraged to learn about new countries by playing them - you might find your favorite this way. Some are ridiculously hard and might require several restarts but that feeling when you manage not only to survive as Tabaristan but to from into formidable Persia and challenge Ottomans, priceless. I managed to pull few tough ones but my favorite is definitely A Kaiser not just in name.4. This argument is direclty linked to the previous one. You should get this game for HRE mechanics, if for nothing else. I have always disregarded these features until few months ago when I decided to try to unify Holy Roman Empire which I did. Now simply put, you feel like you are in Game of Thrones itself,  that vibe is incredible. There are so many ways you can lose but once you push through the reforms, you are pretty much unstoppable.5. Always learning something new. There is always a room for improvement and this game greatly depicts that.6. Soundtrack. It is awesome. However I have to say Sabaton is beyond awesome. When The Lion From The North song popps up, you know it's time to wage a war. Honestly, I found out about Sabaton from this game and even managed to go to concert this month, so I am very grateful.Cons:1. The game has too many DLCs. Now I am not bringing that argument, it is too expensive etc. With enough waiting  you can get it for a good price, just like anything on steam. What I mean is that the game has been greatly changed. In its current state it resembles little to its original vanilla form. 2. It keeps adding more complexity which in my opinion greatly limits your options of expanding, especially as OPM or any small nation. If you miss DLCs you are still affected by new game mechanics but have no way of influencing them back.3. It is too Eurocentric. Granted, its name is Europa and I am European myself but there simply aren't enough reasons to play or be remotely interested in Asia for example, whereas in Europe, many countries get unique events. I understand this will change with the upcoming expansion Mandate of Heaven, so I guess that problem will be adressed.So all in all, you can find this game fequently on sale, try it out and if you get past few dozen of hours, you are in for an endless entertainment.

This is an amazing game to play by yourself BUT if you have freinds it turns from 10/10 to 15/10. The only con i can really think of is the fact that I dont have enough time to play this game.			"

												Europa suffers from two main problems:1) The core mechanics of the game have been constantly changing since release and there seems to be no end in sight. This makes it very difficult for someone to pick up the game again after a prolonged break, at which point either your save is broken, or you are penalized for not having access to the latest DLC.2) There is something decidedly ""unfun"" about the game's challenge. Your victories feel hollow over beating braindead AI, and your defeats feel cheap due to rubbish coding behind the AI to compensate for its idiocy.I had my fun in the honeymoon period when the game was fresh and new. But the allure is gone now and the game does the opposite of what a good game should be doing: Europa puts me in a bad mood.			"

												I once would have highly recommended this game. An indepth rewriting of history, which like the Civilization left you clinging to just turn the tide of battle before you finally went to bed in the early hours.However recent changes  have in the words of some ""but critical content behind a paywall"". Unless you buy the Common Sense DLC developing your empire (kind of critical) is not an option. I won't buy it because a lot of the other gameplay changes are simply irritating or downright annoying.			"

												A solid upgrade to the flagship series of one of the greatest publishers in the business.  If past games are any indicator Paradox will continue to create expansions and free content patches for several years...  and they actually listen to their customers.  Much of what goes into these games is shaped by feedback from both beta testers and suggestions from regular customers and message board users.This game is incredibly fun, and purchasing it also helps support one of the strongest independent voices in gaming.

												would be a very nice game if it werent for all the dlc's. out of all dlc's that arent music packs or 3d unit models only two dlc's contain content that actualy have some right in being dlc: the el dorado dlc and the conquest of paradise dlc. however only the main content in these dlc's should be part of the dlc as those dlc's also contain game changing content. when a dlc came out once they also changed the building system so that you need the dlc to use it like it was originally. all in all paradox are run by money hungry ♥♥♥♥♥ who keep glorifying the game changing dlc's they keep pumping out as something good, here's the list of game changing dlc each costing about half of what the base game costs http://www.eu4wiki.com/Downloadable_content NOTE that the list doesn't show a lot of feutures that are game changing, if you type in the dlc name in the wiki search bar you get to see more in depht of the game changing feutures.

												-Choise a country at the year of 1444-rewrite history and be the strongest power on earth or fulfill any personal goal you want-conquer the land of your enemies in war-expand the influence of your dinasty with royal marriages, get to the throne of other countries without the blood of your peasents-colonize america with a country which never ever colonized distant lands-be the pope-turn ottoman to an orthodox country and then be the emperor of the holy roman empire-lead a jihad and destroy the catholics or lead a crusade and reconquer JerusalemThe possibilities are endless, Paradox is great in making grand strategy games and this is a masterpiece aswell. The game has lots of content and visual DLC yes, but you could just play 1000hours with the base game and buy each DLC one by one, each change the game a bit so you could be entertained for another few hundred hours each time:-) Even if you play a lot of time, in every playthrough you will figure out new things and say ""oh hell, in my next game i need do it this way"":D			"

												To put it simply, the DLC's ruined the game. The last good DLC released was easily El Dorado, and afterwards they completely revamped the game, which was not needed once so ever. I will admit, the seige system in Common Sense is great, since thats the only part you dont have to pay 20 bucks to get. For me, to be forced to buy a 20 dollar dlc, to ""develop"" provinces, when the AI can already do that by themselves? Thats not difficulty, thats called being greedy.If you want a Grand Strategy game, get Crusader Kings 2, now thats a gem, not plagued by the 8 headless DLC horsemen. Well, it is, but atleast then I can safely say that I dont feel like a slavic pig dog while playing it.			"

												Europa Universalis 4 is an extremely entertaining real time strategy game, similar to all the others released by Paradox Interactive. In the game, one is able to create armies and navies, invade and conquer your neighbors, and colonize the world. It has no real end goal, however world domination is nice. With a felxible starting date of anywhere between 1453 and 1800, there are centuries of history to play through, as historical countries, even though keeping to their set history is up to you. Europa Universalis 4 provides a platform to do the impossible, to conquer Europe as China, to maintain colonies accross the world, to destroy the largest empires, to invade Russia in the winter.However, Europa Universalis 4 is a game riddled with challenge. It is not easy, and players hoping to start off as the tiniest nation they see are almost certainly going to have a difficult road ahead of them if they wish to succeed. There are also other nations like France, Austria, Portugal, and Castille if you are in the mood for an evening of steamrolling the weak nations and conquering the world in one fell swoop. Micromanagement is also a crucial aspect to gameplay, and it can pose to be difficult, but also rewarding, to fully manage an economy, organize military forces, mitigate crises, and handle diplomacy. However this amount of micromanagement provides a sense of immersion into the game, and allows a greater sense of pride in tasks like maintaining a surplus and such.Europa Universalis IV is a great game for strategy gamers, who have no doubt at least heard of other Paradox titles, but for those looking for a walk in the park as they see every nation fall to them may not be able to enjoy the game.

												Europa Universalis is a Grand Strategy Game. We have to stress and underline the Grand, this game is really Grand in terms of content. Addictive is another adjective to describe EU4.First of all: this game has not a learning curve, but rather a learning walls. Once you fell down climbing the first one, there are more walls to climb to entirely understand this game in its complexicity. So if you know that you will give up after a couple of tries, because you get easily frustrated DO NOT BUY this game. If you think you can deal with frustration, love complex strategy games and then buy this game.To describe it briefly: You control in this game a nation, which you either lead to its glory or doom. Or you just survive. This is your job. How do you do this? You conquer provinces, construct buildings, draft armies, build ships, send them into battle. You will fight wars against neighbours and rivals and crush them or get crushed. The game has multiple ways of playing, you can play peaceful nations or be a warmonger.If you are able to pass the 20 hours of beginner's frustration, read a couple of guides and the wiki, try to understand the game - you are in for hours of great fun and enjoyment. The game is actually not difficult. Just complex. Have fun!			"

												This game may be more casual held up to the standards of Paradox games, and pales in complexity to games like Hearts of Iron, but painting the map in the creation of your ideal empire will keep you seated for hours. You're not just expanding the empire, you will shape whatever policies rules this empire yourself, and will round up hundreds of individual decisions that will have influence on your country.You'll also find yourself having strange outbursts of extremely prejudiced hatred against dice and cosmic phenomena.9/10, There are gaps and holes, but they aren't severe, just annoying. The game is, rounded up, quite fantastic and worth your money if you love strategy.			"

												(This is a fairly long review that i've recently rewritten. I'll try to give a fairly comprehensive look at why you should or shouldn't buy this game.)I've played this game for almost 1000 hours at the time I'm rewriting this review, so i think i can be a pretty good judge. I originally didn't reccomend this game (and still don't) to the broad gaming audience, and that's for a multitude of reasons. Cons:This game is nearly impossible to get into by yourself. It's really difficult to learn how to play this game, let alone play it well. If you're not already coming from a strategy game background, you most likely will never put the time into learning this game. The only way that i originally got into it, was from being harrassed by a close friend of mine to play it with him because he wanted someone else to play it with. I've since done the same thing to many of my friends, and that's the only way I know of people personally learning to play it.Secondly, a lot of the game's essential features and improvements are marketed as DLC. I don't have a problem with supporting Paradox in developing new features for a game I really love, but they don't see how hard it is to come into the game with what I'm fairly certain is 100's of dollars of DLC at this point. Granted a lot of these are harmless texture packs for certain countries units, or new music. However, some of the patches with new DLC made vanilla Europa basically unplayable, such as the common sense DLC (ironically). When i started playing this game, there was only one major DLC released, so it was a lot easier to pay the extra 15 bucks or so on the back of my friend's promise that is was worth it.My third major gripe with the game is that Paradox doesn't seem very willing to take the community's suggestions on game features and or balance. There are a lot of things in the game that the EU4 community doesn't like currently in the game. A quick example is the coalition mechanic. There's a general consensus that this mechanic needs to be either reworked or completely removed until they can think of a sensible way of implementing it. Another is a very disproportianate amount, and the quality of most rebellions. There's no reason that there should be 27 thousand seperatist rebels spawned from a small nation i just took over that had a standing army of 8 thousand. How did some rebel leader manage to persuede more people into joining their force than their actual nation had when they existed? Let alone the fact they can afford 6 artillery regiments. There's many examples of things like this and I've looked on every forum I could find and couldn't even find a response from any Paradox employee. Really frustrating and honestly kind of stupid considering they're essentially alienating a large portion of their small niche audience for no apparent reason?Pros:Getting past all of the cons, this game is helplessly addicting and entertaining. I'd never become bored of forming a large empire out of a small county. The expansion and total control of your country is really amazing and something I haven't seen from another game before. It's given me nearly one thousand hours of enjoyment and it really doesn't feel like that will stop anytime soon.Tldr: I can't reccommend this game to everyone. But if you can somehow manage to get past the steep learning curve, frustrating developer methods, and expensive pricetag, this game could provide you with a lot of fun.			"

												Relive your ancestors lives, from subjugating natives to murdering the Pope in his own home, from meeting people who tan differently than  you and alienating them  for it, to starting a civil rebellion in  any country (yes,  even your own)... Ohh and dont forget, this game pulls no punches. It subtly bashes religion, color, and nationallity.  Yes, don't expect to live long if you're a  docile, passive native. Europeans eat  that like subsidized kfc in N'Orleans. It's called Europa  for a reason!			"

												I'm tired of all these DLCs and their inflated prices. The content added often brings new depth to the game, but frequently has features that we shouldn't have to pay for. I'm looking at you Nation designer! Also you dirty unit and music packs should be ashamed of yourselves for existing! If you look at other game companies, they often give comparable content for free as an update. At the very base of it, I'm sick of all this piece meal DLC. I can understand expansions increasing the longevity of the game, but seriously The Cossack’s cost is 50% of the price of the base game. And don't you lie to me and say that any of these expansions add enough content to justify their price. Most of these are just slight mechanic tweaks, not anything ""expansive"". It’s sad when mods offer more content then official expansions and also happen to be free. I love the concept of a game developing after its release, but don’t make me pay for every slight tweak. Also don't talk to me about steam sales, the most recent releases only get 35% off. For “The Cossacks”, that's roughly 7 dollars off still leaving me roughly $13 dollar left to pay, whoopee do. By the time, we get a substantial ""deal"" on any DLC, it's often way down the line and Paradox has already churned out another one. All of this means two plainly disappointing facts. You'll pay considerably to have a complete and current content version of any Paradox game and that when a new game releases it's evident you're only getting a tiny proportion of the eventual game. However, I know that nothing will change as long as people keep apathetically buying the product. And so this 'just another ranting guy on the internet' is going to reach into his wallet, pull out his credit card and buy the next ""grand"" expansion for EU4 because oh well, right?UPDATE 4/10/16:With the release of Mare Nostrum, It's evident that Pardox Interactive is trying to milk their games in increasing fashion. This is pitiful and doesn't show well for the future of Hearts of Irons 4, Stellaris and their other franchises. These are good quality games being subjected to obnoxious pay walls. Paradox makes base games that are just good enough to entice people to buy multitudes of DLC fillers which in the end ruins consumer enjoyment. Paradox knows what it's doing and all of their comunity streams and involvements are distractions to make us buy into a friendly exterior and therein be consoled into buying their products. The only action I'd want them to take is in their DLC practices. If you're going to sell us the game piece by piece then at least make it more worthwhile. Combine the cosmetic and music packs into their corresponding  main DLC expanision then lower the prices to $9.99 and lower. You may think you'll lose far too much profit this way or that your efforts are underrepresented at such prices, but you'll have both a greater purchasing base and a longer lasting franchise to milk if you do this. If the reason prices are so high is because not enough people are buying the product then this solution would solve that problem in the long term. If you have merely caluclated that you can sell at these unreasonable prices and still make a hefty profit then whoever made that decision should be fired. Our else, your company will be crushed under the boot of companies like Sega, who specifically has turned CA and Relic Entertainment into DLC producing Cash Cows that take all the heat.Your CEO has stated you're undergoing the IPO process, therefore you'll be an option for buyout within a year or two. The gaming industry is full of puppeted developers straddled by larger publishing corporations that use them as proxy moneymakers without taking any real accountablity. You're on a path that will be your undoing; please become something better, Paradox, not something so pitiful and so often seen with developers.P.S. 5/28/16:Europa Universalis 4 has become a convoluted piece of crap that is hardly playable. It stifles the player every step of the way and fumbles on offering a challeging and engaging experience. Paradox is becoming a disappointment, if they aren't already.			"

												This game transform me into a child over and over again, repeatedly pushing my history and geography sweet spots. I played Svea Rike 1 through 3 when I was a kid. The game that led Paradox Interactive to being the dominant Grand-Strategy masterminds they are today. I grew up and changed course - I found it much more hilarious to run people over in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas or explore Black Mesa in Half-Life again. Deep down though, I am Strategy. Put me in any war in any time and I would DIE horribly day 1, but put me in front of Europa Universalis IV, remove France and I will crush my foes with never seen ruthlessness. The ground trembles as every great nation falls beneath my feet and.. gotta pee brb.Europa Universalis IV deliver near unlimited sandbox strategy gameplay during the time period 1444-1819. Covering the times where the nations of Earth changed the most, whether that be through violent colonization or peaceful spread of a religion. Pick any nation out of hundreds and start your great adventure. In the beginning your ""great adventure"" will end within a few years with your entire great empire crumbled under whatever pathetic nation is next to you. The learning curve seem Immensely steep when you start up the game for the first time. Getting into Grand Strategy might be the Hardest thing I have ever done. It's easy to just don't play it. That's what I did, for 2 years. Scrolling past it in the Library list, mentally putting a check-mark over it, telling yourself ""I will play this soon™, no rush"", as I have with So many great games.Once that learning curve is mastered though - A miracle, an eye-opener and a mind-blower appears, tearing apart your very Existence as a human being. ""I want to play the Iroquois and colonize Americas centuries before the Europeans come"". ""I want to play Navarra and conquer entire Europe"". ""I want to play Brunei and unify Indonesia, colonize Australia and dominate the seas"". I had some insane ideas, sadly the first attempts didn't succeed, but I just restarted and tried over and over again until it succeed. Looking up guides and let's plays helped a lot. I always try to stay ""pure"" when I play a new game, not looking up information in case it will ruin the experience. A stupid rule.I will say though, that this game is not for Everyone, you have to; like history and alternative history, have a lot of spare time, be obsessed with painting as much of the map in your color. Being a real-time/turn-based strategy fan might not be enough to enjoy grand strategy. Although Europa Universalis IV is in real-time, you don't build any barracks and train individual units, workers or collect any resources as fast as possible to outplay your opponent. Europa Universalis is relatively historically correct which means it's unfair. Whatever France, Ottomans or Ming wants and it will happen. Luckily the game gives you the tools to change that. It comes down to choosing a path out of Military, Diplomacy or Trade and arguably; Religion. Combine whichever is necessary to end the infidels.Europa Universalis IV will offer many late nights and work daydreams for the ones who meet the criteria and are ready to climb the stairs. Many hours will be spent on what, at the time might feel like a waste but you will emerge as a glorious EmperorNote: There are a bunch of DLC's that add, not only new nations but also very improved gameplay mechanics that changes the game in a big way. The latest DLC's have received some negative critique regarding the lack of content compared to what is expected. Personally I think this game has given me enough for what I paid. "

												I did not buy this game as it was just released, but far later. For a reasonable price i could get EU4 with the following DLCs: Women in History, Wealth of Nations, Res Puplica, Conquest of paradise, Art of war. These DLCs makes a game with a lot of strategic options, and a fun gameplay when you play the game in version 1.11.4. Thanks to steams ""Beta"" tab in the properties of the game it is possible to play this version and disregard everything Paradox has made since. In ironman mode in the game it is still possible to get the achivements that existed at the time 1.11.4 was released.By reverting the game to the old version i have played many hours and never needed to rush to finish the games i was playing. It has been fun, and slightly educational. If you play this game, you will learn something about history in the period 1444-1821, and you will learn a lot of geography while having fun.And this game is fun for anyone who can appreciate the management of a nation. The strategic choises you make regarding allies, expansion, religion, technology and the tactical deployment of your armies have such huge impact on your game, that you get to understand the importance of almost every desicion you make.For me, i quikly startet playing in Ironman mode. This means that the game saves often, and you cannot revert any decisions you make. You have to live with the consequences of your actions. This has given a lot of retrys, but when you start a game, hunting an achivement, and you succeed, the feeling is simply great. Especially if it was a hard one.I have found this game very fun and very rewarding, and i like the ironmode idear: Bear the consequences of your actions. And this applies to the consequences you couldn't have predicted as well :) It is a usefull lesson thats apllicable to real life as well.			"

												I've never been a fan of Paradox's DLC Policy, doubt I ever will. I truely enjoyed the game during it's initial release, in-fact I enjoyed it so much I continued to pick up some of the early DLCs, but the new trend of lacklustre and overpriced DLCs has seriously been a turn off for me. Conclusion: It is a great game. The biggest problem is that to truly enjoy the game to its fullest you need to spend an absurd amount of money on extremely overpriced DLC.  "

												I used to love this game. It was and arguably still is one of the best games in the Grand Strategy genre. But the DLCs killed the whole thing. First, the price of each new expansion is getting above any reasonable amount for a bunch of not that much meaningful/flavorful features. Don't get me wrong, some of the expansions are great, but lots of them feel like something that should be in the base game in the first place, or not at all.  But that would be fine, nobody forces you to buy DLCs, right?Wrong.The DLC policy of Paradox is absolutely horrendous - once it's launched, you get the DLC installed automatically with a patch of base game and the AI countries are using the benefits of DLCs for themselves (the most striking example is the province development in Common Sense), and unless you pay, you are forced to compete with enemy that has a massively unfair advantage. It is a blatant cash grab and because of that, I won't be buing any more of Paradox's DLCs or new games (even though I was hyped for HoI 4 like anyone else), unless they clean their act or at least release a complete edition... although then there's the risk that it will be like the EU III Complete edition all over again.

												Awhile back me and a few freinds started a game of eu4 multiplayer which we played every sunday. We began the game at 1444 and each player picked a nation. I chose tunis a small north african nation with a plan to unite africa and take southern europe by storm. Nikoli and tim decided to pair up as crimea and the golden horde with ambitions to take over muscovy before they formed russia. Patrick picked denmark, and daniel went for orissa a city state on the eastern coast of india. 3 months later the year is 1586 and the world is a very different place. As tunis i have taken control of all of northern and central africa. I also have several colonies in brazil and have succeded in subjugating the tip of italy. However my economy is in bad shape due to spain portugual and great britains repeated invasion attempts. To my east is the ottomans a massive all powerfull sunni nation who have succeded in taking a large chunk of eastern europe. Relations are tense and the only thing preventing war is my alliance with the timurids a technolgically backward horde that controls vast swathes of asia minor and india. Nikoli and tim made the mistake early on of attacking russia in the winter :D. The war lasted 15 years and nearly bankrupted both crimea and the golden horde. However they scraped a win and over the next hundred years fought off the ottomans and the united commonwealth of poland and lithuania on multiple occasions. Despite succesfully reforming his goverment and westernising nikoli's crimea was eventually overrun and he switched to play as the shogunate of japan. Tim's golden horde succesfully managed to take over the remnants of muscovy and he remains a major power in the region. Patrick managed to unite scandinavia into an empire, but grew bored and switched to playing as the papal state in italy. He is not very happy that my tunis now controls half of the peninsula and persistently declares holy wars against me :/. Daniel isolated from the rest of us has become one of the dominant powers in india and is currently colonising the spice islands. We have become very invested in this game and my dream of taking over southern europe still burns strong. Buy this game, convince all your freinds to buy this game and embark on an epic simulation of over 400 years of the worlds history.			"

A strategy gem! - 10/10Introduction:Europa Universalis IV has deserved the right to be called a 'grand strategy game'. It doesn't need fancy graphics and extreme 3D battles, it's all up to your imagination. All you need to be a true conqueror of the world is your brain. It all comes down to tactics and knowledge. Once you got into it EUIV will drag you into parallel existence for a very long time where you can write your own history...maybe you will dominate the world...or maybe you will get crushed because you became to greedy.Pro:You can easily waste hundreds of hours playing this game without getting bored (duration of one game if you play it from the earliest date until the end: 15-30 hours)High replayability: Every nation is different and has it's pros and cons. No game will be the same.Strategy with depth: You have to take care of loads of stuff in your realm, plan ahead, adjust everything to suddenly changed situations and watch your friends, enemies, rivals and coalitions closely to prevent the development of bad situations and to turn it into an advantage over your enemies.World design looks greatChange the true history and write your ownChallenging AI (mostly)...so you don't need other players to have funMultiplayer via Steamworks: I haven't played it with strangers yet but it's so much fun to play with some friends. Make plans together to dominate the world or plot against each other or just backstab your mate in the darkest hour to make profit. Everything is possible. Your friends don't need all the DLC. Every player has access to the DLC of the host. Nice feature!Ironman mode: No mods, vanilla game settings, no manual save option, only 1 autosave slot -> this mode is the mode if you're looking for the real fun. You have to think twice before you decide important decisions because you always have to live with the outcome. This prevents you from doing stuff too careless and forces you to use your brain more. Every success will be so much sweeter.Loads of challenging achievements (only achievable in Ironman mode)Steam Workshop support: There are some pretty good mods available. Neutral:Steep learning curve: You will forget where your head is in your first 5-10 hours if you haven't played a title from 'Paradox' before because there is so much to take care of, but once you have learned the core mechanics you will have a blast! You will even learn new stuff after 100 hours of gameplay. This keeps the game interesting. It is absolutely worth the effort but if you are a impatient person...this game won't be your cup of tea.DLC politic: It's a bit controversial in the community. The main DLC from Paradox are always worth the money but there are several cosmetical packs with new unit skins or music for a few bucks. Some people are arguing that the cosmetical stuff is cut out of the main DLC to milk more money, but Paradox is saying that they're cut out to lower the price of the main DLC because not everyone needs or wants them. Those who want them, can purchase them separately while other people don't have to pay for a feature they don't need. I like it the way it is. I buy the cosmetical stuff when I like it and while it's on sale. Some extra support for the devs. You won't miss something big if you don't have them.Contra:German translation: It's a mess. All games from Paradox have a messed up german translation. Missing lines, completely wrong words...simply awful. It isn't a big deal for me because I can understand english and play it with english language but there are people out there which have a problem with it. I guess the translation for other languages aren't much better. Paradox should definitely hire some proper translators or doublecheck the translation with beta tester.Conclusion:It's a 'must-have' for every strategy lover. Absolutely worth the full price. If you can get it while it's on sale: what are you waiting for? It's a steal. Buy it. The world, your vassals and your army are waiting for you.10/10 (it's 2016...and it's still  a gem.)----------------------~ Do you want to add something to the review or do you want to share your opinion?

												There is fundemental problems with reading the percentage negatives or positives whilst many mechanics are heavily scewed in favour of the Ai.First you will notice, should the player go over his manpower limit they will be penalised heavily via their income. This does not apply to Ai armies who, despite having one province can field double their manpower limit (check the ledger) with no penalty. In fact I had a game just a minute ago where I, as England were called into a war helping Castil and Portugal against Aragon, Papl States and France. France stomped everyone all at once. Why? Because they were 15k OVER their force limit. The reason I tell you this is because it is indicative of the Ai already deciding on the outcomes of conflict. Why did my allies, Portugal and Castile NOT go over their force limit? Because the outcome of the war had been predetermined. Me and my allies were going to lose from the off. These types of Ai buffs are often explained as being an aid to an Ai that can't think like a human but giving the Ai the ability to field armies WAY OVER its economic ability to do so is not a check to the human brain as it is impossible to combat.Further to this, as mentioned above the percentages do not tally. For example, both me as England, and the Ai as France fired a seige of at exactly the same time. Me in Brittany's capital (Frances ally) and them in Normandy. Both started the seige at -49%.Checking the seige capability of both armies I found that mine was +4% whilst theirs was - 1.8%. I had more artillery and reasonably thought ""I'll have mine seiged quicker than them because the percentages are in my favour as is the firepower"". Not so. France managed to take my Fully maintained castle, with no firepower and less seige ability quite some considerable time before I managed to take Brittany's capital.The percentages mean absolutely nothing and the maths does not tally. You can have better firepwoer and higher seige capability and still be beaten on time. You can have higher numbers of troops with better morale and favourable terrain and STILL lose if the Ai sees fit to do so.It appears that much depends on how you are performing at the time. If you are expanding aggressively the Ai is much more likely to, rather form a coalition for example, just ensure by some arbitrary means, like those mentioned above, that you do not expand further. This equates to ""cutting the player down to size"" by means that are unrealistic. Whether that be tiny nations having huge armies and some very cute and convinient morale boosts or just making sure you do not win battles that are so heavily in your favour it is impossible to think it feesable you'd lose it.Also, the ""fort"" mechanism restricting movement is awful. Particularly as the Ai can move freely around your lands whilst you have to go to the other ends of the earth to cross into the neighbouring province.Further unbalancing in the stability mechanisms frustrate. The Ai does not go into minus stability...ever. Loses a monarch? Still stays on the same stability it was just before. Alliances are a problem also. The players allies will seldom join an aggresive war (unless its against their rival) and suffers no penalty. The player is simply told that they will not join for X,Y, and Z. No - 25 prestige penalty for the Ai. No broken alliance and opinion debuff. Just ""not joining"". The player however is expected to join EVERY aggresive war, EVER|Y defensive war and if you don't? -25 prestige, loss of alliance and opinion debuff. Why does the Ai NOT get this? Of course the other issue you will notice is how your alliance member s WILL NOT help you in battle and will often walk off somewhere irrelevent leaving you at the mercy of the Ai troops. This DOES not happen for Ai allies since they will never be more than 2 provinces apart and WILL back up when needed, even leaving a partially sieged castle to do so; something YOR allies will not do.. This is to say nothing of the ridiculous alliances the AI can get between themselves and clear rivals that are obviously only meant to keep the player in check. The alliances system in this game is tantamount to AI vs Player as opposed to the country vs country balance that should be obvservable. To highlight this consider that, as England I warred with Spain. I was Allied to The Commonwealth and Scotland and they to Papal States and Kongo. The Commonwealth armies, rather than come to me in Iberia went to Naples instead allowing the Ai doomstacks of over 100k troops (how stupid) to pick us off quite easily (another example of how the Ai allies will not leave their buddies) whilst Scotland sat in their capital and did not budge whilst Kongo, the Ai ally floated to Louisiana to siege my colonies. Yes that's right, Scotland,my ally, wouldn't come down to Spain to help out whilst the Ai ally floated accross the atlantic to help and my other ally, the Commonwealth decided that the war goal, Spains capital, was infact a suggestion NOT a necessity. It seems that the Ai gets all the positives the player gets, none of the negatives and then a few extra buffs on top. (Lucky Nations? WTF is that about? Especially the fact that to Ironman you have to have ""historic"" lucky nation on...but this doesnt apply if the player picks a lucky nation making a mockery of the ""Historic"" aspect of the choice). Essentially, as with many other developers the way to make a game challenging is not to improve the mechanics in a way that MAKE a game challenging, just add arbitrary buffs that exclude the player to make it SEEM more challenging ( CA I'm looking at you as well). I'm not sure who at PI designs or decides on the updates for their games but this one has been ruined by very poor design choices regarding updates, unreasonable Ai buffs and a percentage system that lulls the player into a false sense of security. It is actually more prudent to NOT expand or go to war at all making the game a boring ""click-a-thon"" where, aside from colonies, your land mass will remain the same. This makes for quite a boring experience where you are torn between doing nothing or fighting pointlessly against an Ai that will win because of the insane help it recieves. Poor coding and bad ""improvement"" decisions have made this game into a very aggrivating experience where it is apparent that the handicap facing the player is more than insane ""lucky"" buffs but extends to differing behaviour of Ai allies that handicap the player still further. The most infuriating aspect of any game is watching the Ai behave exactly how you would like it to behave when watching an Ai vs Ai war only to see it behave totally differently when it comes to backing you up. This makes the whole experience of playing the game incredibly unpleasent. In 30 years of gaming I have never once played a game that handicaps the player to this incredible extent. Sticking pins in your eyes is less painful than watching your army get diced by the combined enemy alliance whilst your ally sits in the next province waiting for the enemy doomstack to finish him off seperately because he is 1/10th of a way through sieging a castle. It's sort of like a Sim-City-esque game where you spend all your time building up your provinces without the satisfaction of seeing these buildings appear with a little sub game for the sado-masochistic imperialists out there where you will just be waiting for the moment the Ai shafts you. And not shafts as in cunningly attacks when you're weak. No, shafts where a tiny nation can field a bigger army than its economy can sustain whilst having every single morale buff it can get just to put you back in your place.If you like looking at numbers and percentages that appear favourable but will, 9/10 times end in you losing then this game is for you. Alternatively you could just develop a gambling addiction....At least you stand some chance of breaking even.			"

												This is one of those games that you just can't stop playing once you get into it. Fair warning, there is a decent learning curve for beginners (one of my friends never put the time in to learn how to play because it was a bit overwhelming at first glance). Once you get the hang of the basic gameplay you will most likely learn to love the game. I especially recommend this game to those who love history as this game is all about historical events and it gives you the ability to rewrite history according to your will. One of the best parts about the game is how every single playthrough is different. The A.I., for all the hate it gets, does seem to do a good job in my opinion of being unpredictable. It's pretty much impossible for two playthroughs to be exactly the same based on the scope of the game (how many countries there are) and the adaptiveness of the A.I. Something that I think goes overlooked when discussing this game is the sheer amount of options the player gets when playing. For example, when starting a game, you get to choose any counrty that you want! It seems like a small thing, but how many games really give you that sort of option. Usually I feel like games restrict the creativity of the player, but EU4 really allows the player to do basically whatever they want. To top it all off, the modding community is great and even though it's been out for years now, they are still updating the game and you can easily find a multiplayer game to join if you want. Overall, one of my top 5 games of all time! I can't recommend EU4 enough.			"

												This game used to be fantastic. How the system worked is that although there was an abundance of DLC, every time a new DLC was released you would also get a free patch to go along with it that usually added something substantial to the game. Now? With the recent release of the DLC ""Common Sense"", the ability to develop provinces  was released. However, if you didn't buy the DLC, you will be unable to do it while literally every other nation in the game will be able to develop their provinces and eventually become stronger than you. Its a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t pay to win feature. Would not recommend unless you like shelling over cash over and over just to play correctly.			"

												EUIV is a fun game. I think its better than the total war series even though the battle and war mechanics are terrible. However I would never reccomend EUIV or Crusaders Kings II to anyone for any reason whatsoever.Paradox interactive is number one on my list of companies that I will NEVER buy from again. They force you to buy expansions by automatically updating your EUIV game and basically forcing you to pay for an expansion to unlock certain features. This locks you out of certain aspects of the game like not being able to develop your provinces unless you buy the Common Sense DLC.Furthermore it makes all of your previous save games incompatible. I spent 170 hours playing as England and basically getting to a point where I dominated world trade. I can no longer play that save game so essentially all of that time has been wasted.Besides whatever the initial price tag is you need to consider how much of a dent buying all of the expansions will put into your pocket. You also need to realize that you will be forced by paradox to buy future expansions and that your save games will essentially be unplayable in as little as a year. NEVER NEVER NEVER BUY ANY GAME FROM PARADOX. They are as bad as free to play MMO games.			"

												The game was awesome. (Apart form the dlc etc issues mentioned in almost every comment...)But with every patch they made it more ""realistic"", ie harder to conquer Europe when starting with a one province minor nation. By now loads of things just depend on luck (even when only playing republics to avoid all the no-heir and regency random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t). Example: start as Venice, do well. Hungary gets the random event which gives them a 100 army tradition general. They decide to attack me. I have 150% percent the men and higher military tech, bait them to attack me in the mountains across a river in Salzburg. The other general has 6 shock, mine has 0. I get completely destroyed. Definitely realistic, there have been Generals like that.Buy the game and watch the AI succeed with completely random non-sense strategies. Have fun.			"

												Where do I begin? Maps and Menus IV is the best game for the map and menu enthusiast. It's got 27 unique maps and even more unique menus. In fact, almost every month you'll get a brand new menu. There are even some menus that turn into MORE MENUS! This is no joke people, they really delivered on the Maps and Menus. But, despite the name, the unsung hero of Maps and Menus IV are Numbers. There's two main kinds of numbers, green numbers and red numbers. Protip: You want more green numbers than red numbers. Sometimes, but rarely, you'll run into yellow numbers. But it's not enough to touch on. This game is perfect for:-Cartographers-Menu Enthusiast-Numbers people-Armchair Generals-Doing light to heavy chores-Watching TV-Wasting time you could be using to devlope yourself into the person your granddad always wanted-My granddad-Doing your math homework-Finding a prom date-Finding a prom date your granddad approves of-Why doesn't my granddad appreciate the things I do?-I try so hard-Nothing I do pleases him10/10 Would play for the rest of my life			"

You can be Ireland spreading the green-ness to the entire world, or be Byzantium and take back all the former Roman territories. And the mechanics are vastly improved over how they were in EU3.

												I really enjoyed this game until about a year ago but after the recent events I honestly cannot recommend it anymore.What went wrong?Imho, two big things.Firstly, the DLC money schemeAnd secondly, the constant ""updating"" and changing of the game's mechanics.I bought EU4 with the first 4(?) expansions when it was on sale and have really played the hell out of it ( I think it shows). But when new DLCs come out every couple of months and each DLC is about 15 to 20 € then you seriously start to wonder wether you really need those.But that's not really your decision at all.The problem here is that the last couple of DLCs completely changed how the game is played. From little aesthetic changes to changes to core mechanics, the game as it is now is very much different to how it started out. You can argue about the necessity or usefulness of all the new mechanics, but the implementation is terrible.And the changes affect the AI regardless wether you bought the DLCs. So even though you didn't buy that DLC and can't use X yourself, the AI can and will use X (and likely have another advatage because of it).All those changes and all those ""updates"" also mean you have to start a new campaign because save games will most likely not be compatible.(Yes, you can roll back your version number but then you couldn't use your mods anymore - they update as well)It's sad to see this great game become just a way to milk the players.Paradox should stop mucking about with EU4 and simply start with EU5.And instead of all those AI boni, maybe try and just make the AI smarter.I wouldn't buy it anymore, and the way Paradox handles EU4 you shouldn't either.

												Hello Steam Community.Well... what can I say about this game that has not been said a hundred times already? Other than its worth its purchase on how you see it. Firstly to start this review, this game will take your way of strategy in managing a country in a good diplomatic and expanding style. It is not the Crusader Kings 2, but that is not necessary a bad thing, quite the opposite in some ways. If you want to play a game that focuses on managing a country through pretty much basic but a variety of ways which focus around diplomacy, colonies and expanding. This is the game to get.Pro Aspects about the game:The Game by itself with its historical starts and able to play pretty much almost over hundreds of different nations from start to finish with many having their own ideas and historical events coming up is just fantastic. This game does show that if you make certain decisions that would have happened in real history it affects your game in the long run. Also its fun to learn about a little history about nations in a game without having to read a book about them at the same time.Another apart from being very addictive is to make you focus rather on brute force but rather using deception strategies when managing your country. Ironically when playing later on with smaller nations I had more enjoyment in making them survive in the shadow of bigger powers and then during the end making them into large empires of their own with the former enemies now in fear. You get a sense of feeling like a proper leader focusing on expansion.Cons about the game:This might be just a little pick of some stuff but firstly the tutorial to get into the game does not really support fresh gamers to a new strategy style of game. But this is not fully a bad thing since Paradox games usually are kinda daunting to get into so, if you want to play this game (Which I still recommend strongly you try it out) Look online for guides for this is a very meaty and large in content in game. So be prepared to have moments of mass confusion though over time this comes in practise.Over a large amount of time if not managed properly your save data will pile up and start eating up your storage so if you have limited storage be sure to remove saves you don't want to keep. At one point I managed to aquire over 45 Gb of storage from just saves alone. Then again if this is taking the date of hundreds of nations and yours as well then I'm not surprised.Also this game is not a game to focus around and command armies or navies around the world in the battles so don't expect the game to focus around that which is not really a bad thing but should not be mistaken for being so.Conclusion:Although this game is daunting to take in at first and can be difficult in managing countries even on Iron Man Mode which makes you have 1 save on the go, this is for me as a strategy lover my most played, appreciated, loved and enjoyed game I've ever played. If you are a strategy player, this deserves a place in your game library or at the very least for you to try out the demo now and take a nation in a historical way, or change the world map forever.

Never pay the full price for these dlc because they barely add anything.			"

												tl;dr: Every two months a free patch is going to come out that will break your game if you don't buy another 17-21$ DLCI'd LOVE to give this game a positive score.But once common sense came out the development team added new ""features"" that pretty much made the game unplayable unless you shell out more money for the dlc to unlock essential features. All the dlc that adds features (Did I say add? I mean unlock, all the dlc buttons are in the base game, just greyed out) add up to a staggering 95$ (Canadian).Don't get me wrong, some of these dlc are actually good, Conquest of Paradise, Art of war, and El dorado for example, as they only locked out non-essential features(mostly) But almost everything since Common Sense is litteral cancer.

												I have played every EU game since the first, and I still can't love them.  It feels like you are playing against the game mechanics instead of the AI.  The rules are excessively fussy, and new rules are made up for different countries, religions, cultures, etc.  It comes across as band-aids on top of band-aids, rather than a rich system of detail.And rebellions are just ridiculous: massive armies just spring into existence while it would take you ages to create the same thing.  I get that they want to model that enormous alien empires face disruption, but the mechanics are still heavy handed and violate the intricate rules that the designers themselves made up.			"

												After playing Hearts of Iron, Victoria, and Crusader Kings, EU4 probably has the least and most to offer. In terms of things to do, this game definitely has the other 3 trumped. EU4 doesn't have the specialization and complexity of the other 3 games though, that's for sure. The pros of this game are that it's easy to get into, there's a ton of stuff to do, and you are given a lot more leeway to play how you want. Overall, this game has the most ""sandboxy"" feeling out of all Paradox's grand strategy games. If you are coming from like Civilization or something then this game is a great addition to your collection. If you have played Paradox's previous games, EU4 is by no means a pushover as some would suggest. I highly recommend it, as you are given a lot more freedom to do what you want than other GS games.

												AMAzing game Really suggest buying it if you are into Grand Strategy games. You have the ability to play AS ANY nation IN THE WORLD from Nov. 11 1444 all the way to Jan. 2 1821. That is a very long time. From this you can play history as your way the way you want and the way you see it. There are some problems with the game such as nations blobbing out of control but if you like the whole idea of nation conquest and nation building Then I HIGhly suggest this game although the learning curve is very steep once you get into it you will not stop playing it.

												I have never reviewed a game prior to this, but can't help have a bit of a moan about Paradox.Whilst I love this game and most of the genre, HOI, Crusader Kings and the EU series.The engine is much the same as previous versions of the game. I am not asking Paradox to to reinvent the wheel every time they release a new version, and whilst a real effort is made to improve the game at each iteration, not only do you have to pay full price for each game, despite owning previous ones, you are expected to buy the DLC just to make the game work the way it should have in the first place.I checked today, during a sale where there is a 66% reduction in the cost of DLC, it would still cost me an additional £63.00 to get it all and I already have 23 DLC's, bringing what I have spent on the game to well over £140, that's insane. Without the sale it would have cost £189.00 what the **** Paradox. People complain about the likes of WOT or Stronghold Kingdoms being pay to play games, but at the very least they are honest.Whilst I really enjoy this kind of strategy and Paradox are streets ahead in this type of game, I just can't recommend it because of the all the DLC that's required to make it complete.

												EU4 was a very nice game that has suffered from continuous DLC development that changes the base game. The breaking point for me was when developing your provinces, an integral part of base gameplay, was reworked and put behind a paywall wih the DLC ""Common Sense.""  With the AI retaining the ability to develop its provinces normally, only the player's country remains a medieval backwater, unless you pay for the privilege. After hundreds of hours already in the game, it left a sour feeling to be asked to pay money to retain features that had already been present. The level of chrome and updates the game has received since release are alright if you own the DLC, but largely to the detriment of players who own only the base game.			"

												I love this game.  It is BY FAR my favorite game in my entire library.  However, in its current state, is unplayable.  Paradox Ineractive, as usual, have broken the game with the most DLC.  At the moment, several features are DLC-exclusive and make the game virtually unplayable.  If you decided to get the game, simply beta back to an older date.  The older date, however, is not the current game.  Take me back in time 3 weeks, and I would recommend the life out of this game.  Now?  Not a chance.  Sure, the game is great and all in past versions, but the past versions of the game IS NOT the current game.  You might as well call beta Kerbal Space Program the actual game while you're at it.			"

												I would like to thank paradox entertainment for butchering their perfect game. where at initial release the player had all the freedom they liked from previous releases (1 and 2 were easely modified by texteditor) and the great graphical improvements from 3 adding the workshop for modders at 4, now thanks to DLC and updates completley stale.if you like playing history games by following literal history, then this game is for you. if you think of purchasing an empire building game with depth and freedom in how you like to play it, save your money and leave this game where it is.adding MANDETORY colonial nations was their first mistake (had it been optional, no complaints community wide).Continuesly updating petty changes was their second and probalbly biggest mistake, as with each update the modders had to either update their mod for every small change in the defines file, or completley start from scratch again, killing the joy of modding the game all together. Like me the fun was over after the 100th time i had to open the defines.ini file to rechange a few lines because with each graphical update, or other changes outside the defines file it would be back to its original vanilla self after each (frequent) update. crashing the game upon reload of a save each and every time.So i stoped playing for a while, then when a few months later i think of giving the game another try, i find it in an even worse state then before. To find half the games mechanics have disapeared and the core itself extremeley unstable. i'm running the latest ATI video card, 16 GIGs of ram and have a quadcore 3.2GHZ that runs like an Octacore, but the game runs like i'm back playing on an old PC from the '90s. Browsing the DLC's i find each and every part i miss in the core as a DLC.its just  a darn shame in my opinion, as it was a perfect game to play and enjoy when it was released, bugs and all.			"

												There is a reason EU4 is one of the highest rated games on Steam.If someone were to ask me ""what are some all time best games someone should own?""I would say:- EU4- Mount and Blade Warband- XCOM (new versions or old you choose)EU4 is *NOT* a 4X, because to be honest most 4X are not really 4X, they are like 2.5-3X at most.  IN EU4 you have to manage every aspect of your empire, administrative development, economy and trade, military progress, religion, and diplomatic relations.  As opposed to many other games you have to actually use diplomacy because the AI is too strong and you cannot just make enemies with everyone and eat them.   First off, if you did that you'd get a massive coalition and secondly, your country would implode from being at war too much and ceding too much land too quickly.EU4 is a constant struggle against the AI especially if you challenge yourself and choose a nation that isn't historically powerful.  That is the best way to play EU4 in my opinion - choose a goal and try to achieve it.  Want to make The Hansa a thriving and powerful European nation in 1821?  Want to expand the Papal State to own half of Europe by 1821 and shout ""God WILLS IT!"" a lot?  Want to play a Native American tribe or the Aztecs and stop Europeans from gaining dominance in the new world?  You can do all these things and play them out in what I would consider by far the most accurate and representative game out there.  EU4's interface is daunting at first, no doubt, but later you realize that it is that level of detail that makes things play out more similarly to real life.  Your people will get upset if you're at war too long, your allies might not go with you into every war, some people wont ally you because they just dont like you or your religion or whatever, some wars you lose even though you have 2x their troops but they have better troops and more tactics, if you spend all your administrative power ceding provinces from enemies you'll fall behind in administrative tech and you'll also gain corruption in you nation.  All these interactive elements form a platform for empire building that is hands down the closest to reality out there.EU4 is not a 4X, it is in the truest form of the word a simulation of real world empire building.10/10 in my book.

												This is an excellent game. It has the potential to expand your knowledge of, or even develop an interest in, the subject of history - It is a series unparalleled in the genre of Grand Strategy and In the earlier versions of the game, I would have recommended it to anyoneHowever, I can only in good conscience recommend this game to people who have enough money to buy all of the DLC, or at the very least, has a good friend who they can play multiplayer with who buys all the DLC. The game is not able to stand on its own merits without this. The way the DLC model in this game works is that they expand content, change systems and do other rehauls of systems; and charge money for it. That makes sense, they rehaul a system so they ought to get paid right? Well, sure, unless they take content away from the player that they originally to repackage it and sell it off to consumers, as was the case in most of the ""new features"" in common sense. It's a disgrace.I've had bugs occur in previous patches which were caused by not owning the DLCs; and even if you do not own the DLC, the AI (i.e. every single other nation in the game) does, which means the AI develops an unfair advantage over you in many cases.Also, in the case of one of their DLCs, an ebook, they were literally selling Thomas Paine's Common Sense (which, by the way, is in the public domain and hence free for anyone to download online.) - It's hard not to characterise Paradox as money hungry with actions such as these.And unfortunately, as I mentioned earlier, this series is unparralleled. I want so much to love this game, and I often do, but it leaves a really poor taste in my mouth when they do such things as these, and they have no incentive to stop doing the things they are doing because suckers like myself still buy the damned DLC, and they have no competition in this field.

												If you're reading this, I'm assuming that you're a white European male. Every now and then, you think back to the good ol' days, back when we could subjugate native populations and assert our dominance over other races, and no one would bat an eye. Because the only people who we allowed to have an opinion were our own kind, and they were doing the same as us. The good days.Nowadays, the new trends include libtard bullpoo like ""tolerance"", ""native reservations"", and ""remorse"". No empires left. Your guaranteed dominance over most of the world's population is dependent on your merits as a human being, not your bloodline. This game lets you live the aforementioned good times. If you want to create a mediterranean merchant empire, forcing smaller nations into poverty, be my ♥♥♥♥ing guest friend. Do you want to crush the native traditions of the New World with guns and swords, supplanting a proud culture with your own? Go for it, famalammer. Even if you're a damn commie liberal, play as the Cherokee, and conquer Europe, or the entire world, becoming worse than the monsters that you sought to destroy.Are you female? Wrong, no women on the internet. But if you identify as one, take advantage of the free (The one free DLC, Paradox holding true to what can be accomplished in their game. Good on you lads!) DLC, Women in History. Fight the patriarchy with OP events detailing the escapades of women in history, as the name would suggest.TL;DR, wholesome and tolerant fun for the whole family.			"

Do you have what it takes to change history? Most games difficulty can be judged by the percentage of players who have completed the achievements. In Europa Universalis 4 around 14% have completed the basic ones. So this game is very hard and there's a reason to why, but more on this later. It doesn't take very long to get in to because the tutorials are great! Europa Universalis 4 is very complex in a Paradox Interactive way. But I find it very challenging and rewarding at the same time. What I like the most is the diplomacy and the forging of alliances. Everything falls into place when war breaks out, then you will either regret or cherish the alliances you've made. So you have to be on your toes and pay attention to the world around you, not only in order to accomplish your goals, but to strike when other nations fall apart. Suing for peace is another thing I like, where the options are based on how well the war is going, or went if you completely destroyed your enemy. The AI use these options too, with various outcome. The trade system in Europa Universalis 4 is complex but well worth taking a closer look at and understand well because it generates the money for your nation. There are details and other brilliant things worth mentioning too, but I'll leave them for you to find. Europa Universalis 4 doesn't tell you what to do so you have to challenge yourself with your own goals. There are missions and decisions where the game asks you to do things. Like ""Build fort in province x"", ""Increase reputation with nation x"" as examples of missions. These missions rewards you with different things which helps your nation. The decisions can be ""Form empire from x"", which gives your nation a boost in certain areas during a set date. But you don't have to do these. If you don't like missions you can chose them and then cancel them, the decisions you don't care about you just ignore. So there's nothing stopping you making your own history. The history and current progress of the world is written in a ledger, which is quite interesting. The ledger is a very useful tool and probably worth a review on its own. There are events, historical and generic. The historical events are the only thing which force you to do things ""as they were"". Unfortunately I hate the generic ones.I've read that they're meant to give the player something to do and balance things, but for me they are just frustrating and just there to work against you. For example, there's one where your heir falls ill. you can either spend money to send for a physician or not spending money(or ducats as they're called). The ""spend money"" option gives the heir 50% chance of dying. The other where you don't spend money a 75% chance. I always chose the 50% option, spend money and EVERY time the heir dies! Other generic things happen depending on different things, even though they shouldn't happen they do happen and always in the most inappropriate time and some are bound to happen sooner or later. So these generic events gives me a ""love, hate relation"" to this game. The Iron man-mode which you have to be in to get the achievements I guess I can cope with in the long run. In Iron man-mode you only have one save game and the game saves every month and overwrites that save game every time. Which results in two things. 1: The game progress very slowly as you wait for the save file to be written 70% of the time you play. 2: Things which happen, either your own wrong doing or the generic events are irreversible. So if you do a mistake or are screwed by an event, you have to start all over, from 1444. Having someone nearby who can comfort you and give you advice does help to overcome these things. If you are unsure, wait for it to come on sale, because this game is great and a ""must buy"" for everyone who love strategy games.			"

												If you are mildly interested in geography, religion, history and world politics as well as a strategist this is the game for you.In this game you will experience various sorts of historical phenomenons between the years of 1444, the onset of the Ottoman Empire, and 1821, with the fall of the Holy Roman Empire.Colonisation, Intrigue, war, expansion, trade and diplomacy is just a small portion of what the game has to offer. The list of things to do in this game would be far to long to cover in this review. But i can assure you that the game handles each part very well. Of course there are always some things that needs to be polished but nothing major at all.If you are new to the genre, dont be discouraged of the complexity this game has to offer. New players will have an easy time understanding the basics from the very well made tutorial which covers all the things you need to know to play the game. From there you´ll learn most of the mechanics by just reading and screwing around with the different map modes, numbers, logs, etc.For those of you who like to maximize your gameplay to the smallest detail I definetly recommend this game aswell. You can improve your military stats to the an amazingly precise degree and micromanage your production with buldings as well as events. When you get good enough at the game there is alot of intresting and immersive achievements. The price tag is definetly worthy to be 40 €. There are hundred upon hundred hours to be found in this game. If this is a bit to expencive for you as is steam sales are definetly something to consider purchasing.			"

												I would have recomend this game at some point in the past , especailly given that i've spent over a thousand hours in it , but its more obvious than ever that paradox dosen't care about making games anymore and would rather just cut them all into a million  pieces and sell you each piece individually at a premium. They're doing what EA did to the Sims 3 , sell you the framework for the game at 50 or 60 dollars , and then have all of this overmarked DLC which should have been in the base game.EU III just havd 4 expansions that came out once a year, but At the time of writing there are 6 ""major"" DLCs that have come out in the nearly 2 years since its relase . Now we're at the point where paradox did a complete overhall of the province system that was in the base game , but locked parts of the new updated system behind a paywall.You are now paying for an update of what was the base game at launch.If you want to get into Europa Universalis buy EU III. However don't buy it on steam , EU III complete here dosen't have Napoleon's Ambition and In Nomine. "

												One of the best strategy games on the market now! Europa Universalis IV is just fantastic and very addictive! You can choose any country that existed between 1444 to 1821 and play it. From a native tribe in North America to a great european power! If you choose for example Portugal or Spain you can probably be the first to set sail to the New World. If you choose France or England that are in the 100 Years War at the at the start. You can also choose one of the small german states/nations and try to overthrow Austria and become the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire or play as a daimyo and unite Japan!You have many decisions to make along the long way between 1444 to 1821. For example as England or Scotland you can form Great Britain after some objectives are made, as Castile you can form Spain. There also other formable countries for example The Polish Commonwealth, Germany, Hindustan, Holy Roman Empire, Ireland, Prussia, the Netherlands, Russia and lots more!In the upcoming DLC Conquest of Paradise there will be new native tribes, When you conquer or colonise a certain amount of land new nations will be formed, for example if you play as Spain and you have coquered all of the Aztecs, Mayas and Zapotecs the game will form a colony nation called New Spain, that will become a vassal.Paradox made a good job on this and the community is also very good! 9/10			"

												I have played this game for over 900 hours, because the older versions of the game looked rather promising. Then with every consecutive DLC and ""free"" update I started losing faith. Now I will just have to say that this game is unplayable, for several reasons:Rather than improving and fixing the AI to suit the game, they do the exact opposite. They made a horrible, mostly useless AI and started designing the game around it. This results in a game that, inevitably, will feel less like a simulator of history between 1444 and 1821, and more like just a bunch of blobs around your blob that you have to fight. It is in no way different from RTS games at this point, except somewhat bigger and semi turn-based. Even for people who do not particularly care about history, this is still dreadful, because the AI is no longer in any way enjoyable. In older versions of the game you could actually see the Holy Roman Empire being made from time to time, but now the bots are such debiles that there is no way you are going to see that, ever.Paradox Interactive are a bunch of kikes who know incredibly well that they virtually own the grand strategy market. Initially it did indeed look like PI was caring about designing an interesting game and the first DLC was kind of alright. Did not take too long to see the trend, though. They know very well that nobody will be making any similar game any time soon. Practically they force loyal consumers to pay for overpriced garbage that does not add anything, because, as already said, they know they have nowhere else to go. There are no high-budget non-Paradox grand strategy games. Below is a list explaining exactly how little all of the DLC does in comparison to the price you are paying for it.However, before I start, here is something you really need to know: DLC is just a cancerous term that has been made, sort of like a political euphemism, to start pushing through human vitriol that can be literally anything and charge for at the price of literally any arbitrary amount. The term ""expansion packs"" did not exactly cut it for multi-billion dollar corporations like Electronic Arts and Paradox (the publisher) who wished to sell garbage to the consumer. However, that is not to say all DLC can be horrible. The DLC for EU4 is cancer, though. Why is it cancer? Because it does not introduce any new game mechanics to the game. It merely disguises itself as unlocking new mechanics, but in reality the game mechanics are already offered for free, but these work only for the bots. All the DLC does is enables these features to work for you, the player, as well. That is why every Paradox Interactive employee needs to land under a speeding bus on a highway. Anyway, here it is: Common Sense - Costs 12 dollars. What does it do? They like to make big lists of features for every DLC, but this is the only significant change you will feel at all: being able to improve development in provinces, add inferior static bonuses to your Protestant nation and being able to support the independence of junior union partners or colonies. Mind you that none of these mechanics are advanced. You will work these out in five minutes. This is at the top of the list because of the fact that you are paying Paradox Interactive 12 dollars for having to pay a horrendously large sum of monarch points for a meagre improvement in your provinces. The most important part is that the bot can do this even if you do not have the DLC. Art of War - Costs a little over 12 dollars. What does it do? It allows your ships to carry allies. Does this have any use outside of multiplayer (i.e. for allied bots?) You guessed it. No! Not at all. Okay, but what about being able to designate objectives in enemy/occupied provinces? No, it doesn't work. None of these features work, because the AI is broken. Paradox Interactive is a subsidiary of one of the largest companies in Sweden and apparently also the least competent one, full of hissy hipsters who revolt at the sight of game criticism. More on that below. It also adds a Thirty Years' War mechanic, which really is the least enjoyable event in the entire game. Oh, and by the way, you can finally make templates of armies/navies so, when you grow to become a huge nation with one million manpower, you do not have the go through the tedium of building a new army from scratch after losing someone in a battle. Why should I pay 12 dollars for such an extremely basic feature you would expect in a grand strategy game to begin with? Oh, because Paradox, and apparently we need millions more to pay for all of our five active employees (50% of population of Sweden). Not to mention, this does not work either, lol. If the landscape you draft your men from has any strait, this seemingly bugless (""What could go wrong?"") feature fails to recruit men in a logical manner. Seriously, wow. Great job. El Dorado - Costs 12 dollars. What does it do? Apparently gold fleets or something. Then some exploration of the Seven Lost Wonders. Then the basic feature, that should have been there to begin with, of automatic exploration. I hope you are starting to see the trend of how you have to pay 12 dollars for very, very basic and barebones GUI features you would expect from a multi-billion dollar company and publisher's grand strategy video game. Oh, and you can make a custom nation. That is probably the only thing worth paying for at all, since there indeed seems to have gone some effort into making this somewhat interesting. The values seem to all be balanced. This is the only compliment Paradox is going to get from me. Naturally, though, this is nowhere near enough to keep me interested, let alone forgive for the greed of those subhumans and senseless game design. Cossacks - I am not going to buy this because at this point it really is directly insulting not just my own, but everyone's intelligence. They want you to pay for knowing what provinces your allies and enemies are interested in. The moment I saw this, I was, like, do they think we are Down's children or something? Why should I pay 15 dollars (used to be 20 dollars, mind you) for something so simple, something I would expect to see in a grand strategy game to begin with? When you go into a grand strategy game about Europe between 1444 and 1821, you expect all the drama that was going on. You expect to be able to interact with other nations' conclaves and heads of state in an engaging way. This was never in the game, but I had some faith in Paradox and expected this to be like that eventually. However, this dream is shattered and I have been conned by charlatans that simply do not deserve anyone's time, and, most importantly, money. I hope every single one of these debiles drowns in burning petrol.There are other DLCs, but they will only redundantly reinforce my points above. Basically, do not buy them. Stay away from this game. If you do not give any money to these people, you are enabling candidates who might rise up to fame and, in an ideal scenario, come up with superior alternatives to Europea Universalis, Crusader Kings and whatever other filth Paradox pumps out. Do everyone, especially humanity, a favour and do not buy this game or any of its ""content"".As for the developers themselves: in update 1.10, they introduced a feature that makes, essentially, no sense from both a video game and human perspective. Basically, when you go to war with someone, they have military access through every single nation that gives military access to you. Yes. Not the enemy. You. Let us not improve the AI and make them stop going to wars they geographically cannot possibly win, no, let us just add a feature that makes literally no sense at all. You have to be mentally ill, seriously. Screw Paradox. I wish there wasn't a character limit on this.			"

												It feels like after every update, the developers are further and further breaking the game. Just like Microsoft is doing with Skype (seriously what the hell?). Common Sense locks out people who don't have it, so I have several friends who cannot play the full game unless me or another person who has the DLC hosts a multiplayer game so they can enjoy the full game. Utterly ridiculous. I have long enjoyed the game, but I have occasionally disagreed with the changes throughout the game's development. The Fort system is ludicrous because the AI ignores the forts and goes right past to destroy your army while you cannot get past their forts. The AI also will destroy you utterly after being an ally for a long period for no reason other than, ""Well, I suddenly want all your land, dear ally! Sorry!""Then there's also playing moderate to small sized countries where every country around you will hate you and declare six simultaneous wars on you and destroy you before you can even do anything. I attempted a Venice playthrough three times. Hungary, Milan, Austria, Ottomans, Serbia, Bosnia, and Mamluks all declare war on you nearly simultaneously each time. Once I gotten close to destroying both the Mamluk and Ottoman navy as well as taking the Pelopponese, but then you have the issue of NO ONE wanting to ally you. Not even France and every nation dogpiling on you until there's nothing left. So, in this scenario after nearly defeating the Ottomans I am reduced to nothing and Ottomans kills everyone else. Great work everyone! Oh and more recently Ottomans have been able to ally Bohemia and Aragon with regularity. Is this an intended change to AI behavior? I do not know, but it's rather silly! Similar story with an Oman playthrough. Yemen, Haasa, Hejaz all ally and kill everyone else. Yemen gets allied to Adal who takes Somalia and Mamluks as well. Everyone else is allied against you and there's nothing you can do about it! No one will ally you and the AI make it a certainly that they will crush you for what appears to simply be existing as a player country.I haven't had any major issues since before Common Sense, but it has just been getting more aggravating. Even colonizing is stupid because even if you are a strong country, they will all revolt simultaneously every twenty years, which makes owning them not worth it unless they deliver gold builllion every few months. So, that's yet another feature that isn't fun anymore. I hope AI behavior, colonial nation behavior, development regarding people who don't own Common Sense, and the fort system being cheated by AI is fixed at some point. Otherwise, I'll just be waiting for Stellaris I suppose.			"

												Update: I bit the bullet and bought all 8 major DLCs save Rights of Man, for the cheapest I could find them, using a combination of ""3rd party"" keys and the Steam Winter Sale, and it still totaled $58.Europa Universalis IV is a paywall labyrinth which is so inticing I wandered in and got lost.If you want a highly detailed personal account of EU4's gameplay, here:Good game, I enjoyed it.If you are only bothering to read a negative game review because you know there's going to be an enjoyable rant about something, then read on.I, like so many before me, cannot fathom nor begin to condone the marketing practices that Paradox has undertaken. The DLC content for the game totals to  four times  the price of the base game. As of this writing, six members of the myriad of supposedly ""extra content"" are considered ""expansions."" These expansions, as most will say, are less about adding more content to the game and more about bothering to finish off the content that's already there. In more commonly accepted practices, this is reffered to as a ""patch."" The buisness model of Paradox, essentially, is to charge you $40 to play a demo version of the game, and then charge you an additional  $135  to play the full game. All the while forcing another $40-$50 dollars of miscellania down your throat.EU4 is a good strategy game.EU4 is not $225 worth of a good strategy game.			"

												Easily the best game I have ever played. I've sank 3000+ hours of my life into this game, and do not regret any of it. The paradox team has very actively updated, and improved this game since launch, and the state it is in now is glorious. It is an extremely complex game upon initial playing, but the learning curve is much better than it used to be, and the tooltips in game are incredibly detailed. I've had friends who have never played ask me if it is anything like the Civilization series, and the best response I have to that is Civilization is the equivelant of playing with legos as a child, where as EU4 is like building your dream house to live in. There really is no good comparison though, as the only way they are alike IMO is that both are nation builder games.Eu4 is not for everyone of course, but if you even think you might have an interest in it, chances are you will love it.I recomend a Brandenburg playthrough, and a muscovy playthrough at some point.As for a good nation to get your feet under you, and learn the game, Ottomans is definitely the easiest, and I doubt anyone would argue that. France is another great nation for learning the game in every aspect, and Spain is awesome for learning a well rounded game with a focus on colonizing. Playing any nation in Japan is a blast, but you'll want to have a firm understanding of the game before trying that. The modding community is incredible, and some of the mods out there are like getting a whole new game for free. There are mods to simplify the game, and ease the burdens of monotonous tasks, as well as mods to make the game more complicated, realistic, historical, and difficult if that's your thing. The initial purchase of $39.99 is a fair price, the only bad thing is if you do buy it there is a great deal of DLC that is very important, but not needed to play the game. I believe all of the DLC is absolutely worth the money, but I can see how initimdating it would be to try and buy them all now.			"

												You stand, shoulder-to-shoulder, with your fellow men in arms. Behind you, a long line strechting 200 meters of deadly artillery, the very same your enemy on the other side of the hills have too. You know their power, their speed. You stand near the flanks, and you see allied cavalry near you. You will be facing theirs, but you have prepared your bayonette just for this occassion - their renowned cavalry is no match for you.Trumpets. Your general enters. In the sky, a large golden star hovers over him to tell everyone in the field, he's got a pretty okay shock and fire modifier, but he can't shut up about that capped out mobility. Yeah, that'll help this fight.""Dear god.."", do you hear your close friend whisper to your ear. ""They have full offensive ideas"". You take a gulp, but don't worry, you have 5% extra morale because of some prayer books they forced in your hands. Surely, they will bring you the tide of war.In the distance, you see their line. Their big blue flag with three golden symbols wave in the sky: France. A general swoothes through the sky on a unicorn that is both artillery and a shock bonus sets aflame half the field. Three huge, imposing, intimidating golden stars blind half the regiments on both sides. 6/6/6/6. ""Great"", your friend whispers.Not all is lost. Just before you prepare for the final charge, out of the heavens fall two massive dies. The blue dice bounces around a few times, until it magically rolls onto an 8. You can beat that.Your rusty ol' red die shambles around, fighting the urge to even roll.1.Your 20k men is stack whiped in 2 days. GG.EU4: A game of rolls, no white peace, you win or you lose.			"

												This is the best game ever made. Seriously.Its a good strategy game and all, but it really has improved my life in other ways. For example, I now have superhuman knowledge of trivial points in world history that will never come in handy ever. Every time i blink i see a map of continental Europe burnt into my retinas. I'm pretty sure that I have become racist towards various cultures and religions. Especially the French.Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ them.Also stupid ♥♥♥♥ happens all the time. You've been looking at central Europe for a few hours. You pan the map to the west and notice that Haiti now owns half of America. You declare a war to claim ONE PROVINCE and before you know it the whole damn world is fighting against itself in every single continent.You feed your ally provinces from your wars and laugh manically as you watch their kingdom crumble to 200 stacks of rebels.The game seriously plays down all the opression and ethnic cleansing that goes on. It makes it seem that all you're doing by hitting that convert button is changing a few percentage values, but deep down inside you know whats really going on. When you hit the harsh treatment button to lower your peasant revolt risk, you don't realize that your soldiers are storming into peasants homes and executing them just for having an opinion on how to better their lives.I mean, i didn't even notice that all of my african provinces were producing slaves until i got an event that abolished slavery. The only reason i even cared about that was because it made my monthly income go down...Don't even think about trying to be a tolerant, peace loving society. Either all the countries next to you will kill you, or the boredom will kill you, because there is literally nothing to do in this game besides wage war and find new ways to ♥♥♥♥ the common man in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.It really opened my eyes to how terrible white people are.Overall 10/10 best opression simulator. So good, it desensitizes you to make you think just like how a near omnipotent aristocrat in the age of discovery would. "

												Used to Love this game. But after coming back and downloading a couple more DLC's I cannot say I am liking the game anymore. It is one fail after the another. 1. Aggressive expansion-Burned several times. So even being extra careful and checking current Agg expansion with neighbors before I do another peace agreement, see that I should be ok, but no, everyone on the map goes ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Keep in mind the same thing does not happen to France or Austria.2. Austria is now freaking insane, the programmerfs do not want the player to blob the map, so they make the big country AI's blob and get away with it. This steals the fun out of the game. Look I do not play this game the way you demand I play it I guess. If you are going to hit players this hard, say so. Dont take our money then force to invest time into multiple failed games. 3. Cant block straits with your navy now. WTF not? Again you should tell returning players in one screen what you have changed since so and so patch in order to screw over the player.So insummary if you start small, and try to expand at a rate that will allow you to compete with Austria or France in say 200 years, the game bends you over and flushes 8 to 15 hours of game play down the toilet. You got alot of money out of me for this game, grats. Not another dime.			"

												After I had first downloaded and installed I spent 9 hours playing until I realised it was 1am in the morning.... This game covers the period  1444 to 1821. It's more accessable to get into compared to Eu2 and Eu3 that i've played bringing improvements to the UI and other gameplay additions. Not that there's anything wrong with those titles in the series far from it as i would particuly recomend Eu3 with all the expansions. I keep meaning to play Eu3 again for comparisons sake after getting this but I'm playing Eu4 too much so far to have the time to do that. Eu4 is far from being a shallow game either.One thing that might be an issue is the amount of dlc availiable for this game. In short you don't need any of it as there is plenty of content in the main game to be getting on with. This dlc comes in the form of expansions, flavour packs (music and events) and  various sprite packs. Of which only the various expansions are really worth your immediate attention. Art of War and Common Sense are the two most recomended ones to look at first. I only got those two as they were on sale when I got the base game but I could have easily have waited until the next sale. Paradox release a patch along side the release of an expansion that includes features that compliment and enhance the game alongsidee each released expansion. So the game has improved since it was first released. eg the way the spread on institutions  spread technology was released in the patch alngside the Rights of Man DLC.Important to note that in nultiplayer whoever hosts the game the players all have access to the hosts dlc in that particular game. So perhaps a way you can try what these dlc expansions are like before you may want to buy them for single player use? "

Simply put: the DLC does not offer enough content in each one to justify their price.

												Like many of Paradox's other games, Europa Universalis IV is a grand strategy game taking place in real history, in the real world. The game starts in 1444 and ends in 1821. You can play as any country in the world, including the Cherokee in North America, Brandenburg in Holy Roman Empire, the steppe horde of the Oirats, the Delhian Indians, the sub-saharran Songhayans, or even the native indonesians. As a European, you colonize and dominate the world, while as an Asian, African or Native American, you fight to resist the imperialism from taking your homeland. Game mechanics include colonization, diplomacy, exploration, westernization, reformation, technological advancement, and, of course, warfare. It is a bit simplistic and quite random, but the game is extraordinarily fun and every game is different from the last.			"

Masterpiece  Europa Universalis IV,Sometimes if you play at Ironman mod it makes you really angry but game is awesome.It has a really good gameplay.You can expand with only making marriages or you can expand with wars but you can't take a lot of provinces from enemy,if you take you will have really big aggressive expansion and Coalition will attack you. There is lots of mechanics on diplomacy,wars...The game is really fun.If you are thinking of buying this game or not,just buy it.And if you can buy DLC's too. "

												I wish I could still recommend this game-as it was one of my all-time favorites-but, unfortunately, this game's developers have systematically made this a less interesting, less dynamic, and altogether less fun over the course of several patches. There are many positive reviews here, and they were all earned-before the game's most recent patch. Instead of a dynamic empire-building game, you are left with a game that will, quite literally, severely punish every step taken in that direction. In addition, while Paradox is usually a first-class company regarding DLC practices, the most recent patch to this game renders is a hollow experience without buying the accompanying DLC, Common Sense-same basic practice seen with the Total War Series. While this is a first for Paradox, it is shameful and should be called out for what it is.If you do buy the game, make sure to play it on an older patch. The developer's determination to make the game, frankly, slow and dull is hard to understand, but should be avoided if you decide to purchase. You need only google a bit to see people's concerns about this becoming a glorified waiting game.Bottom line: Developers took this game in terrible direction, despite concerns among the community about doing so, and now we have that is less interesting (and buggy, for the moment) as a result. Do yourself a favor and buy Crusader Kings II instead. Unlike EU IV, the developers have only added to the player's options and that game's versatility, rather than turning it into the waiting game that EU IV has become. You will not regret buying CK 2, but there is every chance that you will find EU IV plain boring in it's current state. I hate to leave a review like this, as this game was just great, but the slow decline due to design philosophy to slow down expansion and every other aspect in the game, and the shameful DLC tactics on display with the Common Sense DLC, render this game unworthy of a positive review at the moment.

												Ok, admittedly I say this a lot when it comes to paradox interactive, but it really can't go unsaid this time around: WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ DID THEY JUST DO TO THIS GAME?? To explain that a little more clearly: I arrived at this game relatively late, so I cant say for sure, but EU4 seems to follow paradox's trademark pattern of starting off promising and ambitious, improving with a few early updates to work out some kinks, and then enduring a succession of hideously awful updates which, in huge and decisive steps, utterly mutilate what a few days ago was an awesome game. It was already suffering a mild case of paradox-update cancer when I got to it; filled to the brim with an overwhelming array of impenetrable, counterintuitive, and overly fiddly interfaces and easily misunderstood and incredibly important gameplay mechanics. This gave the game a bit of a learning cliff, but at least it was playable and everything worked. I was in the middle of my first competent game when the new update destroyed it. Playing as feudal Japan, I had successfully united all the islands of my country under one government, eliminating the squabbling daimyos with a mix of diplomacy and brute force. I made some rookie mistakes, overcame them, and finally got the hang of things and it was really cool. Then I decided to screw with history a little bit and focus on developing ""advanced"" technology, which I used to explore and colonize the new world, west coast first. Then the update happened, and the entire world got covered in fog of war, screwing up my trade income (nobody knew where anyone was, so who could I trade with?), forcing me to painstakingly restart the process of uncovering it all (an intentionally slow and obtrusive process), introduced some more new micro-mechanics which predictibly add absolutely nothing to the game, and then, every financial exense associated with maintaining my empire quadrupled overnight, making it completely impossible to avoid bankrupting at terminal velocity. Makes me wonder how the other countries are doing (not that I can check, because the update erased my world map). This is extremely not cool. I spent hours on that game and then the update took a big, steaming, dump on it.			"

												After nearly 2000h of gameplay, here's my review:EU IV is my first game in this genre and I just wanted to test it back in time, with not thinking that I ever spend so much time on and in this game.This game has a really great advantage:It never gets boring due to new (and awesome!) DLCs + a great Community.You need a little time to understand the whole game mechanics if you are new (like me) to this series. But it pays off, because for other game's you need much time like for the story. Here you make your own story. The mechanics are deep and get deeper with every (major) DLC.I'm sorry I can't compare it with other grand strategy video games, but I think it's safe to say that EU IV stands out from the crowd. The amount of possibilities which country you play, how you play it (defensive or aggressiv, both has disadvantages), the time period you play it and with 'El Dorado' the customization is fantastic and so much you can't even describe it with a few sentences.So in conclusion: Even for new and non-specialist this game should be an option. It has a great replay-value, a nice community and a growing 'supply' of DLCs.Edit:Hit the 3k hours and it's still good. The newest DLC's gets more customization and the replay-factor is going through the roof.			"

												Don't get me wrong by the ""Not recommended ""- the game is very good and fun- that's why I got over 1000 hours playing.Also the game devs are really... nice and caring... they give us a properly bugged update around each 3-5 months, that improves maybe 1 issue no one really cares about, constatntly avoiding big issues (*cough cough* forts system *cough cough*) and when the developers have a nice mood they  also add few working free features. And do you know what the best part is? A great DLC adding literally nothing but additions that make the update playable- for a crazy cheap prize of 15$.But that's not all- the developers work hard all night to add content packs of new textures- just for 5$ each!!And if it's a lucky day, we also get an E-Book about the DLC!!!Now srsrly- if you're going to buy this game look really well what the DLCs actually add before purchasing (look only at big expansions, the E-Books and content packs are crap the desperate devs try to sell)- do it at the game wiki site, since on Steam the devs write what the whole patch added. Go on untill the DLC you find really stupid already and stop. Play on the latest version you can (the patch that came together with the last DLC bought) and enjoy- don't try to catch up with all the DLCs unless you can actually pay a lot for gaming and don't care wasting 15$ on crap.The moment the devs will release normal DLCs or reduce the costs to ~5$ or less- I will change it to ""recommended"" again.

												With its two year anniversary nearly upon us, I felt I should write a review of what is perhaps my favorite game. With a setting that begins at the tail end of the 'Hundred Years War' and continuing on past the final defeat of Napoleon, Europa Universalis IV offers players the chance to take the helm of any country that existed in that 377 year period and bring honours and glory to your realm. You can play as a great land power such as Austria, Prussia, France, or Russia, or try your hand and carving out a vast colonial empire with the Spanish, Dutch, or British. You can begin in the far east, and attempt to fight the tide of European colonial adventures into your lands, or play as an American Indian tribe and unite your neighbouring tribes into a powerful confederacy to halt the Europeans in their march westward. I cannot stress this enough, EUIV is MASSIVE and will provide you with hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of enjoyable gameplay. You will experience the dawn of gunpower, the Dash and Glory of Musket and Horse, founding and expanding colonies in the furthest regions possible. You will gain provinces, and you will lose them, but it is always possible to come back from the darkest defeat and restore the glory rightly owed to your nation!EUIV has brought out several major DLC's that add major game play improvements and additional content that genuinely allow the game to grow into a fantastic piece of art. From interesting and challenging colonial mechanics to giving the player the opportunity to create a trade empire, and from improving the combat mechanics to making religion play the major role it did in the period, the EUIV team has consistently updated the game released in 2013 to keep it challenging and in line with what the people who play the game want it to be. Some people may balk at the DLC structure in use, however with each paid DLC released the developers provide a free content pack. I think the major DLC's worth purchasing, but should you not want to do so you can rest easy knowing that you will still get free updates. In short, put on your Tricorne, mount your horse, and prepare to fight for your God, your King, and your Country!			"

												I used to love this game, but with the addition of the newest DLC (common sense) I do no longer enjoy it. From what I've understood from various forums and blogs, there are a number of features that are now included in the vanilla game that you can't alter without the DLC, and those features happen to be incredibly important for improving your land. So either get the game including common sense, or don't get it at all.And this leads to the conclusion that the vanilla game is not something that I recommend, since it is ruined. And it used to be an incredible game.			"

												This game was really great for me 10/10. Although with this new Common Sense DLC it's more like a 3/10, if that. Want to build a highly developed nation without events? 15$ DLC, want to expand your nation and be technologically advanced? Pick one. The new coring costs and diplo annex costs are very high to the point you quickly fall behind in tech. There's more detailed reviews but in essence the new dlc and patch made the game even slower paced, and much more limited therefore i cannot recommend this game.			"

												This game. This game is the grandest of all the grand strategy games existing today. This review could easily be considered as a comparison between the two games Civilization V and Europa Universalis IV.tl;dr: This a great game, I recommend you buy it.To compare it to the game ""Civilization V"", Europa Universalis IV focuses on more complexity with expansion and conquest, as well as more resources to limit your aggression. The strategy in Europa Universalis IV is much deeper. The historical connection is stronger. The AI is better. Civ 5 however lets you play over a very long time period. It lets you take over the entire world and stomp on the AI. It is easier to learn and master so requires less patience and persistence.The DLC & PricesIn Europa Universalis IV, the DLC is not mandatory but is fun to play with. I don't recommend buying it unless you have money to throw around.Whereas in Civilization V, major DLC is mandatory for gameplay, and is considered an essential for any hardcore Civ player.To summarize this with math; discluding sales, Europa Universalis IV gives more content for its price and more gameplay as well.  $39.99 (Game)+$9.99 + $14.99 + $4.99 (Optional, Non-mandatory DLCs)=$70.00 Total Civilization V alone isn't much fun to play, and is also pricy however it has fairly pricy DLCs to add to the game.  $29.99 (Game)+$29.99 (BNW) +$19.99 (G&K) +$4.99x5 (Per other Civilization)=$80 Min. -- $100.00 TotalI also often see the two games on sale, so I recommend snagging them up for cheap. I got Europa Universalis IV for $14.99 and DLC for $19.99, only spending about 35 dollars.In summary, I like them both. EUIV as a historical grand strategy game and Civ 5 as a build, expand, and conquer arcade strategy game. Now many people will usually choose one and stick to one game. Those differences determine whether you prefer / favor either of the two games. But in my opinion, if you have the money, you're better off buying Europa Universalis IV.			"

												Let me start off by saying I love the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game. The amount of time me and other players have spent playing this game is a testament to how great it is, with many players that I have played multiplayer with currently sitting on 2-3k hours. In the beggining major patches were very spaced apart, but they were rich in fun and meaningful content, and so was all the DLC. However as Europa progressed Paradox has started releasing patches and DLC with a much higher frequency but a much lower quality. New major game mechanics are added in what feels like a monthly basis, which would be great if they weren't absolute garbage. I mean let's be honest, everyone hates the States/Territories system, the Sailor system is nearly arbitrary, the new intrigue system is alright but changing it had no real effect on the game, nobody knows what Revanchism is, and the list goes on an on. If they kept releasing amazing DLC like the Art of War I would bend over with my credit card in between my cheeks, but unfortunately thats not the case. At this point I think Paradox has given up on the game, and is flooding the market with DLC to make as much profit as possible. The patches clearly lack effort and desire to please those who still enjoy this game, and it makes me sad to leave a negative review on something thats kept me entertained for as long as this has. This is a negative review, because I hate what Europa has become, however it used to be a great game. I can only currently enjoy it by playing multiplayer, which makes some of the patches bearable because the competition is inherently fun, or by rolling back to an older version of the game.  If Grand Strategy is your cup of tea, then I would storngly suggest waiting untill this is on sale, then buying it alongside some of the major DLC, and rolling back to around patch 1.14 or so. But I cannot reccomend buying this game at full price, or playing on patch 1.17 .			"

												The most accessible Paradox grand-strategy game to date. That doesn't make any of the game mechanics any less complicated. Once you understand the game, like all good strategy game, EU4 will eat up any spare time you give it.You can play as any nation/culture in the world from the 1400's to the 1800's. The two main routes to endgame success is early&aggressive Colonialism (Portugal and maybe England) or Continental Europe land domination (Austria and maybe France).Succession feels watered down from the hilarious chaos of Crusader Kings 2. You still might be able to get a free nation if you are clever & lucky. The upside is the complex and detailed technology tree. The various nations also have their own micro buffs.Recommended you only buy EU4 and the major DLC (CoP & WoN) on sale.			"

												My original review (which i've now deleted) had this game down for what it was, back then- without doubt the greatest and most fun grand strategy game of all time.  However, that has all changed since and after the release of the inappropriately-named ""Common Sense"" DLC, which also involved one of the greatest frauds by a developer against gamers in business and PC history.  When a game takes out a core mechanic that you have already paid for when buying the game, then CHARGES you via DLC for using it's less-than-perfect replacement, then you've been done over.     - Effectively, everytime Paradox releases DLC, you are forced into buying it to make the game playable and balanced again. Province development is a great example of this. When simple patches are released as DLC, over and over again, that you need to shell out more and more money for (even though you've loyally bought all there overpriced wee texture and unit packs over the years), then you've been done over.    - The whole EU4 collection will now set you back an astonishing and completely indefensible £165. When working systems are replaced by half-baked and often totally illogical mechanics that make no sense at all, then you've been done over. A great example of my last point is the ""zone of control"" farce that forts now exert. Although a garrisoned fort/castle has never in human history stopped an army from simply ignoring it and walking round it to its destination, it could've been an interesting mechanic, had Paradox spent more than ten minutes implementing it. As it turns out, in EU4, since the Common Sense forced-DLC, a tiny fort 400 miles to the south can stop a full army moving 10 miles to the north, even if said fort is under seige by a second army. I've even seen an army having to loop round from the east Chinese coast, all the way to the Hungarian Steppes and back again, just to move one province (or about 50miles) north. It is the most appalling and ridiculous inclusion any game has ever had. Furthermore, just about EVERYTHING that\'s been added requires monarch points to some degree. This in itself wouldn't be a problem. But Paradox didn't actually increase the number of monarch points you generate each month to compensate for everything that now needs them. So you're left unable to do half the things you want/need to do.The game has also been made harder and harder as time has gone on, with player choice being nerfed with every DLC. This in turn leads to lots and lots of time where you are left doing nothing, just waiting, with the game speed turned up. Any change that reduces ""stuff to do"" in a game can only be bad. Enormously crippling Over-Extension mechanics, which have been ramped up with each passing patch, has put paid to any ideas you may have had of creating a sprawling Empire-style nation. You simply won't have the monarch points to do it. So the alternative is to create a One-province nation, which, believe me, is no fun at all, as you spend 90% of the game at the highest speed level, waiting for something interesting to happen.Don\'t get me wrong, i enjoy a challenge, but not one that gets artificially added with each passing patch and reduces my ""up-time"". The result of all this is that half the achievements are now completely beyond being achievable (unless you use a cheat engine or similar, which deats the purpose).But for me, by far the saddest thing about the horrible direction this once-great game has taken, is the effect it has had on public opinion about Paradox. Paradox were (once) a much-loved developer who enjoyed a lot of goodwill internationally from gamers. Now, they are close to being reviled world-wide by all of PCdom. Their bizarre decisions to change things that were working fine and locking off absolutely key mechanics behind more and more ridiculous paywalls has relegated them into the same leagues as EA and co. I just cannot take them seriously anymore, and this seems to be a stance i share with many, many others. It is a great shame then, that, being a proud owner of half a dozen different Paradox strategy games, EU4 will sadly be my last. I will not be taken for a mug anymore by a company who have lost their way in every way imaginable, and have managed to alienate themselves from the gaming world.If you want to play this game, then do so, but roll it back to the patch before Common Sense, and switch off auto-updating. That way, you can enjoy what it once was, and not the money-swindling and unbalanced monster it has sadly become.			"

												Overall 5/10I’ve been playing Europa Universalis since its early days, a long long time ago. It’s been a joyride for the most part, its peak with EUII. Now, the best bit about this history simulator (a much more suitable definition than 4X or simply strategy game) was the huge amount of historical events thrown at you through time. Historical characters, wars, religious events, economic, trade and administration advances. You could actually learn a lot about history of unknown and mostly forgotten countries. Most of that is now gone, substituted by an easier “mission” system that allows you to pick and choose what your country is going to be. Sure the game is still fun, but it has become a lot more generic, losing that “grounded in history” feel it used to have in earlier versions, while the game engine is pretty much still the same old one.So, is this a good game per se? Yes it is. Would I recommend it? No, as it is a huge step back from previous releases.PROS:-	The whole world is up for grabs, and there’s almost infinite replayability-	The UI is nice and easy-	The game has depth and width as most Paradox games doCONS-	35 DLCs and counting, seriously?? Considering most of the DLCs are utterly useless (most add songs (!!!) or tiny graphical improvements or ebooks (!!!!)). Some are meant to be meaningful (like Art of War, Wealth of Nations) but these cost 20USD a piece and add very little content.-	The updating policy is ridiculous and offensive: sure, patches are “free” but updating the game without getting the latest DLC (which you’d dearly pay for) the game becomes very unbalanced and clunky.-	Getting the game and all the DCL’s at full price costs more than 200 USD (two hundred) for a game that runs on a 15 years old engine. I got the game on a huge sale with several DLCs and still I regret spending about 25 USD for it.-	The historical flavour, with the tons of events that were there in previous versions is gone, making it another faceless 4X strategy game.

												I used to love this game but Paradox force too much to buy DLC.This game used to be played without DLC but now you will find that it's very hard to play especially when new tech system has came.Other tech group used to could westernize but now westernization is impossible if you don't improve one of your province to make it the center of new institution....improving a province is a paid feature of ""Common Sense"".

												I loved this game at release and unfortunately it's only gone downhill from there.Almost every time there is a new release you have to relearn how to be successful at the game. Ridiculous amount of overpriced DLC. Some of the features you enjoyed are now in DLC you have to buy to return your game to the way you used to play it.I got tired of having to continuously look for player made mods to fix whatever new ""feature"" was added by Paradox whether I wanted it or not.Basically, this game went from one of my all time favorite games that I was recommending to everyone I knew.....to a game I'll probably never play again and that I warn people away from.Game at start-10/10Game now-2/10 "

												I haven't put much time into the game so my opinion may be worthless, but I love this game either way. When I first bought it, I had gotten the EUIV Collection since I had thought the game was done pushing out DLC and had bundled everything in to a neat little box. I was horribly disappointed to learn a few months later that another DLC had came out, then another after that, and another, and another. It's more like I'm paying for an episode from a Telltale game instead of an actual full DLC.To quote a fellow player and reviewer-""...unless you want to spend hundreds of dollars and pay a monthly tax to unbrick the game when they lock another core feature behind the 347th overpriced DLC don't buy it.Paradox makes good games, and then they unmake them.""

												After playing with my friend online i realised how much i was missing with only the base game. Sadly getting all the DLC to give me a full game would cost me 200 euro...... and without it i'm missing such things as ""ask to support independance"" when playing as the minor part in a personal union. which makes playing as one very unrealistic and hard.*edit* after going trough all the dlc and removing all that are only cosmetic even the ones named in such a way that they were clearly made to be used with the DLC i was buying (still cost extra) it went down to ""only"" 100 euros....... OH I GUESS THAT'S ALRIGHT THEN*EXTRA edit* Just in case you think you can buy the 92 euro ""collection"" which you might guess includes all the important dlc, NOPE it only has 4 or 5 out of 14 gameplay changing DLC.

												This game series is the best strategy series ever made. I've played most turnbased strategy games (and a number of real-time), and used litterally months of gametime on the Civ-series alone. And months played time on Heroes of M&M etc. This is better!It's more complex, have far greater replay-value than any other strategy game I've com across, and the not-really-turnbased-not-really-real-time concept is perfect. Even most of the DLC's are good.Why NOT recommended then?1) It's fast becoming one of the worst DLC exploiting games. (2nd only to their own CKII wich is litteraly insane!)2) Every time there's a DLC, the game without the DLC also changes (mapchanges, interactionchanges etc.), and often makes it real hard to play decent without the DLC. So you either get a worse gaming-experience or have to pay up more.3) If you like to play for acheivement, save yourself hours of anger-management treatment and don't ever touch this game. Example: You try several times to get one of the hard acheivements, and then in 4th try its there. You start as a minor Irish county and manage to outsmart England and are close to conquering the British Isles. You've got 30 hours playtime on this campaign, and in just a few more the achievement is there. You save and go to bed. You start the game next morning and load it ready for the sweet victory. Only problem is there's an update. You begin to sweat, knowing this might be a horrible gaming-day. You get into the game, and see that the game isn't under saved games. In horror you click on ""load outdated savegames"", and load your game. It seems fine. Phew! The day is your! The time is now! You finish conquering the isles! BUT? Theres no ach-pop-up?!? You can't see anywhere that anything is wrong, but the minor bug-fixing-update that morning, changed your savefile enough that achs doesn't count from it.... When this happens for the 3rd time, and you write Paradox if theres anything to be done about it, you recieve something along the lines of you could either (*haha*) just start over, stop playing the game (since we allrdy got your money), or simply just go f... yourself...A year later the bitterness is a distant memory, and the thrill of those sweet moment when a really hard ach is achieved begs you back. You even buy one or two of the DLC's thats come in between. The first few easy-mode games go (too) well, and you go Iron-man-mode (the setting needed for achs) and get one of the new easy or medium achs. You start one of those ""play-for-weeks"" campaigns for a hard achievement, and when closing in on it: there's a minor bug-fixing-update. The horror. The bitterness. The promise of never to give Paradox a dime again... Untill a year later, when the bitterness is a distant memory.....This cicle has repeated itself untill im closing in on 1600 hours gameplay (and thats only on number 4 in the series).So if you're willing to pay for every DLC they come with, to the point where they might as well have subscribtion, and you don't care for achievements, or getting save-games ruined (also non-ach games) every few months, and want a game you can play again and again and again and forever, this is the game you want. If you havn't allrdy been tricked into giving one of the gaming companies that gives absolutely 0 f...s about their costumers money - save it (and your frustrations) for those deserving it :)			"

												EU4 is a great grand strategy game and has vastly improved since release. Paradox Interactive regularly adds new free content along with every dlc they make and the dlc adds some great features that are worth the price. EU4 is very fun once your into it but it takes quite a bit of learning to get into it and one of its faults is the tutorials lack of help when it comes to learning the game. If you are interested in this game and haven't played a Paradox Interactive grand strategy game I would highly reccomend watching some people play it on Youtube since it really helps you learn the game better. This game does a great job of allowing to conquer the world however you want with any country in the game. Yet world conquest isn't the only way to win as you can focus on a colonial trade power, unifying the Holy Roman Empire, or many different ways to play. Highly recommended game if you enjoy grand strategy games and if you have a remote interest go watch it on Youtube to find out more about it.			"

												EUROPA UNIVERSALIS IV - THE NEW BAR FOR GRAND STRATEGY GAMES.Fun, enganging, meaningful, accessible. These are words I use to describe Europa Universalis IV. Europa Universalis IV (EUIV for short) is the newst Paradox Grand Strategy game, and unsurprisingly, the fourth main game in the Europa Universalis series. In this game you control any nation from the earliest start date of  November 11th, 1444 to rhe latest starte date of January 1st, 1820. In addition there are plenty of historical scenario start dates for you to choose from.Europa Universalis IV is the easiest Paradox Grand Strategy game to get into. The graphics are wonderful. This is the first Paradox Strategy title I actually can play with the terrain map mode on because it looks so great. The models for units are done well, and the world comes alive as you see units moving across the map and the world go from winter to spring.  In addition, the artwork for the game looks great. From the dilemma pieces to the pictures of great leaders during the loading screens the artists did a fantastic job.The music is beautiful as well. From the intial loading screen the title song starts to play, and generally as the song comes to a lovely apex the map of Europe unfolds in front of your eyes in a wonderful fashion. It is a really breathtaking experience. The music is well done and makes you feel like you really are running a nation of the time period covered in game.As well, the mechanics are deep yet simple. For example, diplomacy has had an overhaul since EUIII. Now instead of having ""Diplomat Points"" you have diplomats who can only do one thing at a time. You could be improving relations with one nation, while brokering for peace with another, but those are your two diplomats and you can't delcare war on a third nation until one of the other diplomats is freed up. All of the people that can be used in game have changed to that system from the ""Person Point"" system of EUIII.Another overhaul the game has received are the Administrative, Military, and Diplomatic points. You get a set number of these each month based upon your rulers skills, your advisors, and the base amount your nation makes. These points are used to do a variety of actions, tech up, unlock new ideas, increase stability, deal with dilemmas, in addition to a variety of other actions.EUIV is an easy game to get into, and a hard one to stop playing. It is easy to sink hours into this title without ever looking back. I easily give EUIV a coveted 10/10 rating. I have really enjoyed my time so far with EUIV and can not wait to see what the future brings.			"

												Europa Universalis IV is undeniably very good. There are many historical events, the possibilities are immense and replayability. I take great pleasure to rewrite history.In EU4, you get to to control the destiny of a country and play with it in a sandbox. You want to play France and conquer Germany? You can! You want to play Poland and become a colonial power? Its gonna be hard, but you can. You want to be the Ottoman sultan and colonize the North America? Post a screenshot, that's gonna be awesome :)If you pay a little extra on the side, you get a CK2 to EUIV converter, allowing you to export your favourite kingdom from CK2 to EUIV and continue its legacy.

												After playing this patch + DLC for a while now I come to the conclusion that I sincerely dislike Common Sense on balance. A lot of issues have been mentioned, the most striking for me:- Fort system. What sounds like a good idea (reduce carpet sieging, make combat more tactically interesting) is actually doing the opposite: the restricted movement means your troops are basically sitting ducks until the enemy has gathered all troops and it is a big show-down. Multi-front allies are useless (Portugal + Aragon against Spain: Spain calmly superstacks Aragon while Portugal is stuck sieging a fort and can't come to help). The path finding is atrocious. What it SHOULD be like: Forts should reduce movement speed and units should suffer high attrition when they move beyond your supply lines (i.e. into ""prohibited"" territory that doesn't connect to controlled territory - or even a controlled fort of your own). As an aside, terrain defense bonusses should not apply to sieging forces because otherwise it makes no sense to put fortresses into mountains where they historically belong because you can't relieve them there. In sum I think Forts make wars more predictable and less tactically interesting. They could be a great addition but in their current incarnation they make wars dumber, not better.- Coring Cost, Diplo annex, province development...I read with amazement that some people insist that ""blobbing"" is still possible. I find that even modest expansion (by EU4 measures) kills any hope of technological advancement. This is neither fun nor is it historical. Monarch points now feel like a massive drag rather than a controllable resource. Province development is so expensive it makes the feature useless. I really don't see how a re-enactment of the British empire could be possible (High tech level, high development level, high expansion rate). I don't even want to think how much coring India would cost now.- Rebel Control.Rebels occupy land within a month, so you can't really avoid rebellion success (for ewxample 10 more years of nationalism) even if you have the troops nearby. - Troop maintenanceNot a new feature, but it should have been one. I would really like to mothball troops. It is ridiculous to have the entire Spanish army of 35.000 on high alert just because some Conquistador and his 2000 friends are exploring South America. Also, mercs should never have their maintenance reduced (minor point).Sadly, this is a big step down for one of my favourite games and the multitude of issues makes the chances for fixes look remote.

												I'm changing my review slightly to better fit with my thoughts, especially considering the most recent DLCs/patches in this.This game I really and truly feel was balanced specifically for people who like to break systems, or who enjoy a more balanced gameplay experience (I.E multiplayer). EUIII in comparison I felt, while rather easy (which was not a problem to me, but I do know people for whom it was) in its ease allowed for a lot of fun and ahistorical scenarios, EUIV's dedication to its idea of 'balance,' where every country has this strength and this weakness and every country is forced into these very historical highways that do not allow for fun deviations without missing out on a -massive- power advantage by strictly following history I just don't find fun.There are also problems like the military aspect, especially early game, being the realm of the larger powers. You essentially know whether you have won or lost a war before it even begins, as if you don't have a major power on your side, or you yourself aren't, you're screwed. Even if they don't start out the war with one on their side, the scales are tipped in the defenders favor in a conflict to an insane degree. You can ally up with people and call them into defensive wars mid war. You can have people intercede on your behalf for a white peace without even giving two ♥♥♥♥♥ about your country.All of this means that trying to turn someone like Poland or even a relatively decent power like Venice into a world hegemony is ridiculously difficult as your manpower issues and your forced historical focus keeps you, ironically enough, from doing some things that may have in fact happened historically that just don't fit the narrative of the country according to Paradox.If you want a strategy game thats a challenge with some decent window trimming of the time period I think EUIV will do you fine. If you want a game that properly dedicates itself to allowing you the freedom to make a country and mold it in this time period according to your weird kingly whims, EUIII is still the much better product IMO.

												As already said in a lot of quality reviews here, the economic model of the game is a joke. Did you bought the base game (40 €, not exactly cheap) or even better, the ""Extreme edition"" (4 DLCs for a mere 5 more euros (a great deal right ?)Then ♥♥♥♥ you.   The base game is barren and quite limited and you need those 20 € DLCs to stay relevant against the broken logic of the game rules and the ability of the AI to well, be a broken AI relying on too many cheap bonuses to offer any challenge and nothing else.   And still, this would be nothing if the devs were not actually taking out mechanics with each patch, ""enhance"" them and then release the updated gameplay feature behind a paywall. (The patches only implement very basic things and are obviously just there to prepare way for the next DLC. Speaking of them, the devs are most of the time ignoring their fanbase and tend to actually reduce the possibility of metagaming instead of actually fixing things up (i.e. Fixing an exploit used to circumvent a broken mechanic but not fixing said mechanic, letting you, the player forced to face an obviousy unfair mechanic)If this was 2014 I would fiercely recommend the game, but in-between, It went from awesome to baleful because of poor management, and of the devs ego and greedyness.Sad.

												This game has had so much potential but it has failed to become the great game I thought it should be. This is because of a few things. 1) Balance2) DLC3) Stupid leave game system4) Botched alliance and favour system5) CoalitionsFirst of all the balance, this game has the entire world for you to play as but most of time will be in europe. Why? Well faster gameplay stronger units on average as well as more and bigger events than anywhere else. This leads to the balance complaint. First of all if Castille decides to it can easily conquer most of Northern Africa then inherit Aragon and possible Naples very early game. Meaning they can quickly expand into Italy and lower parts of Africa. This then leads to the alliances complaint as it is entirely possible for Castille to have both Austria and France as allies meaning the main defence for Africa (Ottoman Empire) is not going to last very long especially with Poland and Lithuania glaring at them as well. A united India would struggle to push back a European power as well. The DLC in this game while it did come out very slowly and only the host needs it is a gauling ammount. Another complaint with this is the unbalancing that Common Sense originally brought with it which if not purchased allowed the AI to develop their provinces making them much better while you couldn't without the DLC. The alliance system in the Cossacks was a step in the right direction for curbing the use of powerful nations for rapid expansion but it does not seem to have an option for 'I am attacking your rival, please help me curb their power', which I have found it to be rather annoying. Some of the features do feel like they should have been in the base game anyway such as the ability to swap occupations which came with the art of war DLC.More of an annoyance than an actual complaint but the game shuts down briefly and reloads if you quit the game you were in. At least it is a step forward from the previous method of locking you out of multiplayer if you were going to go play with a friend. The alliance system as mentioned before does need some work still. This because you can have all the powerful nations in the same area all allied with each other which basically means game over. I have seen this with Scandanavia - France - Commonwealth which was proberly the most annoying, Russia - Ottomans - Austria - Papal State, this one was daft. Britain - Austria - Castille - Aragon, is a more recent one I have seen. I would say this makes it interesting but they will quickly become immortal and just keep expanding everywhere. The coalition system, now this is a huge pain. Largely because the AI never seem to get them. I have seen France take over huge portions of land in Germany in single wars and not have any back lash for it. Normally it is measured through development but since it is Germany the average values are quite high and can easily cause a coalition. I have taken 3 provinces and caused a world war to kick off over it.  "

												If the AI has an ally it will act in a super intelligent fashion. If you ally to the same country they suddenly become morons. I launched a war with Leinster and Burgundy as Allies while Desmond was Allied with Scotland. Scotland and Desmond fought as one giant stack while my allies were intentionally coded to leave provinces before cappingUsed to like the game company. Doubt I will buy any more from them. The Allies = You Lose code is really poor game design.			"

												Base gameThe best, most in-depth strategy game I have ever played, but due to changes in some patches and the actual price of the game I have to give a thumbs down for it.The base game is very limited if you do not have the DLC and want to play the latest patch. So the actual cost of the game is 134,93€ plus Mare Nostrum 14,99€ if you want it. However I would recommend to revert back to patch 1.15.1 with all the DLC up till Mare Nostrum installed. That was the most fun I have ever had with the game. It was more in-depth than ever before, there was finally meaningful content between the wars, estates are a nice addition, the development and building of provinces is great.A lot of people praise Paradox for their DLC policy, because of the ""extensive"" free content with all major DLC and the ability to roll back to previous patches. But for a game like this the ability to roll back to previous patches is mandatory as play troughs, at least for me, easily last for 50+ even I have never played through the entire timeline from 1444 to 1820. These long games would not be an issue, but most major patches brake previous saves and as I play on Ironman (1 save & 1 backup only) I would never be able to finish any campaigns if I would live a normal life outside of the game and I would play other games than this. Most major patches such as Common Sense and now Mare Nostrum introduce new major features or change existing core features in such a way that you either become handicapped if you want to play the current version without the DLC or also the AI is handicapped to make the game fair, but it feels like you are playing in the Paralympics while the normal Olympics would be constantly dangled in front of your face as a reminder to buy the DLC. In Common Sense this feature was the province development which locked the amount of buildings you could construct in each province. This meant that if you didn´t buy the DLC and wanted to survive any wars as a small nation the majority of your buildings were forts which crippled your economy.Even though I very much enjoy the game as it is in 1.15.1 I would not say that it is worth 134,93€ unless you have nowhere better to spend that kind of money. On sale the price might be reasonable or if you find the game somewhere else for less. Fanboys will give a thumbs down for any negative reviews, but I am just stating the negative sides of the game, because most reviews seem to only focus on parsing the game and the developers.Mare NostrumAs a Finn I find the cultural changes related to my culture group absolutely idiotic. Karelian is now part of the Russian culture group, Finnis are now Nordic, Estonian is part of the Baltic culture group and Finno-Ugric culture group is now just Ugric.This would be the same as making the whole Scandinavian culture group part of Germanic and renaming the mess to German.I cannot see any reason to make these terrible changes as the cultures were accurate before. I would like to know who was the idiot who came up with this idea and why it was allowed in the game.As a Finn I simply cannot recommend this patch as the cultural inaccuracy is appalling.Feelings right after Common Sense. I was not happy.The game is ♥♥♥♥ because of Common Sense.If you buy the game you should downgrade it to Art of War or Eldorado.  This used to be my favorite game but Common Sense broke the whole thing and sucked all the enjoyment out of it. It changed core gameplay features and made it so that you have a severe handicap if you do not own the DLC. Paradox why u do this to us?ConclusionBuy the game and all major DLC until Mare Nostrum on !SALE!, roll back to patch 1.15.1 and prepare for the best historical grand strategy game you have ever played.

												This game is fun for those who like to conquer, except in one minor area where the enemy AI will avoid your attacks at all cost when they know it will lose. While this can be overcome using crazy strategies, I oftened just cheated and owned the game's failed mechanic in this one crucial area.Aside from that, I was deeply satisfied in my hungry to conquer Europe, the Middle East and most of Africa. Being able to 'role play' as a certain country was intriguing and gave me new insights on the history behind the Holy Roman Empire, the Ottomans, and Italy. France be damned. ;)			"

												A crap ton of expensive DLC.People will tell you that you still get free updates, but all the updates really are are teasers showing you features you can't use until you buy the latest DLC. Every update also adds balance changes which revolve around you having the latest DLC, so you get punished for trying to play the latest version without the latest DLC.Another thing people will tell you is that you can just roll back to an earlier version, but that means you forfeit three years worth of bug fixes, meaning that you're stuck playing a broken game.That being said the game is still good, but if you can't get the expansions then just stick with EU3.Verdict: Don't buy this unless you have an additional 300 bucks to blow on it, unless you can aquire the DLC by some 'other means', in which case this is a great game.

												EU4 has turned out to be the best strategy game I have ever played.  Just a warning, the learning curve is massive.  If you think Sim City or Civilization is difficult to learn, you should not play EU4.  The game is not much in the way of graphical showcasing, but it makes up for that with the thousands of real-time modifiers happening in the world.  Strategy really matters in this game and there is a very active forum & wiki community to help figure out what you might not notice (did i metion thousands of modifiers?).  The developers are also active in the community and have been releasing DLCs and patches to evolve the game as the player base becomes more 'intellegent'.  The Multiplayer community can be hit or miss, since it takes a lot of dedication and time to get a game to the finish of 1821. The game is inifinitely more fun in multiplayer since the AI is predictable after a while.			"

												GREAT GAME but do NOT buy it YET.Wait for developers stop messing with updates. Then buy the game in pack with all working DLCs. And it still should work on Linux. (I plan to change my vote then.)I decided to write this warning after todays update that broke access to existing savegames and disabled some DLCs. True story - check forums. I am not angry as I lost only 25 hrs of playing and I have just few DLCs. But I feel pity for people who lost hundreds of hours and spent a lot of money on the game.BTW: suggested downgrade to old version seems not to be a perfect solution. My downgraded game just crashes.Before you astroturfers decide blowing some s2t on me be aware that I am fan of Paradox games since the very first EU.			"

												It is with pain in my heart I hit the ""do not recommend"" button. I absolutely love this game, but the most recent update broke it. The default base game is no longer playable. The new technology system introduced in 1.18 practically depends on having the Common Sense DLC. Without it, you can wait hundreds of years to get the institutions spreading to your location if you happen to be outside of Europe. DLCs used to be cool addons that were really nice to have, but you didnt _need_ them to have a functional game. But with the advent of Common Sense, ever more ""essential"" features are in the DLC, and now with 1.18 the base game is just unplayable without it. I understand that Paradox needs to earn money somehow, and the development poored into this game is definitely laudable. But to advertize the game as something that can be played by itself? That's just pure deception at this point. New players will have to shelf out €100+ to get it to a workable state.  "

 Extremely addicting, extremely fun, but with a hefty price. While not on sale the game and all of the core DLC will currently run you 154.91 USD and much, much more if you decide to pick up all of the additional content packs. That being said, I’m going to give you my opinion of the DLC system they’ve chosen for this game.  If you want an opinion on just the game, you will not find that here, go read someone elses review for that, however, this is still an important read as the game is worthless without the DLC. New Content:  The game has grown significantly since it’s release, the game is much, much better and more complex than it was then.  This is part of the reason that the game has been kept so alive as well, if you’re finally getting bored of the game, they drop new features on you and you feel like you’re playing through a whole new experience.  Yet, there is a con to this, and that is when you're going for achievements, there's many that because of the changes to the game are much more difficult to unlock than they were before. Free Content:  Every DLC, free content in a patch is dropped alongside it.  This one SHOULD be an argument for the DLC rather than against, but sadly it cannot be.  While you are locked out of DLC features, the AI in your game is not, adding a disadvantage and annoyance to the game.  On top of that, sometimes features are essentailly replaced with a new paid feature, meaing sometimes you are essentially locked out of the ability to do things that you could before. Content Packs:  This part is pretty BS, so when they drop a DLC instead of dropping the content packs as part of the DLC, they charge you separately at a pretty large price, now this isn’t as bull as the Total War franchise as this does not lock you out of playing as any countries and this stuff is a hundred percent aesthetic.  Also, you can download mods to do the same exact thing as the content packs, replacing the look of troops, portraits or adding new music. DLC In Multiplayer:  This feature is great, when you are in a multiplayer game only the host has to own the DLC and then everyone playing in that lobby has access to it.  This means that if you have any friends with all the DLC and plan to play with them, you only need to purchase the base game and that’s it. Still Getting A Bang For Your Buck:  As you’ll see looking through these reviews, lots of people have hundreds or thousands of hours in the game, so even after spending 154.91 USD you still come out positive in a dollar per hour system. Constantly On Sale:  The base game and dlc all go on sale very often, so I’d recommend picking them up then, you can easily cut that 154.91 USD into about 50 USD, however, this still does not excuse the game, as when a new DLC drops you have to wait months if you want to pick it up at a discounted price.I highly recommend this game, especially if you have friends who are into it.  The DLC model is BS, but not enough for me to NOT recommend this game, it does not ruin the game like Total War’s DLC does.			"

												I have sunk far too many hours into this game for this to be a negative review. That's not to say there are no negatives to this game.First I'd like to state that this game is developed by one of my more favorite game studios: Paradox Development. Paradox makes games such as Crusader Kings 2, Victoria 2, and Hearts of Iron 3 (and soon 4). If you've heard of any of those games and enjoyed them, then I'd strongly recommend looking into this game.The game is an Empire Builder simulation/strategy game. You take on the role of one of the numerous nations that existed in the year 1444 all the way to the napoleon era of 1821, and lead them to glorious world conquest.You are not limited to the boundaries of history, because one you hit start the game starts diverting from history. You can play as England who starts in a war against France in the later stages of the Hundred Years War. Defy history and win it, usurping the French throne and merging England and France into one massive European super power. Unify the Holy Roman Empire into one single entity; no longer burdened by the decentralized german states and stand strong against any potential French emperor. Play as the Byzantines, last of the Roman Empire; stand strong against the Turkish aggressors and see them fall to your tactical genius.That's not to say you are limited to Europe. Nay, the WHOLE WORLD is yours to conquer. From the Aztects in the Americas in the west; to the Chinese and Japanese empires in the east and everything inbetween (Starting from west americas going east in case you thought you were clever and started in the americas and went west directly to Japan).As your nation develops you unlock technologies and ideas which increase your potential in both War and Peace. You discover new forms of governing, such as Absolute Monarchy, to a Constitutional Democracy.The game features a fairly decent trade system, where as goods are produced and streamed down several important trade nodes such as Alexandria and Ragusa to ""End Nodes"" where trade can no longer be pushed down to another node, such as Venice, or Seville. While I much more prefered the Centers of Trade that Europa Universalis 3 had, this will have to suffice.As your game progresses you will get events that will add that more dynamic gameplay so that each playthrough won't be the same. But beware the sky, for when comets fly, the peasants cry, and as much as you try, your stability will die. *cough cough* Anything can happen. You can be in the middle of a bad war, and suddenly the people rally for the war, supplying more manpower and reducing the war exhaust your nation is suffering. Now your newely invigorated nation is ready to reclaim the war. Or you can be suffering a bad economy and a random noble dies, heirless his wealth is inherited by your crown which you can use to pay for improvements that will help you out of this economic pit.In case you are wondering, religion also plays an important role in this game. The Evangelical movement does happen, and you will have to content with heretics and heathens. Religions include the Christian branches such as Catholicism, Protestantism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and the Reformed Church (aka Calvinism). The Islamic branches of Sunni, Shia, and Ibadi. Indian Hinduism, Chinese Confucianism, Japanese Shintoism, and Tibetan Buddhism. I'm sure I missed a few.The Papacy is alive and waiting for your influence.My most favorite parts of this game are the religions and cultures. I love taking the underdog and expanding it to greatness. Did you ever thing Albania would rule the Mediterranean? Or just how far west the Eastern Orthodoxy could spread? That aside, I love some of their diplomatic features, such as Personal Unions in Europe. Essentially one nation's ruler comes in to rule another nation as well, effectivally ruling two nations, or the newely implemented Military Marches (a kind of vassal). There is so much depth to this game and I would highly recommend it.If that wasn't enough, try playing with friends in Multi-player, start a friendly rivalry, or perhaps you want to work together to split the world down the middle.Still not enough? How about the vast amount of mods that are availible because of the active community behind this game. Some overhaul the game to a completely new era, such as back in Alexander the Great's time, or the founding of Rome, or all the way to the present. Some just expand on the base game, adding features only a mod could get away with.If that's not enough, then I have to say the Paradox is among the few Professional Game Developers that actually listen to their consumers. They aren't burdened by companies such as Activision or EA which means that more care is given to it. They are constantly adding new features for free and as DLC.Just as a warning, if you are freaking out about all the DLC. ALL OF THEM are completely OPTIONAL. Pick and choose what you want. There's no reason to buy DLC for areas of the game you don't play in as often. Buy them over time, all at once, or not at all; it's not mandatory. Though if there was one DLC I'd recommend, it would definitely be Art of War.Cheers!			"

												With 300+ hours logged into this game and still wanting more I am here to promote this game. If you are at all a RTS fan this NEEDS to be in your arsenal. Ever wanted a game with true Diplomatic options? Backstabbing politics? Historical Accuracy/Relevence? DLC that even if you don't buy changes the base game enough to make you want to play again and again? GET THIS GAME!!!10/10.			"

												I know this game has plenty of fans.  It has incredibly complicated diplomatic and military dynamics that undoubtedly give an intesnely realistic experience to what is fundamentally a war game (think risk on steroids).  If you're willing to invest many, many hours of complete and utter failure in an attempt to learn the intricacies of the game, you'll surely enjoy it.  Unlike every other strategy game I've played there is truly no ""learning"" mode.  There's no option to dial down the difficulty level while you figure out game play.  It's trial by fire, and I hate to admit I spent so many hours on this more out of determination to figure out how not to get crushed than any sense of fun.			"

												It's difficult to say whether I'd recommend EUIV as it is now or not- especially since I see more of its faults than its good points. Fortunately, as with a lot of Paradox titles, recent updates have been increasingly making the game better than what it originally was. While some changes have been poorly received and needed adjustment later (Paradox's newfound popularity has also come with a much larger number of people only familiar with EUIV and CK2 giving feedback upon yonder forums.) Paradox seems to have found a direction that properly takes (good) player feedback into account, without relying upon it too heavily.It's not quite the game I wanted it to be, with some mechanics changes simplifying the game in a negative way (restoring stability with the push of a button when you have sufficient points is far too simple.) and other EUIII mechanics remaining that are only hurting the current state of the game. (Missions are terribly outdated things which can hardly be said to function in the current state of the game.)Despite all this, it's still a very fun, easy to play game. Perhaps with some more updates (and a few mods...) I'll be able to say EUIV is a masterpiece of a grand strategy game.			"

												Europa Universalis, whether III or now IV, is my favorite game by a longshot. It's a lot to get into, as it is dauntingly complex, but it is worth it and there are a lot of Let's Plays on YouTube that are great entertainment. One thing, though, which I will admit to people looking to buying it--the Wealth of Nations expansion isn't that spectacular. Honestly, I don't think I've taken advantage of any of its features. But I'm sure there are people who have.			"

												One of the best strategies along with Civilization and Total War series. Has very steep learning curve as opposed to traditional strategies, and requires some time to learn the game mechanics.

												If you purchase this game, keep in mind that you will need to spend tons of cash for DLC's.  This is unreasonable and its gouging their customer base.  My hope is that another company comes along with decent and fair DLC policies that will force Paradox to change their greedy ways.  Making a profit is completely valid, but gouging customers with stupid DLC policies is just wrong.Over 30 bucks for an expansion if you want the complete experience... Music, sprites, etc.  Not cool.			"

												My experience with the Europa Universalis franchise:I started playing Europa Universalis since the 1st version (dam im old -_-') when a friend lend me his copy way before this was on steam (heck, i didnt even know steam back then). The game was basic, but the idea was mindblowing at the time. So when EU2 came out, after i had like 1000h of EU1, i bought the game. There where no major changes, just a tweek here and there on the game mechanics and its AI, but the rendering was still the same. Anyway +3000h coloniziing the ♥♥♥♥ out the new world as Portugal (and yes, in the first 2 versions i kinda only played Portugal, well, cuz im portuguese and i just love our history, and guess what, i now study history at the university). Anyway, back in 2007 i read online (on my pc, no smarphones back then) that EU3 was coming out soon, and that looked freaking awsome, for the the 1st time a 3D rendering and huge improvement to the AI, so i was counting the minutes and bought my copy the day it was released in FNAC at the Colombo shopping centre in Lisbon. Oh boy did i waste my life on this game. It wasnt yet needed to have a steam account to play it. Just when i thought it couldnt get any better, EU4 came out. I bought it again, and on CD (but yes i already had steam cuz i played a lot of Football manager, hence i created an account). Anyway, i play mostly offline so im pretty much sure i got over 4000h of this game, but meh, whos counting. I confess that was only in late 2013 that i found out this had an huge multiplayer community (holy ♥♥♥♥ yeah i was living under a rock). So i divide my time now between multiplayer and single player sessions. I love both. A quick overview of the game:In sum, EU4 is a game where you get the world map begining in 1444 spwaning till 1821 (i.e. kinda since the fall of Constantinople till the Liberal turmoil in Europe.) You got all countries that existed in 1444 and each countries with they historical provinces. The countries's borders change depending on the date you choose to start playing and new countries may or not appear on such date in time depending if it did exist or not, and are all historically correct. Then just pick a country and start managing all matters of state, economy, territorial, diplomacy, army, navy, etc. The game mechanic may seem difficult at start but trust me it will grow easy on you. The AI on this game is awsome idc what the haters say, single player at hard level will challange you a lot. The multiplayer mode its all fun specially if you in a lobby with 60 players i.e. 60 countries. If you want to play Portugal, Castille or England and colonize the world and go to Africa, India and Indonesia and build a massive trade empire, do it. If you want to play Austria and form the HRE, do it. If you want France and blob everyone, do it. If you want to play Brandenburg and form Prussia, do it. Theres arround 200 countries, and you can play them all. The sky is the limit with Europa Universalis 4.Warning:Dont play this game without all the DLCs. The game grew like 100000% since its vanilla. Ill keep paying gladly for the DLCs, cuz i prefer to have an active game being developed then having a new game being released every 2 years with little improvement.9.5/10			"

												You are the King/Queen/Parician/Doge/Empoerer/Empress/Chief/Sultan of any nation that existed as a soveign state inbetween the years of 1444-1821. Be it the Ottoman Empire, or the start of the Austrian Empire, the world is in your hands the moment you start off. There are no limits to potential ambitions and goals, and achievements give you some good starting(and also very hard) goals for you to try out in your spare time. Restore the Roman Empire from the remnants of the once great Byzantines, barely holding onto Constantinople itself. Restore Danish Hegemony over the Baltic by defeating Sweden. Create an Albanian empire in the Balkans. Form an Iroquious Confederacy controlling all of Eastern North America. Unite Japan and take the pacific as your birthright.There are no limits to the possabilities this game brings to the table if you like history, or just strategy gameplay in general. Managing a global empire is no easy task, however. Colonies will want freedom, trade companies will exploit the native population, and soon... Perhaps even a revolution from the inside of your own capital?Pros:- Massive replayability with hundreds of potential nations.- Most of earth at your grasp.- Many potential routes to take, from conquest to diplomacy to trade.- Theres a gothic nation in the Crimea, CONQUER THE WORLD AS THE LAST GOTHIC PEOPLE!- Actually good multiplayer support.- EXTREAMLY GOOD MODDING COMMUNITY!Cons:- Steep heftly learning curve that can take hours, sometimes day to get through.- No one wants to hear about you conquering Russia as the goths.- Sweden is not overpowered.

												Well, where to begin... It's a rather complicated task to explain what this game is to somebody, who never touched any other Paradox Grand Strategy game. It's probably better to begin with most popular tags:- Grand Strategy : Grand - for there's whole world to play with ( both explored and uncolonized ) - several hundreds of provinces with their cultures, taxes, production, trade power, etc. Strategy - well, because it is one. It's Real Time Strategy, pausable by hitting space or by tinkering ""smart pause"" options - game will automatically pause when specified by you or default ""trigger"" events fire (like another country declaring war on you, etc).- Historic : Game covers time period from 1444 to 1821, possibility to start playing any day between. Default ""timemarks"", offered to player are rather historically accurate, with actual leaders in charge of their nations, pre-existing alliances and other diplomatic relations, etc. Amount of research done by Paradox is impressive. But once you start your game and unpause it, weirdest stuff can happen, like AI-controlled Poland taking over Europe, lol.- Simulation : Game engine takes into consideration MASSIVE amount of data and processes it simultaneously ( diplomacy, economics, religion, stability, rebels, trade, research, national ideas, terrain, army commander skill, etc,etc ). What is pleasantly surprising, and frankly - shocking - is how despite having so much information to work with, player is saved from micromanagement by smart UI design ( which only is getting better with updates ). You don't have to babysit every province or army (unless there is serious battle nearing, in which case it's only natural to pay more attention to your soldiers, lol), observe multiple tradenodes or dig into complicated UI for some basic info. Everything you need can be accessed by 1-2 LMB clicks, and UI itself can be easily configured to suit your needs. Gameplay is actually relaxing, once you understand basic concepts.- Sandbox : Because nothing restrict your moves and imagination by handicapping you. You just start a new game, pick a nation ( btw, you can pick ANY nation on map - from giants like France to smallest african tribes) and voila - you are completely free in your actions. IMO best example for this would be playing as Irish lord : you can go ""classic"" way of forming Kingdom of Ireland first, Great Britain - later, or pull off crazy stunts like rushing exploration national ideas, exploring and colonizing Americas way before other European nations and moving your capital there.There is some kind of ""missions"" which you can go after - but nothing MAKES you complete them. They are mostly aimed at ""historically accurate"" playthroughs for those new to that nation\EU4 and are there to hold hands of newbs who are usually shocked by lack of any kind of ""corridor"" they are used to.For those who want to compare EU4 to other games: - Crusader Kings 2 : EU4 is overall more complicated, mostly centered on country simulation instead of that semi-RPG gameplay of CK2. Leaders here are placeholders with 3 basic stats, and you don't get attached to them like you do in CK2 (I still remember my afro-Tzar Putiata of Russia from my 2013 playthrough, lol)- Total War series : It's RTS, less graphooney and combat is calculated in the background, and player has no way to influence the outcome, other than deciding initial army composition, hiring high-skill commander, choosing battles wisely and rushing additional armies into provinces, where battle occurs.It may seem dumb at first, but there are a LOT of charming underwater stones that you HAVE to consider : different optimal army composition that depends on tech group of your nation, your current military technology level, etc; picking right terrain to fight on - countless options.All in all:PROS- Everything stated in ""tags"" part- Huge replayability- Huge amount of content to discover and learn.- Fair DLC policy : they are well worth the money, big part of them gets patched into game for free for everyone else, multiplayer game host can be the only one with all DLCs - game counts everyone who connected as if they had same DLCs as host has.- Almost bugless (unless new DLCs\patches are introduced - even those are fixed pretty quick)- ModsCONS- Tutorial is... lacking. But paradox strategies are well know for that, so it might turn into a feature one day, lol. Seriously, read the wiki or watch letsplays. Learning curve is steep.- It's sometimes hard to establish a good multiplayer game with pub strangers - most are leaving pretty quickly.P.S If you need any guidance on this game - feel free to add me and ask questionsUPDATE 25.11.16Still a solid thumb's up - every DLC they introduced added something significant and fun to play with. This game is as lively as it was on release, and aged really well into fall 2016.			"

												This game will take hours off of your life (in the best way possible).Europa Universalis IV [EU4] is a grand strategy RTS from Paradox Interactive. The game is set on the earth anywhere within 1444-1825, focusing heavily on colonization, imperialism and the influence of the papacy and the Holy Roman Empire on the rest of the known world at the time.I don't think I've ever fallen so completely in love with a game since I discovered the Metroid series. One of the things that bug me about RTS games is that usually, during the late game, there isn't much to do since your economy is self-sustaining and the most attention-consuming task is managing military units. EU4 goes so much more in depth than any other game I've played before (to be fair, it is my first grand strategy game, so I don't know how it compares to its peers).I like to always have my mind focused on something and can get bored quite easily at times. While there are slow times like in any other game, EU4 has so many little tasks and situations that need occasional checking up, as well as random events every so often, that your mind is almost always engaged.The learning curve is quite steep for this game, in my own experience (around 20-30 hours to grasp many of the subtle yet critical elements). I recommend starting as the Aztecs for your first game - no one in Central America can build ships for quite a while, so you will be able to focus on understanding how the basics of land combat work. You will be defeated multiple times your first few playthroughs. Don't give up - this is quite normal. Also, turn player bonuses on in the menu for your first few learning games.I won't go into detail on the elements of the game since there are SO MANY - this review would probably take about 20-30 min to read if I did and nobody likes that :/ If you need help learning the game, the in-game tutorial didn't do much for me. I hear there are superb video tutorials on YouTube, so check those out if you so desire. As for DLC, there are currently five official expansions and numerous music/cosmetic enhancements. I have purchased a few of the music/cosmetics and cannot complain, but I have not purchased any of the expansions and so cannot comment on their value.I have used the Extended Timeline mod extensively and completely recommend that you try it, but play some vanilla games first since it is essentially a complete overhaul. I have lost much time to this game. Whether or not that is good is for you to decide. I wholeheartedly recommend this masterpiece to anyone who claims to enjoy strategy gaming. + FIVE THUMBS UP +			"

												   Quite possibly my favorite strategy game of all time. You pick a nation from any time between the 15th century to the 19th and play as them, making allies, fighting wars, discovering the Americas, whatever you choose. Although it sacrifices some of the complexity of it's older sibling, Crusader Kings II, it manages to improve gameplay all across the board, at the heart of which is the flexible negotiations, where you can not only choose what to win or lose when settling a peace depending on who has been winning the war, but you can also negotiate separate truces with any secondary members of the war, letting them go easy to weaken your main enemy or crushing them one by one and making them rue the day they ever dared challenge you. And the best part? There is a free demo.			"

												As far as Grand Strategy style games, this is one of the best out there. A lot of micromanagement for those who enjoy it, and a good deal of features and fun game play. I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't like to have the ability to actually control battles that occur like in Total War, but this is far more detailed when it comes to governing and economics. If you are someone who likes sliders, micromanagement and, of course, world-domination, then this is the game for you!			"

												Before you read this review you should know that it is written by a ""seasoned"" player, and that the changes I mention here as bad, wont be noticeable by new players. Also this is more of a review of patch  1.13.0.0 I loved this game. I really did.Because once upon a time I could have fun conquering the world, making huge trade-based empires.No more.Now all I get is patch (as if it fixes ♥♥♥♥) 1.13.0.0, which just ruins the game and everything it used to be.The patch adds:  Forts! And their ""zone of control"". First of all the AI doesnt give a flying ♥♥♥♥ about your forts, just wading right through them, when you, as a player, have to traverse half of ♥♥♥♥ing Europe to get to the province next door. ( Zone of control is also broken by military access. Which is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid !!!)  Development! Taking out the building system of old, and replacing it with broken ♥♥♥ development system, that you can't ♥♥♥♥ing use unless you buy the ridiculously overpriced DLC, ironically named Common Sense...  Manpower revamped! Now your pretty little manpower pool will deplete even faster! This is actually okay and maybe even balancing, but not when you lose 10.000 manpower sieging one ♥♥♥♥ing fort, to simply realise that the army you've now been persuing for 2 ♥♥♥♥ing years is not reachable. Not after this fort even.  Because the AI just built another adjacent fort while you were sieging the original one.	   Forcing you to siege this one too. ARE YOU KIDDING ME PARADOX  So much overpriced DLC essentially ruining what use to be your perfect game.EUIV has for me, become more of a rage quit simulator than a grand strategy game. I hope that I'll be able to play it consistently in the future, without getting ♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ed by cheating AI.I would rate this patch  1/10. Sorry for long post but no ♥♥♥♥ing potato here. "

												While this game is a great whole world grand stratgery game,  its biggest flaw is Paradox. I won't repeat  comments  other reviewers have made about the game as they are fair. However, new buyers beware this game focuses on DLC after DLC and the prices are absurd. When Paradox learns to create a game with:1. The content already in it rather than as tacted on DLC2.

												This game used to be good. Since release, Paradox have unleashed a torrent of DLC's and by this point I'd say you're missing out on a good chunk of the game if you haven't paid for most of them. The online system was great and a massive improvement over EUIII but then they cocked it up and instead of fixing it, you now have to restart your game like the old days whenever you exit to menu from a session. About the worst thing they've done is simply sapping the fun out of the experience. With every patch the developers basically throw out a big middle finger to the community and make the game more tedious to play. Blobbing is fun. Gamey mechanics are fun. Whacky situations are fun. Paradox doesn't seem to understand this because every update makes this game more tedious and streamlined than it already was.TL;DR - Paradox is doing their level best to make EUIV feel less and less like a video game despite the fact that is exactly what it is.

I was always a big fan of Total War games, dont get me wrong, i still am, but after playing Paradox Games, Total war series are in Big picture Easy games!! Europa Universalis 4 is a complex game, you have to manage evrything, but if you dont want to do that, there is an option not to do so. You have endless possibilities in this game, you can decide to go colonize, form Italy, Germany, whatever... You dont like war? Start a Trading Nation and make economic warfare, ...Its hard to explain how the game works, and the first time you play this game you want to shut it down because it looks all very complicated...

DLC should add new and separate content to a game, not put in things that should've been in the full game. I am able to enjoy without the numurous expansions and dlc, but it isn't an experience worth 40$, unless you really, REALLY love strategy games, in which you will probably buy all 200$ of dlc anyways.

												Today I loaded up one of my old favorite games, Europa Universalis, I played for a while, realizing I can no longer build an actual empire, I am forced to crawl like a ♥♥♥♥ing snail while a single developed province (120 for undeveloped) costs 250 admin points (with dlc of course its required). I read online about it and the head AI developer Wiz said this, ""To expound on my reply from yesterday, coring costs have gone up somewhere around 40% compared to 1.11 (more for dipannexation) because we wanted to create some more interesting dynamics where conquering everything around you was not necessarily always the best option.""I don't know what planet you come from ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but this is a WORLD CONQUERING game, nobody plays this game for it's rich backstory or to have fun ruling a little baby nation, the entire point of the ♥♥♥♥ing game is to conquer.""It is still both possible and rewarding to expand, particularly if you take the right ideas, put money into advisors and use a mix of conquest and diploannexing. As Milan, I was able to unify most of Italy (more than twice starting development of France) in under a century without any core cost reduction, and could easily have done so faster. Growth is slower but it's certainly not 'blobbing now pointless'.""That's funny because Milan just so happens to get these ideas.+10% Infantry combat ability+1 Diplomatic relations−10% Idea cost−10% Development cost−25% Mercenary maintenance−5% Technology cost−10% Stability cost modifier+20% National manpower modifierThat's right folks, if you want to conquer you have to select nations that give you reduced technology cost, better soldiers, AND administrative ideas.It really pisses me off that they keep ruining what was once a perfect game, the game in it's current form is garbage and if you want to play it, do yourself a favor and roll back a few patches.OLD REVIEW Shameless moneywhoring is now a common thing in today's video game industry.And just because I previously PU'd Paradox does not make them unsusceptible to retribution for their crimes.Common Sense It's an omen! -1 stability.

												Without a doubt the best game I've ever played. I didn't know how good gaming could be until I bought EU4. On a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the absolute highest I'd rank this game at least a 15. Yes. It's that good.It has by far the steepest learning curve of any video game I've ever played, or any cognitive task I've ever done for that matter. I've played about 730 hours and I'm still learning new things about the game each time I play. So I'd recommend downloading the free Demo first to make sure you like it. The first 150 - 200 hours were a stressful process of learning the most basic game mechanics. From 200 - 650 hours I knew my way around the game enough to earn achievements if everything went well. After 650 hours I feel like I really started to know my way around the game.			"

												One of the leaders of Grand Strategy Games genre. You must guide your nation of choice to world dominance through conquest, diplomacy and colonization. Controls are pleasantly abstracted - for example, when you dicover a new kind of military unit, you can upgrade all your armies with 1 click. There's little to none micro managment, you can devise your sophisticated plot and relax in your chair as you can setup a full scale invasion with just a few clicks. Game is visually appealing, though, in my opinion, EU would look better with 2D graphics (instead of full 3d).There's only one thing that i really dislike about this game - the combat resolution. It has very sophisticated algorithm with dozens of parameters. It's very vague and as a player you have absolutely no idea what the hell is happening unless you invest an ~hour of researching on the internets.All in all EU4 is one of the top games in its genre. It's equally good for people who love Grand Strategies and as an entry point for people who are curious about the genre and want to try it. 9/10 would buy to rule the world.			"

												This is a great game, but if you want to have the best experience, have all the latest patches, actual improvements to the game, you need all these expansions...Come on Paradox, everyone needs money to survive, right? We don't wanna pay worthless DLC's just to make the game play a little better. The base game? I got tired of it after 250+ hours on this game. Every Paradox game gets boring eventually.The base game is just getting worse and worse. I think an Expansion means expanding a game, not just that, but improving the game with patches just to make the base game worse for those who cannot afford all expansions. (They all cost more than the game itself!)Not to mention that ALL the DLC's cost 250 euro. Frightening. Absolutely.Not to mention yet again that most of these mechanics from the expansions must be also implemented in the base game,  also obviously the patches. i.e, the estate mechanism. Paywalls just to catch on with the game is a joke. Enjoy beating up France as Ulm.			"

Europa Universalis IV provides hours of fun , but of course, if you do not like the genre or attempt to purchase it. One of the only problems is that you can enjuar easy one due to repetition .

												Taking what Europa Universalis III did right and making it better, EUIV has become an intense struggle to build a vast empire in any area across Earth. Want to construct a grand African nation to fight off potenital European colonizers? How about founding a vast Venetian trade empire, capable of supplying arms to rebels of your enemies? Want to restore the Roman Empire to its former glory and repair the schism of the church? Perhaps you're interesting in colonizing and exploiting the Americas as much as possible? Maybe there's a chance of China forming a large army and marching on their enemies in India and Europe?Then do it.That's how intricate and complex (or simple, if you like it that way) this game can get. If you like Grand Strategy games and have an interest in history, this game is for you. No doubt about it.			"

												EU4 continues the greatness of the EU series, this time with the updated engine seen in CK2.  If you own both games and have the CK2-EU4 converter, you can now lead your empire for almost a millennium!Back in EU4, you can once again choose from hundreds of historical nations around the world.  From the start, you will work to lead your country through history.  You can begin in the New World and try to fight off the European invaders, try to unite Japan or keep the Ottoman empire from falling apart.  This grand strategy game is a must if you enjoy trying to change the course of history. "

												This Game is Great, it is one of the best strategy games ever.There is just this one thing... They make an update about every month (or so) and it always completely destroys the game. It makes the game completely unplayable after that and you almost have to buy the latest DLC cause otherwise it is just completely unplayable... and they are not cheap...In addition to that, an update ALWAYS brakes your saved games and you have to stard a new one. If you put 50h gameplay into that it is all just gone, just wasted time. If you almost reached and (almost) impossible Achievement it is really annoying, because it was all for nothing.This could be a really nice game and the updates are the only thing that are not good, but this makes the game so annoying cause you notice that you wasted another 50h or so to a save game that is not playable any longer... and it just ♥♥♥♥es me up			"

												Madly addictive, interesting and intricate. Infuriating at the same time, when larger kingdoms wipe out your army in an instant and then without restraint lay seige to your whole country. This dispair is offset by the complete joy of colonizing new lands and investing in more and more advanced societies and technology. A great insight into the time of it's setting. Promising to be far less frustrating when the 'Art of War' expansion comes out. Should be less instances of your supposed allies, sitting there watching you get demolished by your enemies before being defeated themselves...Visuals/Audio 3/5Optimisation/Quality 4/5Replayability 5/5Value for Money 3/5Immersion/Fun 4/5OVERALL 4/5			"

												""Europa Universalis IV is a game that allows the player to take control of any civilization that existed from November the 11th 1444 until the early Victorian period and steer the fate of that country going forward from there. You have an absolutely incredible amount of flexibility in how your country is shaped.Where many other games focus on war, diplomacy, or trade, EUIV does all of that, most impressively it does it all without any one element feeling less viable or over powered. You may send ambassadors or fling insults, forge claims to neighboring lands, arrange marriages, crush you enemies, collect intelligence, bribe cardinals, dominate trade routes, and colonize the new world all at the same time.The tradeoff here is that Paradox Interactive had to sacrifice accessibility for complexity. You will need to learn to play the game. There is an in game tutorial and a very helpful tip window that allows you to bring up summaries of game features and related topics by clicking on relevant parts of the screen.""			"

												While I definitely wouldn't reccomend this when it was released, it's actually a good game now. Unfortunately, Paradox are money grabbing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and you need DLC for it to be enjoyable, so I would only buy this when it's on sale. Here's some opinions on different aspects of the game:Warfare: The AI is way too eagre to take attrition. I'm talking about 20k soldiers sitting on a fort which needs 6k to cap. I'm talking about 30k sitting on their 25k supply capital. The AI loves to sit around doing ♥♥♥♥ all while their army dies. Now, it's been about 2 and a half weeks since the last DLC, so I'd expect the game to be pretty playable right now, but you can observe your allies being utterly useful a lot of the time. You may think this doesn't matter if you're reading this review a while in the future, but just be warned that when Paradox releases a DLC, the game is usually broken and will be quite buggy for weeks.Economy and Colonisation: The whole ""trade flow"" thing is great, and helps bring more meaning to colonisation through bringing tons of American and Asian goods to European markets for sweet sweet ducats. However, it also limits your expansion to specific regions, which makes the game slightly railroady when it comes to colonisation, if you care about being cash-efficient. Playing Spain or Portugal? North America is completely pointless to colonize, at least in terms of trade. You're trying to colonize as somebody who didn't historically colonize, perhaps someone in North Germany? You can colonize Canada and that's pretty much it. Really though, trade flow should be less restrictive. Especially when you consider the way treasure fleets work - if Spain colonized, let's say, Canada, and found gold there, would it be impossible for them to transport that gold back to Spain? No. But is it impossible in game? Yes.Monarch Points: Until Common Sense, monarch points, or 'mana' was my biggest issue with the game. Now that you can create buildings without it, I'm less inclined to curse Johan's name for this stupid concept. However, it's still needlessly restrictive. Why should inventing technology and assaulting a fort use the same resource? Why should I not be able to offer a peace treaty, simply because I hired a new Admiral? Come on Paradox, out with the Führer mana, in with some more common sense.Despite all this, it's still a really fun game. If you're interested in building an empire, or rewriting history, I would reccomend this, but only if it's on sale.			"

												When I was in Afghanistan I bought EU3 as a time killer. Now I really really really really REALLY sucked at that game, Infact I still couldnt play it properly after trying for weeks because the learning curve on that game was as steep as Mt. Everest yet I enjoyed ever second of it. When EU4 was released I was excited and also intemidated based on my previous experince with EU3. I can now say after playing 80 hours, EU4 is just as fun as EU3 and is so much easier to learn. Even though it still took me about 20-30 hours to learn the game, once you climb that learning curve youll be humbled by just the amount choices you have in directing where your country will go. I highly reccommend this game to anybody who likes strategy games just be warned, If you're a Total War fan or a Civ fan those games will never be the same after playing EU4.EDIT: Those 80 hours were only spent playing as three different factions (western countries at that). I still have yet to try out the colonist part of the the game, let alone play as a muslim, horde, indian, chinese, japanese, or meso-american faction.			"

												I have loved EU IV, but I find it a chore to keep up to date - staying engaged with the community and playing on the same version carries a very high price tag.It's impossible to recommend this game to anyone who has not already picked it up, and as time goes by, PDS has been delivering complexity rather than depth on DLC with prices that exceed the cost of the base game. For anyone considering this purchase, be prepared for a difficult and expensive learning phase, which you may not find very satisfying if you've not been around for the long journey since release.

												Often produce rushed and overpriced DLC. Milk their communtiy for every penny. This is not just this game, but ever game by Paradox. They produce quality games and have a near monopoly on the historical grand strategy market, but my God, they are the greediest scum of the Earth, worse than the producers of Call of Duty and all of those other AAA games. Worse than EA with their DLCs, as they mass produce them and include things that should be in the base game, and they overprice the living hell out of the DLCs, doing ""pre-purchase"" ""upgrade pack"" items, truly disappointing. Not worth funding.			"

												Technically a great game, but suffers from a questionable DLC/developement policy and serious missbehavior from side of the developers.EU IV is grand strategy game, which means you try to lead your nation through the course of history, for multiple centuries. Along the way, you have to manage diplomacy, military, economy, trade, exploration... Well, mostly diplomacy and military, the remaining areas are more of a side thingy (as in, peace is boring).The game has no mentionably good graphics, but will probably eat your CPU anyways if your tower isn't current, double so after the 1.8 patch (which, despite the developers stating ""there should be no noticeable performance change, is A LOT more demanding).The Multiplayer mode is by no means stable and has it's regular moments of desync and reconnecting, but it's definitely playable and fun. As well, the developers pronounced multiple times that EUIV is meant to be a Multiplayer game. Which probably explains the barely adequate AI (let's say, it does some things fine but is so utterly horrible at others that it requires tons of AI-only advantages to give them a chance against even the newest player).However, what needs to be mentioned here that Paradox, since I've started following the developement of CKII and EUIV, has been on a steady decline in quality. Every patch seems to introduce just as many bugs as features, sometimes even making the game completely unplayable.To make things wore, the devs have as well started to completely neglegect old mechanics or content in favour of constantly pushing out new DLCs. Which are usually full of new half-baked concepts that need to be overhauled in a hotfix a week later (and this is not a hyperbole, this happened literally two times in the last four patches).And sadly, there is another source of frustration: the developers themselves. Upon one of the fail-patchesmentioned above, the game was near-unplayable due to obscene amounts of rebels popping up (to the degree where you may or may not got a random event spawning SEVERAL TIMES your maximum army size in rebels, causing a complete massacre to most AI states). This was pointed out less then a hour after the patch release. Johan, Paradox lead developer responded, and I'm not kidding you ""It's not our fault if the players don't know to play the game, our QA tested the patch and it is fine."" When the community responded in uproar, he added ""And now see how ungrateful you are. It's weekend and I'm spending my free time in this forum and those complaints are all I get."" Needless to say, two days later a hotfix was released repairing the changes. Shortly following that, Johan created a new dedicated EUIV lead developer position and has since then not been very active in the EUIV forum anymore (which of course implies he never apologized or rectified anything).I'm currently eagerly watching the new lead dev's steps, hoping he might change EUIV's dev policy and save the game... but it just seems to be a dream hope for the time being.Rating: 8/10 Great game, even though it has a few weak spots.But Paradox currently shouldn't be supported. Vote with your wallets and stay away from this game.			"

												While the game has given me several hundred hours of enjoyment, and it still has the fun of taking a one provence minor and making them the most feared power in the world, I wouldn't recommend this game. Lots of small annoying changes from EU3, like the monarch points system and inabilty to control the advisors you get, make the game feel very irritating to someone familiar with older Paradox grand strategy games. I would whole heartedly recommened EU3 or CK2 over this game, at least in its vanilla state, for more enjoyable times. Also the multiplayer while adding at interesting human element to the game, can tend to move VERY slowly as you are forced to play on a slow speed and there is much less mirco, or small things, that need to be done in this game.

												This is a really fun grand strategy game. I played the first two games in the series, they were good. (Until patch 1.08 wrecked EU II, ""Because of multiplayer, we are going to ..."" RUIN THE GAME!)Anyway, this is a lot of fun. However, there are a few things about the game that are frustrating:The Game Punishes Good PlaySeriously. The better you do in the game the more harsh the events are. Trying to save 500 coins to construct a neat building? When you get to 400 an Event will hit you taking away 300. Win a war in the early game and get 16 points of Prestige? You WILL get an Event taking away 10 of them. ALWAYS. EVERY EARLY WAR. EVERY GAME. There are other Bad events as well.  These events are so HARSH it makes the game frustrating. The Good events seem far minimal in what you get. When you actually get a decent event.Weird AlliancesLike France allying with Ottomans so Turkish armies are running around near Paris. Really? WEIRD. InstitutionsThese make technology gains harder, but the Ottomans and the AI never seem to have problems getting the advances. I played Burgundy in a game, and I had two Institutions START in my country and I was still last to embrace them. They are alright but wow, what a money sink.ScoreI wish they would just delete this. Some countries always get a lot of points for score, such as France and Ottomans. Other countries have a really hard time to get score. For example, one of the ways to get score points is to have a large Navy. Really? How do land-locked nations compete? In EVERY game, France and especially the Ottomanss run away with the points, forcing the player to attack both countires just to knock them down. This is plain DUMB.Junky Kings Will Not DieThey live until 70 when you have a really good heir. I hate this.AchievementsYou cannot get them unless you play on ironman. Stupid. Also, many of the achievements are just plain silly.Recruiting LeadersSo, you invest in an Idea to increase Army Tradition? Your Army Traditino is 40+? When you recruit a General you eill still get one with 2 pips (lousy leaders). Meanwhile, with almost no Army Tradition, the AI gets leaders with 10+ pips. I HATE RANDOM ROLLS FOR THIS!Decimal PlacesI really wish they would change everything to whole numbers.I still like the game but I seriously hope Paradox redesigns some of these issues.			"

												At the behest of a friend, I decided to pick up Europa Universalis IV. I had never played it and did not know anything about the game when I grabbed it as part of a humble bundle deal. I assumed from the title, as well as the cover photo's of the game, it would be much like Civilization or Tropico, with a historical slant. What I found is, Europa Universalis IV has much more in common with Crusader Kings. You build up your territories, similar to the way you would in Civ, but you are given the opportunity to micro-manage your country, down to the last detail of what religion they will be. The array of starting countries is not limited to Europe and Asia, you can even start out as a Native American tribe in the yet to be discovered, ""New World"". Europa Universalis IV, can be unforgiving to the novice, and it can easily be turned into a numbers game, so it may not be for everyone. Having tried it even though it is not my typical genre, I enjoyed it and might give it another shot some time. Until then I can only say, if this sounds like the type of game you enjoy, then you should really like Europa Universalis IV.			"

												I love the game. In my opinion the game is one of the best strategy games of all time.Gameplaywise it is quite unique. I still can't recommend buying it...____________________________________________ DLC:Yes, I know that this is a review for the base game. However I think it is important to know about dlc and dlc-politics before buying a game.  important note:	Till now  8 major dlcs have been released for the game. Those dlcs are usually accompanied by a patch, which brings changes for everyone. But if u want to have access to all possible gameplay elements, if you dont want to stumble accross something like 'need to own XXX dlc to YYY', if you want the game to feel truly complete, you will have to buy atleast those (debatable). All other dlcs solely add new music and unit modells to the game, which do NOT influence gameplay. See eu4wiki for details.Allthough the release of a new dlc every few months means that the game gets more content,it has its downsides besides the need of cash: Bugs and unbalance. Usually every major dlc brings new gameplay mechanics or radical changes. With them bugs come; the new mechanics are rarely balanced. Therefore one or two hotfixes follow every patch. Which can give you the feeling of having bought something incomplete or not fully tested. Savegames. Whenever (or mostly) new dlc is released you will have to take special actions, if you want to continue a game and not start over again. You probably will have to do this before starting the game, otherwise your savefiles will be corrupted and your savegames will be lost. It will NOT matter, if you buy the new dlc or not, because the patch that accompanies the dlc will break the savefiles. A single run in this game takes many hours, therefore this is very important to know. features. Be aware that features added in dlc, may later be changed, moved to available for all or even completely removed.____________________________________________ What kind of game it is? The game itself is a sandboxy grand strategy wargame set between 1444 and 1821. Your job is to take over the role of the ruler/rulers of one of the countless nations of that time period and lead said nation to glory. Besides 'glory' there is no fixed goal. You choose your own goal. You can play as Spain and explore and conquer the (or a random (dlc required)) new world. You can play as China and colonize America or conquer Asia. You can play as Austria and reform the Holy Roman Empire into one state. In case you are good enough, you can even conquer the whole world. The choice is yours! pro:  overall deep and interessting gameplay nearly infinite amounts of content and not completeable game (or atleast thousads of hours) sandbox game interessting period contra:  very difficult to learn for new players gameplay mechanics are not always explained in the game and tooltips are often misleading or wrong ai gets bonuses (more diplomats, more money, ...) ai sometimes behaves unforseeable or just weird (allies may 'betray' you without any warning) bugs stay around for a long time while constantly new bugs turn up and others get fixed savegames get corrupted by patches/are incompatible with new patches multiplayer (unstable). Many players seem to have problems with connection in mp. luck based. For example there are random events throughout the game. While many of them add flavor to certain nations, they are all random and you can get screwed by them. Battles partly include luck. The Gameplay is considerable poorer in times of peace. Which is a problem, because bad luck (for example with events) can force you to stay at peace for a long time.(Dlc can be viewed as good or bad based on what I wrote before.)At this moment I have played the game for nearly 1000 hours and will most likely still play it for hundreds of hours. Like I said in the beginning I love it. I bought all of the major dlc at or close to realease, except the latest (Mare Nostrum, out 3 days, I will probably buy it at some point). Which means I spent about 140€. At this point, after almost 2 and a half year, this game feels like an early access title.That feeling and the sum led me to the insight that i can NOT recommend buying the game, allthough I love it and buying dlc now or at sale would be way cheaper. Sure it is possible to enjoy the base game, but it will feel incomplete.There is literally no other game where I could tolerate said things.			"

												I won't comment many negative things Paradox has been done as they are already covered by others. Before my main point I'll just say that music is worse than in EU III. There are several really epic songs but that's it compared to EU III which almost whole OST is fantastic. There is absurd rebel mechanics!!! If you don't play Ironman (say good bye to achievements), they are managable like everything else as you can reload. Do you play Ironman? F#ck this s#it! - rebels are the strongest faction in game- one province spawn rebel army as big as your (you have 5+ provinces)- and their leader is always Napoleon reborn- and if they are in mountain, even the twice bigger army can't defeat them- what is completely outrages is they don't suffer from the lack of man power!!! WTF?!- they spawn with perfect morale and their maintance is 0 gold!- for the most factions in the game, it's the game over when it happenLet me describe how it works in the real game. I played as Bavaria, crushed 7k army of Salzburg and annexed it. Several years later revolt happened and now they have almost twice bigger army (12k) with insane leader which you can't beat even with 22k army (I even payed 10k mercs just to see how much absurdity goes)! WTF?! It's even more absurd in the New World!EditReformationTypical Protestant propaganda interpretation of history. I'll add more but how the f#ck Reformed can have +2 heretic tolerance? Calvin, Knox, Puritans and iconoclasm just to name few were everything opposite of it.NO REFORMATION IN FRANCE!!! W*F?! Not a single province in France is converted by Protestants or Reformed so no religious war => France is unstopable. AIAI is disgusting. Only good friendly AI is France, they know how to fight and will actually help you in the war. NEVER play in Ironman mode because there is no back! No achievements? They can be easily unlocked by SAM. I mean there is no shame in doing this. Shame on Paradox when your ""allies"" are those who completely ruin your game and you can't reload so you have to abandon your 30+ hours save. Who needs enemies when you have AI friends. SuccessionCan I play a game where my heir doesn't die in hunting accident when my ruler is 60+ years old and that happen at least once in 100 years so I lose my dinasty?Poland-Lithuania CommonwealthIt's just disgusting how much OP is and it's completely ahistorical! Those historicaly dirty poor provinces in Ruthenia are one of the most developed in the game WTF joke is this.Unlawful territoryHere comes another brain dead mechanics brought by Paradox. You annex HRE province and emperor demands to give it back to previous owner. I can accept that. What I can't is that you declare war on H.R. emperor Austria, you completely destroy him and his allies (100% occupation, they have 0 manpower and troops, lost every possible battle, WE is 20 and rebels are poping out left and right), he cedes one province to you and the next day he demands province back and when you refuse, province get 10 years negative unlawful territory modifier. WTF is this brain dead logic?			"

												I would love to be able to play an actual updated version of this game. However I really dislike Paradox's handling of there game prices. If they had a similar approach as Civ5 does, actually making there game affordable for most people, they would get a lot more sales. I would not drop over 100$ for a game starting out, trying to play vanilla is also discouraging as its old, outdated and sucks compared to what recent gameplays are. This goes for Crusader Kings 2 and Hearts of Iron 3... would love to get into them, but they are not worth over 100$.			"

												This was my first strategy game. When I first started, it was all so confusing. I stared at menus blankly, watched youtube tutorials, played through in-game tutorials. Could this really be the most accessible strategy game Paradox has to offer? Yes; and it's also one of the best expreinces I have ever had in my gaming life. I've spent entire days playing, watching the years go by. How am I going to deal with France? Should I ally Austria? THERE IS NO WAY I'M GETTING INVOLVED IN THAT WAR SCREW YOU AUSTRIA *declines call to arms*. These are some the burning questions I've asked and loud statements I've shouted during my time playing EU4. I played my first game as France. Easiest country in the game bar none. I got better. I played as Venice. Got better. Soon it wasn't about ""winning"" or even doing well, it was about proving to myself that it could be done. Can I form the Netherlands as little Friseland. Yes, I can. Can I beat back the Ottomans as Byzantium? NO, NOT THAT. But through each failure I learned. Through each success I learned. I learned about the time period, I learned how to strategize, I learned how to accept defeat, I learned the joys of winning an impossible war, and I learned that I loved strategy games. Thank you Paradox, and thank you Europa, for teaching me.			"

												EU4 is a very interesting game. I mean, sure, it may take some trial and error to develop an understanding of the game mechanics, but once you can grasp the basic gameplay components, this game is really, really enjoyable, especially when playing with other people. The multiplayer aspect of things makes the longevity of this game that much brighter, since you can make deals and forge alliances with countries that would otherwise never be interested in what you have to say. Even without human interaction, it's an enjoyable experience to stretch your brain to find the logical course of action to increase your influence and power.This game also puts the Grand in Grand Strategy Gaming. The fact that you can play as literally any country in the world is simply mindboggling. Not only that, but you have complete control over every aspect of your country: finances, advisors, military affairs, trade policies and embargoes, royal marriages, claims on other monarchs' thrones, fabricating claims and supporting rebels in rival countries, establishing colonies in Africa, Asia and the Americas...the list is endless. This is also a great example of ""great power, great responsibility"", too, since you have to make every action count in order to avoid setbacks for your nation. Want to go to war? You should look at who that nation's allies are, how powerful they are, how close they are and how many troops they can afford to send. Good foresight can help win this game for any strategist, whether they are rookies or veterans.And another thing, ""winning"" the game. What is ""winning"" the game? Is it establishing diplomatic ties with major powers to bolster your nation's security? Is it colonizing all of South/North America and ousting any foreign competition? Is it taking over all of your main rivals by force and establishing local superiority? That's just it, though: although the game can stretch from 1444 to 1821, the game doesn't always have to be that long. You decide when you've won at any time by setting goals for yourself. It doesn't always have to be about world domination or anything that intensive. You could consider yourself the victor within 50 years if you so desire. Playing as France, I completely wiped out and took over Great Britain through military dominance over England, and vassalizing and diplomatically annexing Scotland and the Irish factions. I then took over the Austrian lands ceded from Burgundy early on, and had them weak enough that they couldn't take me down. At that point, I declared myself the victor, because there wasn't much more I could do besides world domination, steamrolling through Europe and travelling to the Americas, Asia and Africa.Every game is so unique, too; you will never have a game play the same, year-by-year or even day-by-day. That also makes the experience so fresh every single time, and that sense of uncertainty really forces you to take a step back and wait, see what happens first. If everything works out in your favor, that's great. If not, there's still a chance that you will end up with that stroke of luck in maybe five years, or fifty years. Who knows?I would give this game a 9/10, because it's absolutely amazing for what it is, and the epic gameplay mechanics can easily make up for those frustrating moments in your game, or for lag or disconnections in multiplayer, and even then, that's not a very common occurrence (well, the disconnections, anyway). This game is very deserving of a $40 pricetag, and if that's a little too steep, you can always get a good taste of the game from the demo. Hell, I would be willing to pay twice as much if it offered Twitch live streaming integration. But, that's just my own opinion. I can leave you now to try this out on your own.			"

												A masterpiece of the Grand Strategy genre. You play as a wide selection of nations in the timeframe of 1444 to 1821. You have to take care of your economy, people, neighbours, diplomacy, religion and military while the rest of the world either wants you dead or torn apart. Find allies, and crush the baguette, remove kebab from Europe or stop Russia from annexing Crimea 400 years before Putin was even born. It's your choice. And if you ever get bored of the main game, there are great expansion packs that can squeeze some more hours, even when your playtime is in the thousands. And the modding community is alive and well too. A very good buy if you like the genre, and a great one if you enjoyed Civ.			"

Also, if you are like me, you'll want to buy all the big and little dlc that they release for the game. If you can afford it, it is worth it.

												Russia colonizing Australia because screw Great Britain, Sweden ruling Northern Germany and Canada because screw Great Britain, Rebelling as the USA (although not exciting as the real War for American Independance) because screw Great Britain, Create the world's largest trade hegemony as Portugal because screw the Netherlands for a change, or Byzantium re-emerging from a near-dead with the help of Poland to kick the Ottoman's butt. What's not to love about totally messing up history?However, this is more than your average strategy game. If you're coming from the Civ camp over here, you're going to have a hard time. Trading, diplomacy, and war are a lot deeper here from other strategy games. I reccomend watching a let's play on YouTube after playing the tutorial, otherwise you're gonna suck at this.All in all this is a great game for experienced strategy masters with great paths towards alternate history. Once you play it any other non-Paradox game will seem extremely slow and boring.			"

												Europa Universalis IV is the fourth grand strategy game about the awkward puberty between the medieval era and the industrial revolution from Paradox Development Studios. It has a lot to live up to considering the success of their last two major titles, Europa Universalis III and Crusader Kings II.So does it live up to it? Ultimately I think so. It streamlines many of the aspects of EUIII and CKII that turned away many novice strategy lovers. Recruiting soldiers is easier, the Trade system is more intuitive than before and the game really makes an effort to encourage the possibility of a mostly peaceful game, which is good because it feels good to switch it up every once in awhile.Not that it's eazy to run out of things to do in EUIV. You can choose literally any nation in existence on any day in between 1444 and 1821, and although some are less fleshed out than others because they played a lesser role in history, the fact that there are so many options is by itself astounding.Overall, I give EUIV a 9.1 out 0f 10. I haven't fleshed out all the reasons in this review why it is so worth your 40 dollars, but just rest assured it is totally worth that amount (although I'd still reccommend waiting for the inevitable sale.).

												Serious review.Man this game is perfect. the level of detail and research put into this glorious masterpeice is gigantic.review:You can pick any nation/american tribe you wish from 1444-1821 rule them from different aspects such as diplomacy millitarily and adminstrativly and instead of being a king in this game. instead you ARE the country with kings growing frombecoming heirs and heirs growing to be kings each king with different stats either they can be diplomatic or adminstrative or a war mongerer. heirs can have weak claims on the throne so people you have royal marriages with might go to war to inherit your throne and it can be the other way around you taking their throne.you can't go to war with anyone you wish as you need a cassus belli (reason) going to war without a reason   will greatly make you suffer as other countries might form a coalition on you (trust me i went to war on an african minor for no reason then THE ENTIRETY OF NORTH AFRICA and arabia went to war against me.) and the money system in this game is great you get income from multiple things like trade or tax etc and that money can help you recruit regiments of armies or building stuff and you can gift money to other countries so they like you.there are diplomatic and adminstartive and millitary points that you gain through adminstratives you can use theese points to get ideas for example you can colonise the new world from the new world idea.OKAY I WILL STOP NOW THIS IS TOO COMPLICATED.what matters is:you wont like this game if you are a casual gamer or an rts gamer from games such as command and conquer, this is a Grand Strategy game if you like the total war series you will like this. although this is much more complicated and will take months to get used to the basics.plus there is a mod that lets you play from 51 ad all the way to 2015 and beyond meaning you can pick any country from 51 ad to 2015. romans mongols etc etcPros:-level of detail-diplomatic system-mods like the one i mentioned-level of replayability-The amazing orchestral sound trackmuch moreCons:battle system.few glitchesRating is 9 for me. add one if you are a paradox fan (sadly i only knew them from this game.)subtract two if you are not a fan of the grand strategy franchise.Aaand post.

												This game is an extremely good game once you get use to it. I highly recommend that you do the tutorials first, the game can be very confusing and complex, time is essential to succeeding and creating your empire. With over 100 hours of playing, I'm still not the best at the game, it takes time to finally figure things out. So I only recommend this if you're willing to be confused for a while until you learn the basics and than the complex stuff.In my opinion, there are a few countries I would recommend you playing as if you're a newbie depending on what your goal is.If your goal is to make a lot of money, then I would suggest either Venice or The Hansa, or any other merchant republic country. Venice & The Hansa have access to some of the best trade nodes in the game, giving you a reasonable amount of income, but also their ideas I believe do help a lot. (Don't quote me on it, haven't played as em, just heard about em)If your goal is to create a military empire, I would suggest France for the most part, due to their traditional ideas, and the fact that they have a brilliant army at the start of the game. Giving you an advantage over your rivals and enemies, but time is your enemy, as France has some powerful countries as rivals, such as Austria, Burgundy and sometimes Castile.Overall, a brilliant game with great mod support. There are some things I wish were there, just to make it much better.			"

												After a game play with ironman mode of CK2, I think currently, EUIV is still the best game among Paradox games despite the fact that patches after patches, byzantine players, normad players and some other ppl who are struggling for their achievements all suffer through each updates. Comparing with CK2, the game is more predictable: you don't need to worry about the massive revolts which are tirggered whenever your monach dies, nor do you need to deal with the massive aztecs, mongols who have no attritions. War score and military acess rules make the war more realistic. It's much more friendly for achievement players in this sense and only drives you mad in rare occasions.Comparing with VICII, the learning curve is shorter. As long as you know how to manage your national ideas and understand all those modifiers, you can just get through it quickly.For the new players, starting without ironman is a nice choice. A castilian compaign will let you understand the general mechanism of the game including vassals, personal unions, crusades and colonization. A moscow game will give you some ideas of the technology group and none catholic countries. An australian compaign will introduce the mechanisms of the HRE and diplomatic power. If you are a fan of map/history, it would be a nice choice for you.			"

												This game is extremely fun. It'll be difficult to learn everything at first, so don't freak out. It'll take time to learn everything and get good, but after that this game is really really fun. You can play any nation you want and even add your own in with a DLC. Many of the better and useful things are locked behind a paywall, like the very necessary development feature in the Common Sense expansion, which is $15, or the Art of War expansion, which is just loaded with nearly everything you'd ever need, is $20, but the game itself is  definitely worth the money. It's just once you get the expansions you'll never want to go back to the normal version of the game.   It's rather complicated, but that's only because there is so much to learn and the proper way to learn it all is different for everyone, but I think the best way to learn for beginners is to just watch someone play the game itself. One of the things you will need to actively find how to's for is the trade system. Don't worry though, it's not difficult. It's just that it is blunt and doesn't tell you much of how it works from just looking at it. Trades important, for it can get you from the red, to the green, and even fund your armies sometimes if it gets high enough. The military combat is rather difficult if you don't know what you're doing, but if you play as a nation that's not in Europe, or one of the more separated European nations, then it won't be a problem and you can learn how to do war yourself. I recommend being England as a European nation to play as. They can't get invaded easily because of their navy, so you wouldn't have to worry about dealing with war too much as you figure out how to play. The Diplomacy is fine, easy to do, and you can figure it out just by looking at it, but it can be your best friend for getting land or avoiding war if you plan things out just right. It'll even help you win the war, before you even start it. It's best to play with a friend that knows how to play as they will help you from dying if you plan to play in Europe, or out of Europe as the Europeans will colonize.   Modding is really easy to learn, if someone's teaching you, although figuring out how to upload the mods is really difficult if you don't know how. I've started to mod not to long ago, and I've developed a very well crafted and balanced nation with no experience with programming when I started. It even has a set list of what it will do when it becomes an A.I. There also a good chunk of mods that can satisfy your distastes with the game like there being no Secularism, enough music, or the game length being too short. It's really not short, but if you want it to last forever you can do that. ^-^    I say that even with some faults the games has many great things that balance those faults out. The faults aren't that bad, but the good is great. If you wanted to make a mod that adds a new country that's specific to you, you can do that, and all it would do is take time. Modding this game isn't hard, but it is very time consuming. As the wise and powerful Egoraptor said, ""It gives the illusion of difficulty because it takes up your time."" Have fun playing!			"

I did enjoy the TW series but the diplomacy of TW series is broken. Everyone always hate you for no reason.EU diplomacy is much more advanced. If someone hates you, there is a reason and it even tells you what that reason is. You don't just get back stabbed from an ally in EU.Game with all the DLCs is a bit overpriced. I do enjoy the DLCs but I feel they shouldn't have costed as much as they do.

The DLC whoring has really gotten out of hand recently. As of right now, for the full game (all DLCs) it is about $240. That is insane. Paradox needs to change the way it does things, and fast.			"

I'd like to compare that frustration to Dark Souls (I have it on console) but at least Dark Souls has a strategy too it that can help you overcome the odds, this is just asinine. Worst off I've tried to reset the game to versions such as 1.11.4 and 1.12.2, the earliest versions that supported the El Dorado DLC and not the recent updates, they crashed every time I started a game. Uninstalled, no question about it I have no reason to continue playing this game. I'm just happy I got my moneys worth out of it before all this happened.If you want details about the updates themselves they go as follows:Provinces instantly fall if they do not have a fort, putting a strain on your forces to constantly recapture them if you are doing anything more than chasing down one enemy army.Buildings (such as forts) have over doubled in costs, costs micronations I like to play as cannot afford. There seems to be no boost to cash flow.Each province with a fort costs 1 gold to maintain, in large nations that adds up quickly in small nations that puts you in debt.I'm not honestly sure what else they added, I saw this and I was pretty much done. Military conquest was supposed to be engaging, difficult, and rewarding not a pointlessly frustrating hassle. "

												Came back to play this after a long time, had nearly 200 hours in it. Found that the updates to the game completely unbalanced the game.

												I think that Europa Universalis IV is the best grand strategy game out there. I used to be a great Total War fan and one day i saw a friend of mine playing europa and he started explaining me how did it work. I was fascinated so bought it and tried it out: AMAZING.I can just say that you can take the role of a country/kingdom/whatever from all over the world, from European countries, african tribes, asiatic empires or even the japanese clans/shogunate. Choose what you want and throw yourself in an epic quest starting from 1444 and ending in 1750.I HIGHLY SUGGEST IT. 5/5.			"

												Will you lead your nation to greatness? will you forge it's destiny?Next generation of the ultimate grand strategy game. A lot of quality of life improvments for non-European nations were made from EUIII including a revamped tech system. The two Great mods of EUIII Death and Taxes, and M.E.I.O.U. have also now combined their efforts into one mega mod called M.E.I.O.U. and Taxes that make this the must have strategy game for the 1350-1800s era.Truely a must own for History buffs and fans of grand strategy games alike. Pick any nation, any principality, even a vassel or union'd country at any point on the time line, and then History becomes yours, you decide your nations destiny. And yes, Ulm can into space.9/10			"

												This game was amazing. It is a very hard game to play and understand ( and if you are looking to learn i highly recommend watching arumba he has amazing tutorials on this game) but once you understand it it becomes something great. This game is much like cursader kings so if you like that title you will like this one however this one is more focues ond states rather than on characters. Another thing about this game is dlc. Dlc is something that really improves this game but it also in a way punishes you. An example of this is the mare nostrum dlc got released ad as usual a patch came out with it. The patch made it that spying is much more effective however only if you buy the mare nostrum dlc can you counter spying meaning its impossible to stop the constant stream of people spying on you for no reason. Also do not get this game if you want a conversion mod.Great game however the patches are making it more of a chore. They add new systems with these patches that make it even more complex and sometimes just more boring since it makes you wait longer in the game rather than being able to act at that moment. An example of this is you used to be able to conquer the world without a problem. however now there is a system which implements a limit on the amount of areas you own and they arent effective if you go over the cap. These are things that should be optional rather than forced. I highly recommend this game but only if you get all the dlc. Otherwise your going to be playing a half made game.			"

												No longer recommending this after close on 3,700 hours.EU series is meant to be played as Austria. That country is purposefully given far too much weight because Heil Hapless Hapsburg (hapsderp, haw haw). o/Of course, we've so much DLC That DLC has become an inbred monster of a thing, which is fitting. Edit: To clarify and come across as less spiteful, I wonder where the slavish kow-towing to the HRE comes from -not one of the more well-known global empires ever. There's even a non-toggleable dedicated UI element to them for their mini-game (dull as dishwater but you're -supposed- to care about it for some reason). See, if the series was set in Europe alone, this would have merit, but the whole world is opened up and yet somehow the Great Mughals or Ming are supposed to care about a small mini-empire far far away (Austria, default country of interest sooner or later, wherever or whatever you may be playing -true story).I have never understood this virtual hapsderp Austria Shrine (Prussia is PDX's second, lesser wet dream nation). Similarly, finished with the corporate money grubbing as a point of principle as well.Anyone have a good book recommendation?			"

												This game is the pinnacle of grand strategy. Through exploration, colonization, conquest, trading, and diplomacy you will lead your nation to great glory or utter defeat. Play any country through the age of discovery, the protestant reformation, and into the age of classicism.This game is a must have if you are a grand strategy fan or even just a history buff obsessed with the time period. though not completley historically accurate it is very authentic, and as it is a sandbox game as you play it gets less and less accurate but its possible you may pick up some history and geography.Although its predecesors were overtly complex, I believe Paradox Masters of Grand Strategy have found a good balance of detail intricacy and accesability. Now buy this game and lets play! It has steam works so you can jump right into multiplayer with no hinderments. Get started today you will spend hours clicking away tweaking your country and taking over the world.			"

												Who actually writes a -review- for something off steam? It's a total waste of time, isn't it? Who wants to provide free marketing to a videogame company? For Europa Universalis IV... No, it isn't a waste of time. EU4 deserves a review. This game is a masterpiece.If you've ever played risk, Civilization, or any of the Total War games, EU4 is all of those games ramped up to eleven. This game is one of the most deep, complex, and engaging strategy experiences you will ever encounter, putting you in the shoes of any nation in the world you can think of between the years 1444-1820. One of EU4's most interesting elements that defines the franchise is that there is not any clear goal; you decide what you want to achieve. It's a sandbox in every meaning of the word; the sky is the limit in terms of goals here. Do you want to be the most powerful nation in the world, ruling the seas from Britain with a mighty fleet? Or perhaps play as France, the terror of Europe and scourge of Austria? Or maybe you just want to play as a Native American tribe and attempt to survive the onslaught of European colonizers, hungry for land and gold. It's all possible. Some people even make a hobby out of taking the most doomed nations possible that are literally meant to just die, and making them into superpowers. Who would've thought it was possible for the Knights Hospitaller, reduced to a single island in the Meditarranean, to conquer all of India and the Middle East?The real pleasure in EU4, however, lies in its sheer depth. Nothing is cookie-cut. Every aspect of running a nation, from staffing the government with suitable advisors to waging war on rivals (with realistic attrition - don't invade Russia in winter, you nitwit) is covered. Rich events and choices flesh out the environment of the time, simulating things such as the French Revolution and unification of Spain, and even though the game is almost 400 years long, things don't get TOO off course historically. Impressive, considering the timespan. It's a game for history buffs, but everything is well-explained enough so the layman can understand what's going on too. The graphics and user-interface are above average, really. The map is usually crisp and clean, providing information on current events for the player's benefit. The UI is complex, but understandable over time. Multiplayer with friends is an outstanding experience, and something that everyone playing this game should try at least once.No review's complete without mentioning the bad and ugly, however, and there's certainly that in EU4. The learning curve, for one, is absolutely murderous - And this is Paradox Interactive's easiest title. The sheer amount of things to do will absolutely overwhelm any beginner for about the first week of gameplay. There's a few design flaws with the game itself, such as the game becoming too easy if you're really good at it or just start in a strong position - Starting as the Ottoman Empire and smacking around your inferior Eastern neighbors with outdated technology, then turning to your Western neighbors with the might of India behind you is not a challenge at all. There's the occasional bug or thing that'll happen that is absolute nonsense, but it's understandable in a game of this size; the AI can be a bit patchy at times too.  In conclusion - If you consider yourself to be a fan of strategy games, you need to at least take a look at Europa Universalis IV. It's a different kind of game that looks at things on a huge scale. It's not politically correct, and doesn't apologize for this. It's deep. It's fun, once you get into it! It's a cut above most gaming products on the market right now, and it at least deserves your consideration. Give EU4 a try - And maybe shoot me a message if you have a question or two about the game, I'd love to help. Strongly recommended.			"

												I'll write down my thoughts of this game and the ''dev''. Excuse me from the start for the ''grammar fails'' I'm not a native speaker but hey... :)Man, I love this game!!! But... Paradox's policy has changed over time. I'm pretty sure you can still have fun playing vanilla game. But soon or later Paradox gonna take that fun back while looking into your eyes and smiling. Because you'll love the game dynamics and get used to it but then they make up a new DLC and if you dont buy it soon or later they gonna add some new dynamics to your ''vanilla'' game from the ''new DLC''. So, update by update your ''vanilla'' game will be more incomplete and lacking dynamics to be able to do play properly...Example. If you buy the vanilla right now you'll get tons of other dynamics from the DLCs but just to be able to ''develop your provinces by monarch points'' (such a good dynamic) you have to get the ''Common Sense'' DLC. And you'll start feeling the pressure because your game is incomplete.Another example. I have the El Dorado DLC (Which gives you tons of combination of being able to create your own nation in game). No matter what I should be able to create an ''Arabic nation in Russian territories having Chineese technology and ''Merchant Republic'' as state type''. But I cant! Because now they made ''Mare Nostrum'' DLC so I can still see ''Merchant Republic'' option but cant choose it cuz I dont have Mare Nostrum!!!! Arhg!!! Do you feel the angst I have???SO THAT MEANS PARADOX CAN BLOCK YOUR ''DLC'' DYNAMICS BY MAKING UP NEW ONES!!!!Solution. If you are a competitive guy (I have to get the achivements!!!) you better buy all of them at once! Do it! And dont look back. You wont be mad.Other than that, if you wanna play a strategy game and chill just get the vanilla and maybe El Dorado DLC as I've said that gives tons of combination on creating nations. Vanilla Game = Not recommended for competitive guy and just ''okay'' for ''lets play strategy and chill'' people.Thanks...			"

												I loved this game before last patch. It was almost perfect (AI could be better, but I'm not gonna compain). And then... Last ""patch"" came (with dlc). This patch is a HUGE stepback for EU4. All mechanics changes (sieges, unbalanced costs for coring and diploanexing, removing buildings, turning good and easy buildings managment into piece of micromanagement crap) are just stupid and silly. Best one - they did not changed code of AI. Yes, AI is behaving like in previous version (and often can't move at all). Update and ""Common Sense"" ruined EU4. Don't even waste time on this game. Go play EU3, it's better than EU4 after ver 1.12.			"

												FOUR HUNDRED HOURS...(edit: closing on 600 hours)I haven't spent that kind of time on a stategy game since Civ IV. In a nutshell this is easily one of the best strategy games available at any point in the history of gaming.Still reading? Ok. Thanks...let me make it worth your while. I've played EU, EU3 and EU4 and this is the best of the series. The other games engaged me for 30, 50 or 60 hours. That's not bad but they never entirely grabbed me. This one is simply a better game than anything Paradox has ever released. The new Clausewitz engine renders this game beautifully. For those worried about the multitude of DLC packs, don't be. The base game plays beautifully and it feels complete. I only purchased the DLC well after I had 100 hours into it. Some may find the DLC worth it. I certainly did. But if you don't get it you're still buying a complete game.So what makes this game good? Options and choice without complexity. EU4 is the epitome of ""every action has an equal and opposite reaction"". Sure, you can play as a massive warmonger and try to gobble up everyone. But then you'll have to deal with the internal unrest and your neighbors banding together to take you down a peg. You can play as a nice neighbor and not attack anyone but then you'll have to deal with keeping major allies happy in order to watch over you. You'll have scenarios where lifelong allies of yours attack each other and you'll have to decide which one to back. Do you build up? Do you build out? It's all up to you. You can take France or the Ottomans and try to dominate the world. Or you can take a tiny country and just try to survive. And there's no ""victory"" in the game. Whether or not you won or lost is your call, not some arbitrary game decision. Meanwhile, you're balancing military, political ramifications, gold, your provinces, technologies and a host of other factors. It's a lot to juggle but it's not overwhelming.There's a learning curve here, but the new engine makes everything more accessible than ever. Thus while some people have been put off by the complexity of this series in the past, this one is actually fairly easy to get into. Now for someone who is entirely new to the engine it's going to take some time to learn your way around. It's not a typical strategy game where you can rush your actions. You have to take your time, plan your actions perhaps decades in advance and then be ready to strike at a moment's notice. It's wonderful fun.There aren't any large flaws with EU4, which is one of the highest compliments I can pay a game. It is highly recommended for any strategy gamer's library.			"

												Updated on 23.12.2014. In short, the three major expansion have fixed most of the issues with the game, and added a massive amount of extra content and flavour.Review:An improvement over the already excellent 'EU3: Divine Wind' in almost every way imaginable. - For those interested in the genre, this is probably the best place to start: Excellent tutorials (by Paradox's standards, at least), less unnecessary abstraction, but all the depth of a PDS game. You'll still fail miserably a few times before fully figuring the game out, but that's always been part of the fun in these titles. So ye, if you're new to grand strategy, get this.- As for 'us' veterans? Improved mechanics across the board, trading that makes sense, more challenging AI and Ironman mode make this a worthy sequel to EU3.The biggest change from EU3DW is the monarch point system that replaces the budget sliders and magistrates. A welcome change, in my opinion, as now you can't just adjust your sliders a bit in the early game for high stability and fast military tech. Monarch points are used for national ideas, tech, buildings, national decisions, even peace treaties. The highly limited amount of monarch points earned per month force the player to really think about his actions. No more spamming buildings at max magistrates and never touching the sliders.  This system does have slight balance issues: military tech is always a better investment than military ideas, for example, and the fact that your ruler's skills play a major part in your monarch point income can screw over large portions of a playthrough. Fall behind in military tech because of an idiot king? lol ok, Prussia is going  to eat you now.Other small problems include the infrequent revolutions and apparent ultra-stability of large AI nations. In my three finished campaigns, [strikethrough]only a handful of American nations ever managed to gain independence, and I've never seen a Revolutionary France. Small sample size, yes, but it does seem like large empires are a bit too stable at the moment.[/strikethrough] These happen far more often now. Colonial nations revolt quite often and the revolution mechanic makes seeing revolutionary nations far more common.The UI is much better this time, being closer to CK2's than EU3's, but the panels and the font are still far too small at 1920x1080. Fortunately, there is a fix to this in the Steam workshop, another great addition to the game.AI has seen quite a few improvements as well, especially in diplomacy. Every nation now has a limited amount of diplomatic relations they can maintain, and the AI does seem to understand the mechanic quite well, cutting ties with nations because of shifting interests, and seeking new allies as the game progresses (instead of picking 3 allies at the start of the game and sticking with them, like in EU3). Cascading alliances are not a problem anymore, as infamy was replaced by an aggressive expansion relations hit to all nearby nations. AE going too high leads to the AI forming coalitions: defensive alliances that do what cascading alliances were supposed to.Overall, the AI nations seem far better at waging war; effectively pursuing hostile armies, splitting up to siege multiple provinces at a time, exploiting river crossings to crush larger forces, etc. EU4 > EU3  Divine Wind. [strikethrough]Only thing I actually miss from EU3 are the overseas territory names (ie. Portuguese Africa, British Caribbean)[/strikethrough] Conquest of Paradise adds this back in.- How is it as a standalone title?A bloody brilliant game, and miles above any non-PDS strategy game in depth, scale and complexity. It also looks very pretty, so that's good. I was a long-time Total War fan, before being introduced to EU3. Now, even Empire: Total War feels far to simplistic.Expansions:The Conquest of Paradise- Colonial nations form when you have enough colonies in an overseas region. Similar to vassals, but pay tariffs instead of taxes. A pretty cool mechanic, though I do miss being able to micromanage every single colony.- Randomized New World. Not too exciting. Terrain generation is really odd, and looks like a random map seed from Age of Empires 2.The Wealth of Nations- Revamped trade system is great.- Trade companies are like colonial nations in the East. Cool system, but has the same problems CN's have.- New diplomacy options are great. Transfering trade power, new casus belli. Great additions.Res Publica- More flavour for Poland and the Dutch. Not too exciting, but highly recommended if you want to play those nations.Art of War- More diplomacy options again. Excellent additions like supporting rebel CB, fight for subject CB, war reparations.- Autonomy system added in the patch is great, as is the new revolution mechanic.			"

												If you have not bought ALL the DLC for this game - don't even start to play it, coz you will lose. There is no way to win without some DLC features. Game is basicaly unplayable and Paradox should be lynched for that. Wasted God knows how many hours playing for Cusco/Inka just to realise that without the ability to reform religions(that comes with DLC El Dorado as I guess) you just gonna lose no matter what coz you won't have coloinst early and other stuff. And I had to go to youtube to even know that.The game is basically a scam at this point, not recommend, you'll just waste your time and lose after a while without ALL DLC features. (and to say that I bought some edition that had 3 DLCs included in it, still got ripped off, can't belive it, not gonna by anything from Paradox ever)			"

												Only Paradox game I would out right reccomend. Not perfect and their DLC policy is still moronic. Playing as smaller nations can feel very RNG reliant and mostly unfun. Bigger nations is where its at. Mostly solid and polished in terms of visuals, UI and gameplay. But by far the WORST mechanic is the rebellion system, instead of having interesting things happen while not at war the game just spawns rebels every now and again to hamper your expansion and annoy you. Instead of rebels ya know realistically popping up when they have reason to rebel.Overall 7/10 only paradox game (besides Stellaris) where DLC isnt neccesary.			"

												poentially the best game of its kind IF it didn't have a few fraustrating improbable things that totally ruin the experience.-a rebellion in a region might field more men than the entire nation and with more artillery than a superpower-at very easy level you might lose a battle when you outnumber an enemy 3 to 1 and have better tech....even if u defend behind a riverI hear many of these things are solved if you buy 1 or 10 of the dozens of ""expansions""....but I really don't feel like sorting thru all that and spending more cash to have an already expensive game properly function.

												If I wanted to not be able to walk into the southern half of Morroco because there's a stupid fort that I can't get to because the province is guarded by a fort, I would have bought the damn DLC that featured it. However, Paradox has apparently taken everyone's advice and put features like this into the base game. But I don't want it. Too bad! Enjoy playing with the estate constantly wanting your land and such! Watch as you lose a war because you can't reach the capital because an entire line of provinces can't be crossed because of one fort! I hate what Paradox has done. I'm never coming back to this mess. 0/10. Won't be fooled again.			"

												This game is a big surprise for me this year. I never though i will enjoy it so much since I havent played any Paradox games before. This has to be because unlike Total War series Paradoxes games doesnt look attractive at all :D, but when i started playing this i couldn't get my hands off it, its so addictive. I have long been a Total War series fan and i still like some of their games but this game is in many ways way superior than any TW game - modded or not. Unlike Rome TW 2 this game is imo one of the most well though games i ever played, and i will be easily putting hundreds of hours in, and enjoying every moment of it. The complexity of whole system may seem huge at first but its worth to invest some time in understaning it, since it will be returned to you tenfold.Many thanks to Goro and others who persuaded me to buy this game ;DFinal verdict 10/10, my GOTY :D			"

												Having been a long time player of Paradox games, I'd have to say this is one of the most fun and polished titles they have developed so far. This game suits all your grand strategy needs and creates challenging situations through new mechanics such as aggressive expansion and coalitions. For people who complain about the learning curve of Paradox titles, I'd recommend this as the best game to pick up first. It might well be difficult to learn, but it is interesting enough to keep you entertained and incredibly rewarding when you get the hang of things. The replayability is also a huge plus (as it is with most Paradox games). The amount of countries to play is fantastic and there is a huge amount of variables that mean that two games are rarely the same. Adding to this, the amount of mods trickling out extend and improve the games playability as well as Paradox's expansions which aim to improve how 'lesser' countries play out. If you're interested in grand strategy games, it's a must-buy.			"

												If you've come here for a 4X, please you need to redefine what you think a 4X is. EU4 is sandbox and that, and it's just an experience. 4X implies a goal and competition, and there is definitly a competition in Multiplayer, but that is only 15% of the game, but there is no way to ""complete"" the game. The only way to do so is to World Conquest, which is next to impossible for Casual Players like me. ♥♥♥♥ I am still learning parts of the game I don't even know. On top of that all a new DLC is arriving in what will be now 8 days, and probably around the time you read this it's already out. I know you'll see ♥♥♥♥ like ""Don't buy, pirate, Paradox is money grabbing ♥♥♥♥♥s."" Let me just say... No. They aren't money grabbing, sure they have some sketchy ♥♥♥ pricing ranges on some mediocre dlc's but what makes them different to EA, Ubisoft, any major publisher is they include half of the contents in a free patch. Not to mention they work on their games for years. I'd just like to point out that EU4 came out in August of 2013. It came out 3 years ago, now you can get most dlc half off during one of the multiple steam sales, ♥♥♥ sales, or amazon sales that happens over the year. What amazes me most is the dedication to the fanbase, most devs will release small patches alongside dlc expansions for a set price of 20 USD. On top of that did I mention you get FREE contents every dlc release. Please name one other ♥♥♥♥ing major publisher that does that kind of thing. I can help you with that, none. Paradox is the only major developer who does this, and I respect them for that.EU4, isn't easy, but it's so much fun by the time you learn it. Definitly worth the grab even if it is full price, but if on sale even better because you can get some dlc alongside it. Remember, Paradox isn't like the other Publishers, they actually know what they are doing.Updating for the event (November 26th)			"

												I am a huge fan of the Europa Universalis series, and a huge fan of Paradox games in general.  I have almost 1500 hrs logged into EU3 and another 3-4000 hrs spread across HOI3, Crusader Kings 2, Victoria 2 and Sengoku.  EU3 was easily my favorite of the bunch...So on to my impression of EU4.  Imagine EU3 with better graphics and all the fun ripped out of it stillborn and left to die on the operating room floor.  They have ruined this game.  Ruined.  R.U.I.N.E.Duh.In the interests of me not having an aneurism, I'll just limit my comments on the weird, delusional, nonsensical ""coalition system"" to this.  Great concept, worse than amateur level execution.  Now on to my biggest beefs...  Defeat your enemy in battle then beat him to the next province to cut off his retreat?  Well go ♥♥♥♥ yourself, his troops are all magic ninjas with the special ability of being able to hide from your ARMY.  Want to go invade your enemy?  Not so fast, there's a castle two provinces adjacent that magically prevents your army from moving there.I have no problems with adding in game mechanics to help balance things, but this is ahistorical horse ♥♥♥♥.  If I wanted to play a game that had a ""fairness fairy"" I'd play something in the fantasy genre.  I come to Paradox for REALISM.  Not for magic castles that prevent movement in neighboring duchies just because some re-tarded asshat wanted to add maintainence for castles and now we need to balance that.   And I understand Paradox has ALWAYS had weak ""stack mashing"" battle mechanics, but historically as well as in EU3, the majority of casualties occured after an army routed.  Maintaining control of an army in full retreat across multiple provinces is a herculean task.  If you ain't Napoleon, you ain't doing it.  And yet...I waited patiently for them to fix the broken, ♥♥♥♥♥♥, lazy fake-♥♥♥♥♥ mechanics with patches or DLC.  Meanwhile I played CK2.  Now Lo and behold some of this stupid ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ has begun to appear in CK2.  Hey Paradox, your ""broken retreat"" concept is a broken game mechanic.  And its driving this loyal paying customer away from your games in disgust.			"

												This is a wonderful game with a Real time challenge, it is very challenging and you can have so much fun playing as the nation you want to ranging from The United Kingdom, To Persia. The new DLC ""Common Sense"" In my Opinion has changed the game in a way that it will never be the same, Let me explain. Whenever I siege and occupy a province and move my men out it will un-siege itself and I have to re-siege it. I was at a war with Ottomans and I was about to win till my Objective province got un-sieged and I lost an army stack because while I was re-siegeing it his main armies came and destroyed everything I had. I could have won and could have peaced out if I had that province but that fact that this DLC has made it so it un-sieges the provinces I take over makes me mad and it costs manpower to re-siege and manpower is something that is valued in this game. Not to mention the new Outrages Admin points you have to spend just to core one province, I full annex Wallachia under Hungary, it costs over 400 Admin and I am saying, ""Good Job Paradox you have ruined my game!"" Also this is not the only bad thing Common Sense has done to our beloved game, it made it so when AI fight their armies go crazy around the map, and thats not even the worst part! I mean the fort system is so bad I just want to use cheats to full annex a nation because of the anger and madness I have of the fort system. Though if you have made it this far into my paragraph you might want to listean even more. The value of sieging a province that a country owns is worthless! I siege all the balkans under Ottomans Control and it is only 6% Warscore, what the actually heck. The only fun thing for me in this DLC is the new re-shaped Provinces, the new nations, the 1490 Italian's leaving the HRE which makes invading them more fun for outside HRE nations, and the last good thing about Common Sense is the devolpment system, I love how you can make your nation strong. Let's say I play as Hungary, I can develop my country to be as strong as Castile,Aragon,France, and Poland. The new DLC in all is worthless and I suggest you do not get it. Other then that Europa Universalis IV is a fun, Stragetic game and I would suggest you get the game but not Common Sense. If you have read this paragraph I hope you agree with me and Paradox, if you are reading this please fix these things to make the fun come back to the game. I put to many hours and fun into this for you to turn it into a non-exciting game! Thank you all for your time of reading this Review.			"

The mechanics are changed with each update and ruin the game experience. Often my savegames disappear or are not compatible any more, leading to regular crashes or errors when displaying the map.

												I recently picked this game up again after a year long haitus. The game has been improved on every level since I last paid, however since I am not a muppet I will not pay for a bunch of DLCs which come to a price higher than the base game itself and which should have been patches anyway.Like how can you patch the game so that you can build fewer buildings, then release a DLC for over £10 which lets you build provinces up to the amount of buildings you could build before the patch and think that's acceptable? Who is buying these DLCs? I understand why people want them, I want them myself, but only because they change the game's base mechanics back to the level they were at at release. I refuse to pay for them though. I don't understand who would pay for them.It's not even as if grand strategy is a niche market anymore and Paradox need every penny. In that case I might be able to justify it. Paradox is doing this because they can, with their stranglehold on the grand strategy market. I'm not gonna enable them though. If you're thinking of buying this game, please don't, do not enable shameful business tactics.			"

												I want so badly for this game to be fun, because it's such a cool concept. But I've been disappointed every single time I load it up and give it another try. It could be so much better.Here's something to understand if you're thinking about trying it: It's more like Risk than Civilization. It's a game about conquering territory, not building an empire. War is the only practical thing there is to do. If you're not at war, you're just gonna be staring at the screen for hours waiting for numbers to go up.Nothing will make sense to you the first time you play this game. The amount of help provided is very limited, and the UI is very confusing. Icons without meaning abound. Numbers and modifiers are given without explanation of what they actually do.If you stick with it, you'll discover that fighting and conquering land is kinda fun. Troops are moved around in real-time, which makes it feel realistic. I'm sure I would have more to say on combat if I knew more about how it worked, but of course, it isn't explained very well. 90% of the fun in this game comes from looking at the territory you own and thinking ""Ahh, look at all the land I own now.""The massive amount of provinces and nations in this game is really, really cool. There are hundreds of nations, and every one is playable, from the biggest to the smallest, from Europe to Africa to Indonesia to America. However, nations outside Europe receive crippling penalties that end up making them much more boring to play than they should be. Different regions of the world have different technology penalties. East Asia, for instance, has technology 60% more expensive, and certain regions of America have technology 250% more expensive. You can remove this penalty through an extremely painful ""westernization"" process. I dislike this system immensely. I wish there had instead been a set of technologies the more primitive nations would have to go through before getting caught up. This would still have kept them behind the Europeans, but it would have given the player something to do. Instead, my native tribe seems to consist of a bunch of morons who can't learn.Most things in this game require a resource called monarch power to perform. This comes in three types: administrative, diplomatic, and military. You get a base amount of monarch power per month, and then the rest is determined by your advisors (which you can hire for gold, if you have enough) and your ruler. If your nation isn't a republic, you can't control who your ruler is...and your ruler massively influences how much you can do in this game. If you have a good ruler, you can do all sorts of fun things, but if your ruler sucks, you're stuck sitting and waiting for decades of game time and hours of real time to do anything at all. Waiting seems to be a common theme in this game's play.You can build buildings in your provinces if you happen to have lots of gold, but it's not very interesting to do so. The buildings have only a small effect individually. Like I said, this game is more about taking land than developing a nation.Exploration and colonization was something I was excited to try, but it turns out you can't do either until you take very specific policies...I wish every nation could expand to unoccupied territory from the very beginning, but this is not the case.I find that most of the strategies I try this game are...cheesy. For instance, if I'm a weaker nation and I want to bully some of my neighbors out of their land, I will attempt to ally with a strong nation, get them into my war...and then make sure my armies land on the provinces I want to take before theirs do, because whoever starts a siege on a province first gets claim to that territory. This doesn't make me feel like I'm winning, it just makes me feel like I'm gaming the system.There are more things I could complain about, but the gist is that this game seems awesome yet constantly disappoints me. If you like maps and war, you'll probably like this game. If you like SimCity or you're the kind of person who prefers peaceful victories in Civilization, you probably won't. "

												The game had potential, but whoever makes it chose otherwise. A questionable vision of geography and history of the mid fifteenth to early nineteenth centuries, an inaccurate world map, and dull gameplay. The small updates they call ""downloadable content"" which are smaller than an expansion but somewhat bigger than a patch are unjustifiably expensive compared to the novelties and tweaks they bring.I will not buy any titles from this firm unless they change their practices and apologise.

												EU 4 is a game that takes time. Time to learn, and time to enjoy. In the first 10 hours minimum, your not going to have any idea what your doing. You'll make mistakes. You'll think ""Wow this game is boring as ♥♥♥♥"" But then, you start to understand. In no time, your rebuilding the mongolian empire, or conquering Japan as the spanish.

												This game is amazing. It's so thorough and realistic! You simply cannot build a massive empire without worrying about stability, and even when you do begin to get big, you have to worry about coalitions, other massive empires! It always keeps you on your feet in some way no matter how powerful you become.Features I love tremendously:Modding Community. I can't express how awesome the modding community is for this game. My favorite mod is the Extended Timeline. I created a massive Germanic Empire covering europe following romes demise during the migration period(I replaced the roman empire, and more, hehehe). I even took on the mughals (which formed from parthia.Frequent Updates and Patches. This just shows how much Paradox Entertainment cares for their games to keep them entertaining. The new Art of War expansion added so much! 900 extra provinces, 150 new countries, new rebellion mechanic, better war mechanics.. that is just the tip of the Ice berg! http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?810805-1.8-Full-Patch-NotesDiplomacy. This is tremendously well done. You can literally manipulate the throne of another kingdom and force them into a Personal Union (only if your Christian, since the AoW update). Diplomacy dictates every corner of this game. If you expand too quickly, your neighbors will see that as 'aggressive expansion', and possibly form a massive coalition against you. This is an amazing game-balance mechanic, as it prevents big empires from going on a conquest rampage. You are forced to form alliances no matter what nation you start as, least you fail the game in the short run, and if not the short run, then the long run.War. The war.. It's so amazingly realistic. It makes you feel like your fighting against another nation like they would in that time period (With crusader kings being even more accurate in this regard). Every single day begins to count during a war (real-time after all, no joke) The way a war is fought is heavily dictated by the supply limit a province can provide your troops. A smart enemy can fight a war of attrition against you, making you lose thousands of troops each month while you flee.Expansion. Yes, I love how the expansion isn't dictated by what you occupy, but what your warscore is in a single war. This boost the realism level to almost as high as it can go. Historically it was impractical, and logistically impossible to conquer a huge empire in one war. You would have mass rebellions, and administrative problems to say the least. Couple this with the over-extension mechanic, and that is where the realism really blossoms. Even when you conquer a small section of an enormous empire, and you still have to deal with massive instability and revolt risk!Honestly, this review only covers a small fraction of the awesomeness of this game. There are so many equally awesome features that I have not covered in this review, and I'm lazy. If you are a fan of conquest games, you should buy this game undoubtedly - unless you prefer the style of CK2 over EU4 (I like both).			"

It is the best game I have ever played, it is so in depth, and everything you do will have good or bad repurcussions. The community around the game is excellent, with many mods available and youtubers like Quill18 and Arumba. My love for strategy gaming began at Civ 5, and now, after owning multiple total war titles and other strategy games, this is the best of the best. The multiplayer is brilliant, as you can play with mods which allows for so many different ways to play. If you have the money you must buy this game, as it is truly the best strategy game available.			"

												This is by far one of the best games I have ever played. This has blown all other strategy games I have played way out of the water. Normally with strategy games I am downloading mods for them after about 150 hours but I am currently over 400 and I don't plan on getting any for another few hundred. Although I have heard the timeline mod is awesome I am going to play the vanilla game to its fullest. This game may take a long time but its full of things to keep you busy. From plotting your next conquest to being cought completely off guard by a declaration of war. You can take the smallest nations and turn them into glorious empires. You can also be utterly crushed under the boot of jealous neighbours.I have only been able to complete 4 campians (Who knows how many I have failed XD) and my favorite was forming Italy as Naples. It was extreamly hard as Austria desided to take Milan but I finally formed Italy in 1700. Shortly after that France and me had to fight off the Commonblob. It was a long and bloody war but we came out on top (and low on money and manpower). That war was the most enjoyable one I have fought thus far.Note: There are people who don't like thier DLC system and I cannot blame them. But this game (and all of their others) is just so awesome I am willing to buy them all to support Paradox and help them develop more awesome games in the future. In conclusion, if you are a lover of strategy games and have loads of free time this game is perfect for you!!!			"

												Europa Universalis 4, the game so good you'll develop E-U-4-ia is a grand strategy in which you select a nation and try your best to not get conquered by France, the Big Blue Blob.  Even if you're some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little Asian nation, don't worry, BBB's-a-comin' sooner or later.  Probably later.To me the real time the game shines is during multiplayer, where all of Europe can jack each other off in Woodstock-class hippy peace time, dividing up the world so nobody is sad and teaming up in ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t alliances against anyone who would try to provoke actual conflict.With frequently-added expansions to the game that aren't nearly as trivial and cash-grabby as certain other studios (not going to namEAnyone) your experience becomes even greater over time.  Speaking of time, if you have under three hundred hours in the game I consider you to be casual scum.So good luck, Tengri bless, and support DDRJake for Dictator of Earth 2016.

												How to play Byzcan'tine Empire:Attempt 1: Get Poland as ally but Lithuania PU never fires. Check Austria diplo and it's a minor in a PU with Aragon 2 years into the game.Attempt 2: Ottomans ignore you for 15 years and blob literally everything in Asia Minor and all minors in Balkans. Poland then dishonors call to defensive war against Ottomans for no obvious reason (not already in a war etc.).Attempt 3: Ottomans declare war before you can get any allies.Attempt 4: Hungary white peaces out while Ottomans are also majorly losing a war with Mamluks on the other end. Ottomans then wreck you.Attempt 5: Game starts out good. Within three years of game start your ruler dies and a rebel pretender much stronger than you stack wipes your army and takes Constantinople.Attempt 6: Game starts out good. Within four years of game start your ruler dies and a rebel pretender much stronger than you stack wipes your army and takes Constantinople.Attempt 7: Game starts out good. Within two years of game start your ruler dies and a rebel pretender much stronger than you stack wipes your army and takes Constantinople.Attempt 8: Everything set up nice with Polish/Lithuania ally. Wardec Ottomans and Poland/Lithuania get completely destroyed due to generals literally rolling eternal 0's and 1's. Ottomans stack wipes everything they look at with fewer troops, worse generals and with crossing penalties.Attempt 9: Poland and Hungary are rivals. You decide to try again game hasn't even started yet.Attempt 10: Poland and Hungary are rivals. You decide to try again game hasn't even started yet.Attempt 11: Poland and Hungary are rivals. You decide to try again game hasn't even started yet.Attempt 12: You decide the fourth rivalry in a row may not be a bad thing if you try an Austria alliance again. Improve relations with all 3 anyway. Can't get diplo high enough to ally Austria (stops at -13 with no other options). Ottomans wardec before you can ally Poland.10/10 would play Groundhog's Day Simulator 2016 again			"

												Best Game I ever played!For the grand strategy fans out there, your search for an amazing game is finally over, never has there been so much joy to be had from a single game..Featuring the best storytelling in decades, a soundtrack filled with music composed by swedish angels, whats not to like about this marvel of a game!Do you want to crush your enemies with a mighty force of combined arms? Or would you rather make them join you in a personal union because your king was excellent at producing offspring? The choice is yours! "

												This game is excellent, the best Grand Strategy game ever! It is excellent value for money and the DLC is sensational. I cannot fault it at all. It is the best game I have ever played, it is so in depth, and everything you do will have good or bad repurcussions. The community around the game is excellent, with many mods available and youtubers like Quill18 and Arumba. My love for strategy gaming began at Civ 5, and now, after owning multiple total war titles and other strategy games, this is the best of the best. The multiplayer is brilliant, as you can play with mods which allows for so many different ways to play. If you have the money you must buy this game, as it is truly the best strategy game available.			"

												There are few games which are more packed with content than Europa Universalis IV. The best thing about this game is it's replayability, ensuring that even when you have more than 500 hours logged you still want to come back and play another campaign. With hundreds states to choose from spanning a time period of almost 400 years you essentially get a situation where no playthrough is ever the same. Although the game takes a while to master, getting your *ss handed to you multiple times is something even players with hundreds of hours logs sometimes have to deal with and also makes you want to come back even stronger the next time you fire up the game. Another pluss is also it's amount of detail. If you like history like myself you will find tons of neat flavor-events which describe historical events. Alot of the states in this game also have unique mechanics, ideas, events and more adding to the historical accuracy of the game and the replayability value. The developers are also very supportive and the community is nice and lively. The developers hand out regular new DLC's which also come with free content. The game now (7-12-15) almost only resembles the game which came out on release in name, everything else have been changed - mostly for the better.  If you are a true fan of strategygames and have the time to learn its deep and engaging mechanics I can seriously not find a reason to buy this game: it's worth every penny. Short Summary of the points above:+ Replayability. I have  over 500 hours logged on my steamaccount alone plus around 200 more which are not recorded. I am still nowhere done playing this game and there are people with more than 1000 hours and I am sure I can easily reach that number as well.+ Historical accuracy, alot of neat mechanics, events and ideas, making every nation feeling and playing different. +  Active Developers: Free content, unitpacks, expansions, etc. This game is still evolving and the developers are still actively listening to fans for suggestions and tips. + Multiplayer: There are alot of people online looking for multiplayer games if you want to try it. The community is alive, friendly, mature and (most of the time) serious enough for some good games. I suggest trying out the forums for more info. + Paradox: EU IV isn't the only good title they have ever released. If you like what you see I'd suggest looking up the following games: Hearts of Iron III (and the new game HoI IV), Victoria II, Crusader Kings II and the upcoming game Stellaris. - Difficulty: This depends on how you look at it. The game takes some time getting used to but the fact that it is difficult also works as a way to keep on learning and improving. Even for me some setups are challenging and when you start to hunt for achievements the game can really push you to improve your strategyskills. It does however take some time to get there. - Social life equals gone: This game can easily eat up all spare time you have, watch out before you are suddenly divorced, late on paying the bills, etc. Some funny things I have done in a few campaigns:- Played as the Free City Danzig whilst being surrounded by angry Poles. - Witnessed a Coptic Egypt emerging which then started to destroy the Ottomans- Reformed my government and technology to western standards as a native american nation, and pushed back the western aggressors, securing America for the native population with my friends.- Let Byzantium rise from the ashes and recreated the Byzantine Empire- Migrated to Russia with Trebizond, creating a Greek Siberian Empire there.- Destroyed France (hehe)- Got into space with Polendball- Started as a country with Ibadi as religion and spread it around the middle east - Finished the Baltic Crusades with the Teutonic Order by taking over Russia. I Formed Prussia (best Russia) afterwards and started moving West. I then managed to create Germany. - Colonized Northern America with Japan, making it Shinto. - Created a fleet which was 10 times bigger than the number 2 in the world with The NetherlandsBuy this game.10/10			"

												Great game if you like heavily strategic games.This is a game that is totally random in time if you play with a country.I play for almost 300 hours in this game. And I still love it. :DYou can choose so much different country's and I play only 50 of them I tthink. If I'm right there are more than 500 country's.I'm a really beginner which country must I choose?One of the country's that is easy to play are Austria, Poland, Castile (later ingame Spain). If you want more difficulity go for France, England, Muscovy or Ottomans. And if you are later a better player and know how all mechanics work in the choose a difficult country like Brandburg or smaller country's.I play only for the achievements. Which are easy?For more info about how easy achievements are go to the wiki.Here is the link how difficult achievements are.http://www.eu4wiki.com/AchievementsYou must always play in Ironman mode! If you don't do that you will never get the achievements.This are some tips that I can give. If you have a point for it. Say it and I will change it.			"

												My take on this game :Pros :(+) Great simulation of Europe, Holy Roman Emperors, and the wars in between.(+) Great simulation of New World Exploration. While we somewhat knows where is continental America, this is somewhat fixed in a New World DLC.(+) Great simulation of Europe technologies. The technologies are also explained in a historical context.(+) Good simulation of warfare. In addition of tactical battles, one can also won by engaging naval blockades, trade embargoes, and such.(+) Good simulation on politics. Declaration of war is not that simple, you have to obtain a reason : whether it is a different religion, reconquest, etc. The mechanics of War Exhaustion, Stability, and Aggresive Expansion enable careful warfare and not all out map painting.(+) Each big nation have their own ambition and mission. For example : Brandenburg to form up Prussia, and later Germany. Cons :(-) Sometimes your allies make such bad decision. Such as waging a 20-years war with a HRE/France for one pitiful province. Or wage 10+ years war that consumes manpower and increase war exhaustion for one tiny land.This game is a historical simulator, not 100% accurate but still put history in context.			"

												It is absolutely amazing. The incredible rush you feel when you zoom out and realize that your country's name is the biggest in the world. The satisfaction of going to the religions map mode and seeing that all of italy is finally sunni after a century of conversion. The thrill every time you start a new game playing as one of over 300 diferent countries in one of 377 unique starting times (you can start playing during any year between 1444 and 1821). These are not even a fraction of the reasons why this game is possibly the greatest game i've ever played, and by far the greatest strategy game out there. Is has so much replayability it's ridiculous. It's not just addictive like some stupid arcade game, it's fulfilling and great fun. Don't believe me? look at the other guys that have left reviews. Over 500 freaken hours. do you know how long that is? That's almost an entire month's worth of hours. That's one 936th, or more than 0.1%, of the average american's life span, playing europa. No one plays that much because it's a bad game. And if you ask me, that's time well spent.			"

												8/10 - This is a GREAT game.+tive Points - It is EXTREMElY addictive and enjoyable for long hours, there is literally never a moment with nothing to do; whether it be war, building infastucture, stabilising your economy or advancing technology. Especially fun with many friends on multiplayer; this is when the game is incompareable to anything else, it IS grand stratergy. You really get drawn in and you get stuck to its sticky bosom of pure enjoyment. You really feel you're building an empire, and there are so many playable nations you literally can replay the game thousands of times, for thousands of hours. It is also one of the most easily modable games on Steam, with many mods adding even more greatness to an already great game.-tive Points - If you're new to stratergy, this game throws you into the deep end and you will spend a LONG time getting to grips with the multitude of mechanics. Battles, although fun and challenging, can be repetitive with the same animations and tactics, a little more variaty and interactive-ness is needed in my opinion. Multiplayer HAS A LOT OF ISSUES. Although it is the best part of the game, the servers have many issues, with players frequently and randomly disconnecting or not even being able to join a lobby. A game in multiplayer may take time to get going, but when it does, it is AMAZING!Overall, if you love stratergy, this is a requirement. If Paradox can sort out multiplayer servers and issues, you would be looking at a 10/10 game here, but these issues do make the game frustrating at times.			"

												I don't usually feel the need to write a negative review, but after looking at the long list of dlcs on these games I'd like to vent on this one.....well, Paradox generally actually.I love historical games, love strategy games.  I've read endless praise about all of Paradox's games since the first EU.  As a result I have bought countless Paradox titles and played them for tens of hours trying to get what people like about them.  I still don't get it.  I find all the titles very similar...a map, lots of statistics, arcane calculations to simulate real events which never exceed the excitement of watching a slideshow.I understand different people like different kinds of games and I wouldn't feel the need to share my opinion normally.  But when I see the appalling dlc policy of drip feeding their fans tiny upgrades for premium prices I think I should warn others, so they don't end up wasting their money like I did.  If I want to play their games again I'm confrionted with 100s of dollars of 'essential' dlcs that make me feel that I only possess a demo of the game.  The early games were sensibly priced and worth the time investment.  These latest rip off installments should be avoided by all but the die-hard Paradox fans.			"

												Truly not abusing the term ""grand"" when it comes to grand strategy games, EUIV is hands-down the best 4X game I've played in many, many years. Having the option to play as any nation ranging from the start of the European Renaissance to past the American Revolution, the scope and involvement in your nation's development is unprecedented. Making sure to keep your expansion in check and powerful allies placated will have you forming decisions well well into the hundreds of years. Most nations (even smaller ones) have unique sets of ideas that will radically alter your playstyle - will you conquer massive swaths of land as the Ottoman Empire, diplomatically unite the Holy Roman Empire as Austria, build trade dominance with Venice, or play as a little-known minor country in Africa, India, or Asia? There are literally hundreds of choices.This game is not for the faint of heart or those without a fair amount of time to invest - a single game can easily last weeks! That being said, pick this up if you have any interest in strategy, or even just world history! It's the best excuse for sinking 12+ hours into a session - you're ""learning"" about the world!			"

												Great game but not for everybody. If you enjoy numbers and micromanaging minutiae, and if you don't have anything serious to do in real life for the forseeable future, give it a try. When describing it to friends I typically draw parallels between alcoholism or other serious addictions, but that appeals to some poeple.I've honestly learned a lot about geography and history from the game. With a little imaginiation it feels like you're rewriting history with your own spin, and you can do it over and over again with hundreds of nations.			"

												     Europa Universalis IV is a Grand Strategy Game developed by Paradox Entertainment. The game allows you to take control of a country from the time period of 1444 until 1820 (An official save converter for Crusader Kings II can push this date as far back as 867). The country pool you draw your selection from is vast, ranging from future world powers like England, Sweden, and France to Native American and Meso-American tribes like the Shawnee, the Cherokee, The Aztecs, and the Inca. Keep in mind that every country is not created equal; Western Countries have a much easier time as opposed to those with Eastern or Tribal cultures. Westernizing as a tribal group is always a must; you will be crushed otherwise.    In Europa Universalis IV, the world is your oyster. Your goals are yours to define; Emergent Gameplay is very much a key point of the game. Do you restore the Byzantine Empire from it's single holding of Constantinople? Do you attempt to conquer the new world as the Ottomans? Or do you follow the historical path of your country, such as colonizing the New World as Spain or Portugal? All of these scenarios are able to occur in the game, and feel immensely gratifying when completed.The Game plays like a charm, although I would recommend turning off Lucky Nations as they tend to skew the game in the AI's favour, with the game following the Earth's history a bit too closely. England, France, The Ottoman Empire, and Spain all usually end up becoming the defacto world powers with Lucky Nations set to historical. With Random Lucky Nations the game becomes a bit more interesting, but I would still say to turn this setting off.    The game also has a large learning curve, though the tutorial in the game helps you get the basics of the game down. The rest, however, is up to you to verse yourself in. You will lose. Often. But those often are not like those other strategy games such as Civilization. These losses teach you all kinds of interesting facets of the game. In no time you'll be ensuring the nation you're about to crush has no alliances with a more powerful Nation, or that they're currently weak thanks to fighting rebels that you spent some ducats to support.  Overall, I heartily recommend Europa Universalis IV.

												if you enjoy history or a good strategy game this is so great. play as any nation from 1444-1821 up until 1821 where the game ends no matter when you started. if you dont know much about history you will begin to learn so much and somehow itll be fun, when i first saw eu3 i thought it was going to not be fun at all... but expanding your nation--- your empire, striving to own all you can, beginning wars for all the land around you, give it 50 or 100 in game years and then scroll out and look at your empire, it will have expanded (i hope) and it will feel so good, looking at that peice of land you fought the damn annoying nosey austrians for, that small nation's land you diplomatically annexed through relations, marriages, alliances, then integration to grow you empire even more... its so wonderful that feelingjust put like... 24 hours of play time into the game and itll start to get alot more fun			"

												An Amazing game missing some of the key features which its predecessor had, but along with new game mechanics not having them seems only trivial. The new trade system allows players to engage in wars for trade and also enables dynamic fluctuations between profit. The new coalition and aggressive expansion system means that players have to be more careful and watch who they are angering. The coalition system allows players to stop nations who outgrow their respective borders, but can also be turned on the player if aggressive expansion gets too high with surrounding nations. These features make this the best installment in Paradox's Europa Universalis series, and i would highly recommend this to anyone new to paradox games or even seasoned vets of Europa Universalis.

												If you're reading this chances are that you have a bit of experience with games similar such as Civ5, Victoria2, or other Paradox games. Well, I never have played a strategy game in my life, so playing EU4 was a bit of a learning curve. You WON'T understand the game right off the bat. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you watch videos on YouTube, Google any questions, go on Reddit, the EU4 community is all about sharing what you can do in the game. There aren't *that* many channels devoted to EU4 but to name a few: Arumba, shennryyr2, BAStartGaming, DDRJake, and many more. Watching and doing is the best way to learn this game, so before you download this game, please check out videos on YouTube so you aren't entering the game blindly. There's no tutorial. YOU MUST SELF TEACH YOURSELF ON HOW TO PLAY!!!!			"

												I can say a lot of things about EUIV.  From a pure gameplay perspective, its very good, much more accessible then its predecessor that I've spent so long playing.  The revamped coring, culture changing, and technology systems using the new monarchy points system, while incredibly gamey, are much nicer from a practical point of view from its predecessor's ""wait a long time/throw lots of money in this vague direction"" systems.  Graphically, its much prettier, with the terrain view especially showing off just how gorgeous Pardox has been able to make their games nowadays.  Gameplay-wise, the game is easily a 10/10 in my book.My main problem with the game is that it basically doesn't really care about any country or culture that isn't from around the mediterranean.  Even then, if you aren't European or the Ottomans, you're pretty much out of luck unless you buy all the Muslim DLC!  Eastern Asia has the changes from the EU3:DW expansion, which is nice, but still is lacking in the depth that you find in Europe, and India suffers from this as well. I am glad Conquest of Paradise improved the Native Americans though, as before playing as them was essentially a test in patience, as nothing happened until the European invasion.  I do understand the game is ""Europa"" Universalis, set in the time where Europe historically dominated, but having some more filler for the non-European countries could only, in my opinion, improve the game.  But after 3 expansions with 2 1/2 of them focused on Europe, it leaves me kind of concerned.Overall though, the game is still really fun to play, and you can find yourself easily putting hours upon hours into each game.  The extensive modding support, characteristic to all Paradox games, also helps a lot in this regard.  And though it doesn't really meet the extreme rigors of my non-European playstyle, what it still has is great, and if your looking for a good strategy game, you can only really do better, in my opinion, with Paradox's other big hit, Crusader King II.P.S. if your looking for good mods, my personal favorite is Occultuis Orbis Terrestre, which adds all the legendary and forgotten lands explorers had thought existed at one point. Also, check out the main overhaul mods, Veritas et Fortudo and MEIOU and Taxes.			"

												EU4 is a complex game but an incredible amount of fun and reasonably accessible. You play as a historical nation from 1444 and its course through history is yours to take. It's essentially a geopolitics simulator. Ever wanted to re-enact the American Revolution? How about a British Empire 400 years early? Or what about going totally ahistorical and doing something like colonising Canada with the Tibetans? You can do it all. History buffs and 4X gamers, this is a great title and has everything you could ever want.			"

												     Europa Universalis IV is a Grand Strategy Game developed by Paradox Entertainment. The game allows you to take control of a country from the time period of 1444 until 1820 (An official save converter for Crusader Kings II can push this date as far back as 867). The country pool you draw your selection from is vast, ranging from future world powers like England, Sweden, and France to Native American and Meso-American tribes like the Shawnee, the Cherokee, The Aztecs, and the Inca. Keep in mind that every country is not created equal; Western Countries have a much easier time as opposed to those with Eastern or Tribal cultures. Westernizing as a tribal group is always a must; you will be crushed otherwise.    In Europa Universalis IV, the world is your oyster. Your goals are yours to define; Emergent Gameplay is very much a key point of the game. Do you restore the Byzantine Empire from it's single holding of Constantinople? Do you attempt to conquer the new world as the Ottomans? Or do you follow the historical path of your country, such as colonizing the New World as Spain or Portugal? All of these scenarios are able to occur in the game, and feel immensely gratifying when completed.The Game plays like a charm, although I would recommend turning off Lucky Nations as they tend to skew the game in the AI's favour, with the game following the Earth's history a bit too closely. England, France, The Ottoman Empire, and Spain all usually end up becoming the defacto world powers with Lucky Nations set to historical. With Random Lucky Nations the game becomes a bit more interesting, but I would still say to turn this setting off.    The game also has a large learning curve, though the tutorial in the game helps you get the basics of the game down. The rest, however, is up to you to verse yourself in. You will lose. Often. But those often are not like those other strategy games such as Civilization. These losses teach you all kinds of interesting facets of the game. In no time you'll be ensuring the nation you're about to crush has no alliances with a more powerful Nation, or that they're currently weak thanks to fighting rebels that you spent some ducats to support.  Overall, I heartily recommend Europa Universalis IV. Though it's hard to get a grasp on the genre, Grand Strategy Games never fail to provide an entertaining, thrilling ride throughout a possible alternate timeline.			"

												So, here is this little nice expensive game with like 15 DLCs each the worth of one individual game. When I got into Paradox Games and saw this, I got scared by the huge ammount of DLCs, but I decided to buy the Deluxe Edition-Whatever crap, and I got like 7 DLCs with that and other small packs. As usual, I skipped tutorials except the very first, and what a grave mistake I done. I get bored by tutorials, but holy ♥♥♥♥ing god, I'm currently at 400 hours and I am still learning the mechanics. Don't let their DLC policy scare you off, it's worth it so much. Awesome game, historically accurate, with tons of flavor and can be even very dynamic with mods. PROS	-Very good replayability due to a wide selection of nations to choose from.-A run-through can last for 50 hours, so you can enjoy this game for a couple of hours a day for about a month, without starting over.-A ton of historical flavor, especially with the DLCs.-Dynamic choices and events, letting you to customize your nation.-AMAZING modding community and Steam Workshop. The modders deserve all the appreciation possible for their further development of the game.-Cool multiplayer-Well-made diplomatic and espionage systems.-Various buildings, resources, powers, and development options. CONS -Specific nations are overpowered. Might be historic but gets annoying for Austria to have 25% more morale than a elite Roman Empir- I mean Papal State army.-AI tends to ally with small, puny states which can stay in your way of total conquest.-Expensive DLCs-Not sure if this a con, but colonization can get crazy and moments and natives tend to advance very well.-Non-western civs are slighty grindy to play as it's hard to advance in tech. My conclusion is that this is an awesome strategy game. A must have for grand-strategy lovers out there. If you are tired of the stupid TW and Civ diplomatic and cultural systems, this game is for you. It very beautifully made, and the world feels very large, so your total conquest will take you some time. Also there are a lot of mods out there to make the game even better than it is already, some awesome examples would be Beyond Typus and The Idea Variaton.Blue French Blob forever.			"

												With a large range of nations to play and a complex diplomatic system, EU IV manages to live up to it's previous title, EU III. The map is much more detailed now and the trade system is much more robust than in the previous game, even offering you a visual representation of the trade routes and trade areas.Thge religion system is also improved. For example, playing as a catholic nation, you can vote bishops by using your religious influence on the Papacy and the bishop may even become the Pope. The military system is also improved a slightly more detailed. It offeres a much easier to manage system wehre you can easily split your troops, move them or even recruit. There are also more types of rebels and even flags to represent them. They are much more powerful in comparison to EU III and if you're not careful they can really screw over your nation.The player has more control over colonization and how it works making you feel more in control of your empire. You can send colonists to a specific place (depending on your technologies) and you can either try to work together with the natives or send down an army and slaughter them all.The technology 'trees' have more to them now in comparison to the previous title and uses a point system to unlock different technology types. The point system is where the game unfortunatly the game fails. It offers three types of points, Administrative, Diplomatic and Military. All these are harnessed over time but the speed they are harrnesed at depend on your monarch and the advisors you have. With these points you can unlock new technologies, reduce your over-expansion, increase stability,decrease inflation and etc. This system makes the game feel way too arcadish, and you'll find yourself finding all sorts of ways to aquire these points but they make no sense realistically. the Europa Universalis series was very popular for it's somewhat realistic approach to things, making it more of a historical sandbox simulator rather than a Star Craft like RTS except on a huge map, trade and diplomacy. It is also far less challenging to achieve certain things in the game like form a commonwealth or a nation (but that's not always true, some are still fairly challenging).All in all it is still an enjoyable game and it's even more enjoyable if you're playing it with the MEIOU and Taxes mod which offers a much more robust religious system, more historicaly accurate map, general rebalances and much more.

												First of all, let me say that I've been playing the hell out of this game since version 2.  I had pre-ordered version 4, but didn't get time to really play it in depth until recently.  Despite some of the critcism that follows, I've never regretted a cent that I spent on this software.EU stands tall in the pantheon of strategy games.  It is both a world building game (cousin to civilization, Master of Magic) and an historical game (operational war games, Harpoon, etc.)  It has enormous depth and historical accuracy.  The developers have done a great deal to expose all of the game's variables to tinkering : diplomacy, military, espionage, economics.  It invites, no, insists on micromanagement.  EU is not one of those games you knock out in an hour or so.  A completed game demands many hours over the course of days.  I play solo.  I'm not a social wargamer.  When I do play socially, it's generally on a tabletop at my local hobby store facing a real opponent.  So my first criticism has to do with the A.I. opponent.  The AI in this game has gone from challenging to brutal to (in v.4) psycho.  An historical game like this one, should include both a sandbox mode and an easy mode.  EU has an 'easy' setting ... it's the only one I've ever played and the AI on the 'easy' setting is, I say again, psycho.  One slip up, or sometimes no slip ups and all of a sudden, with little or no warning, twenty heavyweight high-tech countries gang up on you and destroy the country to worked so hard to build.  This has been a weakness in the game from the very beginning.Next concerns a couple of specific rule changes in v.4.  Version 4, overall, seems to favor historical accuracy over historical variation, to the point ot shoving the player into an historical box.  In version 3, I was able to colonize the New World with both Venice and Naples.  Version 4 makes that difficult if not impossible.  Even if you manage to get troops across the Atlantic and seize a native province, you can't core it, and thus, yoiu can't create an overseas empire.  Also, the idea of 'rivals', along with a penalty for not picking them is another example.  It narrows, not expands the player's choice of diplomatic strategies.If you've never played this game, and you're reading this review, don't let the above critcisms put you off.  If you like this sort of game, EU IV is a great choice.  It will give you many hours of challenge and enjoyment.  The game plays well with Windows (try pausing, then ctrl-esc).  It also has a robust API that many users have used to create interesting variations.			"

												If you like strategy games and history before WWII or heck even before the Victorian Era between 1444-1821, this game will fill that desire. If you like to bring countries like Austria, England, and France to their historical glory, you can. If you want to change the face of history like Ireland and Scotland conquering England or being able to dismantle the HRE before Napoleon in 1806, you can. If you want to create the massive trade and colonial empire a minor country like Portugal or the Netherlands tried to do, you can. If you even want to take part as a non-western tech country and manage to survive their conquering onslaught and in turn invade mainland Europe.... Europa Universalis IV can help you do all of this.			"

Europa Universalis IV (V. 1.12.2.0)Europa Universalis IV is a historical simulation / grand strategy game developed by Paradox Interactive. First released almost two years ago back in August 2013, the game continues to receive regular updates and instalments in the form of DLCs, the most recent of which - Common Sense - was released in June 2015. Starting in the year 1444 and ending in 1821, the game gives you the chance to rule any nation in the world during the era of Colonisation, when the nations of Europe explored the world in search of new land and riches. This review will focus predominantly on Gameplay due to how important it is to the game, but because of the word limit I will not be able to cover everything.GameplayIn the game, you are given control of any country you choose throughout the world, in any time period between 1444-1821. Being a grand strategy, there are a lot of things to focus on. One of the most central features of Europa Universalis IV is technology, which you must upgrade throughout the course of the game by generating and spending points (commonly referred to as monarch points), which are gained each month in-game and are split into three areas: Administration, Diplomacy and Military. Points are generated based on the skills of your leader and your leaders advisors, who cost gold (in-game ducats) to employ, but along with generating points can also give other bonus modifiers to your nation. You are given the ability to focus on a specific area if you deem it necessary, at the cost of losing points in the other categories. Technology is split into the same three categories as the points, and have up to thirty-two levels. As you progress, being ahead in technology gives you bonuses over other nations in the game, at the cost of the next technology level costing more because you're ahead of time. Being ahead in technology, as well as other things, contributes towards your Game Score, which merely gives you a ranking to see how well you're performing in comparison to other nations. Where you start geographically in the game decides your nation's technology group, of which there are a few. The further away you move from Europe, upgrading your technology costs more monarch points, which means it takes longer. As a balance however, the lower your technology group, the more monarch points you can generate and store. When playing as a non-Western nation, you have the ability to 'Westernize' once you border a Western nation, on the condition that you're behind on at least seven levels of technology. After reaching the fifth level of Administrative Technology, you can unlock an Idea Group in one of the three main areas of Administration, Diplomacy and Military, which you can progress along by spending monarch points. Every nation in the game starts out with National Ideas, which give extra bonus modifiers to your nation and can be unlocked through completing ideas in Idea Groups. Once Idea Groups are completed, some can be paired together to set National Policies, which can give you extra bonus modifiers at the cost of a single monarch point in that policy's key area (e.g. an Administrative policy costs you one Administrative point monthly in-game to maintain).There are many other things you will have to spend your monarch points on, so spend them wisely. There are other points which you will have to focus on: Stability, Prestige and Legitimacy and Power Projection. Stability is the overall strength of your nation, and if it is positive, that will give bonuses to your nation. If it is in the negative, it will give penalties. Prestige is how noteworthy you are, and has the same impact as Stability. Legitimacy is the strength of your ruler; the less Legitimacy your ruler has, the less authority they have. Power Projection is how imposing you are towards other nations, and this depends on how active you are against your nation’s Rivals, which you can choose throughout the game. Alongside all of this, you will have the help of various invisible individuals who you can send around on various tasks. You will have Diplomats who you use to improve relations and form alliances, or even fabricate claims and declare war on nations. You will have Merchants which you use to steer trade and collect trade from various nodes, and Missionaries to help convert land. A key feature of the game can be utilised through Colonists, who – once unlocked – can be sent to colonise regions like the Americas and Africa. Finally, you must build your armies independently (based on Infantry, Cavalry and later Cannons) and hire generals to lead them. Navies are also built independently, with various units built for specific purposes. Provinces can be improved with various buildings that grant bonuses, and the more Development a province has the more buildings you can build in them. Random events will occur from time to time, which can either have positive or negative effects depending on what decision you pick. Considering all of this – and other aspects I haven’t even covered – I’d recommend that players take a good long while to explore the mechanics of the game before becoming too ambitious in their aims, particularly as the User Interface does have a few hidden yet incredibly important pieces of information players should keep an eye on.Graphics and SoundThe world map is displayed beautifully, and features many useful and varying map modes to give you all the information you might need to digest from just a quick glance. Decorated with beautiful terrain and sprites, it’s easy to spend hours just surveying the map without any in-game time actually passing. The soundtrack is also quite enjoyable to listen to, and in Paradox’s usual style of thinking outside of the box, the addition of heavy metal music to the soundtrack makes playing the game even more enjoyable, if not just for the music itself. Three Pros and ConsPros:+ Perfect for fans of history, and a must have grand strategy for any armchair general or wannabe dictator. + Every game is unique, so you can play again and again with many different outcomes. + Workshop-supported; community content gives the game even more replay value.Cons:- Hard learning curve; in-built game tutorial is severely lacking. - The User Interface can be incredibly overwhelming at first, and a lot of crucial numbers and modifiers are hidden in the tool tips with no obvious pointers as to where they are. - Certain features depend on whether the player owns a particular DLC, which narrows down the possibilities with the base game.ConclusionEuropa Univeralis IV is the physical definition of Grand Strategy; limitless possibilities await you as you lead your chosen nation to a glorious future. Whether you follow history or change it is up to you, and the goals of the game are your own. A definite must-have, the game will have you hooked for hours and is a momentous challenge, but I can guarantee you that it will not be a waste of time.Nominated for a Steam Award 2016			"

Absolutely.Is the game without the DLC good? No. The game is unfair to the player if he doesn't buy the dlc, because the player is crippled.Ex: You cannot devellop your provinces without one DLC, you cannot command your allies without another DLC, and the latest one just destroyed the technology system.Plenty of fanboys defend this DLC practise because they don't care.

I expect them to be in my ♥♥♥♥ing game! Because without them i can't play naturally! The AI is braindead, my allies don't help me, but they get a ♥♥♥♥ ton of bonuses because Paradox can't programm a good AI, instead they sell you a game piece by piece.Btw the developers are keen on the political correctness thing, make a sarcastic joke on the comunity and get temp banned for ""racism"". ♥♥♥♥ing idiots.

												This game is essentially a simpler version of Crusader Kings or a more complicated version of Civ. It ends up playing a lot more like Crusader Kings than I had imagined. It just doesn't have all of the people and duchies and the like to deal with.The map is great and being able to play with a preposterously large number of nations is very appealing. I like the missions that one can choose that are tied to one's nation as the flavor text makes them feel more historical.The interface is bad. Epically bad, as with Crusader Kings. When you have a base game and then tack on a bunch of extra features made by different people, it clearly shows. Even playing through the tutorial and having played both Crusader Kings and Stellaris before, it was difficult to get around.Recommended if you're really into historical strategy. Not a good choice for a quick, casual playthrough.			"

												For the record, I love this game. It's everything one could ever want in a historical grand strategy game, and it's obvious how much work went into creating the amazing experience that this is. However, I cannot even play it anymore. With the DLC policy put in place by paradox, this game is borderline unplayable if you dont drop $200 on DLC after already purchasing the game. This is unacceptable. I loved EU4, but every DLC release further skewed the game balance against me, having not paid for the newest content. Simple and easy features that should have been in the game at the very beginning are locked behind a paywall, and it's ridiculous. This puts me in a quandary. I really like the kind of games that paradox creates, and I want to support them as developers, but I cannot reccoment spending over $200 on this.			"

												This is an amazing strategy, it has ~400 year time span in game(irl over 5 hours depanding on how many times you pause the in-game clock), and you can play as any state between 1444-1821. This game is a few years old and that may mean to other games quaulity is declining, but with this game upadates are regular, but currently the $15-$20 dlc policy will cost you $120 extra, unless you buy them on while on sale, which will make the ~$48(at least for me), but just the base game is good enough(the updates usually inclued free content in the base game).

												Nearly 1200 hours in this game and I cannot recommend it. Ultimately I (probably) got a positive return on my time investment in terms of hours, but I can't say how many of those hours in this game were entertaining. It's odd to think that - so many DLC and patches into EU IV's lifecycle - I think the game was better earlier. The fundamental problem is the DLC, and I'm not talking about the pricing. Please allow me to explain:Each DLC adds new mechanics to the games. Everything from new vassal interactions to ""estates"" which you can ""interact"" with (i.e. click a few buttons) that attempt to add some flavor to the internal management of your chosen nation (an aspect of the game which is decidely weak). You might be seeing the problem already. If each DLC adds a new ""feature de jure"" but Paradox can never be certain who has what DLC and what combination of paid addons they may be playing, each DLC is essentialy its own little island.The game has become a monstrous patchwork. An inelegant frankenstein of DLC features that were sold for prime in their day and are rarely touched again. The game stops looking like a cohesive whole and instead appears more as a checklist of which features you've bought and paid for and those you have yet to purchase.It's a shame, really. However, just like with so many things in life, simplicity does not necessarily mean spartan, brevity is not always pithy. EU IV exchanges holistic gameplay structures for something cobbled together out of some very expensive bricks.			"

												Now, it took me a while to get into EUIV, as I had been a massive fan of the 3rd instalment of the series.  After over 2000 hours of creating Byzantine Australia, Austrian Africa ect.ect. playing EUIV was difficult.  So much had changed since the days of Divine Wind.  No more policy sliders, more confusing (now much simpler after getting used to it) trade, more historical constraints and no ""minting"".  However...EUIV is by far, a fantastic game.  Many of the problems EUIII had have been fixed, such as a better way of forming personal unions.  Yes, it isn't as easy to destroy the Ottamans with the remenants of the Roman Empire like in EUIII, but by the pentriach it is much more satisfying for being so.  Every nation feels a little more unique due to ideas and the game flows beautifully.  Even colonization doesn't feel as much as a hassle, though changing religions is a pain in my imperial breeches.  To any EUIII fans that have not played IV yet, get it.  Because while its so different, its a wonderful different and after a while, you don't want to go back.   To newcomers to the series I say several things.1) You will never stop thinking about this game once you start playing.  Strategies will come into your head even when your not playing it.2) This is nothing like Civ.  You won't get anywhere by comparing the two, except for realising you would have more spare time if you played Civ.  A civ game is a few seconds long compared to this.3) You will most likely live the rest of your life alone due to points 1 and 2 and only just remember to feed yourself.  So good luck and have fun!10/10, can't wait for the new expansion.			"

												Now it's time to update this review since the bad start this game had in my eyes. I remember how easy it was to convert cultures in provinces, but this have now been fixed and seperatism and religion must be right to be able to convert. I thank Paradox deeply for that. I also thank them for finally upating the borders of some countries, especially Finland and Ireland. I still think coring could be a bit more challenging but then the questions arise how to make it challeing without making it too annoying.			"

												Yes, EU 4 is a great and fun game, but come on! How many DLCs can paradox squeeze out of one game that we already pay £35 for? Overall, this game is going to cost well over £60 to actually play their ""finished"" version of the game. That said, if you have a ton of spare cash to throw at some Swedish devs, go ahead, it's still a fun game.			"

												I have tried very hard to like this game, and I have played it for quite a considerable amount of time in both a singleplayer and multiplayer capacity. I just can't like this game, it is objectively bad in almost all criteria.Some say all the additions made to it since it first came out have been a good thing, however, in my mind overall it has left the game a bloated mess with far too many small features and systems with nothing coherent to hold all of it together. Victoria 2 has a pop system underlying everything, Hearts of Iron has its military system as the basis for the whole game and Crusader Kings' main feature is the dynasty system. They all have a clear direction. Ask yourself what EU4's main fundamental core is and you are left wondering.Those other 3 Paradox games I mentioned all feel like you are actually living through a period in history, and you can at least feel like you are playing something meaningful, but EU4 has nothing that brings it to life. It's just an assortment of loosely connected numbers over an extremely ugly-looking playdough map that not even visual mods can fix. For example, when an estate gets too much influence, it does not conjure historical ideas or images of the nobility of your realm having too much of a say in your nation's affairs: it's just an arbitrary number that needs to be below 80 or else bad things happen.The military system is pathetic; as much as there appears to be a lot of nuances; in the end it completely boils down to rolling dice. Not only is the combat itself purely luck-based, the quality of the generals who lead your forces is also random. The fort system is a complete disaster. The idea of army movement being hindered by forts is alright, but the provinces on the map are far too big for it to work properly. Your army can somehow be totally blocked from moving by a fortress which in geographical terms is hundreds of miles away.The only enjoyable thing about it is the brief gratification of blobbing your empire. You might as well take a blank map of the world on MS Paint and start painting it with your favourite colour, rather than spending an arm and a leg to buy EU4 and all its endless DLC. Hordes of /r/paradoxplaza zombies who are normally ardent socialists will unironically defend Paradox's breathtaking greed when it comes to downloadable content, which would make even Donald Trump raise an eyebrow.

												As much as I like this game, I find it IMPOSSIBLE to recommend. It's laggy, unstable AND IT LIES TO YOU! It is very difficult to know what will cost points in a piece deal, and how many ships you need for a blockade, and how many ducats you're making per month and how many UI elements are wrong and how much math is broken which just makes it confusing ESPECIALLY for a new player.And also *DLC*. LOTS of dlc. I just wish paradox would release a ""fixed all the lag"" dlc or a ""fixed the AI"" dlc or a ""less paradox math"" dlc. To put plainly, paradox isn't making it hard to complain.			"

												Too much DLC. Way too much DLC. Even with a 75% off sale and excluding stupid ♥♥♥♥ like the ebooks, this game is near $60 dollars. Moreover, the DLC is constantly changing the gameplay in ways you might not like (2014 EU4=/2016 EU4). Don't buy the DLC? Have fun playing a stripped down version balanced around that DLC but with all the new features disabled. That's not even including the new bugs introduced (some DLC releases have made my game unplayable for weeks). Enough is enough Paradox, I had fun but I think it's time I got off this crazy train of yours. I hope you're happy with all the money you made off of me.			"

												I have been told multiple times by my friend to buy this fantastic real time strategy game. I took me some time until I was convinced to spend my money on this game, because I was waiting on a sale (This game is totally worth buying full price, however it is frequently on sale).First impressions:I was fortunate enough to have someone experienced, to teach me the game mechanics, because Europa Universalis 4 is very complex games, that requires a lot of time and effort to learn. Personally, it took me around 30 to 50 hours of multiple playthroughs with different countries to completely understand the basics. However now with over 120 hours of having played this game (as of writing this review) I really understand what I am doing.Singleplayer:Personally, I wouldn’t recommend playing singleplayer at first to someone who is new to the game. Look for someone experienced who can teach you the basics first. If you know what you are doing, singleplayer is a great way to relax or if you want a challenge you can start a game in ironman mode. Ironman mode is an optional gameplay feature that restricts control over the saved game, disallowing the player from correcting mistakes and changing decisions made during the course of play. So basically if you screw up you cannot reload a save file.Multiplayer:I find multiplayer the best way to experience the game. Concurring the world with your friends, creating colonial empires, handicapping yourself for example to defeat Europa as an underdeveloped tribe together and many other things, give the game a huge variety.  The game can change form slow pace gameplay, like building an infrastructure to intense battles to defend or conquer land, in an instant. Every new playthrough with your friends, even with the same countries, feels like a new adventure.I personally think playing against real players is the greatest way to enjoy this game. Even though the AI is smart and is being improved constantly it can sometimes be predictable and okaying against Randoms or friends will give you the best experience.Are there any negative aspects to this game?Yes, there are some negative aspects to this game. Some are minor like the steep learning curve and some are rather negative, like needing all the DLCs to fully experience the game and if you really want to get the game with all the DLCs, you will spend easily more than 80€ (As I already said the game and the DLCs are frequently on sale, which cuts the total price more that 60% to around 40€). If you play alone without most of the DLCs the game feels like it is missing some key features. However, this can easily be bypassed if one of your friends already owns the DLCs, because if you play with your friends a multiplayer session and the host owns the DLCs, everyone connected can experience the additional features of the DLCs without paying. That’s a great move by paradox studios.Summary: So, should I buy this game?You defiantly should buy it. I have rarely found strategy games, that had me addicted, saying multiple times a day to myself: “Come on, 5 more minutes are ok! You can go to sleep then”. The complexity of this game is what makes this game so great and addictive to play. Even though the price is expensive, EU4 is frequently on sale cutting its price by around 50-75%. Furthermore, for the beginners I strongly suggest watch tutorials that explain the basics so you don’t feel lost at the beginning. If you are not willing to invest time in learning this is not a game for you.Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy Europa Universalis 4.This was my first review if you have anything to say, that I can improve for my next review pls do tell me.

												Europa Universalis Has quite the learning curve, but after 50 hours of play you should throughly enjoy the game if you are at all interested in grand strategy,(you thought total war was good? check this game out.) and the late medival era all the way to 1812. It has many scripted events early in the game to give you the real historical feeling which stretches all the way into the late game. Although sometimes Ahistorical events happen as well as some historical events not happening on occasion which I really like because it makes every playthrough different. sometimes I start a game and I see austria fall under a union with france and other similar events happening which always make a new game interesting. Especially later in the game when it starts to really deviate from history. I feel that this game is fair in that the large nations are extremely powerful and can sometimes cause havoc throughout the world like the ottomans and france can so often do, but it is always possible no matter your size if you play smart enough to get the right alliances use the right tactics and take the right idea groups to fight back against these powers and see your little one provence minor in germany cover half of europe by 1812. All in all this is a great game with a medium-small learning curve to become decent at the game, but has tons of room for improvement untill you become truely great at the game.I will also like to note that with the new DLC soon coming out that looks amazing and I love the fact that paradox keeps this game alive by constantly pushing out updates and DLC. Now I understand that people are upset with having to buy so much DLC, but the DLC they put out truely adds much more to the game, and its not like the BS DLC you see in other games where they release the game and have DLC at the beginning for ""extra"" stuff that was already developed before the release. The DLC they make in this game is new stuff, new ideas as this game is a living game and is constantly having more and more add ons and that is one thing I really love about this game, and why I have the most hours on this game than any other game.Oh and the hundreds of mods that give so much more shelf life to the game.

												I enjoy this game alot and I really do recommend it:This game has given me alot of playtime and will most likely give me many more hours of enjoyment to come.  It can be hard to get into Europa at first due to the games overwhelming amount of knowledge (in comparison to the Civilization series) that has to be learned but it is a game that is definitely worth a try if you like other grand strategys as it offers great challenges, satisfaction and replayability.For the amount of time I've spent on this game, the money spent on it has definitely been worth it.(Only consider below if you enjoy the game)Do you need the dlc for Europa Universalis 4?In my opinion, yes and no. The only essential dlc's are ""Art of War"" and ""Common sense"", the rest are more focused on regions of nations.			"

												tl;dr: Great game, lots of detail and depth, people attacking DLC policy ignore the fact that the base game is perfectly fine on its own and purchasers are not being cheated.Dear Reader,Please take the reviews bashing Paradox for their DLC policy with a grain of salt. Paradox is not cheating buyers, nor have they cut up the game and sold it in pieces, or in any way ""forced"" players to buy it. The game was released in 2013, and since then has seen a constant stream of updates, patches and improvements. Many of the new features and all of the patches are free. While I concede that the game has a great deal of DLC and many of them are overpriced (when not on sale, at least), Paradox has continually improved the game even for people who don't buy the DLC. I reccomend trying the vanilla game and getting the most critical DLC (Art of War, Common Sense, Cossacks, Rights of Man) on sale if you like what you've seen. While some of the features of the DLC are extremely useful, the game is not broken without them, and they are not necessary to play.On to the game itself:Europa Universalis IV is an amazingly detailed grand strategy game, and one of the best games I have ever played. Its diplomacy, warfare and economics are incredibly detailed and diverse. Variations in country attributes, religions, geography and government give the game near-infinite replayability (for me at least), and the ability to customize your nation and choose it's path means you can create anything from a globe-spanning colonial trade republic to a strictly authoritarian monarchy with an unbeatable military. I strongly reccomend the game to anyone with the slightest interest in strategy.The devs are friendly, communicative and take player feedback. Nearly all issues that players bring up are dealt with, and devs are active in conversations on the Paradox Forums. The community is also friendly and reasonably large. Multiplayer games are common and the subreddit and forums can usually answer any questions you have. Just watch out for the memes.While the price tag can be imposing, the game regularly goes 75% off. DLC can also be found regularly for 75% or 66% off.Just to let everyone know what they are getting in to: when I say this game has depth, I mean DEPTH. While this is great for creating intrest, realism and replay value, it also means the game can be complicated and confusing to start. This is NOT a game where you can click around and easily figure things out for yourself; I would reccomend any starting player to find a friend who already knows the game to explain it to you. Starting will probably require an hour-long explanation that will leave your head spinning, but after you get started, the game provides hundreds of hours of challenges and fun. If none of your friends own the game, there are many guides to try to help you get started or understand a certain country, and as mentioned before, the community is large and happy to answer any questions. Just search for the EUIV subreddit or the Paradox Forums.Happy Conquering, Everyone!			"

												This game is fun. Start out small.Conquer some countries. Get rich. Get a gigantic coalition against you.Lose game.Repeat.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~For all of the people swayed by the amount of DLC in the game that you can buy, note that you do not have to buy it in order to enjoy this game. For about a good 300 hours I played this game with no DLC and only then I bought 1 after. The DLC enhances and further immerses you into the game. The game is complex, and has a huge depth. Even after 1K hours, I still don't know how to  conquer the world yet lol. This game will make you frustrated, angry, sad, happy, and narcissistic. I definitely reccomend this game to those who like grand strategy, conquering, and those who are into history.			"

												It took a while to get used to the game's complexity, but once I did, it was simply fantastic. The trade and reformation mechanics are very well made and add a level of depth that most other games wouldn't simulate, one of my few complaints is that eastern religions aren't great and as the Ming empire, which i have played rather succesfully as, you are almost completely guarrenteed to collapse in on yourself while the real Ming didn't just bleed out nations but instead got replace by the Qing. Also the graphics are very good, the game is well optimized and only at max speed, which is know to be laggy anyway, is the only time I ever get lag in the game. Hats off to paradox once again for making such a fantastic game again!			"

												Love, love, love this game. I've always loved games where you can conquer the world, Civ 5 being one of my favorites, but it also felt too simplified for me. But then I found this game, and it is wonderful. EU 4 is easily the closest to real life Conquest Simulation game I've played. And its difficult. This is not an easy game, by any means. There is a TON of stuff going on and many smaller things people don't realize they need. For example you can't just declare war whenever you want (not without a huge penalty anyways) if you want to conquer lands you first need to fabricate a claim on the lands. I would recommend that if you are coming from Civ 5 or something similar you should watch some YouTubers play the game first to get a handle on what you are expected to do, that really helped me. The game is of course not without issues, and I'll give a list of pros and cons below.Pros~ Realistic~ History is of your choosing (You want to conquer the British Isles as Scotland, you can do that. You want Norway to be the first to have colonies in Africa, you can do that, etc...)~ Challenging  ~ Tons of Mods (Basically if its not in Vanilla there is a pretty good chance its a mod)Cons~ World always starts out the same, and usually follows a similar path every time.  ~ All the DLC (I mean $150 for all the DLC, really?)~ Massive Learning Curve (Don't expect to pick up this game and have an empire spanning China to France as you could in Civ 5. At the same time don't give up if you lose a couple wars and lose a good chunk of your empire, its still possible to come back)~ Play throughs feel the same (Due to how the game sets you up, every play-through ends up feeling pretty similar, especially in the beginning. Picking a different nation to start with can change this but you can pretty much predict the first 50 years or so) Edit:So after playing several more games, and playing different countries with different goals, I can say that the same is not as ""samey"" as it initially felt it to be. Usually each game starts out with similar Alliances and stuff, but after maybe the first 5 years things can get pretty crazy.			"

												Europa Universalis IV is grand strategy at its best. It is epic in scale and depth, with literally an entire world to explore over three of the most dynamic centuries in history. It manages to create a completely believable world that pays homage to the forces that have shaped history while simultaneously giving you the opportunity and tools to reshape it in anyway you please. The sheer number of features and mechanics at work can be a bit overwhelming. The interface certainly takes some getting used to as you are inundated with bewildering amounts of information. However, as you gradually learn to master these features and mechanics, you crave every bit of scrumptious data as your actions both affact and are dictated by then. This is a refreshing stand against the plethora of games that continously dumb down in order to appeal to mass audiences. The real weakness in this game is suggested in the name. While the European playthroughs are as fleshed out and fun as you would expect, those in other regions of the world are noticeably less so. Certainly, the developer is slowly working to address this problem. Through patches and expansions, places like East Asia and the Americas will become more fully developed with more nations and features. Still, the general focus on Europe hurts the otherwise immersive game experience. Completely recomended for strategy gamers, cartophiles, and lovers of history. 9/10			"

												This game is like a historical playground. Let's put it like this. Say I play as a country no where close to Europe such as the Iroquois. I peacefully dominate my neighbors and await European nations to come so I can advance my technology off of them. After years and years of waiting I finally reform my government and catch up in technology significantly. And so finally a European nation throws a colony in my sightlines and I am excited! The border shows it as yellow so surely it is Spain/Castile. It was quite strange but these things do happen so I shrug it off. I await the reveal when I am thrown into disarray! Why is Scotland colonizing Canada and not England? After anxious waiting the maps of Europe are finally revealed to me. Russia has been overrun by China. Scotland has almost fully annexed England and is now eyeing Ireland next. Spain is no longer spain but now a part of Italy. Italy was actually formed! Why? How? Oh. France was eaten by Burgundy, Austria, and Portugal. Without France's intervention in Italy the nation was actually formed which never happens ever. Ever ever. And so new maps are given to me and I discover most of the continest of Africa and half of Asia. And what I see is a sand colored outline across the shores of Africa. It is the Mamluks! And they have achieved the same goal I have been earnestly awaiting for so long. They have westernized and have now vasslized the Ottomans. Looking further west I see one thing that is normal. A formed Hindustan in India. What is not normal is that upon closer inspection the nation was formed by none other than the mountain nation of Nepal. A nation that starts with two poor provinces and surrounded by dangerous foes. Among the other strange things that happen in the game were the Italian colonies of Brazil Australia and the Carribbean, the formation of Scandinavia (peacefully, which never happens yet again),  Malaya aka Indonesia being formed by some miracle. Byzantium still alive. Russia being small. And then Scotland declares war on France mid-game and then wins. All in all I lost that game to the superior forces of the Italy and Scotland. Combined their forces were something not expected. At all.10/10			"

												Has a tough learning curve that takes time to overcome. I would recommend watching a 'Let's Play' series to get an idea of how the game works. Jumping in blind can be intimidating and frustrating, so just spend a little time getting a basic idea of what's in store. Stick with it and you will be rewarded with one of the greatest grand strategy games released.Absolutely would recommend this game to anyone who loves strategy. Very few games can offer unique playthroughs with this level of planning and strategy involved. If you play the length of the game, it really has a great sense of growth, development, and progress as you take on challenged and achieve goals. 150+ hrs into this game and I still find new ways to improve from my last playthrough. Only BAD thing is some of the expansions are, essentially, required to play the ""full game"" at this point. Fortunately, they are priced fairly and after a few games you'll want them anyways. :)10/10			"

Since it's time consuming and requires you to pay a fair amount of attention, it helps take your mind off of what is keeping you down in the dumps. Sometimes you can sort play it absent-mindedly and just indulge yourself in some decent music or a deep conversation without losing all your focus on the game.It's not a mind-blowingly awesome or hugely-rewarding game, but it's like the best to kill time with.

												If you enjoy grand strategy games, then this is a solid purchase.  Instead of dealing with more personal characters like in Crusader Kings II.  You are dealing with states and countries.  As all Paradox games are.  It is a little daunting at first.  Expect to get crushed in an instant if you're not sure what you doing.  But each time you fail, you'll learn what to not do for next time.  The only problem is a continuing one from the developers.  Lots of DLC that is rather expensive, i've found they do add to the game and are good assets to the base game.  But...  Don't pay full price for them.  They come on sale regularly enough, so just hold your horses (and your cash) and get them at a reduced rate.			"

												This game might be hard to learn at first but if you like Grand Strategy and the conquest and mass genocide of other nations, this game is for you. If you learn how to play this game it is really fun to be able to randomly declare war on world superpowers and devastate their country. I remember one time I took over all of Scandinavia and parts of Europe with Denmark, or the time I landed Spanish troops on English shores and brought absolute chaos to their country. Good times.

												I always say that this is one of my favorite games of all time. The combination of history, warfare, politics, and economy bring alive the era of 1444-1821. If you read this and feel overwhelmed do not be worried. It took me a week to fully understand the game and that experience of learning on its own is the most rewarding. Once you understand the game you can challenge history by taking on various achievements that are challenging and very fun. The game is being updated constantly and if you do not like something in the base game or need a new world to play in the modding for EU4 is immense. I will always recommend EU4 to all my friends, it is something that Paradox Interactive should (and is) proud of. If you are still on the fence then here is some gameplay to help you understand the game better before purchase:

(AI don't cheat, i myself keep saying ""F this ai, it cheats"" but when you read up more on ideas and other things you see that your ideas or teach is outdated)I love Europa 4 and recommend it to all grand strat players.if you need help to learn to play there over 600videos on youtube of 12 year olds that will teach you the game but Quill18 (somthing to that name) don't give a very 'helpful' guide because he goes into to much depth to early and it turned me right off.

												This game has literally eaten up all my free time for the last 1,5 years. Yes, 1,5 years. I am well over 1300 hours at this point. If you like taking over the world either through conquest, subjugation or trade dominance then this is probably for you. If you are a fan of Total War, but more interested in the campaign map than the battles (like me) then this is your perfect match.You can play as ANY nation on the map. Want to take over the world as Timbuktu? No problem... sorta!While the game does have a steep learning curve, there are many entertaining videos on Youtube that you can learn from surprisingly fast. The in-depth strategy of this game is what gives it appeal to me. Don't forget your casus belli!			"

 Europa Universalis IV The Sequel to the critcally acclaimed Europa Universalis III did not disappoint.  With a variety of a new features mounted on a brand new Clausewitz 2.0 engine the game is much more smoother and less clunkier in most aspects, having streamlined alot of the chores into a simple click of a button. Detaching for a siege,Patrolling,rebel supression etc is just a click of a button away as compared to EU3 where you had to manually detach men for a siege for example.As the name might suggest,the scale is colossal spanning 7 conintents and 5 oceans (barring Antartica) the world is your playground. There is no clearly defined objective or motive , it is all up to you ,the player. Playing as England you can try to beat france in the hundred years war and rewrite history. If your a fan of the Romans, you can try to restore the roman empire. Take the balkans back from the ottomans and push them out of asia minor,maybe expand into western europe and reconquer the city of Rome. You can even explore a randomized new world with the Conquest of Paradise Expansion. The possibilities are endless.However,as with any games,there are definitely bugs and flaws. The Protectecrate System as of now is essentially useless,they do not fight in battles and only give you trade power. Your Protectecrates system to benefit more off you than you do off them. Colonial Nations are abit buggy as well,other colonial nations can declalre war on your colonial nation without even calling you to arms, so if for example a 20 province colony of portugal declares war on a 5 province colony of yours,you can not do anything except watch them eat your colony up unless miracously they win that war.There are still many more bugs which i have not pointed out. but you get the ideaThat being said though Europa Universalis 4 is still definitely worth getting , it's replayability value is practically endless and if you have Crusader Kings 2 and the CK2 to EUIV converter , you can start a game in CK2 and Continue all the way to the end of EU4 and maybe even Victoria If there is a converter.9/10 Rating "

Ironman mode is nerve wracking, making it all the more profound and gut wrenching when your fledgling empire begins to crumble. Best played with friends that have waaaay too much time on their hands as a full length game can take over twelve hours easy. Expand desperately as spain, be a military power as france, struggle within the holy roman empire, try to survive the encroaching ottomans or form and create mother russia! This game has something for just about everyone. Expansions add some new gameplay possibilities for starting countries. This game isn't for your quick fix, it's a long term addiction to make the world bow before your prowress!			"

												Absolute Grand Strategy Gem. More than thousand hours spent playing in Multiplayer and i keep on going. Love the fact it's been released a long time ago, yet they keep on adding new stuff, mechanics etc. If you're new to the game, i heartly reccomend going for Complete edition with all DLCs or you'd be missing on lot of fun. I personally see Paradox DLC strategy as good way to keep this awesome game going. It's lot cheaper than playing some MMO for example and with every DLC you also get completely free expansion.Also important to note that if you play this with friend / friends (which is btw the best way to go) only ONE of you (Host) needs the DLCs, so in the end it's not that costy. Also you can always bring someone ""aboard"" with only basic EU4 that is sometimes on sale for almost nothing and by hosting they get access to everything you purchased earlier. Don't know of any other game that does this. Over and all - This is the BEST Historical Grand Strategy game i've ever played. If you want different era, please see other Paradox products (Hearts of Iron, Stellaris).			"

												Calling Europa Universalis IV only as a grand strategy game won't do justice to it. Rather, it is also a history simulator.In your usual strategy game franchises like Civilization and Age of Empires, you start equally from zero: a first city, a few citizens / worker, no significant military power, no obvious technological advantages, and sometimes randomized map. Things are quite different in EUIV, since it's really asymmetric. Big nations like Ottoman or Austria have a powerful military, rich provinces and strong diplomatic influence from start, while small nations like one-province Albania or Irish nations have a few number of army and frightening neighbors. Technology starts almost the same, but from time to time European powers will almost always have a big technological advantages against Asian, African and Native American nations.This game don't shy away from the fact of European hegemony in 1444-1821. However, that doesn't mean the European power will always ""win"" the game. In fact, most of the satisfying experience is turning the tide of history: trample the Iberian shores as Aztec, invade British isles as an Indian nation, prevent European from getting a foothold in the Spice Islands as South East Asian nations, or, if you are crazy enough, try to conquer the world as Ryukyu, a Japanese one-province nation in nowadays Okinawa. Playing smart with intricate network of diplomacy is the key here, as waging war is not only the solution.EUIV is also sometimes an overwhelming game for many people. It is complex, have a steep learning curve and the in-game tutorial is not really helping. It's best to read the wiki and watch other people's play to learn and refine your playing skill, as many nations have very different playing strategy, style and even gameplay mechanics. The number of DLC is also overwhelming, but actually the essential ones aren't that many.There are many gameplay elements that I didn't cover here, like economy and trade, religion, rebel, colony, diplomatic relations, justification of war (Casus Belli), military and battle mechanics, internal factions, etc. But that's another topic for another day.

												EU 4 is a great grand strategy game that has a lot of depth but is also approachable. Also, it manages to be an engrossing sandbox game while maintaining some historical flavor. Unlike the Civilization series, the hundreds of playable countries are quite different. It has some problems  and I don’t approve of the changes that the DLC has made to colonization, but it is easily my GOTY for 2013.  "

												This game is great! Overall it is a huge improvement from the Third with much better working diplomatic and trade system. This is no longer a game about conquest (In Europa 3 I took over all of Europe fairly easy as the Ottomans. And then there wasn't much point in playing) but rather about good state building over time. Mods work very well on the game there is full steam support for them. Best Nation-Building RTS I have ever played.			"

												Has history treated your nation unfairly? Do you want to fix those mistakes and take revenge on those who have oppressed you? Now you can.Europa Universalis IV will make your old favorite strategy games seem like rubbish and make you question why you haven't found this game before.

												EDIT: this was important to me and i think it's important to you too; most of the dlc listed for this game is unecessary cosmetics unless it's over 10 dollars or soThis game takes some initial start up investment to learn the works, at first the menus will be overwhelming due to how much info and tabs there areIt gets pretty comfortable when you understand everything, PLAYING ANYTHING OTHER THAN A EUROPEAN POWER CAN BE FRUSTRATING,YOU DONT GET TO DO EVERYTHING YOU WANTIf you're flexible in your desires you may beable to do what you wantIts a really gratifying game when you make it do what you wantoptions and choices can be seen as either really diverse or really limitedlet me reiterate, you can do everything you want with some nations, you won't beable to do everything you want with most nationsand most nations means that you'll be really weak compared to european powers, but that's how it's supposed to beCHALLENGE ADVERSITY.

												EUIV is a very well designed game, but the entry cost is a bit high. The tutoral isn't as helpful or as in-depth as it needed to be to serve as a strong introduction to the game; it also was apparently unupdated for patches and DLC/Expansions. After the initial time investment (I spent around 8 hours actually learning how to do various things in the game) and a trip to the wiki (eu4wiki), the massive depth of the game really shines through. The randomness of the game allows for a massive amount of replayability, which combines well with the sheer size of the game to create an experience that can last for hundreds, if not thousands, of hours. There are a few nitpicks, especially when the game refuses to say why something can't be done. There are certain moments when very unrealistic things can really break the immersion and tone of the game which is both a flaw and a testament to how well the rest of the game handles realism.While this certainly isn't something that everyone would like, and there is a good deal of time and effort input required to glean any experience from the game, the reward is an immensely deep and lengthy, yet enjoyable experience.EDIT: A note on the DLC policy of the game: The game is constantly being updated (both with improvements and some poorly thought-out mechanics) and DLC is intended to fund this. The different DLC have very different value-to-cost ratios (Art of War-good, Mare Nostrum-bad), so it's definitely better to buy the DLC on sales, since the total overall cost is a bit absurd. Some of the changes that come with the free patches can be quite divisive, and the reviews for the accompanying DLC often reflect this. The patches also have pretty bad Quality Assurance and often times bugs can remain for months after being added and reported.			"
