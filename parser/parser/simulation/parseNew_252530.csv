												This is not a game; it is a simulator in the purest sense. Unlike Euro Truck Simulator 2 and similar, there is no aspect of gameplay at all.As such, if you don't really, really want to drive a bus, then I can't reccommend OMSI for you.On the other hand, if, like me, buses are your thing, then this is the best - no two ways about it. The driving physics are excellent, the sounds are just superb, every individual switch in the cab works and attention to detail has been layered upon the vehicles you'll drive. The defualt maps are OK, and the default buses are excellent - but this simulator is all about the mods. There are dozens upon dozens of amazing freeware buses and maps out there, and a few excellent officially endorsed payware items (I highly reccomend the O305 and Three Generations bus packs).In case none of the maps available meet your taste, the game includes a map editor which allows you absolute freedom to build your own maps, even if the controls take a little getting used to and the editor itself is really well hidden (google how to run it). With a little patience, you can learn to create assets for the game without too much difficulty in Blender and Sketchup, or, in my case, Gmax, via a very circuitous import route.There are limitations - the game only really supports right-hand traffic, for instance. There are left-traffic routes and buses available, but there are issues with passengers walking through the bus. You'd also better get used to selling tickets in German.There are flaws as well - you need a fast processor to run this game at all (multiple cores don't help), and an SSD, while not absolutely necessary, will significantly boost performance, as the game is constantly loading items as they come within range. Back when it was released, the game was not stable at all. This seems to be fixed for most people now, but you should be aware of it nonetheless. The physics can be jumpy occasionally, and I've had a few weird bugs like the back end of an articulated bus falling off. This kind of thing has been few and far between for me, though the game becomes less stable the more mods you have (clean up the ones you aren't using). Play with the settings until you get something that seems to be stable.All in all, if you like buses, this is simply a must-have. Yes, there are bugs, but they're outweighed by the sounds, the driving physics, the wholly interactive dashboards and the endless customization.			"

												Yes, it will crash and freeze on occasion. Yes, it is difficult to master at first and will take time to figure out. Yes, you have to read the manual and instalation of addons can be a pain.But still, there is absolutely NOTHING like it. It is hands down the best transport sim there is - most detailed, most realistic representation of driving a public transport vehicle, period. I own them all - and nothing else comes close.The busses (the included ones and most 3rd party addons too) are infinitely detailed, with nearly all functions working and represented. Deep scripting allows for modders and 3rd party developers to represent nearly any of a bus' systems faithfully; and basic scripting it is not difficult to understand, so if you don't like something - you can put the time in and change it. The sounds are superb, best and most detailed of any sim. There is interaction with the passengers, they're not just props. There is an infinite ammount of freeware addons (I don't remember when I last played the default map or one of the default busses), some of which are not only as good as payware addons - many they surpass the payware addons. There are huge maps with 20 different routes and small maps with one or two routes. There are city maps and interurban maps. Busy maps and quiet, pastoral maps. And most of the maps coming out nowdays are detailed and pretty.Of course, OMSI is also deeply flawed. You have to take that into account, especially if you're used to sims and games built by large companies with teams of developers. It has all the classic limitations of a game built in the living room by two passionate guys - a crappy engine (performance can suffer on large maps even on the best of systems), occasional crashes and errors, underdevelopment in many areas (the AI of cars can be infuriating, they are dumb as hell and never leave their paths, which can create gridlock sometimes). But the core of the simulation is so good that you get used to the flaws and learn to work around them. And yes, it is worth it.Never had there been a sim on which I've logged so many hours. Big thumbs up. "

												Where do I start... Oh well, what I like about Germany? Beer, maybe sausages? No. It's MAN bus manufacturer, and OMSI. It's been almost 3 years since OMSI 1 came out, and a long journey from 2012 announcement has ended. It's finally here, but does it stand up to the name of great simulation like the last one? Is it worth the asking price? Let's find out.After starting the game, pretty simple menu greets you. It has everything including tutorial, options, starting new game. Everything is self explanatory. Options may be confusing for people who aren't really into computers and configurations, but I'd say, set overall settings to PC 2006 or 2011 (options names) and you're good to go. Controls could be confusing too, but driving on keyboard (even is game is designed STRICTLY for steering wheels) is pretty well done, and is fun. I've had no problems setting up two steering wheels in it. After short configuration, I've finally started the game up. After pretty long loading, game had no bus whatsoever. So I've pressed ALT, and then a simple menu came out of nowhere. That little thing is handyas from here you can get new bus from there, fix it, choose timetable or change the Bus display. There is a lot to have fun with. So I've choosen Advertised MAN NG272 and then the fun began. First of all, this game is not for casuals. You need to know what exatly you need to do in order to start the electricity, engine, and then finnaly move your bus. You need a basic knowledge of how buses work in order to find OMSI 2 fun. So after some clicking with mouse on virtual cockpit of my NG272, I've finally heard this bearutifull beast. WOW the sound design is AMAZING. Everything is in place, even creeking of the joint of the Bus. Sound quality is TOP NOTCH. It's better than most games out there. Graphics however aren't that great. 2D trees crossed to make a 3D like impression, 2D bushes, and blocky buildings with pretty low-res textures and berlinians who walk pretty badly... but who the hell looks at graphics in simulation? Bus Models are top notch. Well detailed, well textured. However the deal breaker could be optimisation. It lacks a bit, but it's certainly better than the first one. After configurations you can get most out of it, that's why everything is so complicated in options menu. I'd recommend setting Texture Max Memory to max of your graphic card. Lags in game could be a little annoying while loading next map tiles, but you'll get used to it. Ai can also be pretty jerky, and pretty tough to cooperate with, but hey, when you get used to it, it doesn't really matter. We all need to give credit to Marcel Kuhnt and Rudeger Hulsmann (yes, those two guys created this game) for even doing such a great job on other aspects of the game. Physics are top notch. Every bump has it's feeling. You feel the mass of the bus, and also how well in handles (when of course you know HOW to drive a bus). You will feel significant difference driving on snow, and or dry asphalt. It's incredibly well made. What shines in this game is it's flexibility. You can do everything you want in bus. Open windows, manually open doors, press all buttons on cockpit and see what they do. It's like, literally, you can do EVERYTHING you always dreamed of with a bus, including even manipulating Roll-Band displays. Another great thing is it's modability. You can install user created buses, maps, scenery objects, sounds, Ai etc into this game. What's even more awesome, is that OMSI 2 is backwards compatible with all user created content for OMSI 1. Yay!For what it is, and for what it provides, yes, OMSI 2 is worth the money. Your childhood dreams of being bus driver finnaly came true, and what's more important, they are on steam, available to everyone. Aswell as Euro Truck Simulator 2, HEED THE MOCKERS. Don't listen to anybody who say that simulation games suck, because you will miss the pinnacle of simulation games on PC. However you look at this game, it's maybe not perfect, but it's excusable, due to low human resources of MR Software. I mean, come on. I've never saw two people creating such good game with such attention to detail. After starting up OMSI 1 and OMSI 2, I felt like they were both passionate about busses. Bus driving seems boring to some people, but believe me - it's a hard job. Those two guys captured the true feeling of that job. Game itself shows how much they loved what they did in this game. It shows how dedicated both Marcel and Rudiger are to simulation and re-creation of real-life feeling of such universal job. Yes, animations are lacking,  graphics too, and optimisation a bit aswell, but we cannot deny the fact, that nothing beats the OMSI 2 in terms of physics, sound and design. Other companies (Including TML Studios) cannot even think of being close to what OMSI 2 did. I won't spoil how many new things are in game. Certainly MAN NG272, thus argiculated bus support is there, which is a very nice touch. There have been improvements, and they certainly add even more depth to already impressive and deep simulation.It's a good game, for a good price. Pick it up if you're not affraid of it's downs.8.5/10(Original review restored)			"

												Okay, this game is poorly optimized, the graphics aren't great, the textures are bad, but that's not what OMSI 2 is about. This simulator is for people who don't need high frames (you won't get above 60 fps regardless of your specs) or photorealistic graphics, this is for simulator people. The base game comes with two maps, one large reconstruction of 1980's Berlin and a smaller, fictional, training map. It includes four different busses, one bendy-bus, one single-decker, and two double-deckers. This isn't a lot of content for upwards of £20, but there is a strong modding community which can add a whole new feel and look to the game, so dont worry about this when you first play. For people who like to pick up a game and play it without much of a learning curve, OMSI 2 is not for you. I personally spent at least an hour, configuring settings for my Logitech G25 Racing Wheel, and learning all the different buttons on the bus dashboard. Once you know what to do, this game is alot of fun, but until then, I found it quite frustrating. Look at the forums for Input Configuration for different racing wheels and controllers, someone has already configured them and you can just paste those into the directory. Performance, don't expect much. This is one of the cons of this game, it is very badly optimised. I reach anywhere from 20-60 frames, and experience frequent micro-stutters during gameplay, however I purchased this game knowing this would be the case.Actually driving the bus feels fantastic, the physics (force feedback adds lots of realism) and feel of the busses is very well executed. I've never driven a real bus, but I think this could be considered close. The sound engine for this game is phenominal, and is really engaging. This is one of the most polished features. For those who really want to drive a realistic feeling bus, while configuring routes and lines on the IBIS stystem, worrying about temperatures, and sticking to a strict schedule, buy this game. The price is quite high, but if you're one of those people, you will definitely get your money's worth.If you've played ETS 2, or City Bus Driving, and think ""hey I like simulators"", be warned, this game is much more complex. You may still enjoy it, however if you're expecting an easy time I wouldn't recommend it. In Conclusion:Pros:> Realistic Physics > Realistic Sounds> Plenty of mods> Feels like you're driving a bus> Excellent replayability (different lines/routes and maps)Cons:> Poor Optimisation> Poor Graphics> Rather Expensive> Complex to configure and learn			"

												I upgraded to omsi 2 from OMSI 1 in December 2013 on the date of release and I have to say that there has been some major issues with the game from the start but M&R Software have taken the views and bug reports from the people who matter the end user and have even set-up a special bug reporting email address so that the users can report bugs to them and there have been many updates to OMSI 2 since its release in December 2013.Now it is August 2016 and it is on version 2.2.032 which is a millions times better than the version released in December 2013 and most of the time it is a stable, enjoyable and playable game.  In it current state I would recommend this game as it is more than playable and hours of fun can be had with the right maps and buses. Since I wrote the original review of OMSI 2 back in June 2014 over 2 years ago, many updates have been released and many if not all bugs (for me anyway) have been fixed. The game is a must for anyone who enjoys buses or simulation gaming. In recent months a number of LHD maps and RHD buses have been released including Great Grundorf 2LHT and Grundorf Island which are my personal favourites but there are lots of hours of fun to be had with OMSI 2 as can be seen from the number of hours I have played the game.  In conclusion I would say that OMSI 2 is a vast improvement over OMSI 1 and that the current build of OMSI 2 is a stable and enjoyable game with almost limitless possabilities with the DLC;s available and the ones that are coming soon such as the London addon due in September 2016. In summary I would say that there are enough freeware DLC and payware DLC to enable any user to be able to customise OMSI 2 with the maps and vehicles they want to make OMSI 2 enjoyable for them.

												OMSI 2 is not without it's faults, but overall is a really in-depth and high quality bus simulator. It is a game crafted with love and attention to detail, unlike certain other simulators.. *cough* Train Simulator. So what's so good about OMSI?+ The buses are very high quality, and almost every button in the cab works. Every little function in the bus actually works. Even the driver window slides! The bus sounds are top notch, and this game has one of the best sound engines I've ever heard.+ The game simulates passengers, and it does it very well. The passengers evaluate your bus driving, and will moan at you if the bus is too cold or too warm or you attempt to short change them. They will want to get off your bus if your driving is not up to scratch!+ The game fully simulates a 24 hour clock, and various types of weathers such as rain, snow, fog, etc. You will notice less cars and passengers at night, and lots more at rush hours. + OMSI has a huge modding scene, which means you can download tons of new maps and buses for free. There's always more to do, and you don't have to fork out £24.99 cause you want some different scenery. + Timetables are fully simulated, and AI buses follow them just like you. You can even take over an AI bus if you wish. + The included Berlin map clearly had a lot of detail put into it. Compare it on Street view or compare images and the similarities become obvious right away. + The game is supported with Official DLC's which are of great quality. + The game has full steering wheel support which is really great if you have one. Okay, so what about the negatives?- The game WILL micro-freeze and suffer from framerate issues. If you are really really sensitive to issues like this, I would not recommend it. If like me you are willing to look past these issues, you will be fine. It doesn't prevent me from enjoying the game. - There are various bugs here and there such as the AI hitting you sometimes, passengers noclipping through bus stop shelters, etc. - The graphics are by no means amazing and they could be better, but I do think they do the job. - The game can be intimidating at first and the tutorials really are quite useless, don't bother with them. - The settings can be hard to configure, and aren't as simple Low, Medium and High. This can also be seen as a good thing as you can customise them best to your system.  "

												OMSI is an excellent bus simulator, but not in the same respect as Euro Truck Simulator 2 - buses are a very niche subject, a lot of people can relate to wanting to be a truck driver, a pilot, or even a train driver. But a bus driver? What? Most people's first impression of OMSI is that it's just another broken, unfinished simulator that isn't worth your time. You're not exactly wrong. If you're not a bus enthusiast and you think OMSI looks like a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'm not going to try and convince you otherwise. This game is not for you. Don't buy it. Why are you still reading this?Now, OMSI mainly caters to those of us who grew up on buses, and developed a liking for how they work and all the sounds that the various parts made. It does that by offering astounding levels of detail and realism in the sounds and models. As a result OMSI is a proper, full-on SIMULATOR. If you picked up ETS2 in a sale, enjoyed it, and thought ""hey, these simulators are actually pretty fun, and people are raving about how OMSI is one of those good simulators, I should try it"" then I fear that you MAY be sorely disappointed by OMSI. Don't get me wrong, both OMSI and ETS2 are fantastic simulators but in very different ways. With ETS2 there are simple controls and tutorials to make it easy for people that are new to driving simulators, or just want to finish the objective without a care for how realistic it is - and on the other hand for the enthusiasts there are options to enable things like realistic air brakes, set up a steering wheel and so on.As for OMSI, there are a few tutorials and arrows to guide you through the routes but apart from that there is no hand-holding. (almost) everything on the dashboard works, and you have to do everything yourself. I mean, anyone can play it, don't get me wrong. The physics are clearly optimized for a steering wheel controller but it still works very well with the mouse too. It's just that when you go into OMSI you need to understand that it is a simulator for enthusiasts, and have the patience to forgive its little flaws, figure everything out and play it properly. Yes, you COULD take a wrong turn and crash your bus into an invisible wall that launches your bus into space. The solution? Don't do that! If you go into OMSI with the right mindset, and especially if you are a bus enthusiast, I can assure you that you will have a great time. Sure, the graphics for the environment look a bit dated, the pedestrian animations are hilarious and the AI can be a bit weird at times. And, of course, it being a niche simulator on Steam means it will recieve endless hate from idiots who have bought it without doing any research beforehand, and then complain about finding it boring. But you have to remember it was only made by two students, and the level of detail that has gone into the things that really matter is truly incredible.Some may find the price unreasonable, but the bottom line is anyone who can truly enjoy this simulator will find that it is worth the money to them. Otherwise, wait for a sale.In conclusion, OMSI is a fantastic simulator but is more akin to Flight Simulator than Euro Truck Simulator, and as a result is not for everyone.			"

												Superb simulation but with some bugs. Yes, they are a bit irritating but the gameplay is so good that I don't care about it. The game has an huge community (mostly german but there are also enough english speakers) with an large database of FREE mods like: new busses, new maps/routes, bus modifications, reskins etc.It's also very easy to mod it by yourself. DRIVING:(Please note: I'm using a steering wheel with force feedback as controller, this adds more driving pleasure to the game. It might be different when using a mouse or keyboard as controller)I start off with the most important thing of the game, driving!When you get in your bus for the first time, it could be a bit overwelding. The amount of buttons and switches are enormous. It isn't an easy to pick up game. If you want the full experience out of the game, you need to invest some time in it to learn how it works (the errors and the AI behaviour is a bit odd so in the beginning this can be quite frustrating but after some time you know how they respond so you can change your way of driving on it), and of course how to drive the damn thing ;-). If you get the hang of it you will see that it's quite fun and challenging to drive a bus. You have 12 meters behind you to keep an eye on and a schedule. You also need to take care of your passengers that want to be comfortable and on time at their destination.PERFORMANCEOmsi doesn't run on a fancy big graphic engine. Even the fastest PC can have some lag in this game. Omsi hasn't got a stable frame rate because the scenery is on any place different. But I can give you some predictions of what frame rate you will get:Low-end PC: 10-18 FPSMid-end PC: 20-40 PFSHigh-end PC: 30-60 PFSI know 18 FPS doesn't sounds much but there isn't really much fast action so it's acceptable and playable.MODDINGOmsi is a great game to mod! It has an open folder structure so you basically don't need to install any tools to get going. It takes time to know how to mod but an experienced modder shouldn't have any problems with it. Installing mods is as easy as extracting an archive file. And the good news is, they are all free!But when you want to instal a new map for the first time, you will find yourself getting loads of errors due to missing files. For many maps you need to download a whole list of other objects or maps to get going. But once you've installed a couple maps, you don't get many errors any more because most maps use the same objects.CONCLUSION+ Realistic driving physics and controls+ Huge amount of detail+ Fun to drive+ Large amount of free available mods+ Easy to mod + Best (bus) driving simulator- Crashes sometimes- Some bugs- not easy to pick up (you need to invest some time to learn how the game works)- Not suited for everyoneI would definitely recommend this game if you like simulators. It's one of the best driving sims out there (yes, it beats Euro Truck Simulator 2 on the driving experience). If you can ignore the bugs and you are open to spend some time on learning the game and read some tutorials that you would have hours of fun with this game!Greetings from the Netherlands =D			"

												HOLY COW! If you are a massive transportation nerd like I am and can't get enough of train simulator, and you like simulations that truly do their best to be as true to life as possible, this is the game for you.Basically, I grew up in Chicago as a massive transit nerd, rail fan, everything and had always dreamed of operating a CTA 'L train or being a bus driver. When I stumbled across a YouTube video of someone playing the new Chicago Downtown DLC, I HAD to get this game. I have spent over 200 hours on the different maps in this game, and can guarantee that the developers have really spent a lot of time working on this wonderful game, not to mention the wonderful world of modders.If you want to know how hard it is to drive a bus, and you want to feel a realistic simulation of it, this is the one.

OMSI 2  - Gamer Muscle Reviews 
A Video of OMSI 2
By: GAMER MUSCLE

			With This OMSI 2 review I hope to introduce you to the magical world of 1980s Berlin bus driving ! OMSI 2 The omnibus simulator also known as Omsi Der Omnibussimulator.		


Still if you want a solid bus sim and want to drive around 1980's Berlin in very well simulated buses then this is awesome.Again DONT EXSPECT EURO TRUCK SIM - DO EXSPECT HARD CORE GERMAN BUS SIM !At this point in time the game has quite a few bugs takes a long time to load and is very confusing to use , so it might be worth picking this up in a few months time ether on sale or when it has had more work done to it but if you are crazy about buses then you will probably want to pick it up.

												Omsi 2 is a game that you cannot take seriously.You can try, you can set up your fancy steering wheel, clip on your TrackIR, have the IBIS app on your mobile phone of choice, even wear a floppy hat, but when you get started, you learn that the AI is just too dumb to play it seriously.So don't, and enjoy it.Part of the fun is the mishaps that happen on the way, which there will be many. Under the hood the game is actually pretty darn great, good bus physics, and the sound design is just one of the best in gaming history (and that is no joke). Collision physics suck, mind. Well, they're great if you want to shoot your own bus, or another bus, into the stratosphere. For the most part the quality of the content is good, very good in fact. Originally a tiny dev team it is clear that this was a labour of love, and that effort shows in the stock content and some of the DLC. SOME, not all. Very much like Dovetail, Aerosoft are willing to put any old map/vehicles on the Steam store to earn them some cash. This makes purchases very hit and miss, and finding reviews in a place other than Steam could be difficult. In general though, pretty good, and Omsi 2 has a great modding scene, some of which equal or even better the quality of official DLCS.Omsi 2 is oddly engaging, and entertaining, and sort of falls into that realm of Farm Simulator or Eurotruck Simulator where really the game should be boring as hell, and maybe it is, but you still come back for more. There is a odd satisfaction of driving around a sleek, modern hybrid bus, or one of those real diesel smoke spewers of the 80s, you can practically smell the stubbed out cigarettes and that yellow liquid that could either be beer or urine or both.What this game begs for is optimisation. The game engine of Omsi 2 is pretty much as good as it can get, DLC creators try their best to improve matters, but the core game itself could do with a proper polish up (pokes Aerosoft in the ribs, you listening?). I would love to see this in something like the Unreal Engine or Unity, doubt that would happen though. Any half decent rig should be able to make very few concessions in game settings, but don't expect constant 60s. If you want to buy a few DLCs to expand on the stock content, the Berlin X10 is a great buy (huge map),  as is Hamburg. The forthcoming Omsi 2 Add On London DLC (formerly the mod called The South London Project) is one I'm very much looking forward to, not only to drive some iconic buses, but also to terrorise the streets of my nations capital.A double decker doing scandinavian flicks around Marble Arch? Sign me up.Live out your childhood dream of being a bus driver, very indepth, very fun, just don't take it too seriously.			"

												If you can get past the unstable and buggy gameplay, and slightly questionalble graphics, OMSI is an absolutely brilliant simulator with a strong community making regular contend for both sides of the road.OMSI comes with a total of 15 buses, all made by M.A.N and were used in Berlin in the 1980s/90s. This game also comes with 2 maps (Grundorf and Spandau, Berlin) and are pretty well detailed. This OMSI is cirtainly one of THE BEST bus simulators out there, even though it is very buggy. The DLCs are also highly detailed, and are at very competative prices when compared with DLC for Dovetail Games' RailWorks.You may notice that (when you boot the game for the first time) no passengers will buy any tickets, this is not a glitch/bug, you need to change your settings by:1. Press ""p"", this will pause the game. Esc. also works to pause the simulation, but the time still passes, press p first2. Press Esc.3. Find ""Options""4. This will open a new window, find ""Ticket Selling""5. Open the Drop-Down Menu.6. Select ""Easy"" or ""Advanced""7. Click ""ok""8. Press Esc.9. Press ""p""10. Continue driving :-)I like this Simulator and I highly Recommend OMSI and it's DLC to anyone looking for a decent bus simulator, remember, it is very buggy and unstable.			"

Rating: Conditionally recommendedAn extremely deep simulation that, for better or worse, still has no competition. On one hand, this is the best and most accurate bus simulator available on the market. Almost every aspect of the buses are modeled to the last detail and are functional.On the other hand, this game, our only choice on the market, is an unstable and poorly optimized offering. Do tweak the memory settings and and use the 4 GB patch to alleviate some of the crashes. I rarely experience them after doing so.You should also be prepared to read the manual a lot and/or watching videos on YouTube to figure everything out, as the in-game tutorial does little to teach you the ropes.The base game doesn't have a lot in terms of content, but the official DLC bring a lot of variation and there are lots and lots of community created maps and vehicles available online for free.The price is fine considering the depth of the simulation, but I would have expected a more polished product by now. If you get all the DLC it'll get quite costly, especially considering the game almost never appears on sales.Get this only if you're sure you like deep vehicle simulations, but prepare for some frustration due to instability.I rate this game:EssentialRecommendedConditionally recommendedNot recommendedAvoid "

Bugs Squashed, A Great SimulatorI held off reviewing OMSI 2 for a while - when it first came out it quickly picked up a reputation of being buggy and unreliable. I had faith that M-R would be able to fix it, and they have. New releases from small developers frequently have problems which take some time to fix.Since the last few updates, I've had no crashes, hangs or freezes. It works fine.OMSI is a reputable bus simulator whose main focus is on the core simulation. The main focus of attention is where you want it - in the bus. The outside world looks dated, but the buses themselves are beautifully recreated, and their operation is perfect. The sound system is the best I've heard in a game - sounds are generated dynamically, rather than soundfile x being played when condition a is met.Hardcore simmers will appreciate how few 'gaming' elements are here - no cheaty UI, no dialogs, nothing. You have to actually learn how to drive and operate a bus rather than just jamming W and hitting checkpoints. Keyboard or mouse control is acceptable, but OMSI allows gamepad, joystick and steering wheel input (the latter is highly recommended). It also supports TrackIR, which is amazingly immersive.If you are not a hardcore simmer, or take an interest in buses, then maybe TML's series is for you. OMSI has a steep learning curve and is more about the simulation of operating a bus realistically than beautiful rendered cities.As you can see, I've plenty of hours logged in OMSI. A lot of these come from the Map Editor, which although unwelcoming, is very powerful and lets you create some engaging and entertaining routes to drive.Overall, I'd rate this 9/10. It lacks a modern graphics engine (and the tiling system is dated and clunky), but this is a simulator, not a game. If M-R could borrow SCS's graphics engine, they'd have the perfect simulator.			"

												There’s something oddly wonderful about a game trying to recreate niche, and bizarre parts of history. None more than OMSI, a game which sets out to lovingly recreate buses/routes in Berlin. Not just Berlin, but more specifically the Spandau district from 1980’s – 1990’s, a very peculiar, and to most of us obscure part of history. But does it succeed?Let’s make one thing clear, this is not ETS2. It’s not lavished with game style game play mechanics about levelling up your character, running your company, and customizing your vehicles. Nor is it all that user friendly, or really all that approachable. This is a hardcore simulation, with hardcore simulation style lack of game play. The premise is as simple as coul  be, choose a bus. Choose a route. Drive..GameplayThe buses are very nicely recreated, with a full array of working features on the dashboard, from the usual wipers, lights, adjustable suspension (on the more modern buses) and fully functioning computers, and ticket machines. Although unless you speak German, good luck getting your head around those. Thankfully, you can set your bus up using the rather basic, but functional in game UI.The game does have a rather steep learning curve, while it does have tutorials these are next to useless, so your pretty much on your own. Getting in to a position where you can pick up your first passengers, is rather more than just selecting a job, and pressing E to start your engine, and putting the bus in to gear and driving. Every button on the dashboard does something some of these things are more useful than others. If your patience lasts long enough to get your head around the rather steep learning curve, you’ll quickly find the game is actually quite enjoyable in a mundane, driving a city bus kind of way. Driving your assigned route, you’ll of course be stopping at bus stops, picking up rather badly animated but very amusing robotic passengers, selling them tickets, and all the usual things expected from a bus driver. The simulation of this goes quite deep, even down to them complaining, if the bus is cold.The actual driving of the bus feels very nice, and really the developers have managed to create the feeling of driving a very large, cumbersome heavy vehicle, turns will be taken slowly, and much care has to be taken when weaving in and out of parked cars, and other obstacles scattered around the lovingly created depiction of Berlin. Upon hitting something, the passengers, which by now you have become belligerent towards, will swear, and shout at you in German demanding to get off.Sound:The sound is absolutely spectacular, and a real master class in how the sound should be in these types of games, it’s incredibly atmospheric, and really transported me back to the 80s/90s as a kid travelling to school on those old double decker buses. From the whine of knackered old diesel engine, to the wind blowing in to the slightly open window, the bus rattling and banging as it chugs down the road. Its absolutely superb, and other developers of simulators should certainly take note.Physics:As said already, the basic driving physics are excellent, however the other world physics, are more hilarious than anything else. With vehicles catapulting about in an accident, or humping the ground, people being swallowed by the floor. It all makes for some highly amusing, if immersion breaking moments.Control devices:It’s a given that a game like this is best played with a wheel, rather than state the obvious, I think its best to discuss other control devices, not everyone owns a wheel. Controller:The mainstay of driving games, for those without a wheel at least. Unfortunately, using a controller is next to impossible. The over sensitivity of the Xbox 360 controller is not accounted for at all, no dead zones are added or able to be added. The stick simply functions as a wheel, which makes controlling the bus immensely sensitive, and next to impossible. Don’t even bother.Keyboard:While the keyboard is completely indispensable, with the massive array of functions, and systems, all of which you will need to control, driving with it is, really as to be expected. The game uses the numpad by default. 4 Turns left, 6 turns right, and 5 centres the steering. While its more than possible to drive using the keyboard, keyboards don’t feature any analogue devices, everything of course is either on or off, which can make for some pretty heavy accelerating and braking, which is usually met by lots of angry German swearing from the passengers.Mouse:This is my preferred method for controlling the game. Generally I hate mouse driving, its over sensitive, has very little feedback, or makes very little sense. But the developers of Omsi have definitely cracked it. Move the mouse up to accelerate, down to brake, and of course left and right steer. If you don’t have a wheel this is my recommended method of controlling it. The only drawback, is steering, and accelerating at the same time can be rather difficult, and tends to be a little haphazard.The bad:While I would like to say “The game is a triumph buy it immediately!”. That really isn’t the case. OMSI 2 is as awful as it is brilliant, an incredibly mixed bag. As already said, its not very approachable, a lot of the options, the controls list, and other things are not put together in a very user friendly or coherent way, at times it feels like it was designed by a madman! Even when trying to work out /change the controls The list seems to almost be randomly thrown together, without much regard for the poor player who has to find his/her way through it. In a game like this, which has an awful lot of controls, this really does make for frustration, and swearing.In general the game is incredibly unpolished, mostly using simple OS ui windows to control various functions. More often than not, these windows can make little to no sense at first glance, and can take a quite some time to get used to. Stability:The games stability is atrocious, and really, unacceptable. The game quits to desktop on a regular basis, randomly fails to load, and throws up a lot of errors usually in German, leaving you with little idea as to what actually happened. Sounds will just stop working, and all manner strange things will happen. For a game that’s been out a year (longer if you count the original) these really are issues that should no longer be present.Navigation:This is done by a simple overlay with arrows pointing you in the direction and icons over the stops you need to stop at. While this sounds just basic but functional, at times, it can be incredibly confusing. You’ll get arrows pointing you off towards other routes, which have nothing to do with yours, at times it offers you absolutely no direction at all, and other times it just sends you off down side streets your not supposed to go down, or tries to send you down 1 way roads (of course the wrong way) Content:The base lacks a serious amount of content The map really isn’t that big, and you have a very small number of routes to drive. Simply put, I doubt it will have much lasting appeal.Final thoughts:This game is actually quite annoying. It’s very solid, and very well made in parts but has far too many glaring issues. While I did enjoy it, It’s certainly not something I can whole heartedly recommend. I actually find it quite annoying, the potential is vast. Should it be given ETS 2’s spit, polish, and level of content, I can’t help but feel it would actually be a superior game, capable of knocking ETS 2 off my favourite simulator spot. But in its current state, its incredibly rough around the edges, and falls very short. If you enjoy simulators, and are looking for something new, you might like this one. But don’t go in to it expecting a complete or approachable, product, it isn’t.			"

												This is the best hardcore bus simulator for all those people who actually love buses! It cannot compare with Bus Simulator 2016 as it is honestly the most realistic and authentic bus sims can get. That being said, many people who have played this game, no matter how well their computer is, this game will deffinetly lag. There is just that bad of a platform for this game to run on. If this one thing could be improved, it would be for this game to run on a proper 64 bit system.However, this game, even though the prices seem high, is quite reasonable. Although I bought it when the price was $38.69 CAD, I feel that it is worth it. There are a hundred different map downloads online with an active community that makes maps for free. There are also DLC downloads. Some are great, such as the x10 Berlin and Chicago payware. There is also the upcoming South London which will show everyone that this game has potential to be made very well, in left hand drive as well as right hand drive.All in all, I love this game so much and the occasional stutters can not outweigh the awesomeness of this game! Played it for 6 months with 200 hours. You should consider buying this game if you are a self-aclaimed bus lover. So much so that you dream about it in your sleep...wat.			"

												Pros:-Realistic Driving-Realistic Controls-Realistic representation of the real life job of a bus driver.Cons:-Poor graphics-Poor gameplay for english players-Tutorial is very poor-No real way to exit to the main menu to change options without quitting and restarting the game-No way to restart a tutorial or game as trying to start a new game, of the same one results in a game crash, meaning you must reload the game and reopen the tutorial or driving simulation-If the buttons were actually labeled in english it would make it alot easier for english players (I understand this game was not developed for english players, but I assume alot of the players are english speaking persons)-The game would be better if the map was present day and not 30 years old			"

												PROS:-Busses are historically accurate and have amazing detail-Big variety of busses from the 80\'s-90\'s with loads of skins (Ads)-Very authentic map and also historically accurate-Wide variety of lines/routes through the map-Features tutorial for beginners (OMSI is very advanced)________________________________________________________________________________CONS:-Can be difficult to learn, as this is a very advanced simulator with almost every button on the bus clickable-Is unstable & laggy, you\'ll need a powerful PC to run on stable FPS (30-45)-Graphics of pedestrians aren\'t very good and are very repetitive-Some buildings may have very low textures-AI Cars aren\'t very smart and they can easily crash into you (No worries, you can turn Collisions off in OMSI)-Very tight schedule to follow________________________________________________________________________________All in all, OMSI 2 is a very great simulation but has minor cutbacks and bugs, glitches, and is as stable as it\'s going to get (30-45 FPS). Personally, I would recommend this because of how authentic it is bus-wise, and how everything in the bus is clickable. But caution, you will need a powerful PC and lowered settings to run this game stable. If you get bored of the same old busses, lines/routes, there are various add-ons you can buy to expand the OMSI universe (Maps & Busses). "

												I’ve had OMSI 2 for quite a while now and I’ve done many hours (My hours shown above doesn’t Include the tons of hours I’ve logged while on offline mode). So I think it’s about time I done a review. There are many games out there that wrongly claim to be a simulator, not this one. Without a doubt this is the most realistic bus simulator available. It’s definitely not game that you just can pick up and play and you won’t get very far without at least taking a look at the manual. The standard game comes with two maps, a small fictional map and Spandau in Berlin set in the years 1986 to 1994 with a selection of MAN buses from that era. As well as the official payware content there is tons of map and bus mods available adding greatly to the experience. My personal favorite mods are the Bowdenham and Szczecin Maps First off the good points. The game is extremely realistic the buses handle accurately and every switch and lever is clickable. You can control almost every aspect in operating the bus including ticket sales, destination displays, doors, lights, heating and so on. In the Berlin map, there is a chrono feature where the route and varies and ticket prices change depending on the time period selected. There is selectable weather conditions that can affect how the bus handles. Too often, games are often let down by poor sounds but not in OMSI 2 where they are truly excellent, the buses sound just like the real thing. Almost every sound is recreated such as the suspension rattling on bumpy roads, the whine of the transmission and even dashboard button sounds.Now to the bad points. The graphics aren’t particularly great by modern standards and the game is poorly optimized. It will take quite a bit of time tinkering around with the settings to get respectable framerates. The AI traffic is dreadful often crashing into you but thankfully AI collisions can be turned off. More casual players may find themselves a little overwhelmed by the lack of ingame help. Some may also find the price a bit steep and it’s never included in the Steam sales.Despite these issues, it’s definitely not a bad effort considering it was made by just two guys from Germany and not some big developer with a massive budget. In a way this game is kind of like an old Italian sports car in that much of the time it won’t run properly and will completely infuriate you but the times when it does work, it’s just brilliant and sounds epic.So to sum up, OMSI 2 may frustrate at first but give it a chance and it can become very enjoyable. You may even learn a little bit of German in the process. If you like very detailed simulators and have an interest in buses I would definitely recommend it.			"

												A die-hard simulator, that's for sure.Good things to note:Really amazing detail on the busses. Everything is clickable and the sounds are fantastic.Large maps which are open and unlimited to drive onFull control on what you want do. For example, if you just want to drive across the cities without a schedule, that's totally possible! Decent physics, and good thermal physics.Fully customizable weather and time. Play whenever you want on the calendar in whatever you want. The weather is simulated nicely.Gameplay takes place in real-time.Not so good things to note:There is quite a large learning curve for this game. Hopefully you can ask someone who's played the game for help in learning; not many good instructional videos/just instructions online. The in-game tutorial sucks, just don't do it. I got stuck so many times because things just weren't explained that well.There's not much in the way of goals in this game. Your only goal is to drive and follow your schedule very closely; when you get to the end, there's not much incentive for the driving you just did. I'd like a career aspect to this since being a bus driver is a job. AI can be dodgy - best to leave collisions between them off.Performance isn't all that great. The game is not optimized very well and loading in map chunks hangs the game from time to time. I have a really solid PC, recently built, and I get about 45 FPS average on what I presume to be lower settings. This is a good segway into:Options menu can be confusing. There's no 'normal' sense in the way of graphics settings; no resolution settings or other normal stuff. The controller setup is tricky too.While the detail on the busses is second to none, other details seem a bit lacking. By this I mean low-res people and scenery and both are very repetetive. Just to clarify, the map doesn't repeat, just scenery objects.Overall, it's a fun game. Definitely a bona-fide simulator. I can't imagine playing this game without a steering wheel so keep that in mind. Also keep in mind you'll need like an hour or so to learn some stuff and what to do in the game. After the learning curve, it's quite a relaxing game! Put on some of your favorite tunes and you got yourself an evening!			"

												This is still the best bus simulator.  It is a good improvement on OMSI 1.MAPS/VEHICLES: The Spandau map is much extended with a new chronology function where you can see the routes/fares and most importantly the Berlin reunification/fall of the Berlin wall between 1986 and 1994.  Two maps are included the fictional test map Grundorf (one route, the 76) and Berlin Spandau (routes 92 (137), 5 (130) and also two night routes.  Two new buses come with this game the articulated (bendy) bus MAN NG272 (GN92) and the MAN NL202 (EN92).  The two double deckers from OMSI 1 are improved and the MAN SD202 has two new variants; the D90 and the D91.  There are new AI cars including ambulances with working sirens.  There is also much more trains in OMSI 2.PERFORMANCE: As with OMSI 1, you will need a pretty good PC to run OMSI 2.  FPS is improved from OMSI 1 but lag can be experienced frequently in busy areas of maps.I have an Intel Core i3, 6GB RAM and 2GB graphics card.  Here is my FPS on the Hamburg addon map.Suburb areas: 30 - 60 FPS.Inner City areas: 20 - 25 FPS.City Centre areas: 12 - 20 FPS.UI: The user interface is completely changed from OMSI 1.  The new UI looks much smoother and is easier to use.BUGS: When this game was first released it was almost unplayable.  It had clearly been released too early, as there were very frequent bugs and crashes.  At this stage (version 2.1, the game is a lot better and crashes are rare.  I have played the Hamburg and Vienna maps for the past few days with no crashes.  Unfortunately crashes do occasionally still occur and there are still some minor bugs, although these do not normally affect gameplay experience.ADDONS/COMPATIBILITY: Many freeware and payware addons exist for OMSI 2.  The OMSI 1 addons Vienna LU 200, Citybus O305 and Hamburg Day & Night have all been patched for OMSI 2.  Most OMSI 1 buses work in OMSI 2, but the majority of maps will not work in OMSI 2 without adjustments.  Many map creators have released new versions of their maps for OMSI 2.  A huge range of mods, repaints, vehicles and maps are available on the OMSI forum and other OMSI related websites.DRIVING EXPERIENCE/FUNCTIONS: OMSI unlike most (if not all) other bus sims recreates the bus functions and driving physics as close as possible.  Over 90% of buttons are pressable and have a function.  For example you can set the destination using the IBIS computer, spray the windscreen, adjust the heating (involves many switches, not just one button!), lights and door controls.  The bus sounds are excellent.  All have been recorded off the real-life buses.  Particularly with the bendy bus, you can feel the weight of the bus you are driving.  This is enhanced with a steering wheel.GAME CONTROLLERS: Buses can be controlled with the mouse or keyboard, but for a much more realistic experience a steering wheel is the best.  The best realism can be achieved in OMSI 2 with a 900 degree, force feedback steering wheel.  The one often preferred is the Logitech G27, but as this is very expensive other good wheels include the Logitech Driving Force GT.  TrackIR 6 can be used with this game for added realism of the camera views.TUTORIALS/DOCUMENTATION: As well as a detailed manual, new to OMSI 2 are tutorials.  I strongly recommend users who have not played OMSI 1 previously to do these tutorials as learning how to operate the buses can be tricky at first.Overall this is an excellent bus simulator (now that most bugs are gone anyway).  Remember if you purchased OMSI 1 you can get OMSI 2 at a discounted price at the publisher's website.			"

												The game itself only has 2 maps and a few buses. It is sad that the developer does not implement steam workshop for custom content.However, you can still expand it by installing custom cotent manually.

												Purchased while it was on sale - definitely enjoying it.  Couldn't get my XBox controller setup to properly control the game, so ""driving"" with the mouse, which works surprisingly well.  Yes, the graphics are substandard (and I'm running it on a purpose-built gaming computer), but it's a relaxing change of pace to unwind with after a full day.  There are extended load times, field of distance is not very large with repeated pop ins, and even on higher setting the people look as though they're in a N64 game.  If you've played Euro Truck Driver or Farming simulator, this is somewhat similar...although more limited in scope and graphical quality.  In spite of all of that, I recommend getting the game to enjoy for what it is.			"

												Though there is the odd freeze and FPS drop here and there, the character this game has is just so amazing you just can't help but to not let these freezes stand in your way of buying this really detailed and complex game. There also is a massive modding community as well, meaning you can expand the already quite big selection of buses and you can have new maps to play as well.I do recommend toning down the settings a bit, as this game isn't optimised well. I also recommend having at least an i5 to play this game effectively (this game relies on your single core. There is a multi-core option, but it destabilises the game).Overall, I give it a 92/137 (you'll get the pun once you play the game)			"

												Even if the graphics look outdated, or weird, this is by far the only bus simulator around. Forget about some other ""games"" around for city bus simulation. These guys recreated the engine sound accurately, the routes, all the bus features (cooler, windows, buttons, doors, etc.). Several bus lines on real maps, taking around 40 minutes on each direction.The problem is that because it was developed on a very old engine, and also it's been coded ""old-school"" and using Windows forms, the interface options are not as friendly as many other games out there, not to mention huge loading times. But other than that, if you want a SIMULATOR, not just a game to have some fun, this is the game. Takes some time to learn, a lot of document reading, etc... but same happens with Flight Simulator, you can't expect to just jump inside and flight.Anyway, at the moment of posting this review the game still has some bugs, but they said game will be patched soon.

												First, the bad:The graphics, game engine and menus seem about 20 years old.Poorly optimised - the framerate nosedives in certain areas.Many, many bugs eg:- Hold a button for a fraction of a second too long in the tutorial and it won't let you go back- Then restarting the tutorial causes the game to crash- Flip your bus and it falls through the road because the roof doesn't have a collision boxSerious localisation issues:- Tutorials are written in very broken English- During one of the tutorials, it tells you to press Shift+Z when you actually need to press Shift+Y (due to Germany using QWERTZ keyboards), and it won't let you proceed until you figure it out- You are told to adjust a control in English, but they are all labelled in German. Tell us the German name as well, or at least provide tool-tips!Controls:- Despite claiming full joypad support, the joypad controls are far too sensitive; the slightest movement results in screeching tyres and complaining passengers. A separate program like Xpadder is required to use the more linear steering setup of the keyboard version.- Some controls needlessly require separate on/off buttons to be mapped instead of a single toggle switchOverpriced. You only get one map and a tiny tutorial map. Including more maps would make it a fairer price.Good luck with getting through the poorly-translated, buggy tutorials and setting up the convoluted controls before your 2-hour refund window expires!On the positive side, once the initial period of frustration is out of the way, it does provide a fairly satisfying in-depth simulation of bus driving. If you can overlook the many issues you should get some enjoyment out of it (you only need to look at the thousands of hours some of these other reviewers have ploughed into it to confirm that!), however it is very expensive and therefore I can only recommend it if this sort of thing really floats your boat. But don't expect anything as polished as something like ETS2 (which isn't saying much).			"

												Summary - this is still the best bus simulator around.Pros:1. Realistic driving.2. Carefully researched routes.3. Very realistic buses, with all of their features and with most meticulous attention to detail. 4. Many different buses modelled and quite some routes.5. You can really see how the world was changing. I especially like to see how different Berlin was before and after the German Unification. The contrast between the West Berlin and the former German Democratic Republic is amazing. 6. Maps are really nicely done.7. The customization offers you some really HUGE possibilities - with all those different ratios of AI car, pedestrian, parked cars spawning rates and various objects rates you can depict any time of the day, adjust settings to the capabilities of your PC, and generally adjust everything to your liking. This feature is truly unparalleled and its a shame that other simulators lack it. 8. Steering wheel works great and was very easy to configure. 9. Sounds are simply great.10. There are many mods you can download and many different routes and buses to try. 11. You can customize weather A LOT - so many different settings grant a lot of freedom.12. AI of the cars is really fine and seems realistic, although sometimes can be quite suicidal if you make a mistake - charging to hit you instead of braking.Cons1. Stability - the game likes to freeze, altough nothing game-breaking.2. Passengers - they look horrible and there are only few models out there. This is perhaps the worst thing in the game. 3. Too little variation in AI cars perhaps.			"

												OMSI 2 is like the Microsoft Flight Simulator of busses. Over 90% of the buttons, switches, are clickable and have different functions. OMSI 2 took me a few days to learn how to properly set up lines and routes in the game, so for those looking to jump right in and start driving and picking up passengers, OMSI 2 is not for you. This game requires a decent rig to play, especially if you want a decent frame count. It's upsetting that for a game that looks like this I get lag in certain areas and I have a good PC, but after you do some work on getting your video and graphic settings perfect you will get a fair FPS count. All in all, OMSI 2 is a fantastic sim that keeps me playing this at least once every couple of days for a few routes that normally last up to 40 minutes. The DLC is overpriced, but I've still bought a few of them and the DLC is high quality, but not for the same price of the game. This review is a little all over the place, so I'll end it by saying, forget Bus Simulator 16, that game plays like garbage and the passengers talk to you like you're an idiot. Definitely worth the money for the base game!			"

												Here's the thing with OMSI: you might have noticed by looking at the video that the graphics are not state of the art, the passengers are a bit queer and every now and then you'll see scenery objects that are quite two-dimensional. That said, there is -NO- simulator as realistic and with the huge sortiment of maps and vehicles OMSI has. They have been quite slow in getting OMSI 2 stable and its engine is sort of outdated, but with a modern PC you can get a serious amount of fun even out of huge maps. Plus: the community has always been developing things for the community, that is: out of my 5-6 current standard maps only one is payware, and that one - Rheinhausen - is worth every bit. So don't mind the payware when testing, and if you like OMSI, it's a month's pocket money of a schoolboy compared to other DLC games like Train Simulator to get everything there is.If you like versatility in maps / bus repaints / buses, and if you like a real simulator, there's no way around OMSI 2. I wish Aerosoft were quicker in fixing bugs and they'd even develop OMSI 3 somewhere with a better vehicle AI and a better engine (you do smell the dust on it in the background). But it runs, and it's the only one that runs THAT content.			"

												Having played a couple of hours of OMSI 2 it was a little confusing at the start, there are many procedures to get your bus going and the controls are very weird so I would recommend changing them to the usual. WASD or whatever you prefer.Other than the confused start this game is a must-get if you are a bus fan or like to try out simulators.There are a few crashes and bugs that still need to be resolved but hopefully that will be resolved. Another thing, 3/4 tutorials are german but apparentlyh being translated to english soon so try and stick to the manual until the tutorials are english, that's if this is your language.  So if you're looking for a bus simulator and willing to get the best experience out of it, I recommend OMSI 2! If not then wait until the game is cheaper or in a sale.			"

												For many years, I've been searching for a bus simulator that has great graphics and is relistic. Bus Simulator 2008 : First bus simulator I've played. It was good but I didn't feel like I was actually driving a bus.Then OMSI The Bus Simulator came out and the graphics were not good enough to win me over but it was better than Bus Simulator 2008.Then OMSI 2 and OMSI 2: Steam Edition came out and when I found out about it, I was determind to get it so i got it as part as christmas. I installed it and tried it for the first time. IT WAS EPIC!It felt like I was driving a bus, the graphics on the buses are better, OMSI 2 is better than OMSI 1 and Bus Simulator 2008!I highly recommend you lot play OMSI 2 but if you don't like it, you have no ♥♥♥♥ing soul!OMSI 2 is love, OMSI 2 is life			"

												Omsi 2 is very realistic. Real weather connected internet countries gives realism. Real time play ensures you try to meet your schedules. Fully controlable vehicles, everything from lowering the step to adjusting the sun blind. The AI vehicles act realistic, like indicating one direction and going the other. They try to cut you up & cross lanes just in front of you. Go through red lights. Try & beat you at getting somewhere first. This is a real challenge with collisions turned on. However, buggy AI vehicles 'ghost' through themselves & tend to collide with you. So its probably best to keep collisions off ATM.Theres no company bosses to answer to. You just get in a bus, select a timetable & away you go!!! Or, if your like me, play a freelance driver. Set a destination, head that way & pickup or drop off whoever you come across. Theres no company bosses to answer to. This is only to mention a few things. Its practically a 'digital job' !!Flip side of that is its very slow for updates & bug fixing. I understand theres been internal issues going on causing these long delays. Still buggy a bit as mentioned and theres been an ongoing problem for many with Multithreading. Turned on makes the game more stable but at the cost of performance.Final notes:It is worth owning. Ive played many hours when been in the mood to 'work' this way.			"

OMSI 2 is full of many complex features you won't be able to find in many other simulators, such as:Realistic HandlingFully Modelled and Operational InteriorSelling TicketsSetting up IBIS Systems.This is the most realisitic bus simulator currently  available, it does have a lot of issues but once you look over those the game is rather enjoyable and with plenty of mods available for you to expand your gameplay entirley for free.

												It's great as a bus simulator. Terrible as a program.There's an undeniable amount of detail invested into the busses - and there are dlc's that add more detailed and up-to-date AI cars if you want, however if you're a fan of the classic '80's Volkswagen's, Citroen's and Mercedes' like me, then you won't bother. This comes onto my next point - the bus sim is set in a particular era that covers roughly a 10 year timeframe in Germany, from 1986 to about 1994 (give or take a couple of years).The games chosen era touches lightly on the relatively small, yet significant ramifications of the Cold War, from a bus drivers perspective. Travel to one edge of the map (Heerstr. Stadtgrenze) and you're met with the Berlin Wall. Load a map set in the late 80's and you'll find that wall has no way through it. Later versions of the map then load up a control point along the road to allow access to Falkensee Bahnhof. Information on the bus operations around that area is included within the game when choosing your preferred map versions, which provides a sense of education.Despite being someone who doesn't particularly indulge in the fantasies that bus enthusiasts seem to, I still found it somewhat interesting. I mean, I only bought it because I was taking driving tests at the time and have always wanted to drive larger vehicles such as busses and HGV's. Yet I found it somewhat obscurely compelling. Truth is, I don't much care for stopping every 5 minutes for passengers so I just drive around normally, only occassionally completing routes.However, that can still be intresting on its own. Learning how to change the display both on a rollsign and a matrix display system. Learning how to use an IBIS machine and even admiring the effort put into the detailing.As a game, it's surprisingly good from a non-enthusiasts point of view, and as a computer program, it's terrible.You really don't need to be a technician or in the IT business to realise fairly early on that the stability issues that the game faces are detremental to its overall delivery.Constant lagging, erratic glitching of cars, jumping busses cars falling through the map, buildings falling through the map, map dissapearing from underneath you leaving you driving on thin air until it magically re-appears again. All of this is something you will eventually come to expect when it comes to OMSI 2.The problem is, it feels like not a lot of structuring effort has been invested by the developers. It has a large fanbase with plenty of mod contributers who share their own bus models with eachother, but sometimes you feel like those fans put more effort into their work than the developers do into theirs. New dlc's come out regularly and when I first bought it, there weren't any available because it had only just been released. So it's not like it has been abandonned - you'd imagine they'd sort their existing issues out before releasing more DLC's that only bring a new load of bugs to endure.That being said, the bugs can provide humour at times, however with the standard demographic of OMSI fans being slightly older obsessive bus enthusiasts, those bugs have a higher chance of evoking aggression.So to round up - yes, I would recommend OMSI, just have Google ready so you can troubleshoot whatever obscure error it screams at you in German. The good news is that there's plenty of help available out there, given the colossal amount of bugs people have endured for god-knows-how-long.			"

												Omsi 2 is one of the few games which I still like to play after years. There are other bus simulators on the market, but in my opinion this one is absolutely the most realistic and enjoyable of all. Of course it's a simulator so you must learn to drive a bus, but believe me, it's not to difficult and if you have in the beginning some problems : there are plenty examples and lessons on you tube. Just be sure you have the right pc. 10/10			"

												This is really a good bus simulation game, it is a bit buggy, but you can create your own map and download many others' work. The AI is actually a little bit dumb. However the interior of the bus is really detailed. For me, it is the best to drive with mouse, but you can also use keyboard or a G27 to steer.			"

												If you like driving a bus and simulators then this is a game for you. Definitely it is a game for me too, but there seems to be some issues/bugs.After reducing threads (or what ever was that option called that the game itself proposed after the first crash) helped a lot to the crashing. It still has some random crashes but not too often. Sometimes you manage to lose open window somehow behind the game so that you cannot access it anymore and there seems to be no way to get the window on front again. Sometimes the game doesn't seem to recognize when you arrive to the last stop and then I have to drive a little loop to arrive the stop again. And the line destination setting doesn't work if you write the destination with all minor letters even it looks like that the destination is found from the drop down many correctly, cure for this is to open the line setting window again and press okay (since this time the game has set the minor/major cases correctly), if you fail to notice that you might lose passengers since they don't recognize the arriving bus to be their one.Still, after knowing these bugs you can get decent ""game"" play and at least I enjoyed it a lot. Driving ain't easy but you will learn it. "

												I'm a big fan of Simulators, and this one included. It's a really great game, Take Customers, Take Money, Give Ticket, Give Change, Drive, Load off Customers, do it all over again. The Game itself Runs smoothly with a steering wheel.And that's when we began the game, now we're getting a bit further into it.. (30 Minutes Later) The Map ending out of NOWHERE. People standing still many places and i mean STILL in groups. The Game crashes, Alot.The Control setup is lazy.With some more work on the Map and fixing a bunch of bugs would greatly improve this game, no doubt.I believe this game can become better, but is it worth the money right now?

												So I'm a fan of OMSI. It's the best bus simulation you'll find around as far as I'm aware.Whilst I do get frustrated by its (frankly) many bugs, I constantly find myself picking up my steering wheel (highly recommended) and doing a route or two.Whilst the graphics don't look very pleasing, the buses themselves are VERY well modelled, as well as their audio. As Nerd³ said, it's got quite possibly the best sound I've ever heard in a game.I've said enough, so here's some pros/cons:Pros:* Great simulation* Bloody amazing audio* Well modelled buses* Rather moddableCons:* Crashes a lot* AI leaves a lot to be desired. Pulling to the right, indicating to the right, then turning left, cutting me up and crashing into the side of my bus? Thanks mate.* Graphics engine leaves a lot to be desired.* Performance is mediocre at best.			"

												UPDATE January 2016:================================Almost two years after my initial review I revisted the game. Now having an Intel i7 4790k, a NVidia GTX 970, 16 GB of RAM and a fast SSD where the game is installed to. Guess what I still can't use shadows on any bigger maps and when I activate some weather effects like snow this also brings them down to below 20FPS making the game more or less unplayable. And that even though the system resources are only utilized to around 35%, clearly showing that the engine is the limiting factor. A clear sign for bad programming. Have a look at the following picture, it was taken on the Berlin map at Rathausplatz with shadows activated performing at 17FPS, a no go for a driving sim. http://a4g.eu/images/OMSI_Bad_Performance.JPGOriginal Review May 2014:================================Eigentlich würde ich den OMSI gerne empfehlen aber leider kann man dass nicht grundsätzlich. Nur wer einen leistungsfähigen PC, mindestens bestückt mit einem Intel i5 Prozessor hat und das Spiel auf einer schnellen SSD installiert, kann den OMSI in vollem Umfang genießen. Ich spiele auf einem PC mit AMD FX6300 und einer GTX560 Grafikkarte und habe das Spiel auf einer Intel Serie 520 SSD installiert und kann z.B. die Schatten im Spiel grundsätzlich nicht aktivieren, da die Performance dann in den Großstädten auch mal deutlich unter 20 FPS sinkt, was für einen Fahrsimulator dann doch zu wenig ist. Unabhängig davon kommt es beim Nachladen von Ressourcen, was regelmäßig alle paar Sekunden passiert, trotz der SSD zu heftigen Rucklern im Spiel. Die Grafikkarte wird hingegen nicht wirklich beansprucht. Es macht für die Performance keinen großen Unterschied ob ich z.B. Antialiasing deaktiviert habe oder ob ich 2fach oder sogar 4fach AA aktiviere, der Unterschied in der erzielten Bildwiederholrate im Spiel ist gering. Andere Spieler die einen ähnlichen PC mindestens jedoch mit einem Intel i5 Prozessor haben, berichten sie können die Schatten aktivieren und erreichen dann z.B. in Berlin am Rathaus immer noch Bildwiederholraten von über 20 FPS.Wer also einen modernen Intel PC (minimum i5) und eine Highend SSD besitzt und zumindest eine halbwegs aktuelle Grafikkarte sein eigen nennt, dem ist der OMSI zu empfehlen, alle anderen sollten sich bewußt sein, dass sie z.B. auf Schattendarstellung wahrscheinlich verzichten werden müssen.

The newest round of OMSI is here and this time their pulling up to all the stops. Yes, extremely bad pun, but here we go.OMSI 2 features three extra starter buses than the first edition, with two new starter types; single decker and articulated. Rumour has it, you can also drive trains, which is also an advancement from the previous. It's great to see such new buses on the game. The addition of the articulated bus means that other articulated buses will be coming soon as DLC packs, as they have done previously with OMSI.New damage features are also a cute addition. I managed to total my MAN NG272's (articulated) electrics after trying to hug a bus pole (see video above). Passengers have also been fixed so that they don't randomly decide to walk through your bus, while on the road there's new traffic types and features, and random date-specific roadworks.There are downsides to this game. There are still a few errors here and there, but few and far between compared to the original. The menu is hard to get used to, but once you do the ride is worth while. Negative for myself; if you're planning to record this game, it's hell trying to record these menus. Those things are like undercover agents.Whether you are a hardcore game player or a simulator enthusiast, this will be both enjoyable for the realist and hilarious for the hardcore players. It is a truley beautiful game and a pinnacle point in modern gaming, with realism exceeding that found in the Train Simulator/Railworks series. Get it now, don't be late!			"

There are also various bus mods for the UK and HK around which are also absolutely marvellous and nearly as good as the detail expressed on the original MAN buses built for the game.

												while many early reviews slam this game for instability and bugs, it has since worked out (almost) all of them. i have owned and played it since its initial release and even during the times of bugs it was and still is perhaps the best transit bus simulator. graphics are nothing to be wowed by but the gameplay is very detailed and realistic and more than makes up for it. it is also very customisable with lots of user and third party downloadable content, as well as an editor to make and modify your own maps and routes, trips etc.i still love this game, its predecessor and anticipate the next installment from Marcel and Janine in the coming years (LOTUS simulator)			"

												This is a really good simulator... But as with every simulator you are going to have to spend a but of money on it as the stock stuff gets boring quite fast.I did buy 1 DLC that was enjoyable but destroyed performace so I got a refund on that.Overall a good game but I am not sure I want to spend any more on it than I already have.

												I have just recently bought this game having watched many YouTube videos before taking the plunge. Of course this is exactly what it says on the tin! It is a bus simulator, so you are not going to get GTA style driving or crashing into vehicles on here like you would in the GTA games. This is for serious driving a bus only and quite rightly so. But I can certainly say that if you want the enjoyment of what it is like to drive a bus. I say get this game because there is a growing amount of add-on's available for this game in both payware and freeware DLC content forms. OMSI2 comes with two bus map routes which the first is Grundorf that is a small town/village and its ideal to practice learning the controls and most importantly the handling of the buses that are included in the game. The second city is the Berlin-Spandau map which has some freeways that you can thrash you favourite bus along if you want to have a bit of fun and there is a good amount of bus services that you can play as too.My only gripe about OMSI2 is that sometimes (maybe its a bug in the game) the buses can bounce violently at random times which can be annoying when doing one of the bus services on the map. The keyboard controls are a bit cumbersome at first. But the main thing to have when playing this game is patience and just have lots of practice when driving the bus until you become familiar with the controls. I would recommend purchasing a steering wheel and pedals for OMSI2 as it will make the experience much better. I do hope to see some payware UK bus maps become available in the future and also I would like to see a high quality payware pack of the Dennis Trident/Volvo B7TL Alexander ALX400 buses in all lengths and variants become available to buy as well as I would certainly purchase this add-on. Overall Rating: 82%.			"

In SummaryOMSI 2 is quirky and has its issues. It makes no secret about that, and honestly that's what makes it endearing. It's a product of that most wonderful human emotion; Nostalgia. With some simple fixes and additions it could be an amazing game, but as it is OMSI 2 is a worthwhile investment. You won't get this level of detail anywhere else and I see no reason why people shouldn't at least give it the benefit of the doubt, especially since the community is so dedicated to producing quality content to expand your gameplay.Expect:High levels of realism, lots of buttons and switches, to consult the manual to figure out said buttons and switches, passengers, german stuff, lateness, complaints about your driving, tons of addons (both official and third party), creepy kids.Do NOT Expect:A blockbuster thriller, Speed (movie or rate of movement), triple-A graphics, good AI, an easy time using keyboard, huge variety of anything without add-ons.LONG VERSION:OMSI is one of those games that is hard to describe to your friends. ""So what do you actually do?"" they ask, contorting their faces with confusion. The only answer that I can possibly suggest you give is the truth, plain and simple. ""Drive buses."" Because there is no one simple explanation which accurately conveys the catharsis of taking some virtual German people around Berlin while they do their day-to-day stuff (which for them means getting on other busses). It seems strange to be sat here recommending this. Even as a fan of truck and train simulators.From the outset OMSI can appear daunting. Even setting yourself up for a simple route can seem very complex at first glance when you are plonked into a very faithfully recreated 1980's MAN bus with a vast array of buttons and switches set out before you. I myself, refusing to give in to the apparently unmasculine urge to consult the relevant instructions, set about spending a good hour just flicking switches and turning things until, to my fervored surprise, the engine rattled to life.Success!"" I thought, this being the most progress I had made since I had first booted the game. It was a laughably simple step in the grand scheme of things, but represented the most progress I had ever made. After a few bumps and scratches as I lurched around attempting to wrest control of this double-decker behemoth, I decided that it was time for me to unleash my new-found driving prowess upon the unsuspecting folk of this quaint German village. And that's when I hit the next obstacle. Simply shouting ""Get on the damn bus!!!"" and honking the horn incessantly as the passengers stood, all gazing in the same direction with their arms half-out as if trying to take flight, didn't seem to do the trick. Nor did it help that when they did move, it was straight past me to the bus now parked behind. It occured to me I might need help. So off to the game manual I went, and after some practice runs I was doing the rounds on the historic Berlin-Spandau lines.Long story short, you will need to either consult the manual or any of the many kindly YouTube folk who offer tutorials on setting up your bus and carrying out timetables. It is complicated, but it all makes sense in the end.The base game comes with a number of routes around the Berlin-Spandau area, mostly during the 1980's. Seems very esoteric, but the developers rode the busses in this era frequently and recall it fondly. For me, that kind of passion is always going to create a game that will make me feel something, even if it doesn't have a story, it still speaks to me in a way that no cookie-cutter FPS can. On the face of it, the graphics engine is shocking, but the scale and detail in parts is beyond impressive. I've never even visited Berlin, but the recreation impressed me and the busses simply look fantastic... or as fantastic as you can make a bus look. Even the simple things like the wear-and-tear on the pedals and buttons that give the bus that lived-in feeling - makes them look like they are used day in and day out and not like they've just rolled off the production line. This is where I feel that other sims like Train Simulator and Euro Truck Simulator are lacking - the vehicles permanantly look new, they don't look like they've seen the years of service they are meant to. By your 20th job on ETS2, your seats really ought to be stained and peppered with sausage roll pastry flakes.Button BashingAs I have mentioned before, nearly everything in the bus is usable. Nearly all the dashboard switches, even if they have no in-game use, toggle and even have visible effects (such as the bus suspension lowering for disabled passengers and prams, even though there aren't any.) Even the ticket selling is there, the little paddles on the coin racks dispensing the respective amounts into the change rack, giving a little challenge. On top of staying on-time, you must give the correct tickets and change so the passenger can sit down and you can move on.Seat FillersUnfortunately the immersion is ruined quite quickly. The passengers are one of the two biggest let downs in this game (the second being the AI, which I will mention shortly). Unlike train simulators, you actually see the passengers get on your bus, even ask to buy tickets, but their animations are quite shocking, and their still poses even more so. Passengers stood at bus stops have their arms out from their sides and sitting passengers look like they are holding a beach ball between their hands. Passengers can often get in each other's way if they decide after they've walked halfway down the bus that they want to buy a ticket and queue-cut. Add to that the 5 or 6 variants, and you'll soon be sick of the sight of them.Artificial UnintelligenceNow, onto the AI. Any game that deals with driving needs to pay special attention. Simply populating the streets with cars is not enough by itself. The traffic needs to display awareness, not only of the rules of the road, but also awareness of other road users. OMSI traffic has neither. I will only say this once; Do NOT turn on traffic collisions. You will regret it immediately as the traffic is clueless. Unless your bus is directly obstructing them they will carry on regardless of if you are indicating or merging or just using a roundabout when YOU have right of way. Nearly all accidents will be their fault and you will be the one penalised. Yes, you get penalties. You have to notify the police and that will lose you valuable time making you irrevicably late for the rest of the day.In ControlThe controls for OMSI are a mixed bag at best. Playing keyboard only has been my MO since I learned how to play, and frankly I can live without precision steering. You can use the mouse to steer, but the constant toggling between using the mouse to steer and to use the dashboard is tiresome. I have been led to believe that a wheel is the best way to drive OMSI, but I neither have the time nor money for that kind of set-up.Not all doom and gloomIf you can see past all the quirks and niggles you will be rewarded with an enjoyable experience. The true value of OMSI lies in the third party content. There are a host of new maps, busses and other mods to expand your driving experience and add hundreds of hours worth of play time.If your wallet will forgive you, there are many official add-ons too, but don't expect any of it to be discounted. OMSI 2 is never involved in Steam sales and it will never drop in price. You have been warned!!!			"

												This is an EXTREMELY realistic game. The busses just have so much realism, its like im driving one. The other cool thing is currency in the game, when someone gives you a peice of money, I go into a scavenger hunt trying to find the right ticket and give them the proper amount of change. There is so many paint schemes for one single model of the double decker bus, I don't know which one looks better or wich one to choose. The game is awesome!			"

Posted: April 25, 2016
												Why would a real life UK bus driver want to play OMSI 2? I was curious about how things were in Europe and decided to try it out. After a lot of time and patience spent learning the ropes I decided it wasn't really worth the effort.The sim is somewhat unstable and needs a very powerful system to run it. My cheap 1 Gb AMD R7 360 graphics card gives borderline performance, but at least I can run most of the sim and DLC with it. For some reason Chicago Downtown is not playable on my system with frequent crashes after single figure framerates in the many traffic jams that are encountered. The bus models are excellent, as are the engine sounds, although the passengers are decidedly terrible. The AI traffic is passable, although perhaps a bit too predictable. Real life bus driving is not an exact science, as the sim seems to want to portray. What the sim does:- Tries hard to make the user believe he /she is driving a bus in service, dealing with customers and busy city traffic. What it doesn't do:- Any of the above.The sim is a very optimistic attempt to simulate bus driving, and the developers have to be commended for their efforts. The buses look and sound real, it's just that everything else does not. The door controls in particular are a chore to operate, and negotiating give way junctions into moving traffic is not for the fainthearted. I enjoy playing car racing games, but perhaps if I was a professional racing driver I would not enjoy them at all. If you like buses and fancy something different then give this one a go. You don't need a steering wheel to manage the buses. With a little practice you can even use your built in laptop mouse to steer.The big downer in this sim is that a bus driver needs to be able to see both rear view mirrors and the full width of the bus without having to press a button or a control device to achieve that. Sharp right turns mean that you need to change view to watch your nearside mirror as you turn so you don't mount the kerb or collide wth any street furniture at the location. Then having made the turn, you need to change back to the default forward view to proceed safely. I know this can be achieved with a POV ""hat"" type of controller, but it still means trying to do two things at once to achieve a safe turn. I cannot really recommend the sim, largely due to the instability issues and the need for a high spec system to run it. There is also a fairly steep learning curve before you can get up to anywhere near service speed.			"

												OMSI 2 is essentially the bus counterpart of ARMA 3.It's the damn holy grail of all bus simulators out there on offer, and gets things right, down to every little component.I could have put that $34.99 USD towards a shirt, groceries or the ""daylight robbery"" cost of schnitzel lunch at the local RSL, but I put it towards this, and it's great. I don't regret my investment.In slippery conditions you can do some fully sick peelouts in the default buses.9/10 lunch will have to wait, and it'll be a kebab from Nazaar's takeaway instead.			"

												Okay well I will explain the differences between OMSI between positive and negative! OMSI 2 is known as the best bus simulator going and the game invites you to realism and virtual reality. You get a huge map when you begin known as Berlin, Spandau a brilliant map for you to drive your most favorite bus lines and the fictional village Grundorf which is the small map where you can drive the line 76 to get used to the game. However, OMSI isn't quite positive as you probable thought.. it's performance engine! It starts with very high count AI Traffic (Non Playable Traffic) and it's poor frame rates per second. You have to do a lot of tampering with the settings to get it to the best performance your PC can handle. The most recommended application I would give you is the 4GB patch found on the NT Core website where you can find a lot of useful tools. Patch your executable with this and an extra 4GB will be added to your games memory engine. So overall I would rate the game:- Needs improving- 30%Review by ToM-Da-KiLLa--Xx			"

												If you love bus simulators, this is the game for you. There are a lot of people working on OMSI maps and buses which makes it having unlimited potential. You can find good maps for free on the internet, like Great Grundorf 2, UK map, Bad Kinzau 3 and etc. (Just naming some good maps, there are still loads of good map on internet)Buses are excellent to drive and some have computer on board telling you the status of the bus. The bus physics is quite nice to as you wont be able to make sharp turns under high speed.Though pc spec does matters when you are playing this game. I have a 2GB graphic card and still the game cannot load all the object of the map. A quad core CPU will be good for the game as I am using an i5 duo core, the game does lag sometimes and I need to restart my game when the FPS drops below 5. Anyways, this game is a must buy if you like driving simulators.			"

												This game has been out over 3 Years, but i cant´t get enough. Its one of the best Simulators out there, and even if you think that it costs over 30€, its worth it. Yes, 30€ is a lot, but you have to consider that this game is made by one person, the dlc´s by companies. The game is well thought out and you can have a lot of fun even without the dlc´s. A rather bigger problem is the bad coding, and you need a beefy pc to run it at maximum settings. The AI is (sadly) a bit stupid and has caused a crash or two, but it is okay and you get a better experience. If you want gameplay, or story you are at the wrong place. This game is by far one of the best simulators out there...Well, if you have 30€ to spare, go for it!And If you aren´t into the simulator kind of thing, i would look at Euro or American Truck Simulator...

												I have to say, off the bat OMSI 2 is a game which you can't necessarily ""Jump right into""- there is a learning, trial and error aspect to it respectfully.However, the base game itself, with no DLC attached, is very well put together- little details and niche aspects which you can fine tune and overall understand.There are tutorials, which overall do the job and get you to a sufficient level of understanding- so much to the point where you can start up a bus, 'tune' it to your route, weather and scenario you've selected- and off you go on your adventures!

												I really enjoy the driving with the bus. It is well done but there are some problems with the DLC's like the Rheinhausen DLC. It has a invisible wall. I forgot where it was but it was when you start to drive on the Autobahn (highway). Another DLC I don't like is the chigaco downtown DLC. The story is great but in the middle of any line my game crashes which I hate. So if the developers would fix that, that would be great and awesome. Overall the games really good.			"

												SUMMARY:You should buy this game ONLY if you have a liking for buses in general, in which case I recommend this game.If this is not the case, you should definitely NOT buy it.PROS: + This game's focus is totally on the simulation part, which bus enthusiasts would enjoy+ There is a lot of attention to getting each component of a bus right+ Various aspects of driving a bus being well represented and simulated+ The game is designed to be open to modifications, and thus there is a very, very large variety of free add-on buses, maps, and so on, by other players of this gameCONS:- For the average gamer, this would undoubtedly be a rather boring and pointless game; there is no excitement of the type common in other games- Game has rather poor graphics for a 2013/2014 game, especially for this price, and compared to e.g. Euro Truck Simulator 2- Performance is also rather poor, and one would need a rather high-end computer to run this well- Errors or crashes are still significantly more often than most games, despite all the patching since its release 9 months ago, even if you play only the default content- This game is also strictly single-player, with no possibility for multiplayer			"

												Best city bus Simulator to date. For absolute bus sim maniacs its has also schedeuled ai buses feature, which are driving with player on map, by default. Unlike in other bus games, where AI buses spawn shortly before player sees them with random linenumber and bus number, in omsi they are fully simulated, player can switch how many AI buses he wants on map. AI buses take passengers, just like player's bus. Whenever he likes, player can jump to bus controlled by AI, and take control, leaving his own bus to AI. Routes are long, some of them demanding, tight schedeules etc. Lots of fun.Day-night/weather effects also are implemented. Want to drive night bus, rainy/snowy day ? Did you know that wet / snowy streets change how ie. braking system works ? On a frosty day not setting properly air conditionig will cause passengers start to complain thet its to cold in the bus.Graphics may not look so awesome like in newest FPS games, but this one has unique setting and feel, and is highly detailed.Game has lots of player created maps and buses (search for them on omnibussimulator.de)  available for free, but also great paid addons, which add buses to whole game, and maps with loads of schedeules to follow.So, if You're bus sim fan - its recommnended, lots of fun awaits You,otherwise consider this as good but somehow specific game.

												The game itself is quite good. Nice detailed models, excellent sounds, and the additional maps that can be found on the Internet are good as well. However the one place this game fails quite badly at right now is stability. Just today this game has crashed at least ten times on me. Most of the crashes are completely random and out of the blue. I've had to restart my computer a few times to get it to stop crashing for at least a few minutes. When the game works it works quite well, however it is qutie an intensive game (more CPU wise than graphics wise). Like I said, the game itself is enjoyable, but the stability issues really bring it down on its knees.			"

												It looks awful and doesn't run well. The animations are horrible and the weather effects are crap. But there's just something about it that keeps you coming back. The detailed buses and sound effects. Selling tickets and giving change as efficiently as possible. If you've ever wondered what it's like to drive a bus or if you are just a fan of simulators, then yeah, get it.It's a shame that there really isn't that much content given the price and the DLC is quite expensive.

												Are you an ETS2 or ATS player, but you spent enough time driving trucks? Do you want to have a realistic driving experience without getting your hands dirty? Are you about to get your bus driving license? Then this is the game for you! Sure, it only has a few buses to play with and not more than two maps, but that's no issue! Bus mods are relatively easy to install, but the map mods are hard to install. If you don't want to mess around with the game's files, then you can buy one of the many overpriced DLC, like I did (and I'm regretting it). Anyway, if you do decide that cautious and legal driving is too boring for you, then this game is also for you! Sometimes, buses fly over the city and land wherever they want! And sometimes, the only thing that makes this game mildly entertaining is the fabulous traffic, which is more careful than your grandma when it comes to driving, prompting even the quietest driver to swear at the slow-moving cars!Graphics aren't the game's selling point, as they are inferior to, let's say, ETS2's graphics. They're fine, but nothing special here.In the audio department, this game is all right, but the passengers will start talking to you in German, which is a good thing if you even undestand the language. Luckily, I do, and they were comparing me to Michael Schumacher :)This game is not for the ones that seek fun from simulators, but the fact that it is so close to reality makes up for its problems. Do I recommend it? Sure. Would I pay for the DLCs? Never.			"

												OMSI 2 is a great bus driving simulator.  If you enjoy simulators or busses, this one is for you. It is difficult to learn in the beginning and given that many things are written in German, it can be off putting. However, once you get the hang of it, it is a load of fun. It is the closest thing to becoming a bus driver yourself. Positives and Negatives: +: A true simulator. +: The busses are well made, most of the buttons, dials and switches have function and even the driver-side window has a beautifully annoying squeaky noise. +: Gameplay options – You can choose the level realism you would like. You can opt out of ticket selling, you can opt out of collisions and choose if your bus will encounter technical difficulties making the game easier when just starting out.+: Active – While I enjoyed Euro Truck Simulator 2, the long stretches of road tended to put me to sleep. In OMSI 2, you mostly travel through cities, must pay attention to the route and stop every few minutes to let passengers on and off. +: I had also tried out Bus Simulator 16 the same time as OMSI 2, I found OMSI2 a bit more realistic in the sense that passengers didn’t always get on at every bus stop or off at every bus stop. Just like in real life, there is no need to stop sometimes. +/-: While focusing on being a bus simulator, the people are rather ugly in the game and look as if they’ve just witnessed a murder. It’s not really that big of a deal but…it’s there. +/-: While I enjoy the simulator, I might be nice to see a few other “game” aspects added in to make it more rewarding. Taking all the time it takes to go through a route, doing what you need to do, the only thing you get at the end is a timetable which shows you how punctual you were. While that’s all well and good, it doesn’t feel all that rewarding in the end. After that timetable, you can travel the same route but in the other direction. -: Price – It’s expensive and the DLCs are usually pricy as well. However, with Steam’s refund policy, this isn’t as big of an issue anymore. Buy a DLC, play it a bit and if you like it, keep it or just get a refund to try another one. -: Loading times can be long and the game can be rather buggy.-: There are many times I felt the tutorial was unclear and programming the IBIS can be a pain in the neck.-: There is still plenty of German in the game, which can make things difficult when you can’t remember all the buttons. Also, when programming the IBIS or using the bus modifications in one of the DLCs, the menus are all in German. It would be nice to see the game fully in English.I personally would love to see the game redone a bit so it functions better, becomes less buggy and is fully in English but I doubt it will ever happen. The graphics could be better but I feel the simulator looks good where it really needs it, making it easy to look the other way. All in all, if you enjoy simulators or busses, I think this one should be given a shot.  "

 Foreword I must confess, my old statement of :""This game... It had many freeware Add-ons, now all of them turn into payware. It also is very glitchy. Just don't buy it!"" was total garbage. Therefore I'm going to rewrite this review to be truly my opinion. General Impression It is a great game, easy to mod and easy to code. I could do it when I was a... let's say total noob at programming. (I would consider me a lil' tiny bit better now, in case you wondered). Now onto performance. Performance I wanted to get this out of the way as I have a PC whose grafics card (I suspect it is beacause of this) is about a dacede old in April 2017. It runs pretty great Berlin Spandau, Grundorf (why would't it), Sittingen and Freyfurt. These mostly are on highest settings I dare. But now I have a problem with Mainz, it only runs with the 2006 settings. But I don't mind it, as long as I can play. :steamhappy: Gameplay It has the greatest gameplay I've seen in a bus simulator I've played, I'm not saying Fernbus Simulator, as I didn't play it. It has loads of buttons to click. It has greatly created maps and greatly created busses which only add up for better experience. It even has a tutorial, I was amazed, at the time I hadn't seen a dedicated tutorial scenario!Furthermore later, I really don't have time now.			"

												OMSI is the nearest thing to a true bus simulator you will find. Its old! The graphics are not great, but good enough. The AI passengers are copies upon copies of a handful of characters. The traffic AI is stupid. I suggest setting no collisions!Other main newest bus sim is the new Bus Sim 16 it is defo a game, there are no-real controls like in OMSI.The nearest contender you will have seen me play before, (yes I am no newbie), is New York City Bus Sim.. Now that was good.. But it still is not as complicated as OMSI. OMSI is a great bus sim, if you want as true to life as it gets, It's not a 'game' as such, you will not just be jumping in and pressing go like in GTA!  This bus sim is relatively hard to learn, (one of the hardest games to learn), if not 'the-hardest' I have had the misfortune to want to play.   Nothing is simple in OMSI if you do not spraken de duch.Even the tutorials are worded from a German translation. Its not 'pass me the cup', (simple); it's 'cup me the pass'. All backwards like.  If you want a challenge, give it a go. The tutorials don't really make any sense and are not simple and straight forward.  You'll have to mess about until you learn what they really mean, then you will act like a clever♥♥♥♥♥and say, 'Oh yea - its easy!' (When you know how).  If you have never played OMSI and this is your first ever outing, the tutorial will say things like..  * You can see your driver file any time - but then not tell you how to access it.. *The map is selfcontained infrastructure and temporal classification... err - what the heck does that mean? And many more funny and annoying misleading statements.. The funniest of which I reserve to the last.. They say in the tutorial. Like they know something you don't.. You are going to quit regularly...They say: Tutorial 1.""To quit OMSI regularly, use the button - Quit OMSI"". - -Well, all that seems none straightforward enough.. Lets Play OMSI...			"

I have found that while driving in Berlin-Spandau, the bus tends to bounce around and passengers will want to get off your bus. It doesn't happen in the Grundorf Village though. DLCs for thus game are rather expensive but really good if you want to jump into the 21st Century. I would rate this game 8/10. It is great but not perfect.			"

												As a player of many simulation games, I can say hands-down that this is the best simulation game I have ever owned. No game have I ever been as engrossed into as this one. So let's take a look at what makes this game such a fantastic experience.OMSI 2 was developed by two German guys as the sequel to the very-popular OMSI. OMSI 2 is the only game in the series that was released on Steam, and because of that it has become the definitive version over the years.The driving experience itself is fantastic - it's very hard for simulators to capture the feeling that you're actually controlling a vehicle, but with the sound, weight and turning, OMSI 2 does feel like driving a bus. The most incredible part of this game is the sound, which could not be any better than it already is. Sound is an essential part of a game, especially in a driving simulator. Every sound you can hear is from real life - from the motor noise of each different bus, to the surrounding AI traffic, to simple sound effects - it's all taken from real life and implemented perfectly into OMSI. Each bus is modeled from real life, and everything you can see is clickable and has its own function.  With a game as open-ended as OMSI 2, you'd expect an active modding community, and fortunately there's plenty of it. Aside from the occasional payware DLC on Steam, which ranges from maps to individual vehicles, modders are constantly developing new buses and maps for you to download and play for free.Every game has its downsides, however, and OMSI 2 is no exception. To put it lightly, the game is quite poorly optimized. When it first launched back in 2013, it was barely playable, with crashes and bugs galore. It has since been patched many times and thankfully runs much better than before, but it is still prone to random freezing and crashing. Some maps, such as Projekt Gladbeck, are much more poorly optimized than other maps, like Berlin X10 or Hamburg.In addition, this game is incredibly hard to learn. Before you can start driving, you need to figure out the complex UI of OMSI to first load the map, then jump into an existing bus or place your own. That alone could take you ages. Then you have to actually start the bus, which on your first playthrough, will take you forever to figure out. You will randomly click things; you will try combinations of buttons to get something, anything running; you will probably become incredibly frustrated. And none of this is your fault, because the game doesn't tell you how to do things. There are four tutorials available, but they don't help much when you consider there are a couple dozen buses that come with this game (not to mention the hundreds of buses available through DLCs and freeware packs), and each bus is different from the next. If you expected OMSI to ease you into things gradually, similar to Train Simulator or Farming Simulator, then prepare to be surprised. If you don't concede to the manual, you will most certainly not figure everything out. But here's the thing: once you do figure out how to place a bus, start the engine, and program the route into the IBIS system, this all comes naturally. It may not seem like it the first several times you play, but you will get the hang of OMSI's UI system and how to set up everything so you can start carrying passengers.In conclusion, OMSI 2 is one of the very best simulators you can get, if you ask me. Don't let the optimization issues prevent you from buying this game. I've barely scratched the surface on what this simulator has to offer, because you just have to play OMSI 2 to really know what the driving experience is like. And with many payware maps available (with more to come, including London) and countless bus & map mods, OMSI 2 will never fail to suck you in.			"

												OMSI 2 is an amazing game! if you really like driving buses this is the perfect game for you.Its much better than all the other bus simulators out there.But i dont like the fact that it has no real goal, you just drive for fun.This game is not the most stable game in the world it sometimes freezes and lag and crashes especially when you put the graphics at high level. There a lot of maps and buses that you can download free from the internet.I recommend this game for those who like realistic simulator games.			"

												Amazing game. Great mod support. Only down part is the German, everything is German, also mods. As a Belgian I don't speak German amazing. But it's still worth the effort to understand. The graphics are like 6/10 but that doesn't matter much because of mods. Just like everything. The DLC is expensive tho. But there are also a lot of mods again. Like mods for everything.

												Ahh.. OMSI 2 it's a great game! First when I started the game I didn't enjoy it because I didn't know what to do!

												It may be a bit clunky or not that fancy, but this is the best bus simulator out there, mostly due to realistic bus physics and mods. Hell, I could find all real buses I like.The only downsides are:- Inability to walk inside or outside the bus, the driver is stuck to the bus seat.- Passengers don't talk too much unless they have to (you can drive like crazy and they will complain)- Collisions are not realistic, but as long as you drive well, you don't bother about it anyway- Performance and stability issues sometimes (4 GB patch + loading the whole map helps a little)Apart from that you won't find a better simulator.And I would not recommend it unless you are passionate about buses. This is not a game, but rather a simulator.			"

												OMSI 2 is a game where you drive some buses around Berlin. It's very simple, but still fun. Think of it as Euro Truck if it was instead a bus simulator.Now of course the graphics of the game aren't like a AAA game like Battlefield or anything. But since when are graphics the dictator of how fun a game is? The handling is actually like a heavy bus. Nothing will fly away like a paper airplane or anything like that. The sounds are also beautiful and don't get annoying.Simply put, OMSI 2 is relaxing, and is just a game to take your mind off of stuff. It's a simple idea, but is still kind of nice.So why am I giving it a bad rating? Well...There are some flaws that bother me, such as...- Finding your way around: At points I pull up to an intersection, and there is 5 arrows around... And I sit there wondering where to go... It's very confusing at points, because some arrows are misleading. I was going stopped at a bus stop when I saw an arrow point left. So I turned left and looked around for another stop... Apparently I was suppose to go forward at that intersection, but nothing said to go forward! They need to add a GPS where you just follow a line.- Lack of maps and routes: I was so disappointed when I saw only 2 maps... One map has only one route. Berlin has a few more, but they get old really quickly. I want to have some variety please! Want to know where to get more maps?-DLC: Where do I start... So the game is $35... Care to spend $350? 10x more than the game? No? Then don't buy the DLC... The DLC is severly overpriced since literally all they add is a few more maps and buses. Why would you spend 10x more than a game just to get more out of it? I have checked, the best you're getting out of the sale is around $300... As far as the steam price history website is giving me. I mean, it's ridiculous... I cannot recommend the game because of this.Save your money. Buy just the game if you want it, spend the extra 300 elsewhere.			"

												In development of this game MR Software wrote a lot of cheques, the game has not even cashed half of them. We were promised better optimisation, full backward compatability, and a complete overhaul of the game, to improve upon OMSI 1. We got none of the above. Sure we got a couple of new buses, the bendy is resonably cool, when the game works. It is full of bugs, lags to hell, and to use any user created content from OMSi 1 you have to be some kind of computer genius, which I am not. This is most definately not 'backward compatability' in my book. I am willing to give MR Software a chance on this (they are only 2 amatures after all) and wait for a patch, which they promised us by the 27th December (still waiting on 31st December, do they have a calender?), if that makes no improvement, (and lets face it with the game in the state it's in a total restart would be the best option) then I will be asking for my money back. I got a discount on this because I own OMSI 1 but its not even worth half of the £18.96 that I paid so you are a fool if you are considering spending £26.99. Overall, a reasonable concept, but very poorly executed, and good luck getting any answers out of the developers, they don't respond to E-mails unless they are in flawless German, which is extremely poor customer service if you ask me. It's not like we're paying to be insulted like this or anything.			"

I now getting better but I would reccommend them putting it into early access as this is still un-finshed game.Issue with the game are: 1:Unstable frame rate in centen area of the Map! What I mean by first omsi frame rate is 25% to 50% better but they sort that out soon.2:Grathic looks ok but can still be improved.3: The other problem is the devloper now what to make OMSI - finally for game console which is great but still need to sort out the some of the bugs like, Some time you press a button and it take long to reponds or waiting at the menu which stop work.Check out this to see the console version!http://www.omnibussimulator.de/english.htm "

 Omsi 2 This is the worlds most in depth and buggiest Bus simulator! It's really a hit-and-miss game. From th e first purchase, there's not much content unless you buy quite a bit of DLC. The vanilla flavor of the game has only a whopping two maps to drive your Bus in, and only a handful of different buses to drive, many of them seem to be repeats. How ever, despite the two maps, one of them does have many different routes for you to take, so that's nice. From my experience, the other just has one.This game does have a bit of a steep learning curve, and it did take me several attempts of picking it up and trying to go through the tutorials to figure out what was what, and then once I got that down, I had to try and set keys for my Logitech G27, which only added to the complexity, as you have more controls you need to be aware of for your bus then allowed on the Racing wheel's extra buttons. I'm not kidding, you literally control everything on the Bus. From doors to heating system, to interior lights to opening and closing your driver side window! Beyond that, driving a bus, picking up and unloading passengers is actually kind of fun. If you find a route that you like, you can find yourself sinking some time into this game, if you like running around in circles, that is. Of course you have to make sure you are not late, punch tickets, print tickets, give change to passengers, etc etc. The biggest thing that stops me from enjoying this game is that it crashes for no apparent reason with almost no indication of an update from the developers in the near future. The last update, according to steam, was in May. This really makes you wonder if the developers are doing something for this game or not, or if I've missed something.. Granted they are adding DLC but there has been reports of crashes happening still. There are mods you can download and add into this game, but I haven't dabbled to much. It might help you out, maybe fix the game crashes, but you should proceed with caution.Despite the game crashing bugs and the hard-to-learn controls, this game is .. Tolerable. Adequate. I would love to see where the developers take this game, but as far as I know, it's a hit-or-miss situation. Should you get it? Honestly, I wouldn't, at least not right now. The bugs in this game are to much to bare to really enjoy it. Believe me, I wanted to enjoy this game, but when it crashes in the middle of a route, I find that to be a little disappointing. You might have better luck then I do, and if you want to try your luck, go for it. Otherwise, I would stay away.			"

												------ Update 23/11/16 ------The game is likely as good as it's going to get now. It's relatively stable but some DLC maps can mess that up. The core, base game however is fine and runs considerably better than at launch. I'd highly suggest checking DLC pages for reviews before buying so you can gauge as to how that specific DLC performs. ------ Update 16/11/14 ------There have been quite a few patches now, and the game plays significantly better. It can still be hit or miss and even a high end rig will struggle to reach 60fps on some of the more demanding maps. However, the game is most certainly playable and is considerably more stable. Whilst it is buggy and still requires optimisation as well as a few other fixes, this is without a doubt the best bus simulator available and for that and the patches that have been released I am now happy to recommend this game.------ Update 21/06/14 ------The game has been patched and now plays rather well, however it is certainly not fully stable yet and I would now say it is back to the original OMSI standard. The developers are being a little more proactive, but not overly much.------ ORIGINAL ------AVOID! Right now it is in a very buggy state. The developers are not responding to any complaints. OMSI 2 is almost unplayable, the original OMSI seemed to run fine for me with a good steady 40+fps in Spandua, right now it is around 8fps and unplayable because the bus jumps around as if the road was a trampoline.

												While not the best simulation game in terms of graphics, it does however give plenty of hours of entertainment by allowing you to drive the various routes and buses of either Spandau in Germany or via free and paid mods from various sites. If you're bored of driving you could expand your 'fun' by designing your own maps and buses, thanks to M&R Software's wiki and SDK plus the free 3D application called Blender. Highly recomended and I personally enjoy it very much.			"

Modders have though gone down recentley...so has individuals playing the game. Developer needs to take action and sell or start over and recruit for staff.Very bad built up game, but whne you think of that only 2 guys for Germany made it, brilliantley well done, its playable!7/10 Recommend buying if your into simulation games!  ATTENTION: First few hours will be a downhill, configurating controlers and just starting the buss will take ages. For new simualtion players, I recommend ets2 first. Then if you like that, you will definetley like this.Worth every single penny!			"

												OMSI 2 is a realistic bus simulator. It's set in Germany in the late 80's and early 90's, and you can drive buses from that era. You drive on bus routes with a timetable, pick up passengers, sell them tickets, and drop them off at their destinations.Pros:Realistic controls. Each control on the dashboard does exactly what it would do on a real bus.Great sound effects. The buses sound just like they do in real life, with gear changes, shakes, bumps, etc. There are also some nice sound details like outside ambient sounds becoming louder when windows are open.Nice weather effects including rain and snow.Large variety of different buses to drive, including single deckers, double deckers, and bendy buses.Includes a map editor so you can edit existing maps or make your own.Various mods that add extra buses, maps, etc.Cons:No Steam Workshop support for mods.The English version of the game isn't fully translated, and some dialogue boxes are still in German.Performance isn't great. You might have to lower the settings on larger maps to get a decent frame rate. Even on a high end PC it struggles on max settings.The game can be unstable at times and randomly crash.Only 2 maps are included with the base game. There are some DLC maps but you have to buy them separately.Overall I would give OMSI 2 a 7/10. It's pretty realistic, but it can be unstable and does lack in content without buying DLC or installing mods. Though the game was only made by 2 people, so you have to give them credit for what they were able to make.			"

												This game is still very glitchy and crashes. When it crashes, its in German. Most of the Game is in German. So far, 1/4 tutorials is in English, so it's impossible to understand what to do. It also takes quite a bit of reading. The graphics still look fairly nice. I'm also impressed with the complexity and detailing of the buses. For now, I do not recommend.			"

												i bought this game because i had a really good experience with the original OMSI and wanted to try the articulated and single decker lowfloor buses if i could get my money back i would the game crashes  freezes glitches all in the middle of runs i can go from 20+fps to a crash in the blink of an eye for no reason the game just pops up with a fatal error and closes or just freezes and i have to force close it through task manager and everything says i should be able to run it just fine with my machine yet i have all these problems ive tried changing settings everything nothing helps it constantly even though i tell it not to reloads the ai and the map constantly causing even worse frame rate so in all i cant reccomend this game to anyone i have better luck with the original so i wasted $35 on this game money that could have gone towards other games and or dlc for now i guess ill just uninstall it on my pc oh well			"

												Still bug but getting their, I would wait until setember 2014 to buy this, It should be mustly sorted out.They are asking £26.99 which is Ok but why did they put it out saying it playble? I now getting better but I would reccommend them putting it into early access as this is still un-finshed game.Issue with the game are: 1:Unstable frame rate in centen area of the Map! What I mean by first omsi frame rate is 25% to 50% better but they sort that out soon.2:Grathic looks ok but can still be improved.3: The other problem is the devloper now what to make OMSI - finally for game console which is great but still need to sort out the some of the bugs like, Some time you press a button and it take long to reponds or waiting at the menu which stop work.Check out this to see the console version!http://www.omnibussimulator.de/english.htm "

												Hi Folks, this was awful to learn all that controls to be able to play, and especially for unpatient 8year old son, but it payed all back. This is incredibly realistic game and also good lesson for the 8 year old.. to learn to be paitent to understand that complicated things are hard to learn, but satisfy you much more after that. Now he understands that driving bus is not just turning steerign wheel as most simulators do. Well done developers, keep going wish to see maps of Prague one day.  "

												Yes bus driving does seem a bit tedious. Yes, setting it in late eighties to early nineties Berlin doesn't increase its sex appeal any more than announcing that Anne Widdicombe finally got a Brazilian either.However, there's something special about OMSI2 - Der Omnibussimulator 2, or simply put: The Bus Simulator 2 in English. It's truly magnificent if you want Germans to swear at you or if you want to waste half an hour on figuring out what ""Ernerungsterif"" or""Betriebsfahrt"" means. It'll leave you frantically skimming though the manual as you try and figure out why the bus all of a sudden seized to move (curse you, auto kneeling mechanism), however all is forgotten the moment you roll out of the depot on a dark Sunday night as you make your way to your first stop though the calm Berlin streets. There's nothing quite like driving a night bus in BS2, your passengers, albeit few and far in between, really gives you a sense of satisfaction. Sure the passengers has about as much excitement and enthusiasm as the performers in a strip club has during their 9AM Monday morning performances but they still sit there in your bus, quietly waiting for their destination, they leave you thinking about who they really are. Is the younger chap five rows down making his way across town at his lovers behest.The technical aspect of BS2 is less so, it crashes as frequently as Lindsey Lohan runs out of cocaine. The graphics is about as exciting as a carton of milk is to look at, you're lucky to find a tree with at least one polygon and god forbid you leave the carefully designated routes as you will encounter the sky dome with no warning whatsoever if you do.BS2 shouldn't be good, it shouldn't make me want to play it for hours on end, but something about is just so appealing. Maybe it's because the two people (really, two people made this) made this game purely based on the fond memories they had when they rode on the buses operating on the Berlin Municipal bus lines 25 odd years ago.It's pure nostalgia and passion, the audio side of the game is nothing short of perfect and the game itself is nothing short of amazing. It doesn't take more than a minute or so behind the wheel of my bus of choice before I'm sitting feeling quite content with life.The review submission page asks whether or not I recommend this game. Yes, BS2 is as polished as Battlefield 4 is and still are. Yes, it really is about driving a bus.It's not for everyone, but I do recommend this in a heartbeat if you have even a vague desire to play this.I do, however, feel that I need to add more requirements to the list provided by the publisher:You need a gamepad, preferably a wheel in order to drive in a way that doesn't look like you've had 6 racks of beer and 7 bottles of vodka.It's also based in Germany so there's quite a bit of German language involved. They do have transcripts of what type of ticket the passenger wants in English as well as a manual and quick reference guide. But every single switch, knob and control interface on the buses are in German, good luck figuring out what a ""Regler Heizlüfter vorne"" or a""Nebelschlussleuchte"" is. The quick reference guide will save your life when you're in a bus full of people at FreudStrasse that won't move an inch.			"

												This has the potential to be an amazing game if they cared about it and started to do some development, there has been no changes to the endless amount of bug since Feb 2014.Since i have owned it nothing seems to of changed.For Example.... One bug where your bus decides to do a ninety degree spin out, this happens way to much.I would also advise anyone looking to buy this game that it is over complicatedly and way to expensive for what you get, in the real world i would pay 4.99 for game like this, purely because there are only 2 working routes when they work properly which is not very often.If the development team was to see this i would love to know why nothing is being done,and ask why everything is only in German and not translated in to other languages, and when will you start to fix some of the many bugs and why is the price 26.99?Would i recommend buying this game to a friend?

												This is an interesting game. It is both brilliant and terrible. Let me break it down for you, the gameplay is amazing, it is very realistic driving (even with the mouse and keyboard), but it had some issues too. The game is not really optimised, so you will not be having the highest frame rates, but since not much is going on, it is not much of a problem. Additionaly, alot of things (errors messages, some tutorials, and other things as of this time) are in German, so you might have some issues there, though it is constantly getting better in English so I do not see this as a problem. My last complaint is that the menus are not very good, and it is confusing to learn how to get around them. Now on to the good stuff. The driving is excelent, and it is just a very good game if you are willing to put in the time to learn how to use it properly. I would definatly recommend this to anyone who likes simulators, and has the money (as it is $35). I would not recommend this game to anyone who already have OMSI 1 (as there are not many changes), or who is not that into this type of simulator, there are many others out there to make sure you like it first. In conclusion, this is an advanced simulator for people who have the time any money, and really like simulators.			"

OMSI 2 is set in germany but with many other maps that are downloadable you can go to many other countrys. The DLCs are very pricy but if you buy them you will most defiantly be happy with it. There are many other buses that can be downloaded from the web and DLCS so you won't get bored.

Posted: October 6, 2014
												Okay so my first take on this game is that its riddled with issues. Right from the very get go you are left completely wanton, now i realise that this is a german sim but come now guys not everyone speaks german, what use is it of me downloading an english install only to have everything in german (one demerit). Okay so moving on seeing as there is apparently no way around this, next we have the interface, while it could be a little bit more userfriendly and perhaps presented in a more visually appealing way after playing around with it you should be able to navigate it with relatively minimal stress, which brings us to the tutorials, while relatively straight forward actual translation of that information becomes somewhat cumbersome because the keys are not quite mapped as described in the tutorial (Shift Z for example is actually Shift Y). So alas feeling rather chipper with myself having ever so painfully navigated the first few steps i find myself confronted with a situation which requires me to pan the camera in order to view a certain piece of equipment, now take into consideration i am using a laptop which has no center mouse button an up to which time i was dreading not to have to come across such a situation so needless to say dead in the water. Now the point been here that that while there is some kind of game controller customization (ie, key mapping etc albeit very limited) there appears to be no hat switch functionality, further more precise tuning for racing wheels such as the driving force gt and so on which have 900 degrees of turning radius more or less is extremely lacking and to be quite honest borders on non exsistance. Okay so resigning myself to the fact that it'll take me forever and a day to actually do a successful trip (passngers the works) i decide to just jump into the game based on what little info i've manged to muster up and here goes im in the bus its actually running and in gear everything seems like we good to go so give her the gas and bam im bouncing, crashing scrapping the whole works, more like a rodeo than a bus ride okay so i let things settle down a bit (apparently if you crank the graphics settings too high the game goes beserk all this despite having a more than capable machine so lower the settings and things seem to be a bit better, now just to perhaps say something obvious, im paying for an experince in its full glory and not some half blur world and footlong draw distances but anyway moving on...) so driving along now everything is just dandy trying to get a feel for things go and step on the brakes and half near fly out the windshield (theres that pesky precise game controller tuning thing again) so basically you want to use the brakes with without actually using them hmmmm go figure. So In a nutshell ive owned this game for two days and thats about the progress ive made, esentially as much progress as a moss growing up the side of an old english castle wall. Now before the naysayers get all excited i am yet to try it out on another machine which is more than a monster enough to push the graphics, did i mention that the laptop is no slouch either btw pretty sure i did but anyway thats that. For the record i am a hardcore die hard sim fanatic so pls reserve otherwise personal vendettas to your loo, i know the benchmarks of great sims and this one while it will have its second day of rekoning with me on a different machine at which time its final judgement will be passed as it stands i give it 1.5 out of 5. Money badly spent.			"

												it is like you are driving a real bus. The looks and the sounds of the buses are good. It is easy to drive a bus on it does take a little while to get to know the controls but it is very good.			"

												This game looks great in the preveiws however the game is extremely slow and freezes a lot. The graphics are good however I havent been able to play very much because i have to keep restarting the program or my computer in order to get it to work. I also find that the first titorial is in english but the rest are not so it is hard to figure out the game when the directions are in german.			"

												It's brilliant!... when it works. Joking aside, this is a really realistic simulator but it's still horrible prone to bugs and crashes. Still I would recommend it, just be prepared to have to change settings to get a stabler game and compromise when something goes wrong.EDIT: As of the last few weeks I have been completely unable to start the game. I am working on a fix for this problem, and I will post up a solution when I find it.			"

												If you have a french keyboard, forget about it... I spent eons trying to figure out why the parking break would not release :(.Once I finalled figured out how to get this thing moving (note that it seems impossible to finish the tutorial even if you remap the keys before starting it), because it seems to wait for you to push ""."" which is impossible to do on a french keyboard, as you need to push shift to get a . .

												a good simulator that could be awesome if it would be patched up more, some sort of instruction to easier set up you're wheel buttons would be good as well,but overall a good simulator with mod ability.EDIT:a warning is in place, after little driving and testing i found out that, the further i got in the game the more i realised that this dam game is one of the more buggy games i bought in yrs,it's not even half done and should still be in a pre alpha stage,people are walking into eachother, when you drop them off they walk trough the bus,FPS set on 30 and its hacking like hell etc etc,and the little help you got in their forums are pretty much nada, 99% are in germany, i know i can use google translate but sometime it's just too much,there is a 2.2 patch on the way,but 2 of the devs,and obvius ""bestfriends"" are not best friends anymore and the longing 2.2 patch seems to be written in the stars when it shall come.....................so friends,if ya wanna buy this game, wait for a sale or at least wait for the 2.2 patch ( not certain it will good after that either ) !!71.97 euro i payed for main game and 2 DLC..........worth maybe 1/3 of that !

I am dissapointed in this game. the trailer looked so much better and way more promising than the actuall game its self.			"

												Simply the best bus simulator available at this time. Several rules apply though if you want to enjoy it:1) Be a bus simulator fan - if you aren't stay away. This isn't a fun car driving game! In fact it can be rather clunky... ;)2) Have a driving wheel - without it, there simply is no point as keyboard controls are annoying at best.3) Read the manual!!! - If you won't setup the bus correctly it will not register the stops on the route etc. Destination codes, routes and line codes is what you're looking for.4) Do not try to go outside of the routes - ""City Car Driving"" is what you need if you want to explore - otherwise, plenty of dead ends and ""ends of the world"" await.Pro tip: Check out the online community for this game (and OMSI 1) if you want more maps. There are tons of them! "

												It's a great game, it has a lot of potential, one of the main issues is that so little of the game is in English, most of it is in German, little to no tutorials on the game, which does make it very difficult. For now, untill they start speaking more English, getting a 5/10 from me. Say, you want to download a mod in the download section of their forum, English speakers go to the English part of the forums, it's like a desert or a glacier, absolutely nothing there. -1- thread, then you head over to the German section, a 127 threads. The game is great, just needs a little work on the language. For now, untill they start speaking more English, getting a 7/10 from me.			"

												Take no notice of the bad reviews. These are mostly from people that don't want to put the time and energy in that's required to learn how to play OMSI2. Many of them claim to have decent machines to play OMSI on, well they don't because buses that jump and down only happen on low-spec PCs. This is a simulator and not some kind of dirt rally driving game. This is as realistic as it gets as far as bus simulators go and to be honest, this really is the only one of its kind out there at the moment. You have to learn how to select your route and line (Bus) number. You have to learn how to operate the buses because nearly every switch and button is modelled to work like the real buses. You have to learn how to use the ticket machine e.t.c. In other words, you have to read the PDF manuals and watch YouTube videos to help you familiarise yourself with the game.The physics and sounds of the bus models are pretty darned good with suspension and the buses rattle and shake when driving over rougher roads with broken tarmac and pot-holes just like in real life. There are automatic announcements on some routes and you can even download the current real-world weather to drive in.There is quite a lot of paid DLC to expand with more routes and more buses including lots of freeware maps too. The game is of course pretty old now and is not really optimised for todays PCs as it's only 32Bit and limited to 2Gb of RAM which is why you need to download the seperate 4Gb patch but its still a perfectly good working game and lot's of fun.

If your looking for  SIMPLISTIC video game experiance, leave this page and try finding Flying Beavers, being shot at by Larry Lowerli[p.If you have the patience to become a German Bus Driver.  This game is for you.  70 hours later, I am still learning new things. The learning curve is very harsh. But as my Dad used to say. Anything easy is not worth, chicken poop. My biggest gripe is, as I contimue to download various addons, all the bus variants, from the previous downlaods and add ons, become non important, and trying them in a load without busses sceanario.  They become unimportant and the game crashes. I see nothing wrong at all, with utilizing a City Bus Add on, City bus shalter bus, in the Berlin x10 Add On, Yet the game is a puzzed by this intervention, as it s, when you choose a Lions Bus to cummute  from The Boetterich Bakery to Der Bahnhoff after these Aholes got off of Thris♥♥♥♥♥♥  Yet none of them will board the Lions buis.

												OMSI...Bus driving, Second Version, no big changes, but the small features that have been added to the game or one hell of a joy, articulated busses, new route on Berlin, better UI (you might say something different about it) and...that was about it.Starting off, in the release version, it was total crap, it was not optimized at all, it would always go nuts and crash or lag like hell, now though that it is in version 2.1 it feels much more optimized, and I get very nice 60FPSIf you will just buy the game to drive some busses and have fun, you're kinda wrong about fun, it's a more serious simulator, a simulator that really simulates bus driving, so you have to do every little thing on the Dashboard right to get the bus moving, and if you don't...good luck finding the problem.UI, that's another topic, on start it's VERY confusing, you will have to memorize them since they're only some big buttons with something painted on (like a cloud means Weather, a bus stop means select Route and stuff like that) You will get used to it sooner or later.Steering, that is one hell of a big thing for Keyboard users. The steering is relative heavy to use for Keyboard but VERY easy if you have a steering wheelm you're set.The Tutorial for english was very broken at the start, but if I'm not wrong, they should be fixed now I think (Not sure)Sound is perfect above perfect, it's perfect, they're really nicely made, and I never saw any flaws with them, the quality is amazing, and like every sound.The Graphics are a mixture, the Bus self is VERY detailed, but the outside like the streets and buildings are a total meh, so you can tell by that, this game really fixated only on the bus and AI Busses, nothing really else.TL;DR                User Interface: 7/10                                  Steering: 8/10                                     Sound: 10/10                                  Graphics: 7/10  Addition from previous game: Nothing big, new route, articulated busses, that's about it.I recommend that game to everyone, it's more stable then the release version, the additions are nice but very small, but it has articulated busses, that's the best part in this game.

												If you have the vaguest interest in bus driving or just simulation its self I recommend picking up a copy of OMSI 2. Sure it crashes a little and can be buggy but it is a very accurate simulation and perfect for a bus fanatic.If you are not so into bus driving it can be a bit daunting at first but after reading the instructions (yes all 100 pages of it) and completing the tutorials you should be fine. There are also many add-ons for OMSI 2 that can add more busses and maps.Well, to make things shorter, OMSI2=g00d~Frosty			"

												OMSI...Bus driving, Second Version, no big changes, but the small features that have been added to the game or one hell of a joy, articulated busses, new route on Berlin, better UI (you might say something different about it) and...that was about it.Starting off, in the release version, it was total crap, it was not optimized at all, it would always go nuts and crash or lag like hell, now though that it is in version 2.1 it feels much more optimized, and I get very nice 60FPSIf you will just buy the game to drive some busses and have fun, you're kinda wrong about fun, it's a more serious simulator, a simulator that really simulates bus driving, so you have to do every little thing on the Dashboard right to get the bus moving, and if you don't...good luck finding the problem.UI, that's another topic, on start it's VERY confusing, you will have to memorize them since they're only some big buttons with something painted on (like a cloud means Weather, a bus stop means select Route and stuff like that) You will get used to it sooner or later.Steering, that is one hell of a big thing for Keyboard users. The steering is relative heavy to use for Keyboard but VERY easy if you have a steering wheelm you're set.The Tutorial for english was very broken at the start, but if I'm not wrong, they should be fixed now I think (Not sure)Sound is perfect above perfect, it's perfect, they're really nicely made, and I never saw any flaws with them, the quality is amazing, and like every sound.The Graphics are a mixture, the Bus self is VERY detailed, but the outside like the streets and buildings are a total meh, so you can tell by that, this game really fixated only on the bus and AI Busses, nothing really else.TL;DR                User Interface: 7/10                                  Steering: 8/10                                     Sound: 10/10                                  Graphics: 7/10  Addition from previous game: Nothing big, new route, articulated busses, that's about it.I recommend that game to everyone, it's more stable then the release version, the additions are nice but very small, but it has articulated busses, that's the best part in this game.

												If you have the vaguest interest in bus driving or just simulation its self I recommend picking up a copy of OMSI 2. Sure it crashes a little and can be buggy but it is a very accurate simulation and perfect for a bus fanatic.If you are not so into bus driving it can be a bit daunting at first but after reading the instructions (yes all 100 pages of it) and completing the tutorials you should be fine. There are also many add-ons for OMSI 2 that can add more busses and maps.Well, to make things shorter, OMSI2=g00d~Frosty			"

												This is not your Euro Truck Simulator that you can jump in and everything is easy. It's like the PMDG of the flight sim world, abeit a little buggy. The depht of simulation is incredible. The detail is amazing, and although the graphics are not cutting edge, it's more than enough to satisfy most players. If you are expecting this to be like Euro Truck Simulator, or Train Simulator, or something that is relativly  from the start, you might be a little overwhelmed by the details and the complexity. The pride though of finally understanding what you are doing though, and completing your first route is enough to make you want to try it again. Different times, weather conditions, and busses in the base gamae alone are enough to provide varying gameplay to keep you amused. If you like detailed sims, this is one for you. It's challenging, but can be really fun. One of the best true simulators on Steam.			"

												Sorry, even with up-to-date hardware and SSD this game needs decades to load and runs with about 25 fps ... best case. I do not know what to do.Except the horrible performance, the busses are jumping and do not stop, even will brake full applied. You glitch into things and road signs have too big hitboxes. I do not recommend this game at this point, in fact I never did before.The first game (OMSI 1) was way better, except that there is no support for articulated busses.			"

												As a fan of city transport, trains and simulation games, I can recommend this game.But,there are some problems that are slightly ruining experience from this simulator. I mean crashes. They are everywhere. When the tile (part of map) next to you is loading,when you´re placing a spline in editor - error pops up. I've seen a crash in editor - ""program OMSI2.exe has stopped working"" out of nowhere. The bad thing is, MOST of errors are written in German language.I shouldn't just hate this game.So,there are many good things i like. For example,better optimization. The game uses 2 cores of CPU (which is not the best, but for single-player only game it´s good). And the articulated bus.The joint of the bus is very realistic and works almost like in real life.And the main point of simulations - mods. Since OMSI 1, the game is very highly moddable and comes with its own map editor and downloadable development kit.You can make your own busses from your city, make your own city or make fictional city. Or - just download them, choose a map, spawn a bus and go.Default busses works as in real life, most of controls works as they works on real busses. Sounds have very high quality.Pros:-High quality of default busses and maps-Supports many kinds of mods-Upgraded performance in comparsion with OMSI 1-Compatibility with lots of mods from OMSI 1-AI cars has their own engine soundAnd more that i can´t remember....Cons:-Crashes and errors-Errors are written in German, so I can´t understand that-Stupid AI (they don´t stop and crash into your bus on intersection without traffic lights)I recommend, 75%.

												Great simualtion!! Not seeing Berlin in my life i know how it looked in the past. the game has tonnes of features, control the weather, the time and the AI. Settings whize the game is aswome. The settings give you full control of the AI. overall the game is 10/10. One of my favourte features is the wide range of vehicles you can download and use. The game has aswome community. if you need help with something some one will usally have an answer. THIS IS THE BEST BUS SIMULATOR I HAVE EVER PLAYED.			"

												Pros:+ Three different modes of ticketing. (Nothing, Easy & Advanced)+ Almost fully functional ticket machine and IBIS system.+ Several bus models. (Single-decker, Bendy-bus &  Double-decker).+ Several bus customization. e.g. Adverts on the exterior.+ Lots of DLC's (Not Cheap!!!).+ Multiple Languages!+ Controller and TrackIR support.+ Many more cool features.Cons:- £26.99 base selling price.- Two small maps in the base game.- 1x Single-decker & 1x Bendy-bus.- No custom exterior options.- Very few passenger models.- No driver model customization.- Poor AI.- Very few routes.- German in-game labels with no other language labels.- Few other faults.I'd say it's just good enough to have that £26.99 price tag on steam.

												The original concept of the game was to simulate bus driving in the 1980s. It does that very well  and the game gained a well deserved cult following, considering it was originally developed by 2 students. Since then big business have bought the rights, and turned it into a cash cow, churning out reems of DLC which, for the most part, are utter garbage.I used to play this game, and actually like it, once I spent a few days figuring  out how to access the starting  points and through trial and error match which busses drove in which cities in which eras.All of this adds not so much to the charm as much as it does to the frustration. Recently I got a widescreen monitor and a muscled up my GPU to more modern standards. For some reason dialogue boxes now dissapear behind the game making them inaccessable; forcing a reboot. This is a known bug on some systems, and 'unfixable'. It sent the game over the edge for me making it unplayable. I mean in 4 hours I must have gone through 30 reboots ?  It was hard enough dealing with the unfriendly user interface, the lack of English and trying to figure out how to enter and drive an overcomplicated adaptation of what originally must have been a very efficient series of German bus routes. This game may have been worth buying at some point when it originally came out and the quirks could be excused in the name of 'indie development'. In its current state and at its outrageous price point, they are simply taking the♥♥♥♥♥♥  If you want to get into Bus simulators and you are a beginner, this is definitely not the game. Get Bus Simulator 2016 - Though the driving experience does not come close to OMSI, BS2016 is far more accessable, a lot more forgiving, and easy to have fun with. Also the game is actually in English.			"

												If you want an in Depth Bus Simulator with Realistic Operations and functioning parts then this is the Bus Simulator for you.The Omsi series has a variety of routes and maps and a large community who regurarly make and update mods. The game itself has alot of detail in operation of buses and the malfuctioning of vehicular parts which take time to address. Fully functioning Ticket systems and much more.Would suit the more advanced players out there but also very easy for anyone to play and understand.Out of all Bus Simulators, the Omsi series is definatley one of the more complex and advanced ones out there, for everyone to use.

Where I could've gone on TS2014 and bought the London - Faversham pack for £25, but nope, the bendy bus & single-decker buses lured me into buying this game, hoping that my new TOSHIBA Windows 8.1 laptop would've been better than my previous one, in Grundorf its 25 fps which is great, but the map is boring and small. It always seems to bounce up and down near the Spandau station. I wish I could go back in time and made myself not buy this absolute waste of money ""trampoline"" game.			"

												This simulator is pretty detailed and fun. Takes a while to get going but the tutorials help even though there are one or two errors in the tutorial. It says to press shift Z but it should be SHIFT Y! Also the POS1 key is actually the HOME key.However once you get going its quite realistic, the sounds are very good, you can press all the buttons in the cockpit and they work, lots of various views including allowing the AI to drive the bus whilst you look round lol.Very good and recommended , needs a bit of refinement with the tutorial. hopefully we can download more maps in future for different countries. I did a 2 hour video with a number of DLC routes here. The routes include, Chicago, Hamburg, Vienna 2, X10 Berlin

												If you want to take a trip into berlin in the 1980-1990s then this is an ok game for you. however the game has put most of its time in making the actual bus in fantastic detail which i do agree with but the scenery and cars are a bit under developed. but i dont really care about that. OMSI 1 was a great game and still is but OMSI to is extremely buggy. so much so that the game does have to crash sometimes before it works. However with new patches and updates that hopefully come out to fix these problems once again this game will become great. I know that you can do it MR software as you have proved with OMSI 1. Anyway if you want a simulator with a fully working M.A.N bus with bendys doubles and single deckers this is for you. Roll sign and the modern electric signs with fully work IBIS. I personally love to play this but I WANT to see improvments to the buggyness of this game!			"

												If you are here for a simple sim...this is not for you. If you have an interest in busses and how they actually work, this is for you. If you are an aspiring bus driver or just someone with an immense knowledge of these massive vehicles, this is the game for you.You control everything, the bus (doors, passenger comfort, anything that can be opened or switched) , the climate (to the specific detail even) and even what happens. If you only want to enjoy the Vanilla OMSI 2, that is all fine and dandy, it is excellent in vanilla, (aside from a few hicups here and there) but the full experience comes from modders who are bus fans like the creators of the game.I personally like the MAN NG272, which has superb sound effects, but if it was out of addon busses, it would go to the Mercedes Banz O530G Citaro and the Volvo 9900 Coach. Both are great and work greatly. The Volvo even goes as far as using MOBITEC Destination Displays with the MobiICU400.A game truly for the bus fan, one which gives you the most control over your environment and vehicle. If you are here for a simple sim, you might want to try City Bus Simulator 2012 or City Bus SImulator Munichen by Astragon Software. (A much simpler sim, but boring for someone like me) OMSI offers a real challenge and is worth every last cent/penny			"

												If you are able to get this game running and avoid crashes and freezes you will enjoy the Simulation off driving a bus,sad to say I can not even get the BERLIN x10 map to load just freezes,I drove acouple off routes but it crashed to many times to enjoy the game.That was just on OMSI 2 not any add ons.I have 980TI G/C  i7Skylake CPU 16GB Ripjaw RAM and can not run the game I have tried some off the solutions but none work for me.I have just been trying to play the game for the last hour and nothing,tried the Hamburg map and ended floating in a blue square.I can program the ibis select a route but not able to drive it,going to delete the game and not come back to itIf i could  play it i would have given a good score but i can not.Maybe its my PC it does not suit the game.I have a Predator 32 inch with high res and the Witcher 3 looks and plays amazingly well as does Skyrim.Be WARNED YOU WILL HAVE PROBLEMS trying to play this game if you do buy it hope you have more fun than me,and may the Gaming force be with you .Hope Fernbus sim comes out befor Decenber then the OMSI devs may have to do something to give us all a stable game we paid for, to me its been a waste off time and money.

												I'll be short and sweet because everyone wants to be a critic and feel like they need to detail every little thing in a movie or game.  Well here is the short of it.I was hesitant to buy it 6 or so months ago due to price and graphics looking iffy.  Watched a youtube  video and even that said somthing about it being good but complicated.  So i waited.All I can say is I need help!  I can't stop playing it.  The sounds are phenomenal, the every button works is awesome.  I haven't setup my TrackIR yet, but i plan to, but even without it... it's awesome fun.  The graphics aren't the greatest but they're not horrible.  I don't even notice it anymore.  It's just relaxing fun to drive around and pickup passengers.I own the base game and three generations.  Both, I highly recommend.  I plan to get all the DLC.I simply wish there was more maps and buses to choose from.  It does have a learning curve but not much of one.  Getting over the trying to figure out German when I have no idea what anything says was difficult, but I finally know my ZEIL CODES! Highly recommend this simulator if you're a simulator fan.  I own and really enjoy Euro Truck Sim 1 and 2, I've seen questions asked. Though Euro Sim is great fun, it's not really comparable.  Stop reading, go buy.  It's worth it's full price when you consider some of the junk you've likely wasted money on that turned out to be just that... junk.			"

												If you are addicted to simulator games and You play them a lot I recommend you play this game If not Then You might not like this game but Once you learn how to drive the buses in this game its much easier to drive the buses and this game is better than bus simulator 16 cause its more harder then bus simulator 16 and thats what makes it realistic So i recommend this game for people who are into buses and who like realistic simulators.

												Good driving simulator in general but could do with some bug fixes. If you like driving around for fun in a complex driving simulator this is for you if you don't remember controls this is not the game for you I would recommend a steering wheel but might need to adjust sensitivity a bit. Me personally find it easier to use the keyboard controls but everyone is different. Hope you found this review helpful and HAPPY BUSING!!!			"

												Although this game has some crashes, I found something that some buses I don't noticed before.First of all, I was planning to make an mod for MAN D90 and D91 in OMSI 1, I don't excepted to developer would add these buses into the games, finally when I choose the bus to drive, I found them in the menu, how surprise.On the another side, the entry menu and user interface are user-friendly, ease to use and access. Improved timetable and AI system makes me can't stop playing. Worth pay for this perfect game.Edit: It also works in some of notebooks. Just like LG LGP42, it just requires 6GB RAM, i5-2410U to work it perfecttly.			"

												While there are still bugs and occasional crashes (the developers are working as hard as they can!), and it is still badly optimised when compared to other games; you must also remember that this was made by two people, who were at college at the time they started making Omsi 1. It was never designed to be the best, most optimised game ever with the best graphics; but merely to be a slice of nostalgia for the two Germans who grew up riding these buses. If you like buses, or are into painstakingly re-created simulation, and don't mind the occasional glitch or crash, then this simulator is for you. If you like high framerates and next-gen graphics, then you try making your own bus simulator from scratch with a friend!There's also lots of additional user content available, mostly for free, that includes real and fictional maps, buses and cars; and also objects to make and detail your own maps that you can make in the built-in editor.

All in all , the game has is issues with random  lock-ups and frame drop....but i can over look that easy because this is a ton of fun and it really seem like you truly have a job to do . I rate this game a solid  8 / 10  - i would buy this game and i recommend it to you . The bad thing about this game is that it feels like the Dev's have abandoned this game... no updates no new content and no Sales on DLC . i would like to own all DLC , but i am not paying $60 for all of it.

												If you like simulation games, than this is the game for you. It's a good game, good performance ( although the game looks older than it is ) and easy to play. Except for one big issue. Don't buy this game if you have a laptop / notebook without numpad, like me. You can't play the game without the numpad, without joystick, without any wheel. The bus is driven manually, without any of these accesoires, you wouldn't be able to drive the bus at all. The game works on any average PC, but with all those extra neccessairy options added, you need an expensive PC after all. Positive: - Good gameNegative: - Difficult to drive without a steering wheel or joystick                - Tutorial takes a while                - Configuration of hotkeys is terrible                - Just like the 90's, the multiple key combination is horrifying.

												I just can't recomend this game, the tutorial is useless and takes a very long time to do. The advertised time is 5 hours split into 5, 1 hour lessons. And stupidly it isnt possible to save and load lessons - you need to close the game you will be forced to re-start that leason. And it dosnt help that the tutor is porly translated from English and makes little sense in the first place. Along with the tutoral not being in propor english the bus hasnt been translated at all meaning you will be forced to issue tickets in German without the use of subtitles. And to go along with this rubish the base game inculeds only 2 maps - one of these is tiny and only purpose seems to be for the tutoral.			"

												I love Omsi 1 as it has the best physics and the best flexibility. Only the activation on Aerosoft it's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ It never works. I bought Omsi 2 thinking to have the same experience but since is out and up until now with the v2.1 it continues to crash. I have reinstalled several times the pc, with different OS (Win 7 and 8) and it keep crashing. It's stable only with the basic maps and busses... but like that is boring. Maybe the programmer should have waited a bit before releasing this version full of bugs. Going to Steam has improved the reinstall time and removed the pain in the♥♥♥♥♥activation with Aerosoft. On the other side with ver 1 you could have different copies in the HDD with different maps and busses so was easier to mantain and upgrade. With this version is not.A tip for the programmers: Why the hell you put the HOF files in the bus directory?? Wasn't easyer to have a HOF directory where all the maps where saving it so you avoid ton of copies of the same file and the maps where working with all the busses??If you have patience and you love bus buy it. If you get crazy easily avoid it!!			"

												I'm sure this is someones idea of an enjoyable game, but not mine.  Went in expecting something similiar to Euro Truck sim 2. Left dissapointed as I spent 18 minutes on the side of the road flipping switches. Passing cars probably wondering why the bus kept flashing its headlights and slamming the front doors shut. Sadly I will need to refund this as this is just not the simulator for me.  I would not recommend to my own friends, but that's a matter of my own opinion.  If you want something advanced, maybe this is for you. If you're looking to just chill out and drive around, consider something like Euro Truck Sim 2			"

												This game COULD be a great game but it is BAD because it is full of bugs, disappearing textures and maps and I own one of the best gaming laptops of 2017. This is a bad game & I wish I could've gotten a refund but because it was ""played"" more than 2 hrs (With all that ""playing time"" being spent on trying to operate the dang bus and learn how to play), I was offered no refund. I love simulators and bought this game because of how realistic and interesting it looked. Wish I could get my money back but I do know I will never buy a game created by this company again. It is horrible and I will stick to my American Truck, Train & Bus & Cable car sims as those games give me zero trouble. Again, THIS game is terrible and should be $.99.			"

												I was going to wait until I had played 50 or 100 hours of im game play but I am not. How is the gameplay overall, it SUCKS!  OVERALL ANYWAYS... There are definitely well....just there are some good points of this game. It is very simulated as far as what a bus driver does before he or she even turns on the bus. Most of the buttons on the dash and around you are push activate buttons, HOWEVER they are in GERMAN. I guess that part makes sense considering the gamemakers theirselves. So when someone says they have it in English they aren't 100% correct. There is GERMAN dialect in almost every aspect of this game even if its as small as a button on your dashboard. As far as the steering is concerned, unless you have a wheel and you can control the sensitivity then its a challenge to steer  but not impossible. I tried EVERYTHING, my PS4 controller which took me only so far, then the keyboard which was horrible, and the mouse.  Using the mouse to steer and accelerate was not bad. You just select mouse to control drag the cursor up to ACCELERATE, and down to BRAKE. Left to steer, Right to steer pretty simple and halfway decent.Now this review is based on the fact that I haven't downloaded the DLC for Chicago Downtown which thats the main reason I bought the game, cause after all everything in route is in English. Also a few YOUTUBERS did a great job displaying gameplay for CHICAGO (shoutout to Squirrel).I am however afraid to download the DLC for Chicago because when I first started downloading and installing this game it right off the bat was giving me troubles. Crashed a few times and some of the tutorial shortcuts didn't work. Even crashed at tutorial 2. For a better tutorial go to YOUTUBE and look up OMSI for Squirrel or OMSI for StudiousGamer.SO MY FINAL VERDICT, based off of the 8 hours of gameplay would I recommend this game to anyone. NO. I paid $35 and unless I get the Chicago DLC and actually can play it I will feel that this is a complete waste. IF YOU ABSOLUTELY want this game, its $30 on Aerosoft website, $29 with tax on Amazon however with Amazon Digital Download you DO NOT GET A REFUND.			"

												After only 18 minutes of playing this game I already had a terrible time, the game non stopped crashed, I had been spammed with errors that are in German, German for godsake, do these developers know that English people exist?, what is even worse is that the game is actually in English, the Tutorial pictures are German and the Errors are German, the stupididity in this title is unreal.The game doesn't even work, it crashes if you click on the the loading screen, crashes if you spawn in a place from the original game (which were added by the devs in to OMSI 2), the optimizations are a disgrace and even in the Steam sale, this isn't worth the £13.49 that I paid for this, it isn't even worth £5.I would have loved to have done a real review on this, but as it stands. not possible, with 18 minutes of attempting to actually get in to play the game, which I not once successfully done as it crashed every single time.Now some will say ""Why didn't you search for fixes?"", I did and you know what I seen?LOTS and LOTS of people say how the devs are lying about this game and how the original is a lot better, how this game is terribly optimized and runs just as good as dried syrup.I will be getting my money back on this horrendous excuse of a game.

												This game could be fun, Only if you are into buses or work as a bus driver.I am neither of those, Infact, i posted a forum post debating deciding whether I should buy Fernbus or OMSI. At the end I decided to buy both.The tutorials aren't explained in the best way and I had to restart like 6 times to complete a tutorial.The buses are overcomplicated to operate and The graphics are not at the best.I'll guess you will have lots of fun playing this if you're a bus enthusiast but if you are not into buses, this game is not for you.

												Sorry but this is just a horrible sim, even though it has (or had) lots of potenial.- Too many bugs and glitches for a start, both visual and audio.- Seriously lacks content, it only has two small maps and the rest of it is paid DLC.- AI is stupid.- controls are very complex and can be very complicated.in short there are better sims out there and there's one upcoming bus sim that looks good, looks similar to ETS2.

 Great, enjoyable simulatorThe graphics may not be like ETS2 or ATS, even Fernbus. But this game is by far the most realistic bus simulator I've seen. When you 1st get the game and start, things can be tricky, the game is set by default to lock keyboard steering wheel (make the wheels lock when turning) so if your using a keyboard to drive you SHOULD turn this off. The mouse steering mode is much better though, it provides a more smoother and enjoyable experience.The game is tricky at the start, and you I would reccomend changing the controls the way you like them so it makes things easier. The tutorials are great, they are very detailed in telling you what to do, however, you can't change the keys or options during them.The graphics are not amazing but are fine for me, I don't mind about them anyway. There are some notable bugs and glitches and also graphic issues which are only solved by restarting the game. Some bugs include: slow buses, black textures, passengers stopping and will not board the bus and a major one is that sometimes no passengers appear at stops. Other than this, the game is fine. The game is set in 80-90's Berlin and is a highly realistic to what Spandau area looked backed then, bus stops and lines are real and so are the veichle repaints. The game is highly moddable, and you can change about anything from passenger numbers to making your own lines on the default map or any others on the map editor. I would suggest getting freeware maps from the internet as you will get bored after a while with the normal game. I have also purchased payware DLC via steam which are mostly maps and are great. Overall,  a great game for anyone who has an interest in it, highly reccomended.			"

												Anyone who wants a bus simulator, this is pretty much your only choice. As much as I love the game, there just isn't enough to it. This considering it's hard enough just to put out 35 bucks for a bus simulator, Omsi 2 makes you pay an additional $20 for any DLC. And believe me you NEED that DLC. Plus downloading and setting up free maps takes about as long as a train ride from New York to Miami. I recommend his game, but at a little disappointed standpoint. If you look at my other reviews, I'm usually very excited about games. This one yes, but not that much.			"

												This game is a mixed bag. If you are a pureist and want everything to be perfect it will probably drive you mad. If you don't mind some quirks there is a lot to like here. The detail on the bus models is amazing and the sheer complexity of all the things you can alter and change on the bus is quite overwhelming to begin with. Reading the manual and having a pen and paper handy to make some notes is a must. The attention to detail in the sound is something to behold. After a bit of digging on google I discovered that the destinctive transmission sound was so familiar because the busses that used to transport me to and from school in the UK used the same transmission as the double deckers on OMSI. Learning the routes takes some time and keeping to the schedule is very hard to do without upsetting the passengers. If you want a real driving challenge this will keep your mind active for a long time. There is just so much to consider all at once. It's very hard not to become flustered at first. Stay with it and you start to become pretty addicted to the challenge of getting that bus there in one piece on time with satisfied passengers. A lot of love has gone into this by the creators who have succeeded and then some IMO of encapsulating a period of history inside a game that brings a great deal of enjoyment to play.   "

												OMSI 2 is overall, a very good game.Basically if you want to know whether you should buy it or not - if you don't want to drive a bus don't get it, simple as, but that's the obvious. It comes with a few paid DLC packs, including Vienna, Hamburg and recently released Chicago which are all good, but some people don't realise you can download so many third party maps and buses.It's one of the best driving simulators there is, in my opinion. It's just very prone to errors and freezing, it's not fully developed and at least for now it's easy to work around once you know what goes wrong. However, it really does make up for it for the amount of third party maps and buses you can download. Downloading maps - things very easily go wrong and that's where OMSI can hopefully improve in the future, in making the game stable and simpler to use, possibly. Once you understand basics of downloading buses and maps then it is usually easy to work with.I wouldn't recommend buying the game if you aren't going to download any maps however. You'll only have Berlin-Spandau and Grundorf which get very boring after a while. There are so many maps you can find, small and big ones.I do enjoy the game very much though and I totally recommend it!			"

												** I am addicted to OMSI 2, so my opinion may be biased. **OMSI 2 is pretty much what a bus simulator should be.Everything about the game is fairly nice, and the physics engine is superb. Of course, there are the occasional bugs and glitches, which may sometimes be annoying. I think that the best thing about OMSI 2 is the community. There are a ton of maps, buses, and mods for OMSI 2, and it enhances your gaming experience quite a bit. (I recommend getting the Three Generations bus pack)One of the things that just sold me to OMSI 2 was the fact that you can use real-time weather and set up real-time weather for wherever you are! I also enjoyed the amount of detail that the developers put into OMSI 2, as it really shows off.However, I'm not going to just talk about the positives. A huge problem is the A.I traffic. It likes to cut you off, and generally causes 95% of the crashes you have. My solution to this is to turn off the physics for the A.I, so the vehicles who attempt to cut me off just go through my bus instead.If you are thinking of picking up an accurate bus simulator and are a huge bus fanatic or love accurate simulators in general, then OMSI 2 is for you.

												This 'game' is definitely good for anyone who's keen on buses and wants to drive them. However, it does require some patience and also some knowledge of German. Patience because it may take a little while to get familiarise one into the inner logic of the simulation - and with the known crashing issues, as has been noted elsewhere already. Addons are numerous and installing them requires some skill and patience as well, and possibly a better (more powerful) computer than I've got presently.Knowing at least some German is a plus, because there is a plethora of helpful discussions on OMSI-forum - in German. Even with all these issues, I heartily recommend this for those, who enjoy buses (and other forms of public transport).			"

												this game has a few bugs but has a ton of cool things to do as it is a BUS SIMULATOR set in the leate 80's, early 90's in germany more specificly BERLIN. the game comes with 2 maps (grundorf fict. & spandau/berlin) your  Job is that you work for the BVG in berlin & you have to transport commuters by the U Bahn at U ruhblen or buses at U ruhblen, staaken hanaberg, U aldstat spandau, spandau west/Galenstr, spandau fredstr., spandau nervenklink (mental hospital), spandau walkrenhaus (hospital), spektefeld, spektefeld schruleum & U bhan rauthaus spandau. as well as einstendorf krankenhaus & some other place on the GRUNDORF MAP! the game is currently $24.99 GBP. the game is most popular in Germany, the UK, Irealand & some countries in aisia. the game currently does not support Left Hand Drive maps (LHD) but will probably get fixed some time soon. not all maps from the original game (omsi: the bus simulator)  so make sure you check what version number the file says the map/addons works on! the predeccesor OMSI has less bugs than omsi 2 but currently is being updated, there are a few known bugs in OMSI that are people walking through the bus when the AI is not accually inside the bus!  if you have OMSI i would highly suggest that you upgrade to OMSI 2! the version of windows XP this game supports is XPSP3 & XP X64			"

												This game is wonderful if you have a G27 and love ETS 2. Its got deep historical accuracy for all its vehicles and routes. For a game built by just two guys for nostalgia value its amazing. However...when its good its very good, when its bad its awful. I love driving games beyond racing stuff and this fits the ticket, but it needs updating to 64 bits, you can get crashes and out of memory errors even with a top shelf gaming rig (which I have). If you can get over these rough edges though its a lot of fun if you like driving sims because this is heavy on the sim part. Only problem is that its over priced. If you like driving simulations get this, but wait until it goes on sale.			"

												This is an excellent game, don't get me wrong. It works with my Logitech Driving Force GT Steering wheel seamlessly and the game itself really does make you feel like you are driving a big, heavy, german bus.However, it does have some problems:1. There is not a massive range of bus mods to download that actually work and don't have texture issues. (Except Mercedes and Solaris buses, which are fine.2. There is not a huge range of maps avaliable and they are not too easy to install. (Some do download but require many other mods which makes the whole process a chore, searching around the german websites for the specific mods that the map needs is a real pain and puts me off downloading maps!)The main problem with this game though is optimisation and performance. It rarely gets above 30fps and tends to drop to about 6/7 fps in the inner city areas of the berlin-spandau map. My PC is not amazing but will run most games at 30/60 fps. If the game becomes well optimised and there are more maps and buses added, this could be a hit, bestselling, A+ title. However, if you have a reasonably powerful PC (a steering wheel adds to the realism, I reccomend the Logitech Driving Force GT which is PS3, PS2 and PC compatible! It also has pedals and many buttons to add to the realism even more.) The game will be a joy to play and is oddly enjoyable, even when performance is an issue.Overall, Well done			"

												You need to love busses to play this game. I personally think this is one of the best purchases for an enthusiast. Free mods in the right places and good quality freeware especially on British forums like fellowsfilm. If you aren't interested in busses or transport then it's probably not worth buying.			"

												this is a good map but for me sometimes when i get to a certain point and it varies from time to time but everything dissapears and the game just stops nothing but sky so i have to reload the game thus loosing my progress and its rather annoying but i think its worth the money as its an investment because they will update the map for sure what folk forget is that its only 2 guys whio have made this game from scratch so give them a break they have done fantastic both with the first one and the second version but although i love this game i will rate this one down for now but no doubt i will change my views once the gladbeck map gets a proper update thanks to you guys at mr software for making this game and hope to see an update soon :) :)			"

												This game is good, but beware you will experience some problems.The game has good DLC, but there is also some mods, maps and buses out there if you want to seek something different.The game isn't optimised very well, but the game was originally made by 2 men who were bored so it is quite good for one man to do.I can't recommend it if you don't want problems because it is basically unavoidable. You could also argue it is overpriced for what you get in it.The results are laughable for glitches, but I myself don't play it anymore.Overall, if I could put a so-so option, I would.But I will rate it5/10It has got good potential, but it is lacking and the graphics aren't very realistic.

												this game has a few bugs but has a ton of cool things to do as it is a BUS SIMULATOR set in the leate 80's, early 90's in germany more specificly BERLIN. the game comes with 2 maps (grundorf fict. & spandau/berlin) your  Job is that you work for the BVG in berlin & you have to transport commuters by the U Bahn at U ruhblen or buses at U ruhblen, staaken hanaberg, U aldstat spandau, spandau west/Galenstr, spandau fredstr., spandau nervenklink (mental hospital), spandau walkrenhaus (hospital), spektefeld, spektefeld schruleum & U bhan rauthaus spandau. as well as einstendorf krankenhaus & some other place on the GRUNDORF MAP! the game is currently $24.99 GBP. the game is most popular in Germany, the UK, Irealand & some countries in aisia. the game currently does not support Left Hand Drive maps (LHD) but will probably get fixed some time soon. not all maps from the original game (omsi: the bus simulator)  so make sure you check what version number the file says the map/addons works on! the predeccesor OMSI has less bugs than omsi 2 but currently is being updated, there are a few known bugs in OMSI that are people walking through the bus when the AI is not accually inside the bus!  if you have OMSI i would highly suggest that you upgrade to OMSI 2! the version of windows XP this game supports is XPSP3 & XP X64			"

												This 'game' is definitely good for anyone who's keen on buses and wants to drive them. However, it does require some patience and also some knowledge of German. Patience because it may take a little while to get familiarise one into the inner logic of the simulation - and with the known crashing issues, as has been noted elsewhere already. Addons are numerous and installing them requires some skill and patience as well, and possibly a better (more powerful) computer than I've got presently.Knowing at least some German is a plus, because there is a plethora of helpful discussions on OMSI-forum - in German. Even with all these issues, I heartily recommend this for those, who enjoy buses (and other forms of public transport).			"

												This game is great if you love buses and want toe experience what it's like to operate a bus. The buses are really detailed and the pyhsics are accurate. There are good DLC's avaliable and more planned to come out to keep the game feeling new. The mod support and communities within this game is large spanding from Youtube to forms. However there is sometimes some stablity issuses in the game depending on the map you play on and the AI is sometimes annoying (Always keep colloisons off).  The game has a learning curve but once you get past that , you can unlock the full potiental of the game. I personally love this game and would recommend it if you love buses.			"

												This game is wonderful if you have a G27 and love ETS 2. Its got deep historical accuracy for all its vehicles and routes. For a game built by just two guys for nostalgia value its amazing. However...when its good its very good, when its bad its awful. I love driving games beyond racing stuff and this fits the ticket, but it needs updating to 64 bits, you can get crashes and out of memory errors even with a top shelf gaming rig (which I have). If you can get over these rough edges though its a lot of fun if you like driving sims because this is heavy on the sim part. Only problem is that its over priced. If you like driving simulations get this, but wait until it goes on sale.			"

												It is hard to get used to the game but after a while and looking at youtube videos I recommend squirrel for things like this the graphics are great and well worth it but make sure you have sonething better than an r7 240 graphics card to make your game a pleasure to play. The sounds are very realistic and the functions feel very unlimited in many ways would recommend this game to simulation geeks and will rate it at 8/10			"

												WARNING TO POTENTIAL BUYERS:You must know what you're getting yourself into by buying this game. It has one of the worst engines out there. The developers do NOT know what optimization means and complaining about this game is hopeless, because they will NOT fix it. You MUST have a very good PC to run this.Hi,This game is awesome. An amazing simulation. When the maps are very well made and optimized, the game runs at 60 FPS and puts a smile on my face.I like driving buses in this game. Why? It's fun!-you can interact with all buttons in the cockpit-you can run routes-you can get custom maps-you can buy addons with new maps-the graphics have a nice nostalgia or whatever feel to them-you can get custom buses-i shouldn't have to explain this it's an AMAZING game!!!

												Positives:-Very good scenery and routes.-You can use ALL of the buttons on the busses.-Easy set up.-It FEELS good.Negatives:-Unfinished roads, you can sometimes litterately drive OFF the road.-The DLC you can get from the store is very buggy (and bounces a lot, weirdly)-UI can be confusing.-Steer sometimes seems reacts very late.Overall:Very good game, busses you get with the base game work fine, DLC busses tend to be a lot less polished.Is good for if you like busses, but it is NOT comparable with games as Euro Truck Simulator 2.(If planning to buy, think about buying a steering wheel, as it makes the game a lot easier.)8/10			"

												This may be ""buggy"" and have quirks, but, I challenge you to find a better 'Inner City/Local Service' bus simulator! personally the small quirks/annoying issues disappear amongst all the good points 0f this game. The main thing is the buses, and they are fantastic! replicated to perfection in looks, sounds, and handling. If you are looking for an arcade style driving sim then maybe head towards Bus Sim '16 as OMSI 2 is an indepth simulator, mostly in German but the buses/systems are easy to get accustomed to, and when you do the fun really starts...passengers and ai traffic are at times ridiculous (not unlike real life lol) at this moment I have the '3 generations' and 'Hamburg' add-on installed and they are a fantastic addition to the sim. All in all I would say this is a very good simulator with it's good and bad points (80% good 20% bad IMO) but when you get into the driving and sort out your settings (lots of online guides) it is brilliant I get around 15-30fps withheavy settings which is good for OMSI (trust me lol), so I would reccomend it.**Make sure you apply the 4gb patch to the .exe as this will save you a LOT of frustration!**[Mid Range set-up]i5-3330 @ 3.00GHZ (o/c @3.30GHZ)8.00GB RAMWIN7 x64GeForce GTX 750ti OC 2gb			"

												When Omsi 2 plays well, its a great driving sim but does seem to crash alot of the time. If you can get it to work I recommend this to any sim enthusiast.*Please Note*You may need a decent PC (computer) to play this game.Try using lower settings to make it more playable, how low of a setting depends on your PC Specs.

												This may be ""buggy"" and have quirks, but, I challenge you to find a better 'Inner City/Local Service' bus simulator! personally the small quirks/annoying issues disappear amongst all the good points 0f this game. The main thing is the buses, and they are fantastic! replicated to perfection in looks, sounds, and handling. If you are looking for an arcade style driving sim then maybe head towards Bus Sim '16 as OMSI 2 is an indepth simulator, mostly in German but the buses/systems are easy to get accustomed to, and when you do the fun really starts...passengers and ai traffic are at times ridiculous (not unlike real life lol) at this moment I have the '3 generations' and 'Hamburg' add-on installed and they are a fantastic addition to the sim. All in all I would say this is a very good simulator with it's good and bad points (80% good 20% bad IMO) but when you get into the driving and sort out your settings (lots of online guides) it is brilliant I get around 15-30fps withheavy settings which is good for OMSI (trust me lol), so I would reccomend it.**Make sure you apply the 4gb patch to the .exe as this will save you a LOT of frustration!**[Mid Range set-up]i5-3330 @ 3.00GHZ (o/c @3.30GHZ)8.00GB RAMWIN7 x64GeForce GTX 750ti OC 2gb			"

												This game is great if you love buses and want toe experience what it's like to operate a bus. The buses are really detailed and the pyhsics are accurate. There are good DLC's avaliable and more planned to come out to keep the game feeling new. The mod support and communities within this game is large spanding from Youtube to forms. However there is sometimes some stablity issuses in the game depending on the map you play on and the AI is sometimes annoying (Always keep colloisons off).  The game has a learning curve but once you get past that , you can unlock the full potiental of the game. I personally love this game and would recommend it if you love buses.			"
