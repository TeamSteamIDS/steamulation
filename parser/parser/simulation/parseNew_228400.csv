												In order to enjoy this game, you need to go in with an open mind and forget everything you know about Ace Combat. This is not an Ace Combat game. It's more like Call of Duty: Jet Fighter Edition. The story is pretty flat and is your typical 'Murrica vs terrorists plot. Also, make sure you turn off Flight Assist and change the control scheme to Original for the best experience.Most people complain about DFM (Dogfight Mode) being too on-rails, and for the most part, they're right. There are some targets (called TGT_LEAD) that require you to engage DFM and follow them through a semi-scripted segment of cinematic explosions and debris before you can do any damage to them. I don't care for this feature myself, but it's not a big deal and it's fun to watch. For normal targets though, it's much more dynamic, as you can play a game of cat and mouse by counter maneuvering each other in DFM, or you can choose to not use DFM at all. Personally, I think that DFM, while a tad repetitive, is quite exhilarating. The helicopter and gunner missions are pretty grueling and last longer than they should, but fortunately there's only a few of them. They can be fun and intense at times though, especially on higher difficulties.The multiplayer is where this game really shines, and now that the game is going on Steamworks, we should hopefully see more players. Capital Conquest is incredibly fun, and you can be a fighter, an attacker, or a helicopter and defend your HQ while capturing additional bases to spawn closer to the enemy's HQ. The aircraft are balanced so that fighters don't do much damage to ground targets, while attackers have an insane damage modifier against them, with the downside of being unable to engage DFM. Once your team captures the central control tower, you can go into ASM (Airstrike Mode) against the enemy's HQ as an attacker or multirole. You can attack the HQ directly without ASM but it's not as efficient, since ASM increases your reload speed. Helicopters are excellent for HQ defense since they can hover and shoot down incoming attackers. If you get 8 kills in a row, you can load up your PAK-FA with Trinity (tactical nuke) and decimate a wide area of ground targets. When your HQ's health bar gets low, someone on your team can make a desperate last ditch effort by launching in a B1 or B2 bomber and deal a large amount of damage to the enemy's HQ, but you better provide cover for him on his way there. There are tons of skills to unlock with points you earn from multiplayer, which include weapon damage boosts, improved homing missiles, increased armor, and improved maneuverability. All the skills are pretty balanced and none are too overpowered (except maybe Burst which maxes out defense, but it costs a lot of points and has a limited amount of uses).If you're thinking about getting this game, get it for the multiplayer, You can play multiple roles other than a fighter, and the dogfighting is more fun and less predictable since you won't be spending the whole round circling each other which ends up happening in most other multiplayer jet games.

												Just like the route taken by many other franchises in the past decade, Ace Combat Assault Horizon is, sadly, what happens when a Publisher/Developer decides to rise the finger towards their loyal fanbase, and tries their hardest to appeal to a different, more modern mainstream crowd.In the end and as a consequence, not only failing hard to get a piece of that pie, but losing the respect and support of those who were with them right from the beginning.The GoodOn the brightest side of things, there are twenty five different airplanes, three helicopters, and two bombers to chose from, each intricately modeled and textured, complete with beautiful, detailed cockpit views.While the graphics menus are an absolute joke (more on that later), I haven't ran into any problems what so ever, everything works as it should, the framerate is stable, the controls are responsive and there are no visible glitches or problematic bugs typical of bad ports...The BadIn an effort to not only simplify the game but make it more ""edgy n'cool"", the developers introduced a new mechanic  that goes by the name of Dog Fighting Mode (DFM for short), a mode that gets you close to the action, glues you to your enemy and takes literally up to about 90% of the control off of your hands, just so you may shoot him down with your suddenly increased aimbot like super accuracy.As a result, DFM is nothing but an on-rails, scripted, nauseating (boy, that zoom in/out camera/field of view) joke that takes you on a quest you cannot possibly fail; It requires absolutely no skill whatsoever, providing no fun a result. Such ain't ""optional"" either, since certain enemies can ONLY be taken down using said mode, and others can also glue themselves to you, forcing such mode on yourself....as if that wasn't bad enough, certain enemies will take you on a rather long scripted adventure (you'll notice those right away, they're bullet sponges) and can only be disposed of, once their fancy ""scripted"" event has come to an end.For the first time ever in the franchise, we're given the opportunity to take control of an Helicopter (in fact, tree of them); This is indeed a breath of fresh air in the game, but unfortunately its implementation leaves a lot to be desired.To start off, the shaky, in your face, zoomed in Third-Person camera, has got to be one of the worst I've experienced in a game, the levitating brick occupies almost three quarters of the screen and flies all over the place, making its best efforts to obstruct your view all the time;Thankfully, there is a cockpit view, and even that has the bad habit of shaking in an exaggerated manner and zooming in every time you lock your weapons on a target....now, as far as Helicopter gameplay goes, it could be described almost as a modern generic Third/First-Person Shooter (only clunkyer) and in the air, which consist off gunning down waves upon waves of ground forces who oppose no threat whatsoever (as in challenge), occasionally dodging a missile or two (it's laughable), and maybe, face off another chopper one on one; Oh, and you cannot crash it.Nothing too complicated... in fact, if you're expecting anything that requires even the slightest amount of thought, strategy and/or skill, you might want to look somewhere else...Be aware though!The game has the bad habit of taking the control off of your hands, constantly zooming into whatever goes boom;Trying a little bit to hard to make people go nuts over rad explosions, I guess...New to the series are too the Turret Sections, which consist of nothing but press right click for ""awesome"".Unfortunately, there are no unique and/or interesting mechanics to the big guns themselves, they don't overheat nor do they run out of ammo, rate of fire doesn't vary from turret to turret neither does the ammunition they consume......and as an effect, these sections come off as simplistic, stale, repetitive, and nothing more.It could be said they exist for the sole reason of instant gratification, and it wouldn't be too far of the truth, as challenge is kept to a bare minimum and all it resorts to, is: Everything you look at explodes and anything that hadn't exploded yet is inoffensive to your mighty immortality.Which brings me to......the Health Bar of old, which is nowhere to be seen, and there is a reason for such; Our friends at Namco, decided it'd be a good idea to borrow, amongst other things, one of the worst fads in gaming; The absolute ATROCITY that is regenerative health.Yes, that's right, Planes/Helicopters fix them selves (you'll notice a red screen displaying Critical, Heavy and Light Damage at times);But wait, this ain't over yet!If that wasn't ridiculous enough, our beautiful flying machines now bounce of the ground as if they're made of rubber.Together with ""Invincibility Mode"", such can be abused to no end......but boy, oh boy, there's more; Amongst other fads brought to the table, is the poor implementation of either intrusive Quick Time Events (QTEs for short), that serve no purpose other than breaking the flow of the game, or QTEs that don't even have an impact on anything (yes some can be ignored completely)!Some cutscenes are unskippable (thankfully those are very, very few and far in between), forcing you to ""take control"" of the camera, as in, moving the main character's head to look around, because apparently someone somewhere thought that'd be fun.To add insult to the injury, not only is our main villain the typical evil Russian guy (because 'Murica, I guess) he's also called Markov; Doesn't this ring a bell?Even the name is similar to an evil guy from a certain overly successful, yearly franchise that's been copied to the point of exhaustion for the past decade!...it might seem like I'm nitpicking by now, but it's blatantly obvious who or what this game has drawn inspiration (or should I say lack thereof) from, there's even a boring, uninspired AC130 mission thrown into the mix, and a long boring one at that (actually, most missions overstay their welcome)! Who finds this fun and why?The UglyWhile this game is properly optimized from my experience, the Graphic Settings menu is a joke, there are only four available options to ""tweak"", Antialiasing (can only be turned On or Off), Fullscreen, Vsync and Resolution. On a side note, while the PC version contains all the DLC included, don't even get me started on how ridiculous and overpriced they were on the console version, which used to charge from $4, up to $6 for individual Painting schemes and Aircraft (Not sure if it still does)!Boy have standards fallen low, uh?Final Verdict:Ace Combat Assault Horizon is a game that tries to hard to be the next big thing; Not only does it feel desperate, like a little kid yelling and screaming for attention, it also feels like a compilation of everything that is wrong with games, the industry nowadays and the mentality of those who Publish/Develop the games we used to know and love.Therefore, earning an abysmal rEvo's rating of 2.5/10I can't remember a single moment where I was enjoying myself; I felt suffocated in the middle of all of its ""edgy"" in your face exaggeration, mixed with boring, generic simplified gameplay mechanics...It felt cheap, it felt empty and it felt outdated... Outdated in the sense that the kind of game Assault Horizon is trying to be, has been copied and beaten to death multiple times in the past decade.It's just not its unique thing anymore, and as a result you'll find ""Assault Horizon's"" core, in any other  brown, cinematic (edgy), military (or not), linear, scripted, simplified, over budgeted, mediocre AAA (triple A) game out there...At the very least, the game's well programmed and functional, doesn't crash nor does it stutter around...

												Oh, Ace Combat, why did you have to do this to me?I'm a big fan of the series, it's always been a blast to play, and yes there were low times, but never so much as this. Now, i'm not saying that the game is 100% terrible, it DOES have it's pros, but it has many more cons. I'll list them below;Pros:-The plane flight mechanics feel tight and responsive, sure they're not realistic, but we're not playing Ace Combat for realism, are we? We're playing it for the fun of doing crazy air stunts and gunning down people along the way.-The sound design is nothing spectacular, but it does it's job. The guns and the music are serviceable. Now, the old Ace Combats had some great soundtracks with some spectacularly memorable pieces. DO NOT expect those here. But, at the same time, it's not terrible. - The planes, while not being the highest texture quality you've ever seen, are pretty damn sexy. As are some of the spark and explosion effects, it does feel good to gun down planes out of the sky and watch them burst into flames. Cons:- The dogfighting system. Now, this one just relies on how you feel about the system. The dogfighting system allows you to lock onto an enemy and kep on their tail while firing at them. Alternatively, enemies can also do this to you. It does allow for some pretty cinematic chases, but ultimately after about three times it's already gotten old. What it actually boils down to is this: Lock onto the enemy. Wiggle stick a bit. Fire. Move on. Find new target. Lock onto new target. Wiggle stick a bit. Fire. Move on. It makes the game just a million times easier and means that instead of having these amazing dogfights where you're doing all these crazy stunt mid air, it just means that you see an enemy...and now he's dead.Most of the time. In order to combat you doing this, the game suffers from the same artificial diffficulty that a lot of plane games suffer from, whereby your target will just perpetually fly away from you. Get an enemy into your line of sight, and all of a sudden they pull up. And up. And up. And then you pull up. And up. And up. And now you're just spinning a hundred times before you can lock him into your dogfighting system. No skill needed. The next thing that annoys me is that the enemies can also lock YOU into the DFS (dog fighting system). It seems like a good idea, having to escape them, but it just boils down to doing exactly what the enemies do to you! You're chasing someone for aaaages and then BAM you're taken right out of it, so what do you do? Pull up until you escape. Now you can continue to chase NOPE YOU'RE BACK IN IT WHOOAAA CRAZY RIGHT? PULL UP PULL UP okay we're free again, now to finally chase that NOOOOOOOPE I'M BACK ♥♥♥♥♥ES.-The helicopter missions. They're awful. You fly around a horribly controlled helicopter, gunning down floor enemies and the occasional helicopter. That's it. The heliocopter controls terribly, as i've mentioned, and the whole missions are just uninspired. Use these boring weapons and this boring helicopter and shoot some cars. Woo. Do that multiple times throughout the game.-The turret sequences. OH? WHAT'S THAT? YOU DIDN'T LIKE THE HELICOPTER SEQUENCES? ALRIGHT WELL TELL YA WHAT, HOW ABOUT WE TAKE OUT THE WHOLE FLYING THE HELICOPTER THING AND JUST GIVE YOU A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ TURRET? Yeah, thanks developers. There's literally whole missions where you load in, and shoot a turret for about 20 minutes at some foot soldiers, and then move on. No variety, no challenge, no interest, nothing. Just point at people and click. You don't even get to move around on your own. Just point and click. Oh you wanna do something else? NOPE. POINT AND CLICK.-The voice acting. It's awful. There's not much to say except that everyone is just Mr Generic McGenericson or Mrs Genericson and her Generic babies. Maybe it's not even that bad, but seriously it's so generic that I think it dulled my senses.-The story. Spoilers, i guess, but hoestly just read any Tom Clancy novel and you've heard this story.  While the game is voiced by Mr Generic Genericson, the story was written by his superhero alter ego; JERRY GENERICMAN! American hero. He's the hero we need. Other people. They're the heroes we need. Terrorists have a bad plot to blow up some people! Quick; call America! Oh no, a Generic non-american bad guy who wants to do bad stuff. WE STOPPED HIM JUST IN TIME. BUT WILL YOU MAKE IT BACK IN ONE PIECE? Yes. Roll credits.-The AC130 missions. Just fancier disguised turret sections. Overall this game was a huge disappointment. Are you a huge fan of the series and you're just ACHING for more? Sure, pick it up on sale and just slog your way through it. Only have a slight interest? Just don't buy it. There are plenty of other plane games that you could get that are ultimately better.			"

												Ace Combat's first outing on PC is one of style, cool visuals, and horrible delivery. While the DFM mode adds a cool element of spectacular destruction, it wears out its welcome when it is literally forced onto the player in some sections. These kind of sequences aren't new and they can work well, like in the new Fallouts. However, there you voluntarily activate the sequence. Here, it's required in some portions. It literally becomes an on the rail shooter without warning and only serves to jar. But, the most damning and horrible shortcoming is the control interface: You're literally forced to use a gamepad lest you have to endure shoddy keyboard controls or even worse joystick control. The Joystick support is non-existent. This is unacceptable. Some say this is a game meant to be played on a gamepad and this just smacks of apologetics for laziness that has become so familiar within the industry. Even Tom Clancy's HAWX, which wasn't all that good, had a basic dead zone slider and that came out in 2009, this was early 2013. There's no excuse for this at all. Why can't someone with a joystick enjoy a game about flight? Why is the joystick suddenly a peripheral only for the hardcore flight sim? And why are people defending this lazy thinking as if spending money on a game were a privilege for them?In the end, this is a horrible game and for those seeking a good arcade flying experience would be better served with the original HAWX or, better still, going out and buying a PS2 with its trilogy of Ace Combats. Those games are superior in everyway to this pile of dung. If you're looking for a good arcadey experience on pc? Your regular flight sims can provide; just crank down the physic settings and difficulty. Wings of Prey is also another good choice for that when compared to this.Either way, this games is awful. Skip.			"

												Not the Ace Combat I remember from my good old Playstation days unfortunately. Good game? Maybe. Pros:+ Nice picture+ Not a bad soundtrack+ New game modes (bomber, heli)+ Has quite a few arcade elements from the previous games+ General idea of the ""chase"" is neat butCons:- Forcing people to use ""chase"" mode against VIP targets is just a big NO- Durability of said VIPs is ridiculous- Gameplay in general feels boring somehow. Didn't happen for the AC games I've seen before.- CoD-style missions on the transp. heli minigun- Nanites-covered aircraft which can fix up themselves during the flight given a bit of time. Only works for players.- Barrel roll on the attack helicopters- Unlike previous AC games this one is set on real life Earth which brings politics into play =/- Story and characters just don't make you feel for them. Or even remember them.As the game itself it's quite alright by the standards of modern gaming. But as AC game this one seems to fall flat on its face. As someone said this game is what happens when Michael Bay tries to make a flight sim.Feel free to try it during the sales time. It might appeal to you but I can't recommend this.			"

												As a long time fan of the Ace Combat series this game was a major disappointment. The new ""Dog fight mode"" looks cool for the first few times you use it but then you realise that all control is being taken away from you and that the dog fights are actually highly scripted. You'll activate dog fight mode and while you're chasing an enemy plane the game will make you fly through explosions and under collapsing buildings, it looks great but it's more like watching a cutscene than actual gameplay.For some reason Namco also decided to scrap the science fiction elements found in the older games so there are now no awesome boss fights against gigantic flying fortresses and the plot and cutscenes feel like they're ripped straight from a generic modern warfare shooter. The helicopter levels are terrible too and have awful controls.There's even a boss fight where you can't kill the boss untill the game decides you can, you'll shoot him a thousand times and it won't make a bit of difference because he only dies during a cutscene. That is some silly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.Pick it up on the cheap or better yet, if you have a Playstation 2 or an older PS3 get Ace Combat 4, 5 and Ace Combat: The Belken War, they're awesome and very cheap. Or emulate them.4/10.			"

												If you never played Ace Combat before, you may like this game. Fans like me of the other games will pretty much be dissapointed in it. Both parties however will find the DFM or Dog Fight Mode novel at first, but after a while its extremely repettative and sometimes just broken, and the sad part is you need to use DFM on some planes so the fly by sequence can run its course to progress in the mission, these planes are basically invincible unless you use DFM. Some cool fictional planes make a reapearence as bonus content like the CFA-44 Nosveratu from Ace Combat Six, but the special missiles are sadly nerfed, and somewhat useless in DFM. Pros: -Better diologue then previous cheesy anime inspired diologue,-The B-2 Bomber mission is pretty cool.-Game gives you the ability to customize the color of your fighter.-Previous games planes when shot down would just fall to the earth, now they expload and fall appart with oil and shrapnel and bits going every which way.Cons: -Broken and repetative Dog Fight Mode which is pretty much forced on you.-Attack Helicopter Missions are clumsy, and theres a sad lack of gunships to unlock and choose from.-Helicopter Gunner missions are extremely irritating, luckily there is only two of them. (then why bother have them in there at all)-C-130 mission is just in there for the hell of it. -Game is pretty short, even on Ace Mode. -Cinamatic Swquences are intrusive and annoying.-The first half of the game has little replay value because of tutorial popups which cant be turned off. -Multiplayer could be good if there were more players (not really the developers fault, but still an unfortunet fact.)TL/DR: Mediocre Ace Combat experince, give us a PC port of Ace Combat 6 or Infinity instead please...

												I can't tell you how good (or bad) Assault Horizon is compared to previous Ace Combat titles because I never played any of them. As a newcomer to the series, I quite enjoyed my time with it.The graphics are good, except for ground textures, which are what you would expect from games of this genre – low-resolution and blurry. But there's a plenitude of 3D buildings, the jets and helicopters are well crafted, explosions look nice, and even characters don't look bad at all.Fighter jet gameplay is simple enough and shooting down enemies while in DFM (dog fight mode) is very satisfying. The only problem is that the HUD (heads-up display) can be a little intrusive, with too much information on screen. This can prove distracting at times, especially with the amount of dialog going on.Helicopters are absolutely dreadful to control, however. Luckily there are only a couple of helicopter missions in the campaign, and they're far between.As a side note, I might add that the game can be perfectly played with mouse and keyboard, but was clearly designed with a gamepad in mind.The story is utterly forgettable, but I reckon it is not the selling point of this game, so it can be safely ignored.The sound effects are decent. On the other hand, the soundtrack, while not bad per se, is very repetitive and does not go together well with the action.Lastly, multiplayer is fun, even if few people bother with it due to Games For Windows Live.Overall, a solid game.UPDATE: Since the writing of this review, Games For Windows Live has been patched out of the game.

												Let's get one thing straight.I have almost over 4,000 hours and 10,000+ sorties on this game on all 3 platforms combined.I know what I am talking about, thanks.This game's on sale right now as of Thanksgiving 2015, and I hope you'll read this review and take it to heart.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is Assault Horizon, NOT an Ace Combat game. This is 60 FPS Arcade Aerial Combat at its finest.Assault Horizon is a very under-rated videogame that was shunned by it's Ace Combat fanbase, worth it solely for the multiplayer experience.This was an experiment by Project Aces to solve the QAAM Spam from Ace Combat 6's Multiplayer.The game is niche, and Ace Combat players hate it for the DFM mechanic. I don't fault the Ace Combat players in that anything hurting their precious singleplayer experience is to be hated on immediately, but I can't blame them because DFM is so forced in the game that it hurts the overall feel of the game, but all you need is 1 playthrough. 3 max if you're 100%ing the game.If you're new to the game you'll see that the DFM mechanic is very forced in singleplayer, this is to prepare you for the main bread and butter of the game; Multiplayer. It's what Assault Horizon was built around, and it's a fine tuned experience.Unfortunately Multiplayer is deadish, only very few hardcore dedicated fans stick around, and the community is very small bringing in under 150ish aces platform wide, with about 15 of them being top tier, and about 5 out of that tier being active.I'd aliken AH to Quake in that skilled players online will dance circles around newbies, nobody wants to play when your only opponent is a guy that can beat you blindfolded, right? It's a game that's rewarding to master, and it shows.If you're looking to achievement hunt this game, get it and download a 100% save, then flesh out your achievements.If you're looking to buy this and play singleplayer hoping for JETS and AWESOMENESS, then pass it up. You'd be better watching a Youtube Let's play of it. Trust me, you're not losing much by missing out.If you want to play a 60 FPS arcade jetfighter game with some hard-core veterans, then download it and pop me a friend request. I'd be more than happy to play with you.			"

												☺ Varied Missions.☺ Good Controls.☹ Lacklustre Story.☹ Dull plane vs plane combat.(NOTE: This game was played with an XBox controller and only takes into consideration the Single Player portion of the game).Ace Combat Assault Horizon is an interesting attempt at making a more accessible Aerial Combat game, which, not helped by a lacklustre story, fails to get the blood pumping or really manages to keep you engaged. It's a very arcadey approach to the genre that often feels like its a compilation of the variety missions that appear in modern military shooter games, rather than its own game.The mission variety is very good, from dogfighting over cities in a selection of modern fighter jets and weaving an Apache Helicopter between buildings to providing air support from an AC-130 Spectre Gunship or a series of late night bombing runs; what's on offer is varied and has a nice pace to it, changing things up so you don't tire of the same thing again and again.The biggest let-down for me and my main reason for purchasing the game originally is the Dogfighting. Ace Combat Assault Horizon introduces a feature known as DFM, which is clearly an attempt to keep engagements fast and thrilling. The problem is, in most cases it feels like you've been strapped into a rollercoaster and been given some bread rolls to throw at the head of the person in the seat in front of you when ever you line up. Enemy planes can absorb a large amount of bullets and apart from a few non-essential targets, will quite happily shrug off direct missile hits - it just seems to lack impact or enough fidelity to get the blood pumping and tends to feel like you're chipping away at a health bar until the target explodes. This is made slightly worse if you decide to replay a mission and notice some essential targets are heavily scripted and fly the same paths along specific set pieces.The visuals do a good job although are nothing special, vehicles are decent, explosions look good, smoke trails don't look out of place and the quantity of modelled buildings rather than just a ground texture is nice to see.I played with an XBox Controller and the controls never caused frustration, the game certainly lends itself more to the arcadey approach than a Simulation.All in all, the mission variety on offer doesn't make up for the run of the mill story and disappointing combat. The games singleplayer clocks in at around seven hours with the ability to replay missions and I personally didn't experience the multiplayer, although I imagine with the removal of Games for Windows Live (Ace Combat Assault Horizon - Enhanced Edition now requires Steam only!) more people will be willing to give it a try.It's not a bad game and is indeed, well made - they just should have waited for a clear lock before firing this one off.

												I tried. I really did. But I hate this game. I tried looking at it as a generic spinoff, but it didn't work. The underlying game is just so god-awful. Even outside of non-optional DFM segments, I don't feel like I'm flying a jet at all. I'm just some amorphous blob of missiles spinning around in fart-circles. Ace Combat has always been arcade-y, but this game full-stride sprinted past the threshold of acceptability.The controls are slippery as all holy hell as if drag is completely nonexistant in this universe, gameplay is sacrificed in lieu of truely dreadful cinematic scripted events, furballs drag on and on and on and ON AND ON AND ON AND ON, and the story is incoherent and entirely inconsequential. Non TGT_LEAD units are dumb as a box of hair, whereas TGT_LEADS have infinite chaffs and cannot ever be killed at all. That is, until you engage them in DFM, in which case they happily fly in a straight line and will gladly take a million missiles up the♥♥♥♥♥for you, but not before giving you a wonderful tour of the GRITTY IN-YO-FACE CINEMATIC™ SCENERY first. Outside of that, any challenge at all comes from fighting with the controls to get them to do what you want them to do. I got this for 1 dollar and still regret it. The only pro is the soundtrack, and it still is easily one of Kobayashi's weakest scores.Please never make such a collosal ♥♥♥♥-up like this again, Project Aces. You're better than this. Good god.

												Well just like the title says, this game is no where near as fun as previous ace combat games. It's basically more of a action game than a flight simulator. It seems as if namco went away from the bread and butter of the series and went full Michael Bay on this edition. The game is also short compared to other games in the series such as ace combat 5. Well to sum it up this game is a bargain bin title at best.			"

												I've always been a HUGE Ace Combat fan. to this day, I hold that Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War is one of the best games I have ever played. But this.... wow. It was alarmingly clear that they looked towards Call of Duty for inspiration. let me explain.in every previous game, the story took place in a fictional world. on top of that, the protaganist was always the silent type and was never truly identified or shown, allowing you to more easily insert yourself into the story and get immersed.in this game, you play as American McCheeseburger who's been dreaming of his own death over the skies of miami. as you can imagine and predict, that's a spoiler for a portion of the last mission. to make everything worse, the entire game is PAINFULLY predictable, playing into the ""surprise! Russians are evil! SO ORIGINAL"" trope. The story involves every single war cliche you can think of. Russians are evil, you're a war veteran, the woman suddenly loves you at the end for some reason, your wingman takes a missile for you, the Russians have WMDs and attack D.C. with them, etc. it's so poorly thought through that it was truly difficult to care in the slightest about any of it.Most of the gameplay isn't... horrible, I guess? the DFM takes away 90% of the control you're given and they force it on you throughout the game. the entirety of the end of game is so horrifically scripted, but the dogfights between are fun and true to the original games. (assuming you never use DFM that is) my main complaint is that they simulate difficulty by having the AI straight up cheat. they can pull manuevers insanely faster than you ever can, they have unlimited flares with no cooldown for them, they can straight up ignore your cannon making them impossible to damage until the game says they can be.but the cardinal sin of it all is that they introduced regenerating health for your aircraft. this was never in any of the previous games. not having it forced you to return to base and think about what you're doing more carefully. in this, you can just avoid damage until your plane suddenly decides it's not broken anymore.At the end of it: Go play Ace Combat 5. you will VERY quickly see why the Ace Combat communtity shuns this game.

												The series has really gone off course with this one...Pros* Bombing is neatCons* Ridiculous anime skins for the planes* 4-5 hrs play to completion* Simple, cheesy, predictable plot* Planes practically fly themselves* Almost every takedown must be done through a straight-up junk dogfight mechanic where the only control you have is how close to the opponent you are and lining up your reticle* Dogfighting flight is extremely erratic, almost to the point of motion sickness...* Opponents with the red TGT tag, 9/10 have to be shot down with the gun in dogfight as they have infinite flares* Plane heals itself in flight, no more RTB* All planes fly very similar to each other within their category, bombers fly the same, fighters fly the same with the exception of the a-10 which feels very heavy (kudos) unless you are turning and braking, then it does a bat turn and whips on around* Apache missions are the same, same heli, go here kill things, then go here kill things, shoot down heli, then go across map to kill some things* Not a as wide variety of planes as previous versions* Multiplayer is crap, its a constant dogfight with other peopleThe cons are pretty much endlessAll in all, don't waste your time or money on this game. It wasn't worth the $60 when I got it and its not worth the $20 now. If you must spend your money on this series, at least get a game that will be worth it such as ace combat 4 or 5. I would recommend 'Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War'For what its worth,Raz			"

												I was a big fan of the original series of games on the Playstation and jumped at the chance to grab this when it was on offer. Big mistake. It bears little resemblance to the originals, the dogfight mode is utter garbage and takes away any skill required to try and gun enemy aces down. The helicopter mode is a joke, the control system for it is terribly thought out and trying to adjust the controls through the menu makes little difference.I cannot comment on the story as I have been deterred by the awful gameplay from playing through, but the cutscenes and dialogue are pretty impressive. I can't help but think that if they had spent less time polishing the cinematics and more time focusing on the game, it would've been less of a travesty.The series takes a nose dive here. Avoid.			"

												As a huge fan of all of the Ace Combat titles on the PS/2, this game was a HUGE LETDOWN. Flight controls are extremely limited, and worse yet they added a ""dog-fight"" feature that locks your plane into place to fire machine guns. So if you enjoy the ""flying"" element of aviation games, there's no fun to be had here.			"

												I generally avoid games with mixed reviews but in this case I'm glad I didn't, the game is nowhere near as bad as the reviews led me to believe. I went into this completely blind with no expectations, I played on normal difficulty using a controller. The campaign lasted me about 10-11 hours and I haven't tried Free Mode or Multiplayer yet. I don't like writing long reviews so I'll sum things up:Unlike previous Ace Combat games, Assault Horizon takes place in the real world and features a fairly large variety of missions putting you in different roles, ranging from a door gunner, to a helicopter pilot among others. (I HIGHLY recommend using first person view while using the helicopter). My only major gripe with the game however is Dog Fight Mode, it's actually not too bad most of the time, but the game forces you into using it on tgt_lead enemies to execute scripted events, you can't kill these enemies without DFM. All other enemies can be killed without it however.+Large mission variety+Many different aircraft to choose from, including a nice selection of paint schemes and missile types+Game looks great visually, lots of different environments- Scripted/forced DFM events- Story is fairly uninteresting			"

												An Ace Combat game that's completely on the rails. The only effective way to shoot down aircraft is through a dogfight mode which flies the aircraft for you, the movement is so erratic in this mode that it just gets annoying over time to try and focus the cursor over the enemy jet while it's doing 10g moves. Most of these dogfight sequences are heavily scripted with the enemy jet not blowing up until you pass through scenic explosions and carnage that wouldn't have happened otherwise and that's what bugs me the most. Sometimes planes can take 2 missiles and explode which is usually the fastest some standard jet planes can go down, but sometimes planes can also take up to 4-6 missile hits and a barrage of guns only to explode after we see some stylized collateral damage.The story is also uninspiring when compared to past Ace Combat games. Anything interesting in the plot could've been seen a mile away with as the game tries to hold your hand through its already weak plot.The game tries to make up for its lackluster gameplay by expanding on what you can do in the game: bombing and helicopter assaults. Helicopter missions are a bit weak while the bombing ones are actually interesting althought there is only a total of 1 bombing mission in the game.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this game if you're a fan of the series or want to avoid an on the rails game.

												Hard to recommend but I like the game and enjoy playing it!Well after 4 hours I think that I am able to write a review. The story is about some bad guys who want to blew up the world and you have to stop them... but you do  not play games like these for an 'amazing' story right?You play it to blew things up... and by that I mean a lot of things! The best thing about that.. it is pretty fun!The game controlls are at the beginning a little bit clunky, but after a while you getting used to it and after setting things up in the input-config file to enable the mouse support things aren't that bad. (You should also create a 'NAMCO' Folder inside your documents, otherwise the game won't save any settings!)Flying and fighting in a plane makes a lot of fun and it is pretty hard to fail. While blewing things up the soundtrack keeps pushing you so motivation shouldn't be a problem.Edit: The helicopter missions are annoying but there are luckily there aren't much of them & Missions are take a little bit too much time..The graphics are for a PC Port. pretty good. (No eye-candy but therefore exist other games right?)I recommend to get this game during a sale for 5€ or 5$ or whatever currency you are using.Review may change in details while I continue the game.

												If you enjoyed the previous Ace Combat titles, you may not like this one. For me, there are way too many on-rails gameplay forced on you - especially Dogfight Mode (DFM). Essentially you follow the tail of an enemy jet doing crazy unrealistic maneuvers but you don't even have to control anything except fire missiles and guns. Well you do have to control turning the aircraft a little bit (BUT most of aircraft flying control is automated in DFM).  In fact, certain required targets, those marked TGT_LEAD, can only be destroyed by initiating the on-rails experience of DFM. They tried to make this game too cinematic like Call of Duty and the DFM is very cinematic but repetitive.I liked how they added helicopter Apache missions, a bomber (B-2 Spirit or B-1 Lancer) mission, a AC-130 gunner mission and transport heli gunner missions. However, there were not enough jet missions and jet mission variety (especially when compared to older Ace Combat games).Never played multiplayer because it is dead and found zero online games to join (on a Sunday afternoon) . I didn't bother trying the online Co-op.Air Strike Mode (ASM) is at times required throughout the game, and it's kind of like on-rails bombing gameplay. Fortunately it's only forced on you a few times and most of the time it's optional. It's not overly done so it doesn't feel repetitive.All in all, they added many new features to this game, but I think most of them made the game worse.			"

												In Ace Combat Assault Horizon you will take on the role of a handful of characters that fight for a joint-NATO Russian military working to put an end to a steady growing rebellion. As you fight your way through a surprisingly large amount of missions, the reliability in your allies come into question and will shape the direction of the war you find yourself in. Playing primarily as Lt Colonel William Bishop or “Warwolf 1”, you’ll fly alongside your Warwolf squadron as they race against the clock to prevent nuclear weapons from reaching The United States.Assault Horizon hits the ground running with fast paced combat and intense dogfighting engagements, however, it forgot to tie its shoes and winds up tripping down a set of stairs for longer than you’d probably care to watch. A very notable and important piece of information is that Assault Horizon is not a simulation (despite being tagged as such), it as an arcade shooter and shouldn’t be penalized for not following suit with other Ace Combat games. With that being said, I don’t think simulation like controls and gameplay could save it anyways. So what does Ace Combat do well? For starters, it’s fun. Assault Horizon is simple, you shoot baddies for ten minutes and then you move onto the next mission. No real depth or complexity in it’s gameplay, you fly a wide variety of jets and bombers, destroy a handful of vehicles like bad jets and mean bombers, artillery trucks and large naval vessels. Explosions and action sequences fill some destructive void in the heart of us all that’s craving can only be quenched with blowing things up. Dog fighting mechanics include a feature called DFM that hones in on your enemies allowing you to achieve a solid lock on your target, or get more up close and personal to fire your main guns. It also includes evasive maneuvers that require a fair amount of timing to avoid rockets and enemy missile locks.After about 30 minutes of the aforementioned void filling, ACAH begins it’s descent into boredom. Controls are slow and cumbersome, so a gamepad controller of some kind would be highly recommended. Even on a controller, flying each jet feels more like flying a really fast kite, hard to handle, at times almost guide themselves, and aiming outside of DFM is about as difficult as flying said kite in your living room. The only responsive aspects to Assault Horizon are the missiles which are arguably the only effective tool at your disposal. This formula drags on for a good five hours, missile the hell out of everything, complete the mission, rinse and repeat.Graphics are neither here nor there. Landscapes, vehicles, and visual effects exceeded my expectations, however the cutscenes are laughably mediocre. Bishop looks like Robbie Rotten, your wingman looks like a muscular thumb-hotdog conglomeration, and D-Ray the helicopter pilot’s helmet does a good job at hiding his cone shaped skull. In combat, view options are as follows: Cockpit that has no depth whatsoever, nose of the jet (fair), and a third person camera that’s two inches away from being entirely inside the jet engine itself. An FOV slider may have made up for some of that but the only graphic options are Resolution and Anti-Aliasing [On/Off]. Sound effects are up to par, and light years ahead of the dialogue, which consists of questionable military lingo and Bishop exclaiming “Damn!” So much so that you’d be sent to the hospital if you  based a drinking game around it, and you’d still fly about as well as I did sober. At one point the President comes over the radio and gives a speech in some awkward attempt at boosting moral and inciting patriotism, for a moment it felt like Independance Day. That alone almost gave me hope that Assault Horizon would make some triumphant come back in terms of storytelling. (There were no aliens. This is not Independance Day. Damn!)The lack of technical depth in each mission offers little to go back to in terms of replay value. While they present a unique atmosphere each mission, the only reason to go back is for achievements, earning a higher score (if that’s what you’re into), or filling that explosive deprived void. Sadly my few attempts at connecting to a multiplayer session were futile (Damn!), though I had low expectations of finding a game regardless.Ace Combat Assault Horizon is fun and nothing more. For a $0.33(.3333333) game on Humble Bundle I can say that I got my money’s worth of enjoyment out of it. However, the combination of poor graphics, eye-roll inducing dialogue, and shallow gameplay mechanics don’t make up for it’s mediocre attempt at building a memorable experience. Damn!			"

												You know this was the first Ace Combat written by western people when the plot has no sense, its the most patriotic thing ever done in a videogame, based on the real world (not on Strangereal) and the second mission is a motherfugging TURRET SECTIONTo add to the injury the DFM is overused and it seems that they forgot to add the ""homing"" to the missiles.Overall its fun yet repetive, great visuals and the OST its okayish but the cons outweight the pros by a landslide.Not recommended for full price, consider this game a spinoff of the main seriesTurretsection/10			"

												Many people have heard of the Ace Combat flight arcade games, and hundreds of thousands of players around the globe are fans of the series. However, Assault Horizon was an anomaly. The game's producer, Kazutoki Kono, saw fit to try a different formula for the series, and the results were varied. I'm going to attempt an honest review with little bias from the rest of the Ace Combat series. First things first, imagine this game didn't have the ""Ace Combat"" name in front. Because it's not a part of the series at all. Got it? Alright.Story: The game's story is tightly integrated with the missions, allowing for a smooth transition and preventing the player from getting lost (although it can definitely be intrusive at points). You are flying as Colonel William Bishop, a renowned fighter pilot, for Task Force 108, a multi-national task force including units from the United States, Russia, and even France. The plot is centered around Colonel Andrei Markov and his personal vendetta for revenge against the United States, as well as a rebel uprising within Russia.Yeah, it's not anything we haven't heard before. If you've played any modern warfare shooter released in the last 5-8 years, you basically got it all. What it does do, however, is give us varied characters. To be quite honest, I loved flying alongside Russian and French pilots - they actually seemed more interesting to hear over the radio than your own American squadmates. But other than that, character interaction is really cringe-worthy and there isn't much development to speak of.Graphics: Holy. Crap. Yeah, they're not the most beautiful thing, but Assault Horizon in 1080p at 60fps on PC, or higher, is probably the greatest thing to happen from Project Aces until Ace Combat 7. The aircraft are all gorgeous, with fully-modeled cockpits and animated control surfaces. Explosions are a little Michael Bay-esque, but something I will never get sick of is seeing an enemy aircraft shatter to pieces from a charged missile hit or the individual holes I create with the machine gun. The level of detail in the environment completely sucks at close-up views, but in general the game is so great to look at.Gameplay: Obviously the meat of the game. Fair warning, I play on ""Original"" controls, which emulates ""Normal"" in older Ace Combat games. The game is set by default to ""Optimum"", which emulates ""Novice"" in the older games and makes the game a lot easier (or a lot harder, depending on your playstyle). So if you have the game and it's not controlling the way you think it should be, take a look at the control setting and see if it's this you gotta look at.Assault Horizon's gameplay is pretty great at its best times, but really flawed at its worst. Everyone by now is aware of Dogfight Mode (DFM), which allows you to initiate a close-range chase sequence between you and one enemy aircraft. Guns are more accurate and missiles can be charged for insane accuracy and damage, but you run the risk of the enemy aircraft performing a counter-maneuver to get behind you. A lot of people claim that this is an on-rails sequence, but for the most part that isn't the case. The player still has complete control of their aircraft and must stay locked on with the enemy to keep this sequence going.Playing with fighter aircraft is the core of the game, and it works. You can still dogfight without DFM, but DFM is unfortunately required for some boss-type enemies - these guys have plot armor and are set up to give you a cinematic experience with additional dialog, you know the drill. It definitely retracts from gameplay a little too much, especially when the game cuts away from your aircraft to give you a cinematic close-up of the aircraft being destroyed. I stated before that I loved seeing this, but not in the middle of a big dogfight with tons of other units firing on me.Assault Horizon also introduces, for the first time, gameplay with bombers, helicopters, and a gunship to the series. However, I listed them in order from best to worst. Bombers are pretty fun to fly due to their unique weight and power, and you get to perform a strafing run with dozens of bombs at your disposal in the unfortunately single mission you get to have them. Helicopters, however, are really difficult to control and the missions designed for them are really poor - they're insanely difficult and seem to be aimed at shooting you down unless you follow a specific path. The gunship is the worst - anyone who's played an AC-130 mission in other shooters are sick of these already. The (thankfully only) one mission designed for it is enough to fit into the horror genre given its difficulty in the number of SAMs and AA guns that are trying to shoot you down. There's also two missions that are on-rails shooter sequences using a Black Hawk's machine gun, and they definitely overstay their welcome in terms of time.There are also a few glitches you may encounter, such as enemy aircraft flying through the ground (this has been a common bug in the entire Ace Combat series) or cutting away from DFM at insane angles that you can't follow. But for the most part, thankfully the fighter/multirole missions are the core of the game and they do work, just with a few rough edges for sure.Other: By the way, I didn't mention music or sound effects. These are gorgeous, and everyone on the Assault Horizon OST, from Rio Hamamoto to Hiroshi Okubo to Keiki Kobayashi and more, deserve insane credit. Also, be advised that there are two glaring bugs that no one has fixed since GFWL was removed: you can't rename aircraft skins or skill sets, and trying to access the leaderboards crashes the game. Additionally, the game will definitely tax on the processor for some computers. On an older machine, I couldn't run AH in tandem with a Skype call since it would lag every now and then. These are definitely minor things, though.Summary: Assault Horizon is definitely a flawed game but, for the most part in my opinion, it works. There are some things I didn't mention, like multiplayer (which is dead) and Air Strike Mode (which works just fine). I own the game on the PS3 and paid $60 for it, and I don't regret that at all because I felt it was worth it. Most won't, but the Steam version costs $20 when it's not on sale, and it goes on sale for $5 or less every now and then. So, for $20, I think it's worth a try. For $5 or less, though, it's definitely worth it. Just remember, this ain't Ace Combat, bro.			"

												As a person that has played all the ace combat games i find this game a big let down,the story is very uninspired all the characters are plain and boring. Dog fight mode is forced down your throat, most enemys in the game can only be taken down in it some of them is even scripted were you unload hundreds of bullets and missiles in to a bullet spunge air craft till its over. one other thing for some strange reason they decided not to show you what the Jets look like when you go to choose before a story mode mission with is diffrent from all previous ace combat games.

												If you buy this, do NOT buy this expecting a traditional Ace Combat experience, instead buy it expecting a blockbuster action experience similar to Call Of Duty in the means that it has some on-rails gameplay and deviates from the gameplay that is known for the rest of the series.What's changed?Alot! I went into this seeing the mixed reviews and I expected alot of change but didn't know what... for starters, the game is very story driven, there are Metal Gear-esque cut-scenes at the bunker, quick time events during combat, helicopters missions and infared bombing missions. It's strange to see Ace Combat goes this route. The music is no longer Steve Vai/Joe Satriani stuff but is that orchestral moody stuff you'd expect to hear while playing something like God Of War.Alot annoyed me at first but the gameplay is addicting as ever!The multiplayer stil functions and is acrually pretty awesome.It's okay, I like RaidersSphere4th better but this was passable after getting used to the changes. If this didn't have the name ""Ace Combat"", it would have recieved much better reviews from the player base. It's not bad, it just does things differently.			"

												Either you like it or not, Ace Combat Assault Horizon is a decently good game.For the fighter jet missions, Beautiful graphics, The fast paced in-your-face dogfighting combat is fun and makes you feel bada$$! Awesome soundtrack, definitely not dissapointed!  It's a really fun game when you look at all the action alone and stuff. DFM (DogFightMode) mode is fun, but a bit OP, as all you have to do is lock in DFM and fire missiles. ASM (AirStrikeMode) is difficult, and you have to align the plane to face the targets to shoot them down with the machine gun if your missiles don't recharge fast enough. Personally I thought ASM is a bit dissapointing.The helicopter missions are a bit ehh, slower paced and can be a bit boring as your objectives are to cover the ground allies and shoot down cars and other helicopters. Guess how you dodge a missile in a helicopter? By doing a full sideflip lol. The helicopter missions are the ones I don't really enjoy that much to be honest. The angle isnt the best on 3rd person, so I suggest 1st.  The helicopter door-gunner missions are also slower paced and can be a bit boring. Kinda laid-back gameplay. Also for the door-gunner mission, the camera is behind the soldier, which makes looking out a bit difficult.The objectives for the game is mostly: Cover you allies, Destroy enemies ASAP etc etc. If you do not do it in time, you will fail the mission. Also, the concept is the typical Americans vs Russian storyline, nothing too special.Overall:Pros:Awesome Soundtrack,Nice Graphics and fast gameplay is exciting.Flying and fighting jets is pretty fun.Impressive fighter jet gameplay.DFM mode is actually alright.Cons: Helicopter and Door-gunner missions are a bit staleBad Angle for Door-gunner missions.Helicopter missions can get boring.Mostly same objectives.ASM mode is a bit difficult.Stale storyline.I would give this game a 6.5/10.So is it worth it???? For 20 bucks, No.On sale for 5 bucks, Yes. Could be like 4 or 3 bucks tho.			"

To be more specific: they cut down the simulation in exchance for action, which didn't worked out well enough, as it seems that the simulation is much less realistic than the preveious games, despite the surreal and fictional weapons from the previous ones. I won't go down in more details since I've alreay expressed them on my angry rant above, which I am sorry if I offended someone or sounded threatening. I just couldn't hold my emotional outrburst.If you're a fan of modern action and casual (and rather silly) games, I recommend it. Give it a try and you might enjoy it.For hardcore Ace Combat fans like me, I probably don't have to say anything else.Best wishes.			"

												2/10Looks pretty, but throws everything that made the AC series great out the window in favor of forcing you into a QTE to shoot down every single plane.And there are a lot of them.Prepare for 45 minute missions to shoot downa handfull of aircraftMarvel as you watch your plane magically repair itself mid fligh!Stare astonished as that common fighter plane dodges your locked missile for the 20th time, forcing you into the half minute-minute long QTE to shoot it down!Laugh with glee as the Strangereal setting and plot(s) are tossed aside in favor of the real world with a typical summer block buster plot of evil Russians!Regret spending $5 on it during the sale and go back to playing AC Infinity!

												If this is the ""worst"" game in the series, then the rest of the series must be pretty damn good. As a non-Ace Combat player. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Get it on sale, because although it's a rather good game, $19.99 is not justifiable. The first mission is basically how air combat works, if you don't like it. You should be able to ask Steam for a refund as long as you haven't played 2 hoursAssault Horizon is rather ""fast-paced"" and plays more like a Michael Bay movie.Gameplay: DFM (Dog Fight Mode) is how you're going to take down most hostiles, if you have slow reflexes, this game is not for you. This is the deal breaker for most fans, but since I was new, it didn't affect me that much. It may get a bit repetitive and frustrating if you aren't quick enough. Also, lots of missions REQUIRE you to initiate DFM in order to progress (Ex: You need to initiate DFM with a target leader and then you'll chase an enemy under a bridge or something)ASM (Air Strike Mode) is how you're going to attack ground targets, same thing with DFM, it can get frustrating at times. Also: Two Missions require you to be a Door Gunner of a Blackhawk. Two are taking control of an AH-64. One is flying a bomber. One is flying an AC-130. Rest are flying planes Music: Eargasm, Keiki Kobayashi did an excellent job with the soundtrackStory/Campaign: Nothing new, more Russian terrorists, does a good job with the setting thoughMultiplayer: Basically deserted, next to impossible to find a game unless you're with friendsRealism: 404 not foundMisc: You can also practice your foreign languages. There are six audio languages (English, French, German, Japanese, Italian, and Spanish) and Nine Subtitle languages (English, French, German, Japanese, Italian, Spanish, Chinese, Polish, Russian)TL;DR Action Plane shooter. 8/10Again, the first few missions are basically how the rest of the campaign goes, so if you don't like it. You should be able to ask steam for a refund. (As long as you haven't played 2 hours)			"

												If your a fan of the traditional Ace Combat games, stay away from this Quick Time Event masquerating as an Ace Combat game. But if your coming from the outside i'll list some of the main gameplay points and how it plays out.The DogFight Mode is the new feature in the serise that prides itself on close quarters air to air combat. The sad thing about it is most of the time it is clunky and annoying and sadly the only way you can take down most air targets. If the targeted aircraft in the Dog Fight Mode is one of the many scripted QTE's you cant take it down until it gets to the point where the it becomes some planned out a gigantic Micheal Bay esque chase scene or explosion, sometimes if you take out the target to early or to late in the event it will slam you into the ground or a building because of the location of the QTE causing either massive damage or mission loss. Also there are many counter manuvers in DFM like slowing down and fliping over the aircraft behind you and then entering DFM behind them, which is the easiest and most damaging coarse of action. Or you can speed up and franticly speed around in the oppisite directions of the engagement circle. Which isn't terrible, but much less rewarding than doing the flip like counter manuver of speeding down. DFM makes up most of the Fighter/Multirole missions so after about the second mission it just feels so tedious going in and out and in and out of dogfight mode and doing the flip or speeding to either direction of the engagement circle.Also Fighter/Multirole flying only accounts for only half the game, where the rest is filled by either flying an Attack Chopper, being a UH-60 gunner, a AC-130 gunner or flying a B-2 or B-1 PilotFrom most fun to most annoying, it would go from in my preference: B-2 or B-1 Pilot, Attack Chopper Pilot, UH-60 gunner and then the AC-130. But im just grasping at straws because they're all poorly planned at mostpoints, dont get me wrong they can be fun at points, its just every time i've seen it demonstrated in other games (CoD (AC-130), Battlefield(Attack Helo)) its done way better. But i digress, the bombers and the Attack chopper are really the only things that let you control your fate because you have the power of maneuvering and firing in the area where you destroy targets. The UH-60 gunner and AC-130 gunner are on rails 100% and sometimes your getting hit by missles or gunfire from enemies that have either just spawned and instantly start firing or are totally out of your viewing area. For the AC-130 portions, if you've played call of duty you'll feel mostly accustomed to the mechanics. The major downside is the poorly placed AA missle spawns that sometimes are out of your viewing area. For the UH-60 gunner the gun never overheats (which isn't a complaint)so its just holding the fire button and point and shooting all of the ground targets, though like the AC-130 missions you sometimes have enemys outside the viewing area and are getting hit by things you can control. For the Bomber and Chopper portions manuverability comes at a cost of sometimes way to many enemys on the screen, from helping allys to being tageted by surface to air missles your time is spent going from point to point killing scripted enemy spawns, doing impossible flips (in the Chopper no less) and dodging god knows what so you can just get to the checkpoint.And now we come to the plot. Most people that have played an Ace Combat title before this one has been spoiled by good story telling and great mission structure. I can see if this was someones first Ace Combat title they would enjoy this story, it has everything you could want from a modern day war story. It has the rebels with WMD's and and the heros trying ther darndest to stop them and a tincey bit of mystery. Though at some points its just rediculous and thats saying alot for an Ace Combat fan. From DogFighting in a CAT-5 hurricane to being hit by a nearby WMD and basically sleeping it off, it really stretches the imagination at somepoints since this is supposde to be the most ""real"" story of the franchise. The characters can be very cliche, have little depth and just overall bland. If your a fan of the traditional american warstory than this ones for you.To wrap it up, this is hands down the worst ace combat. Though, if your coming from the outside it may be a taste of what the franchise has to offer, the Fighter portions are what make up ALL the Ace Combats besides this one and DO NOT feature the dogfight mode. The bomber portions were something that had never been tested in an Ace Combat before and were actually a breath of fresh air in this game with sticking to the oldschool Ace Combat formula of free range of flight and bomb placement, and they actually work pretty well with the traditional Ace Combat mechanics so they were patched in the F2P game (Ace Combat Infinity) on the PS3 and transitioned very well. The Chopper gunner missions are just way to on rails for them to be enjoyable and consist soley on the scripted spawn enemys. The Attack Helicopter missions are fun at times but erratic enemy placement can spoil the fun. And with the AC-130 missions, they can be fun like the Call of Duty missions but ultimatley fail at the always on rails premis and lack of target visibility. For the Fighter/Multirole portions there are many times where i'm enjoying myself, but then i realise the target im trying to attack can only be killed once i go into DFM and kill 3 other targets that sprout out of the ground.If you can get this game for the price i did $1.00 its atleast worth a shot, cause really any AAA title for a dollar is somewhat worth it. But the full price of $20.00 or $10.00 is just robbery,for an Ace Combat Fan. If your looking to wet your beak, give it a try you may end up liking it. I and many other people were just spoiled by the old classics on the PS2. If you end up liking this game and want more, i beg you to try out the original trilogy of AC4, 5 and 0 they're classics and offer way more missions, planes and story than Ace Combat: Assault Horizon			"

												This is the cancer that is killing the video game industry.Granted, I came expecting an arcade flight sim experience much like Ace Combat 2, 3, 4 and 5. Instead I found an overly and extremely casualized flight sim, if you can even call it a flight sim, full of QTEs and basically a ""dogfighting minigame"". Whereas in previous games you actually had to outmanouver the enemy top planes here you just press a series of buttons to kill everything.You can't even fly inverted or do loops. In that regard this game is exactly like the ""plane"" game AfterBurner for Sega Megadrive that came out in the 90s.This isn't even worth it at a 90% discount. Do not get this game, it isn't even fun.			"

												A disappointment to an Ace Combat fan like myself. The ""dogfight mode"" is very clunky and glitches out very frequently, making the screen spaz. Combined with a sub-par storyline and lacking those superweapons that made prior Ace Combat games so much fun, and the fact that no level can be played without using Dogfight Mode or some variation of it beside the badly controlled helicopter missions, this game really was below my expectations. It is definately one of the most disappointing releases since Ace Combat 3 (the English version).			"

												DISCLAIMER: I say a lot of this having gotten the game for a mere $5, and with little former Ace Combat experience.	My rating out of ten on this game sort of fluctuates depending on my mood.  I think it’s at most an overall 8/10, though there are moments it really feels pretty great.  Obviously you probably are here looking through the prominent negativity of the general reviews and maybe you spotted this one of, like, three positive ones.  If you, for instance, are coming back to the store page for a visit, you’re probably confused about how anyone likes this game.  I don’t know.  What’s wrong with me?	Well, first off, we should probably glimpse at what people are consistently saying is bad and I can, to some degree, verify.  I’ll save the big one for last:Apparent US/NATO bias, and other sort of national things: Though it seems the PAK-FA is the penultimate plane in all of this, the game seems to focus on America with Russian alternatives.  There are other planes- The JAS-39, EF2000, Rafale, and Mirage show up, in addition to the F-2 (...as a strict attacker, whilst the AV-8B is a multirole fighter) and the fictitious CFA-44 and ASF-X.  However, it seems to glorify the F-22, has two playable American bombers while neither of the Russian ones that show up are playable, and a lot of fighters from other nations that I would have liked to see (granted I don’t think a few of them, like the J-20 and ATD-X, were well known at the time) were missing, and one that I would have LOVED, the MiG-31, was present but unplayable.  With that said, the US planes don’t seem all that much stronger.  What I’ve also seen mentioned is that the Russian characters seem like walking stereotypes, and undeniably the story is focused on America, even when you play as non-US planes.  And, yes, I know that the game is Japanese.  That’s what makes it a bit weird...Story: So, I hear the story is bad.  I thought it was ok.  I mean, as said above, it is focused on the US, and, without spoiling too much, a Russian superweapon has been taken and is being used for purposes of terror by a Russian separatist group, so in a way it…  does sort of pit the US and Russia against each other, even though everyone is actually working together to fight the guys who happen to be Russian.  There was also this one part where it makes a few Russian helicopter pilots look like idiots.  Of the story itself, I don’t see what was so bad.  I mean, maybe mediocre, but certainly not actually painful past that.  There were even a few parts that I liked- I thought the briefing scenes were nice, and the scenario does highlight the intensity of the missions very well.Unrealism in some areas: So the game, which seems to try to be realistic (at least until you notice the payloads), has some unrealistic areas.  The first is something that all Ace Combat games have, I think (I remember in 04, which I played, it was like this).  You have way too many missiles- near two hundred default ones and about thirty of a special type.  This is cool though, just don’t think about it too hard.  Then there’s the gun.  Unlike my experience in 04, the gun has unlimited ammo- there’s even a part of the plane stats that tells you how much ammo you have and it just has dashes there, as if they initially wanted numbers.  It does overheat, though.  Speaking of the gun, it one-shots tanks.  Yeah.  The controls also have two modes- the default is more like Star Fox than Ace Combat, having automatic roll and pitching when you press either side key instead of manually needing to bank and then pitch- at the same time, it actually seems to do weird things to the aircraft flight model, for instance the force applied by the rudders seems to always be parallel to the ground in this.  But you can turn it off.  Furthermore, things don’t feel like they’re actually there in a weird way.  Just look at how the planes land.  The helicopters have also been panned as unrealistic.  For one thing they have JC2 controls where they just translate magically instead of actually moving by pitching, yawing, and rolling.  They could have plane-like control for rotation, throttle for collective, and slave the gun to whatever target you have locked- seems like a much better setup and about as easy to code in hindsight.  If Aces ever goes back to helis, I think that’s how they should do it.  Also, and I’m actually not sure whether or not this works in real life, the helicopters can do an aileron roll as an evasive tactic instead of flares.  Holy Hell, if that actually works…The big one: The main criticism is the “Modes”.  Air strike mode (ASM) is not that bad, in fact in its absence the ground attack missions actually feel a bit lacking (EDIT: Not that I would suggest bringing it back).  But the main complaint is Dogfight Mode (DFM).  DFM is definitely unrealistic and, though it does do its job to keep combat close and intense, is overall a pretty bad thing for a game that seems to want to keep some realism.  Basically in DFM, you start playing a Star Fox on-rails level, where the direction is picked by the target.  Via fancy maneuvers you can break the guy off of the tail (or more often, give him whiplash), but otherwise…  It’s Star Fox.  And no, I don’t hate Star Fox.  To see how screwed it is, just try entering DFM from a distance and look at how your plane moves on radar.  Other times, the enemy plane decides it can move through this particular area of the terrain, forcing you into an unavoidable crash.	With all that said, I think most of it is true.  I would have loved some more realism in the controls and the helicopters, and while I don’t think I could have played with KBM controls as is without DFM handholding me, I would have preferred smoother controls to it becoming a rail shooter temporarily.	The good things it offers, however, are…  Good…  Yeah…  It has a nice variety of planes, great graphics, anime, high immersion, a few ground attack missions that you don’t normally see, a lot of variety, anime, excellent music, huge and detailed maps, anime, adrenaline, anime, anime, anime.  Anime.  Even the DFM does, as mentioned above, do its job and get really intense.  However, as I stated, I have little experience in Ace Combat.  For this reason I assume I could have gotten every good bit of this from another AC title, and Assault Horizon isn’t really bringing anything to the table…	Except maybe that multiplayer.  I haven’t played it myself- I hear it’s dead.  No one online, and by this point, they may have dropped online support (especially with Infinity out- that could use the resources).  But from what I’ve heard it’s quite good.  I imagine that facing other players would make DFM much more fun, and furthermore, you have access to more than just the fighters.  Again, not entirely sure, but if it flies, I think you can play it, from choppers to fighters to bombers (maybe not the AC-130U and MH-60 gunships), and not only that, but all in the same match with AI ground units, so a nice touch of combined arms there, certainly sounds nice.  Maybe someone popular could pick it up on a free weekend/sale and have everyone play it at once until it gets old.  Still though, what I’ve seen called THE good point is dead.  If there’s anything else to be said, it’s the only cross-platform game of the series, and the only one on PC.	But, hey, Project Aces recognizes it as a non-canon spin-off, so feel free to pretend it doesn’t exist.			"

												Ace Combat's first outing on PC is one of style, cool visuals, and horrible delivery. While the DFM mode adds a cool element of spectacular destruction, it wears out its welcome when it is literally forced onto the player in some sections. These kind of sequences aren't new and they can work well, like in the new Fallouts. However, there you voluntarily activate the sequence. Here, it's required in some portions. It literally becomes an on the rail shooter without warning and only serves to jar. But, the most damning and horrible shortcoming is the control interface: You're literally forced to use a gamepad lest you have to endure shoddy keyboard controls or even worse joystick control. The Joystick support is non-existent. This is unacceptable. Some say this is a game meant to be played on a gamepad and this just smacks of apologetics for laziness that has become so familiar within the industry. Even Tom Clancy's HAWX, which wasn't all that good, had a basic dead zone slider and that came out in 2009, this was early 2013. There's no excuse for this at all. Why can't someone with a joystick enjoy a game about flight? Why is the joystick suddenly a peripheral only for the hardcore flight sim? And why are people defending this lazy thinking as if spending money on a game were a privilege for them?In the end, this is a horrible game and for those seeking a good arcade flying experience would be better served with the original HAWX or, better still, going out and buying a PS2 with its trilogy of Ace Combats. Those games are superior in everyway to this pile of dung. If you're looking for a good arcadey experience on pc? Your regular flight sims can provide; just crank down the physic settings and difficulty. Wings of Prey is also another good choice for that when compared to this.Either way, this games is awful. Skip.			"

												(DISCLAIMER: I played this on the PS3 when it came out and hated it; I decided to revisit the PC version to see if I were wrong about it. TL;DR version: I wasn't)Hey, do you remember the days of bad NES games that were 4 stages long and still lasted half your lifetime on this Earth? That's what Assault Horizon is.Coming to us from the dark ages of modern PC gaming, when PC ports were an afterthought at best and console gaming was all about machismo military jingoism. Namco thought the best way to revitilize the great Ace Combat series would be to remove it from its anti-war imaginary parallel earths and drop it straight into the real-world, in a conflict in Africa where NATO forces clash against rebels, who have managed to get a super-weapon from Russian Ultranationalists. Because if Call of Duty did it, why can't we?Not only is the game missing its predecessors' charm, but the gameplay is absolutely the worst; not just in the series, but among many flight arcades. The flying has moved beyond ordinary figher jets and now includes attack helicopters and long-range ""hey let's squash the ants with our giant american♥♥♥♥♥♥cannons from the sky"". The vehicles have REGENERATING HEALTH (yup, that is absolutely true) and for all the developers' efforts, the flying feels woefully... boring. There are a lot of gimmicks, especially when flying fighter jets, to make the game look 'cool', but all it does is dumb down the flight into a series of button presses and remove player agency. Levels last for far too long, with far too many objectives that are comprised of ""shoot that"" and... nothing else. How many times can you hear ""OMG REBELS ARE COMING IN"" before you just fall asleep eyesocket-first into your flight stick?The port is alright in that it runs and, surprisingly, even supports my Logitech 3D Extreme Pro stick right out of the box. Having said that, the visual and sound options may as well not exist, considering how barren the menus are.It's a terrible game. It's an affront to the name ""Ace Combat"". It's a waste of money. All of that simply because it's mind-numbingly boring. You start a mission, you try to get into it, but it soon devolves into repeating the exact same task a million times. Do tell, Namco and Team Aces or whoever is responsible for this tragedy; why did you think it would be challenging to repeat the same exact objective 15 times in a single mission? Because that's what this game is. This isn't a high-octane action arcade shooter; it's a shooting gallery with nipple-tearing controls. An excercise in patience.Not recommended. At all. Stay away. I can't stress this enough; I have played other Ace Combat games, I know how much the PC is yearning for this type of genre and that sims aren't always enough to fill that gap, but Assault Horizon isn't the hill to die on. Not at full-price, not on a sale, do. not. buy.0/10 would start playing my games as soon as I buy them so I can at least request refunds.			"

												Listen. I grew up on flying games like Top Gun: Combat Zones, Jetfighter, iF-22, and later HAWX, Ace Combat 6, and Sky Crawlers (an INCREDIBLE piece by Project Aces). One thing these games all had in common is engaging, fast-paced, and straightforward dogfighting that demanded precise control and a keen wit to spotting enemy maneuvers and countering them to your advantage. I grew up with these learning to dogfight using only the stick, yaw, and throttle to create dynamic dogfights and neverending fun. The unlimited freedom of flight is really why flying games are my favorite.READ: THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE GAMES.Fair warning: I will vent. HO' BOY AM I GUNNA VENT-The game opens on a dramatic cutscene-SKIP JUST LEMME FLY I DONT NEED PLOT I NEED PLANES-and a storm of fighter jets over.....Florida...? (NO ACE COMBAT GAMES ARE SET ON EARTH HNNNGGGGGGG WROOONGG)You drop right into combat and you're in your jet! Cool! Can I shoot things now?NO YOU HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT THIS GREAT NEW THING WHERE THE GAME PLAYS ITSELF FOR YOU CALLED DFM (DogFightMode)Oh okay, I'll give you the benifit of the doubt. Flying games have always had some wierd new mechanic to make them ""unique"" (gotta admit though, I love playing around in the ""Assist Off"" mode in the HAWX games).So this fresh new thing is basically a dogfight autopilot that forces you to tail an escaping enemy. Cool, I guess. You just hit B a few times to launch the (booming echo) NONDESCRIPT HOMING MISSLE THAT OPERATES PURELY ON DFM MECHANICS. Some (booming echo) CINEMATIC EXPLOSION shrapnel fly into your engines and your (booming echo) GENERIC GRIZZLED WHITE MALE PROTAGONIST says he wants to check his systems. Cue generic control tutorial. *gasp* CAN I DOGFIGHT NOW CAN I CAN-...nope just go into DFM again and do a gun tutorial...now?Nope! More autopilot! And this time a bunch of bad guys fly directly in front of you solely to get themselves blown up LIKE FRIGGING SPACE INVADERS FOR CHRIST'S SAKE*deep breath*Okay, that was boring. Game wants me to use DFM again? No, screw you game, I'm doing my own thing and dogfighting old school like I payed money to do!*long silence*.....what...why....I can't... I can't.... kill them...I PUMPED COUNTLESS MISSLES INTO EVERY ENEMY AND YOU LITERALLY /CAN/ /NOT/ /KILL/ /THEM/ /OUT/ /OF/ /DFM/That HAS to be only the tutorial, righ-NO.ITS NOT JUST THE TUTORIAL.YOU CAN'T KILL ENEMIES DUBBED AS ""ACES"" UNLESS YOU USE THE STUPID BORING DFM AND I'M NOT SWEARING FOR STEAM'S SAKE BUT CHRIST I AM ON THE INSIDE.No really, I tried. They all have infinite flares that never fail and even if you manage to bait them with one missle, wait for flare, and fire another while they can't deploy more, YOU CAN HIT THEM /ENDLESSLY/ AND THEY WILL NOT DIEI SPENT TWENTY MINUTES ON /ONE/ GUY AND JUST LOADED HIM WITH MISSLES ENDLESSLY AND HE WILL NOT CRASH. This is the point where I said ""screw this trash"" and shut the game off.Did I mention that the tutorial leads directly into a rail turret mission? A RAIL TURRET MISSION. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PROJECT ACES WHAT ARE YOU DOING. THIS IS A /FLYING/ GAME. YOU MAKE /FLYING/ GAMES. I DIDN'T PAY REAL CASH MONEY DOLLARS TO HOLD RT DOWN FOR TEN MINUTES AND ENJOY THE FRACKING SCENERY.I don't even wanna KNOW what the AC130 missions other reviewers mentioned are like.Few more nitpicks from a flight sim/arcade vet: The stalling mechanic is just your nose falling. Yeah, that would have been acceptable in 2002 ON THE PLAYSTATION FRIGGING TWO. You know, I seem to remember a real-feeling stalling mechanic IN A GOOD ACE COMBAT GAME.All that happens when you brake while turning is you move a little faster. There's no smoothing or feel of a real plane decelerating and slowly tightening its turning radius or any kind of physics at all. It blows my mind that all the things I HATE about this game were already features IN PREVIOUS GAMES THATS NOT HOW PROGRESS WORKS-tl;dr: Sorry I really needed to vent all that. If you like arcadey, almost shmup action with all kinds of cinematic flair? This game is for you. If you like flight sims or ANYTHING RELATED TO THE PREVIOUS ACE COMBAT GAMES THEN NO FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STAY AWAY. I'm glad I got this from the Humble Bundle because if I had paid $20 for this I would probably sue Project Aces,God... I don't think I've ever been so disappointed in a game that I have to just stop playing to avoid future embarassment. I've never written a review. This made me so upset that I sat down and wrote a two-page, 850 word review about how disappointed I am,Out of ten? How low does the scale go? Because that's my answer. Screw this game. Uninstalling.			"

												The graphics are kinda nice actually and the DFM (Dog Fight Mode) of engaging in combat with enemy planes makes the gameplay more exciting that ""I am turning to shoot at you, ok, still turning"".The story however is pretty bland and cliche, especially for one that's supposedly by some veteran author, I guess it kills my interest in his works...Buy this on sale, hook up a controller and create a Pandora station called ""Danger Zone"" and live the dream.

												I have been a fan of Ace Combat since the original and I hate to say I would probably avoid this title. Ace Combat Assault Horizon, unlike most of the other Ace Combat games, has real world locations which is a nice addition to the series and you can now pilot some helicopters. The developers unfortunately added ""Dogfight Mode"" and ""Air Strike Mode"" which turns the game into an on the rails quick time event. It is an unforgivably terrible addition to the series and cannot be avoided as many objectives require the player to use this mode. Some players might be able to work with this game mode and still appreciate Ace Combat's attention to detail and diverse plane selection, I however could not; preferring to play the older titles and hoping on the newer ones.

												I've played several ace combat games for ps2 and xbox 360 but this is by far the worst gameplay for any in the series. Now to be fair i decided to play with a logitech extreme3d pro x3d but its the fact i cant barrel roll and the whole time your fighting the plane to stay in the position you want i played with out flight assist then turned it on for kicks making it worse but you can only roll right before you get hit to evade by tapping/hitting a button. i really wanted to enjoy this game but with the controls how they are now i feel like i dont have full control of the plane ruining my gameplay experience i didn't even want to play through the 1st mission.

I highly recommend Ace Combat 04, 5, and 0.You have a PC, figure out how to play PS2 games on there.If you are to get an ""Ace Combat: Assault Horizon"" game, get the 3DS game as it is a far superior game. Then again, that game is actually a remake of Ace Combat 2, despite what the name suggests.Pros:Decent VisualsWide array of aircraft to choose fromIdolm@ster aircraft spraysGreat sound designClassic Ace Combat SFX usedCons:Mediocre StoryBland or meh charactersForced cinematic combatSlippery controlsTerrible chopper gunner sections""Damn!""3/10			"

												Here's my short opinion on this game.It doesn't feel like an Ace Combat game. The dog fighting mechanic needs to never be revisited. Constantly I am frustrated by planes taking 45 seconds of constant gun and missile damage just to randomly die at the end of a set piece I wasn't paying attention to. Or to have the same thing happen only to land me a face plant into to ground cause thats where the rail spit me out. Turning a fly around and take down jets game into a rail based 3rd/first person shooter is not a good step for the series.			"

												I returned my Dreamcast to buy the original Playstation 20 years ago because I spent hours in ToysRus playing the demo of Air Combat. One night I went in and some kid was hogging the Playstation station. He wouldn't get off so I bought my own console because Air Combat was just that good. It wasn't til a few weeks later that I discovered Doom and then Tomb Raider and Resident Evil. Air Combat sold me on Playstation.Action, action, action. As soon as you shoot down one bunch, they're replaced with another bunch. That could be a good thing but in this game I just found it to be tedious. You're constantly turning, pulling G's. It seems like it never ends and then they give you an awful cut scene and then they turn you into a helicopter gunner. If fighter jets fought in stadium sized battles then this would be an accurate sim. I almost never feel like I'm flying. I'm just steering a camera around some tight turns with a picture of a jet plane in front of me. They never let you do your own thing like explore the world or the capabilities of the jet. It never feels like anything more than a game. The game is constantly telling you to do things. Sure it is helpful to integrate the tutorial with the gameplay but it sucks when a huge flashing ""Y"" button starts throbbing in the middle of your intense dogfight. The game is ordering you to eject into a cutscene. For an action game I'm surprised they weren't concerned how bad this game is at giving you the feeling of speed and acceleration. At least in the early game the feeling of S and A just isn't there for more than a second. I never feel like I am moving through air or being lifted by lift. I just turn my camera with the pasted on HUD and go to different parts of the background picture. Then they have that part where your computer or console takes you down real low through a forest of smoke stacks and girders. That might have been cool if I felt like I actually was steering or choosing to go there. I am moving sticks and such but obviously there's a lot of ""assists"" going on or something. Its almost a cutscene. You'd think that would be a good thing to be at the controls going through those maneuvers but the whole thing is so fudged and predetermined its just disappointing and annoying. The sophisticated navigation consists of a little map in the corner with glowing arrows. It makes me feel so like I'm in a modern fighter plane. You also won't be bowled over by the airplane models, the HUD models or anything like that. They all are definitely blah.I was a fan of the original Air Combat as it came out on the PS1 and while that wasn't really a sim, it was better than this. If you like a lot of fast action and constant battle or you're just wondering how something this action packed can be so boring  then Ace Combat might be the game for you.			"

												This is an arcade style shooter and not a serious flight sim. So to enjoy this you must forget your previous encounter with the ace combat franchise in terms of gameplay mechanics and even the story telling. This is made like a interactive movie and you are in the ride with limited steering options because the whole thing moves on tracks at high speed. This is the curse and blessing of this game depending how you look at it. It gets hectic and exhilarating but it does not have great characters or story or immersion. I myself like the action which is frantic. Story wise this is as bad as the Michael Bay movies get... The cheesy Russian terrorists to mess up the whole world kind of plot I personally could not care less about. It's not even told in an engaging way, even at a time when terrorism is actually a hot potato right now. I feel like game developers swap back and forth with the washout writers that come from hollywood when they can't make it there, and vice versa. Seriously gaming in general is on a steep declining slope in terms of quality of content. Good graphics don't alone make a good game. However this game for me as I'm a casual gamer,is okay in terms of the over the top, Top Gun'esque action. This is like the 'independence day' version of aerial combat. It's not good storywise or by characters, but action leaves your heart pounding and liking it when brains are in need of relaxing and crave for just stupid action for sake of action.			"

												This particular AC game is extremely simple compared to the previous games. The airial combat is very intense and fast paced however I feel that they over simplified the game a bit.The missions are fun and the storyline is decent, unfortunately though as the game progresses through the main story the missions become more and more tedious and repetative.Overall I'd say you should buy this if you are new to airial combat games or plan on collecting all of the Ace Combat franchise.Graphics: 8/10Gameplay: 9/10Story: 5/10Replay Value: 4/10Overall Rating: 6/10			"

												Ace Combat: Assault Horizon is a flight combat simulator game from BANDAI, Another installment in Ace Combat series from the console.Ace Combat: Assault Horizon gameplay is kinda different from any Ace Combat I ever play. In fact, it is different. Some differences are good, even great, but there is something I considered crazy and not fun too. Let's start with the good stuff. My favorite one is the DFM or they call it Dog Fight Mode, which when you get closer to enemy bogey and lock on, you can enter DFM instead and chase the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ through anything, aim very close and engage with your jets machine gun instead of missiles just because it looks cool and epic. There is also ASM  or they call it Air Strike Mode, almost similar to DFM except this one is for ground target. In some part of the mission, DFM or ASM are not optional because some enemies are just too bloody fast and good to be shot down normally. There are also the new helicopter mission, bomber mission, AC-130 mission like the one in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, and Blackhawk minigun mission? The campaign story is also quite interesting.Ace Combat: Assault Horizon graphics are kinda great, and quite detailed. Overall the graphics is good. Performances is also great, no problems at all, at least on my end. Soundtracks of the game are kinda cool too.Although, there is some bad things also, like the helicopter mission. While the helicopter gameplay is kinda fun, it's doesn't feel that great, and barrel roll with helicopter every moment you're about to get shot? That's just not awesome for me. The helicopter control itself is kinda restricted, why can't anybody make control of helicopter game like in Battlefield series? Is it because it's too hard for some? At least make it a choice. Then the Blackhawk minigun mission... I thought this is a flight combat simulator? Then the skill of special enemies... boss fight? Wow, they're just so ace that even with DFM they can dodge almost all my missile every single time! Even locking them to enter DFM is kinda hard. I spend quite a time just to dodge instead destroying each other.But aside from those, Ace Combat: Assault Horizon has many good moment. It's good flight simulator game and fun to play. Helicopter mode needs some polish and it has potential. I recommend this.Rating 7/10			"

												As much as I was dying to have an Ace Combat game on my PC, this has turned out to be a bust.  Despite the great graphics and flying mechanics of the jets, combat itself is constantly interrupted with unnecessary visual scenes that literally distract gameplay.  For instance, if you're tailing an enemy and send him down with a missile, the game will cut to a nice little visual that shows him getting destroyed, but then jumps back to you plummetting to the ground.  There are many times where it cuts back to me flying into an object, failing the mission, and ruining the game.  This also occurs with bombing runs, where you're given the option to fly an optimized bombing run path.  There was a mission where the game was ruined from following the path, because all of the cut scenes took away from your mission time.  I found it much easier to not even enter these ridiculous paths, removing some of the stupid dialog and scenes, and completing my mission on time. You could try to claim that one could ignore these ridiculous features and try to complete the missions without using them, but some of the missions either lock you in them or are impossible without executing them.  For instance, dog fighting with vetern pilots are nearly impossible in the game unless you enter the ridiculous dog fight feature.  What's worse is that your jet and your enemies jet heals over time, so your dogfights can carry on for over-drawn out and unrealistic periods of time. If you want a jet fighter game that's realistic, this is not the one for you.  You will be hampered by ridiculous and unrealistic features.  If you want just some cool arcade game, then have fun with it.			"

												This game is certainly underrated due being a late port from the PS game.Game's pretty nice, quite cinematic at times in the main story.It FEELS like a spinoff, because it is after all, it does not take place in the ficticious world but on the real one, with the generic USA vs Russia conflict. (been playing this franchise since the second one) It is not very long (around 13 hours).Multiplayer is amazing, slighty empty due being a late port as i stated above, but it offers quite a competitive feeling, ranks and quite some maps/game modes.For those who don't want to get stomped by aces and such, you have a Co-op Mode which takes you to the main story but with 3~4 friends (can't remember very well) so it's perfect for those who want to get a good time without worrying about a real pilot on their tails.Controls are easy to pick up, and graphics looks really nice for being a 3 years old game. You can customize your plane with colours/skins.It is a gem and even more at $7,50! Pick it up and smell you in game!			"

												It's a mindless shooter, but different from the usual! I've been a lifelong fan of the AC series (having played most - PSX & PS2) and honestly, I am enjoying this game. To me, it's everything an Ace Combat series is, resplete with cheesy dialogue, over the top action sequences (and plane decorations), JRock soundtrack and the 'happy ending, no two ways about it' story.While most people dislike (or downright hate) the DFM, ASM & helicopter segments of the game, I'm quite sure that it's one of the things that the developers tried to bring in to keep the title fresh. Personally, I have no problems against these segments, in fact I very much welcome them. DFM mode shows multi-million dollar planes being reduced to smouldering heaps of scrap and that's ALWAYS satisfying to see - more so when it's the buggering boss! Again, there might be problems with it (unpopulated MP, at least in my SEA region) and other things, but I still like it a lot. I feel its a good title to keep us satisfied while waiting for AC7, probably due out later this year.Performance wise, there isn't any jarring issues and it is optimised wonderfully.Give it a try!

												This game will be a good game experience if you're not looking for a super accurate flight simulator. In this game Konami had prefered to follow something more ""friendly / arcade"" with cinematic appeal.The campaign will take about 8 hours to complete and it is pretty decent just stay aware that there are many scripted scenes on the game, including the last misstion which is about 90 scripted and it REALLY is annoying.I recommend playing the game with a controller (used a X360 one here) and get it for a pretty cheap deal since the community  isn't playing Multiplayer anymore so you will come up playing only with your friends.

This game stole my heart. It's an in-your-face modern blockbuster fighter jet spectacle, where laws of gravity bow down to ace pilots - because ace pilots are badass, baby.The premise/story is very corny and much of the gameplay is rail-shooting in disguise. But the disguise is so well produced that the result is a loveable game. Sound design helps this game a lot; constant radio chatter creates a good military term dropping feel and the soundscape of air combat is amazing.I rarely say ""action-packed"", but this game is. It is purely fun to play, watch and listen to. Great music - a deliberately produced mix of metal and orchestral elements - plays a big role in tightening up the already over the top explosion symphony in the sky.It's linear, it's not perfect, but it always delivers in the blockbuster-kind of way. Love it.			"

												Assault Horizon isn't quite as good as the PS2 Ace Combats, but it's good enough to be a fun jet fighting based game when there are few of those on the market. There are a few issues with it - such as the Call of Duty-esque plot and the forced dogfight sequences with enemy aces where you can't really kill them until after the cutscene finishes.  Overall though, I enjoyed the dogfight mechanic when compared to the old system. It made the game more fun and less having to go cross-eyed trying to shoot down enemy planes on the horizon.			"

												While the game has some interesting and fun mechanics, its downfalls are just too large to overlook. On one side, the game's story is next to non-existant. What little story there is, from what I've seen so far, is about as generic and boring as can be.That said, the story is obviously not meant to be the draw of the game. A game such as this really only has a bit of story to tie the gameplay together. It's the gameplay that is of greatest importance here. So, is the gameplay good? Well... I didn't think so.The game relies far too much on it's new DFM feature. DFM might look cool, and even feel a bit exciting at first, but in the end it just turns the game into an interactive POV cutscene. ""Hold the triggers and then push B when the lights turn red. Repeat until the enemy is dead. Find a new enemy and repeat again.""A dogfight has the potential to be fun and rewarding, relying on the skill of the player to manuver his/her plane to keep on the tail of the enemy. But instead, we're told to rely almost entirelly on this new mechanic that does nothing that drain the game of what COULD have been it's greatest moments.At least the game is pretty. the environments are well put together, and the radio chatter was definitely a treat.In all, I'd give the game a 4/10[I'll update the review if my opinion changes after playing for more.]			"

												No matter how many times i try to play this, one thing keeps stopping me. That dogfighting mode. The game tries to force you into it, in every way it can. Be it, unlimited no cooldown flares, or the insanly tight turn radius of the enemy planes. Yeah there are other issues with the gameplay, such as the door gunner missions being bland or the helicopters awkward aiming when i the cockpit. but that DCM just takes control away from you and isnt optional. Plus it only really works with the turn left/right controls, rather than the pitch and roll. Shame, i love the Ace Combat games (The first game i ever completed was Air Combat) and would love this one if that feature wasnt so heavily used.			"

												FIRST OF ALL: KEEP V-SYNC ON. The game stutters and lags without it, glitching your plane into unrecoverable crashes. Now that's out of the way, this game is by no means a game for an Ace Combat fan like myself. It's been casualized up the♥♥♥♥♥so it can ""reach a wider audience"". The Dogfighting Mode (More like dogshit mode) forces you into scripted chases and the game CANNOT BE FINISHED without using it. Taking control away from the player is one of the worst things you can do in a game like this. Oh and for some reason, this is only for sale in the US because it's probably a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game that no one will buy anywhere else, and that kills the multiplayer scene if you're not in the US. Conclusion: Buy only if a serious AC fan, and if you want better games in the genre, emulate the prequels on the PS1 and PS2.			"

												This game... it's okay.I say that because there are good aspects and bad aspects. Before I start, I haven't played any Ace Combat games but this game appears to vary in style from the different Ace Combat games according to others. As I don't see this as a sin, I won't include this in the negatives. Allow me to elaborate on the + and -'s:Positives:-Graphics are good, especially in dogfighting mode.-Storyline is somewhat decent too, drew me in a little.-A great soundtrack.-Freedom of choice between different planes, including one with a chemical weapon. (It has a Eurofighter Typhoon too!)-Mechanics are somewhat easy to get used to.Negatives:-The artificial difficulty is painful to look at. It's way too obvious. I'd be dominating a Pak FA and all of a sudden he turns into Yakumo Yukari or something and somehow appears behind me in a split second. They might also fly straight waiting for you to engage them.-The game handles terribly on a flight stick in my opinion. I've tried to get used to it, but it just doesn't work for me. It's best played with a controller.-Some of the reaction times for the counters are ridiculous, I've resorted to spamming the counter button praying I hit it at the right moment. I mean, it's very predictable when they maneuver.-Too repetitive for my liking. Yes, it is a story driven game but they could have done more with what they had. For example, HAWX 2 had different game modes such as Survival and special campaign modes. They could have at least added more like this.My final judgement: Only good for a single playthrough really. If you're feeling lucky, you can try and get a high ranking on all missions but that's about it. Because I am recommending it for a single playthrough, I am rating this up because the story was nice and the other features mentioned contributed. However, if you've played any of the other Ace COmbat games, beware as this is not like the other games (apparently). This is more of a story based game rather than a gameplay based game so I am judging the game with that in mind. If you did not think this review was helpful, please leave advice in the comments, I appreciate it a lot.			"

												Now that Games For Windows Live has been removed from the game, my CD key automatically works, and I can now save the game. I have had no problems so far, and the game is on sale again.The FIRST thing you should do when you get this game is to change the control style to ORIGINAL. The new control style doesn't give you full control of the planes. If you cant go upside down, it aint Ace Combat. The game is pretty good overall, but the ""dogfight"" mode is just plain annoying. It doesnt really take any skill to do, and doesn't give you any sense of accomplishment when you do it. Being basically forced to use it isnt cool. The helicopter levels are boring COD style minigun action. And the 3rd person camera, which is behind the gunners shoulder, does not help. I got this game for around 5 dollars on sale, which was a good price, but I dont think i would pay over 15.			"

												I don't know why people is being so hard on this game. I've been playing the Ace Combat series since Ace Combat 2, and even if this is quite the exception over the whole series, as of story to functions and controls, it's still enjoyable. I've got a great time playing ACAH and enjoying the variety in it, not only on all the fighter planes, but also flying helicopters (which is something many AC players would have liked on previous AC games) and using a gun turret.Well, the gun turret it's the only that seems a bit off for a game mostly about air combat, even if it's on a helicopter, that's the only thing that would belong to a CoD-esque game, but overall, it's still a good game.I wouldn't recommend it only if you are a hardcore AC fan expecting a continuaiton of what was left on AC6.

												God aweful. It brings shame on the Ace Combat name. I hate DFM, its so easy it's boring. It would be fine if you weren't forced to do it. The story loses it's most interesting qualities by becoming a generic 'Murica circle jerk. There are worse Flight sims, but when you compare it to the rest of the Ace Combat series I can't stand it. I didn't even make it half way through before I got bored and quit.			"

												its a really mixed bag, on one hand the aircraft look rather beautiful and there is a large selection to choose from. but as a long time AC fan, the combat just rubs me the wrong way. if aircraft games arnt your thing you may like it but i personally did, the story is meh and after a few missions in you are gonna be falling asleep because you dont really care about the cardboard cut outs that is the people you play as and play with. i mean best way to discribe it is its a b flick that has a solid budget (but lots of booms doe). oh and one important thing, PLAY WITH A CONTROLLER!!!! sadly thats the only way i found to play without wanting to down a gallon of bleach. If your looking for reaslism, get a real flight sim, if you want a game thats arcadey and somewhat realistic, play war thunder, if you want a game were you can shut your brain off and see planes explode, get this.

												Fun game, very arcady (you start withy 200-300 missiles on each mission), especially considering you pretty much can't go without the make-special-move-to-tail-a-bogey mechanic.That mechanic in itself is what turns me down the most in this game. Or rather, how forced you are into using it often as it's pretty much impossible to kill some enemies without it.Story line is not really that much worth, standard evil Russians, good guy NATO pretty much.It's not that difficult, at least on the lower difficulty settings. Just gets a bit repetitive after a while.If anything, this game is made for casual players.			"

												I think people are exaggerating about the dog fight mode, you don't have to use it aside from against certain bosses. At its core this is still ace combat, although the story isn't quite as good as 4, 5 or 0.The helicopter missions are ok, reminds me of games like Comanche 4.The lowest points are the ASM and AC-130 missions, ASM is avoidable but you might not make the objectives in time if you don't use it. AC-130 stuff is just monotonous and drags on for way too long.			"

												I have to admit I hesitated to buy this game because of the mixed reviews on Steam. I have played and completed almost every Ace Combat to date so I was scared I was going to be disappointed with this one. I finally got it just a few days ago, played it and completed the single player, and let me tell you - it was easily worth it! The graphics are great (It's not the prettiest game ever but it runs smooth as butter and the overall detail level is high; explosions and plane models look exceptionally great), the gameplay is fast and frantic, there is rarely a dull moment in the entire 16 mission campaign. The story is nothing to write home about but it's interesting enough. The missions are surprisingly varied (especially in comparison to older AC games) and a lot of fun to play trough. The planes handle like a dream and the controls are great (I used a X360 controller). I see a lot of people are bashing the new dog fighting mechanic but I have to say I liked it - sure, it happens a bit too often but it never really gets boring and it's not without challenge (I've played the game on HARD difficulty). I also see a lot of people bashing the helicopter missions and the turret sections and I can't agree with them. The helicopters are a great addition to the game (it's not without problems, sure, I died many times because of the controls, for example) and the turret missions are short and fun, just as they should be. All in all this is a great game, easily recommendable to any fan of AC or action games in general. Just don't expect a simulation or something like that :) Oh yeah and - this IS a TRUE Ace Combat game, but I guess haters gonna hate anyway :)			"

												This game had been on my radar for some time but I decided against buying it because I'm a hardcore flight simmer and arcade  flight titles are like a heresy to us genuine simmers.With the free weekend trial however I decided to try it and I have since been able to appreciate the game as is after spending about 7 hours into it. That is not a flight sim per see but a light shooter game centered around the theme of planes (and I love planes).As a light game this game delivers some serious fun especially online. Many people aren't able to appreciate the DFM (dogfighting mode) part of the game. But to me it's a brilliant mechanic to get a feel of that personal knife fight aerial dogfight. The suspense in DFM is quite real and very very fun.The single player campaign which can be played co-op however, can be a little too tedious for many however.I just wish more people would play this game online where the gameplay shines!

												This is not Ace Combat 04, 05, or Zero.This barely even FEELS like an Ace Combat game.If you play this you will spend 95% of the game struggling with the fact that the game is designed to try and force you into D.F.M. which is nothing more than a rail shooter chase scene with other planes to try and shoot them down. If you don't, you're going to learn real fast that the enemy planes can pull more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t moves than HAWX or the movie STEALTH. I want to like this game. And I can...if I consider it an airborne version of a Call Of Duty game. Not as an Ace Combat.Here's to hoping Ace Combat 7 does a better job since it's going back to the StrangeReal world.			"

												Ever since CAPCAM added achievements for its aged games, fans of RE (mainly) have started to replay these games existing only in memories. However clever this decision is, I don't see if CAPCAM has saved this one:ACE AH. In retrospect, when this game first came out, its revolutionary dogfight mode won round applause. It has given new life and excitement to the series sacrificing the long competitive tradition.The singleplayer is just about OK, nothing mentionable at all. Helicopter is fun to play at the start but soon gets boring. The AIs are sometimes dumb few times genius. You could spend half an hour just trying to get behind one of the enemy aircrafts flying parrallel but in different direction to you.I can't say anything about multiplayer, cuz it has been sitting on its death bed for so long. I don't know if anyone at all still plays it, I reckon we all have something better to do.In conclusion, don't buy it.			"

												If you enjoyed this game, go pick up a PS2 and find a copy of Shattered Skies. If you didn't enjoy this game, do the same. It was the first game of this series I ever played, and much better than this one. Dogfighting system was a fluke, as many of the exisiting comments will tell you. Online is dead, story is straight from any generic Tom Clancy game, and it's an extremely short game to completion. It's not terrible, especially since it came as a package deal in a Humble Bundle, and it made me a bit nostalgic, enough to go play the before mentioned Ace Combat 0. Not worth the 20 bucks, gameplay-wise, but you can get a few hours of enjoyment out of it. Until you realize it's the same thing you did only a short while ago, stop playing, and then pick it up again a few weeks later. Like I said, it's not a bad game, it just didn't live up to its predecessors.			"

												Well where do I start with this?I ragequitted...really, I put the controller down and uninstalled it..on a free weekend. That's a first timer for me.Good things first: It has nice visuals and it tries to add varietyBUTI hate railshooterparts, especially when the controls are horrible (Why the efff am I able to use my mouse for aiming in the Gatling gun section, but not in the Bomberpart? - Thats where I ragequitted because of the cwappy controls and cwappy checkpointplacement)The game has a Dogfightfeature which pretty much puts you on rails..I would be okay with it, if I would be not FORCED to use it. It is for me similar to the E.R.S. from HAWX, which was there to help you with certain stuff, but you were free for the most part to ignore it. And whos idea was it to put a bloodyscreen into this game? They should rename this into Call Combat: Modern Horizon. Since I haven't played any other Ace Combat, HAWX is the main competitor for me and what can I say? It's the better game. If you want an arcady jetgame get HAWX. Ace Combat only has the upper hand in grafics and ""variety"" while HAWX offers better controls, gameplay and a similar story.TL:DR: Get HAWX (The first) instead			"

												Ace Combat Assault Horizon. When I first heard someone on my friends list say it was an arcade combat flight game with Fallout's V.A.T.S. system I was slightly intrigued. I even went as far as buying it just because of that description, and believe me when I say I normally can't enjoy these type of games, because they become repetitive too soon. And yes, Ace Combat doesn't manage to spice things up all that much, but it gives you many ways to play the game, more than many other games in this genre. Missions are diverse and the gameplay is fun, with indeed some sort of V.A.T.S. system in place to kill enemies. It's a fabulous way to make games like these more exciting. The action also regularly slows down to give you some eye candy to look at. It all looks great in motion and playing the game with a controller (or joystick, I guess) is the right way to play it. I was really, really impressed by its visuals. Everything looked clean, and sharp and the people looked like real people (in a way). The camera is always close and the parts where you're not flying your aircraft look like you're watching a movie, with the right amount of motion blur and angles.The game doesn't do everything right, of course. There are missions that rely on depth perception. There's one mission in particular where you have to use stealth in order to avoid getting seen by the radars. The reach of these radars is shown in large, moving, green triangles, but they're so close apart that I had to repeat the mission several times because it's so hard to see. All of this would've been unnecessary with the use of more color (darker green or light green, for example) or by setting them further apart. It's one of the few times that I was really frustrated.Concerning the length of the game; this is perfect. It's not too long and not too short, it's just right. You can finish it in 8 or 9 hours so there's plenty of gameplay in it.Ok, time to wrap things up again: Ace Combat Assault Horizon is by far my favorite arcade combat flight game so far. Highly recommended ![Rating: 82/100]			"

In the old games you got the feeling of big operations where the allied AI was more reliable.The enemies magically appear and disappear just to make cool scenes of multiple missiles.The story is meh.The good:The music.Yo tuve la oportunidad de jugar Ace Combat 1, Ace Combat 2 y Ace Combat 3, y siempre los considere y los sigo considerando excelentes juegos. Es por eso que estaba muy emocionado con la oportunidad de revivir esos momentos con Ace Combat Assault Horizon, aunque no puedo decir que me arrepienta de comprarlo, este juego tiene mas defectos que virtudes.Defectos:La camara en el dogfight mode es vomitiva, antes entrar en dogfight requeria de habilidad, ahora no es mas que una especie de QTE.Tu wingman es un inutil, te sientes ejercito de un solo hombre donde las unidades aliadas solo sirven de adorno, antes te sentias parte de operaciones mas grandes donde podias contar con que la IA hiciera su trabajo.Los aviones aparecen, desaparecen o se quedan quietos solo para que las escenas con misiles multiples se vean cool, y la historia es pesima.Todo esto representa varios pasos atras respecto a los demas juegos de la saga.Virtudes:La musica.

												It boggles the mind how an arcade flight simulator, not bound by any expectation of realism, can end up so incredibly dull. ""Dogfighting"" is reduced to simply staying in a turn, and pressing a button whenever you hear the beep. The flight models have had no real care put into them, and without an interesting game mechanic, flying a Phantom or an F-16 ends up being even more tedious than flying a DHL cargo plane, and no amount of explosions or flashy action shots are going to distract you from that.

Maybe DFM can suck sometimes really hard, it is actually usefull but I feel like a noob sometimes because old AC games don't have this feature making it very hard to keep up with enemies making it usefull for new guys like me.

												So far starters I'd like to clarify that I've been playing Ace Combat since Unsung War on PS2, I'm not as experienced as the extreme veterans but I've clocked hundreds of hours into each Ace Combat game that has released since. With that being said, I don't think Assault Horizon strays too far away from its old style with this one. There's this new mechanic called dogfight mode which is a step away from the traditional ""Lead your Target"" tactic for dogfights. Instead of using your skill to out manuever planes, you can use a snap lock on feature that automatically locks you onto the enemey's tail.I'm imagining this is where the game gets its hate. I honeslty don't have a problem wth it because it gives a very interesting cinematic approach to dog fights. In this mode the plane sollows completely behind the enemy while the target tries to escape. This can be a number of things in a number of places depending on where you're fighting and I find that interesting.If you ever feel like you're sick of it, just stick to firing rockets-never fails!  Like I said, a step away from intense dogfights but still a solid flight combat game. Another really interesting feat is that you fly multiple typs of airfract, helicopters, AC-130s, etc. This is a step in a new direction of ""Ace Combat"" glory. Is it enough to stack up to a game that you want to come back to? Well I like it.			"

												The game has become a forefront for some very innovative mechanics as of late. For example, instances in which fighters are known to rapidly change position, direction and velocity are usually attributed to lag. Thanks to Ace Combat: Assault Horizon however, this is now an aspect of core gameplay. Definitely a must buy!			"

												Anyone who has been a fan of Ace Combat or likes fast paced aerial dogfights, this is the exact game for you. The game also features a very nice helicoptor and bombing operations. In short, the game features all of the military aerial combats possible. The game does also have some realistic aspects of aerial combats. This is my first Ace Combat game and I am loving it. I really wish I played all the previous Ace Combat games because this one is just too good.			"

												(I've finished this game before I get the PC version)First off, this is NOT...- An Ace Combat game even it has the name ""Ace Combat""- A combat flight simulationInstead, this is a different game from the whole AC series, this game isn't that bad if you don't treat it as an AC game, it's even a decent game in my opinion.And since I can't write an article properly, So I'll just list all the pros and cons.Pros:- Awesome OST- Story is set in real world- Close Range Assault, makes the combat more intense- You have a decent selection of planes, even at the begining- Rather intense combat- Helicopters and AC-130- Idolmaster skins- Idolmaster skins for the Strike Eagle- Player can perform ugachev's CobraCons:- Story is typical, it's another America(with good Russians) saves the day story- Close Range Assault, especially when the player's plane fly towards the ground with the AIs, damaging the player's plane, DFM also makes the dogfight much easier- Helicopter controls with controller sucks- Control setup and graphic settings won't save unless you fix it manually- Scripted battles, and you won't know when will that happen, The final battle against Akula is the prime example, you can see him being hit by dozens of missiles and still flying, because you have to stick with him long enough till the game allows you to shoot him down- Game is shortOverall, if you can get over the fact this is game is NOT a real Ace Combat game or you wanna play something different from the other AC games, go ahead and buy it.UPDATE:The girl who flies the AC-130 is mai waifu			"

												Yes, it is not a real meticulous combat flight simulator. But, it is dynamic movie-style action game, sometimes you need a splendid fun out of box. This game gives you feel of action. That's it. And.. maybe it is obvious and you already know that, but you should play it with a joystick :)			"

												This game is terrible.If you're a fan of the old Ace Combat games, and don't like Call of Duty, don't play this game--It forces you to go into an 'autopilot' mode called ""DFM Mode"" to kill some enemies. A lot of enemies, especially those marked by TGT_LEAD cannot be killed otherwise, I've tested this extensively by both watching the code with a third-party engine, and using a program to test damage values.Thanks whoever made this terrible game, please stop making games now.

												If you are willing to put aside gripes about not being set in the usual Ace Combat world and the total disregard for realism, this game can be a genuine enjoyment. My biggest gripe with the game is the fact that often, when you are chasing a high-ranking bad-guy, he will become unkillable until he leads you to a certain location, just so a cool killcam can occur. This bothered me because I feel it stifles your freedom as a pilot and negatively effects gameplay, just for the sake of showing off the visuals (which are fantastic btw). The controls take a little getting used to, especially if you've played past Ace Combat titles on the playstation, but should be no problem after a few hours of gameplay. Ace Combat Assault Horizon: Enhanced Edition: Fun, arcade mess with a disregard for realism, fan service, and gameplay.			"

												There is a somewhat decent arcade flying game here, but to get to it you'll have to go through some terrible♥♥♥♥♥♥ like being constantly forced to use the Dog Fight Mode (DFM), having the camera control be taken away from you everytime you score a hit, deal with invulnerable enemies during scripted scenes which just make you waste ammo...The uninspiring Door Gunner, Apache and AC-130 sections also don't help the game, and neither does the terrible Campaign story. The Online community for this game is dead so you can also forget about Multiplayer.It may be tempting to get this since it's the only Ace Combat on PC, but I seriously recommend you don't do it. Try to get an emulator running or even get an old PS2 to play the original games. Just stay away from Assault Horizon.			"

												No matter what the title of the game says, this isn't Ace Combat.Ace combat series was all about having a gallore of nice jets to fly with some with unique secondary weapons, fighting impossible odds always thrown right into the action.This abomination forces you for half of the game to pilot an helicopter with boring gameplay and ridiculous missile evasion maneuvers , oh and a 10-15min long stage where all you do is use the minigun of a helicopter's door.The cutscenes are average at best, but they really break the pace of the game how long they are, and they happen in the middle of teh game too breaking immersion , also they introduced Dog Fight Mode DFM in order to take down ace pilots, but really is the only way you have of playing this game at all, you end up using 99% of the time becoming really boring.None of the pilots will ever shut up trying to create some sense of character's personalities but really they all as bland as a pudding.

												Ace Combat: Assault Horizon is best described as a mixed experience. Where the gameplay, sound and presentation excel, the story greatly disappoints, rarely doing the title justice. AC is a risky gamble by developers. In marrying the niche genre of flight action represented by its past titles with the pick-up-and-play modern-warfare genres enjoyed by masses of casual and regular gamers. AC boasts a completely revamped destruction engine, full-spectrum missions that expand into helicopter and support-plane varieties, as well as a brand-new 'Dog-Fight Mode' flight mechanic intended to bring jet-on-jet action right into the face of the player. This it does very well. Transitioning between the standard flight controls into the shooter-inspired DFM is smooth and crisp, and letting the game take partial control over your jet while you focus on keeping the enemy plane within your sights and unloading lead and missiles upon him is incredibly entertaining as you see his plane fragment bit by bit, oil streaks splattering over your screen as he finally explodes, debris burning past you. Even more satisfying is chaining multiple DFMs together then turning the tables on a pursuer with a well-timed stunt maneuver that puts you behind him, and right on track to blow him to smithereens. But once you engage in DFM you dont need any skill at all to chase your opponent. It's all auto. You don't need to care about natural obstacles and such because the AI simply removes it from equation. When an enemy engages it on you, it takes luck rather than skill to shake it off you. Without DFM engaged it's almost impossible to destroy enemy planes at medium and long ranges, so no need to carry missiles for that purpose. Bosses and main targets can only be destroyed in DFM.Helicopter missions offer a more down-to-earth approach, as you weave between buildings and get closer than ever to the ground in missions that have you taking out tanks, infantry positions and even other choppers. There are also bomber runs with incredibly satisfying explosion shots and even a heavy bomber mission that plays rather similarly to that famous sequence in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, offering the same entertainment value, with a tad bit more action as you can now be shot down by enemy missiles.Joypad controls are easy to pick up and the camera offers a nice 'over-the-shoulder' view of the action.Technically, AC is not the best-looking game, but it doesn't look too bad either. Plane textures and models, in both third- and first-person cockpit views, look great. The ground looks decent from most altitudes, with buildings and structures modeled with sufficient detail to remain presentable.Plus AC is easily one of the best-sounding games. Explosions rumble your bass speakers as bombs make their impact, and the sound of lead shredding through metal as the your Vulcan cannon buzzes away is one I cannot get enough of.			"

												I'm going to let you in on a little secret. I love flying games. I love them to bits. I relish the speed, the adrenaline, the viceral sense of the bits of metal that rocket past you at mach 2 as you riddle another plane with bullets. Ace Combat Assault Horizon offers all of that and that is why I like it. Ace Combat has a long history that I have never experienced; so you will not get any comparisons with its predecessors from me. Instead I will tell you exactly why this game is awesome and why you'd do yourself a disservice when not playing it. Let's start with the obvious; the mental presentation. Stuff is literally thrown at you. You are experiencing a barrage of unyielding terror and excitement all at once. The game runs overtime to get you the best angle on the action. The camera will cut back from the action to show you the minute details of your enemy's plane as it disintegrates when you unleash a flurry of bullets and missles at at. If it wasn't enough, the game might just give you a front row seat and follow the missle as travels toward its mark. Not exciting enough you say? Lets talk about dogfighting; the bread and butter of any aerial combat game. Initiation a dogfight in this game requires you to close the distance. A quick button press initiates the special pursuit mode that hooks your plane to your target and the pulse pounding chase begins. Your plane broadly follows the target, but the goal is to keep the crosshair in the center at a insane speeds to make your lock-on kick in faster to shove your deadly missles up his rear end faster. Your mark can escape though. By swaying and dodging, or by hitting the brakes hard and leveling the craft at the right moment you might find yourself being chased. Even then, if you can react fast enough you can instercept his manouver and rivet his plan as he flips in front of you. Everything is carefully accentuated with flares, scratches, explosions and other effect that really make the game's catch prase seem like the real deal: ""Make metal bleed"" The story mode is a wee bit short. And by a wee bit I mean seriously short. One day is all you need. You do get some variation in missions and vehicles. Such as flying an Apache Helicoper, B2-Spirit Bomber or a DC-130 gunship, but the real kick comes from flying the many jet fighters. From the F-14 all the way to the latests supersonic machines. Multiplayer allows you to test your skill against other pilots, or cooperate in thwarting the CPU from bombing major cities. The only real problem is the general lack of players. So if anything, this review should have convinced you to shell some cash and come fly with me, cause I can use a few wingmen.			"

Plane handling is similar to HAWX, but it is still a little better. Mission storyline once again has to do with extremists and Russian rebels taking control of the Russian government and mission 4, the AC-130 mission, now almost seems standard in this type of game. Also, the AH-64D Apache missions, to be frank, suck. But overall, a pretty nice game. "

The story is too bland and steriotypical U.S. Vs ""Terrorism"" or World VS Terrorism. I love the Alternate Universe more than Real World, Alternate Universe (Like in Ace Combat 5) you have major nations like Yuktobania and Osea, Belka, ect. But like I typed, an Ace Combat Game is an Ace Combat game, as long as there's jets, stories, and pretty pilots *glares at Nagase* then there's nothing to be angry about.

It looks amazing, it sounds great, the story is...enough to keep you interested.

I wish there was a free flight in every map like there was in Shattered Skies, instead of being forced to play a mission.  The multiplayer mode sucks.

												In full disclosure I will admit that the only other Ace Combat game I have played is AC04:Shattered Skies, AC04 is one of my favorite games with an excellent combination of good story telling and solid controls, as such I am going to be using it as my reference point and I expect the majority of the other titles in the series to follow in AC04's vein. I will also admit that I have not played much of ACAH due to its multitude of problems, which include the issue of controls and the radical shift in game play compared to AC04.	The controls are awkward to players use to the traditional combination of mouse and keyboard flight simulators, they involve a combination of the arrow keys for the place of a joystick and place the yaw and acceleration on to the wasd. This setup does not give the precision that a mouse and keyboard or a controller gives, it just feels really clunky. Though the control settings claim to support mouse and keyboard, that is only during the helicopter and rail gun segments, the mouse is not supported when piloting fixed wing aircraft. This is a serious problem when you consider the fact that the game focuses on close range arcade style dogfighting, something that inherently requires precision, and leads to frustration at overturning your opponent almost constantly.	 The gameplay itself is solid, if this had not been an ace combat game I may even call it good, it involves closing behind the opponents aircraft, pushing a button, and entering a “dogfight mode” where the camera is zoomed in and your reticule is expanded. In the dogfight mode the opponent is locked to your speed and can only turn, the goal is to use your cannon or a well timed missile to knock out your opponent. But my real issue is the fact that the gameplay is just so different from AC04 that it feels like a completely different series, it feels more arcady and badly put together. The controls don't help the game in anyway, so you really should buy a controller or a supported joystick (of which there are few) before purchasing the game. TL;DR: Controls are clunky and require a controller or joystick to use, the gameplay is so radically different that it might as well be a game from another series. A good game, but not a good Ace Combat.			"

												Ace combat moves onto the next generation gaming, shame that its trying to copy the call of duty franchaise.  The originals are what we want, but in this version you get allies that more or less there to fill space so theres a reason to hear radio chatter but otherwise you are out there on your own.You are the ace of the fighter squadron but in this case you are constantly tring to out run missile after missile lock ons so much so at many points in the game you will find that you are chased by more then 5 or so fighters.  Each fighter is just queuing to shoot you down and when you lose one, the next will take its place while the one you lost will find itself at the back of the queue.Not only that but you get the new and exciting chase camera where granted it is very exciting as it is mostly auto pilot flying and you are just focusing on aiming and shooting the target down.  On occation you will shoot your target down and find that the auto pilot lets go plummeting you towards the ground without any chance of recovery or slams you into a building as the moment you take out the enemy fighter, it was trying to evade you between buildings.On top of this they will pull off impossible flips and end up behind you just as you fire missiles point blank after filling your aiming recticle to max in a increased chance of hit rate.  This game is very exciting in the flight and fight action, shame that all the bits don't work out and no wonder this game is full of check points.Tried multiplayer with a friend, in the end we believe that the game sadly does not scale for the actual number of players but is set to max whatever that is.  We were constantly tailed by 5 fighters each all throughout the mission, ran out of missiles even if 70% of them all hit and ran out of time for the mission even though we were killing them decently if slowly.Simple terms this game is very exciting if you like cheating npcs that constantly gang up on you and you only get 10 seconds to shoot someone in the calmer moments before being chased again. And again this isn't the ace combat games that we know of and the rumours that this is a bad game is sadly true.			"

												One of few ariel combat games that don't belong to hardcore similatots. You dont need a 50 page tutorial to play.+ Good planes+ Helicopters+ Good graphics- More console oriented gameplay/controls - Scripted gamepley.A PC version should be more flexible on controls. "

												If you're ok with GFWL being a total idiot thinking it's still exisitng, this is a good game to pick up on the days you want to be in a  plane going really fast and shooiting down things in dogfights.  Multiplayer is nonexistant due to thew above statement.			"

												/this game in a nutshell: press x to make a ""OMG WATCH THIS"" maneuvre, play minigame ""keep an object within a circle"", woah, ka-blam, burning fighter hull flying towards you/I hate writing negative reviews, and usually just forget about the game it didn't like, but this time it was a real disappointment(or, as they like to say in the net, a nuke-grade b**thurt)Maybe I should have read reviews of other people before purchasing it, but you know, summer sale makes people blind. I've seen that the ""red line of hate"" under this game description is menacingly long, but I assumed that be the result of ""virtual pilots'"" attack(you know, those guys who think it's wise to compare simarcade with microsoft flight simulators).. Wish I knew how wrong I was...You have totally NO CONTROL over your aircraft. Damn, you can't do even the most basic barrel roll here by yourself! Roll rate is limited to 90* - you can't position your plane upside down(if you don't make a vertical turn, of course, but in that case, lol, you can't position your plane normally).  And dogfight mode.... Well, AI complete takes away control  from you, while you play stone age-old arcade ""keep an object within a circle"", with high chances to hit the buildings/ground due to autopilot's ultimate stupidity.The closest rival of this game was the HAWX(i played the first part, which was older than AC-EE). People blamed it for being too simple. Damn, there the dogfight mode counterpart had some challenge, as VR drew you optimal path to target which was often challenging to follow, there bots couldn't evade a radar guided missile with help of (wtf?!) IR flares, enemy fighters were approaching from OUTSIDE the map(while here they just randomly spawn on the battlefield, sometimes even right behind your tail), you could command you wingmen and(oh-miracle!) they would actually SHOOT DOWN something or clear your 6, flying over even a single SAM battery POSED some danger and well, stalling a plane meant ""omg, I'm gonna crash, level out the plane"" and not just falling down vertically... And UBISOFT considered it a failure! And what's more, they refunded the players' purchses!I heard many good things about ACE COMBAT series, but... well, at least this game didn't fulfill even 20% of my expectations. I wanted to play some fun arcade sim for lazy aviation enthisiasts, and what I got was an aerial call of duty.(yeah, if you played CoD you will constantly having deja vu feeling... Ultranationalist takeover in russia, chopper gunner shooting everything that moves gets blown up with a nuke, ""AC-130, don't shoot the church.. oh, sorry, ancient ruins!"")Congrats if you read this far			"

												I personally hate this game, though I loved the series.  The helicopter missions, the dog fighting mode, and the story all contributed to my dislike.  I loved the previous games, I've been playing Ace Combat games since I was a kid and love them.  I think they should return to their roots.  HAWX 1 is probably the best arcade flight combat game on steam right now.  If you want something more realistic DCS World is an amazing combat simulator.			"

												Have you ever played any Ace Combat series game before ? No ? But I do and all of them was awesome. I've waited soooo long for Ace Combat release on to PC platform. And finally , there it is ! There is no words to discribe this game it's absolutely awesome, remarkable. Delevopers had added a heli control so now there is more fun. This game is non stopping action ! I recommend for everyone, masterpiece created by NAMCO company (^.^)- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  After completing this game second time, I should mention about something. Well, my feelings are still same as before, but... in fact gamepad control is somehow 'hard and tough' , I think that because I got comparsion to Ace Combat series from PS1 , PS2 and PS3 and at consoles using gamepad was simply better. It was kinda smooth control of plane, while at pc it sometimes 'lint' . Another thing to discuss is all ot those cutscenes when you're chasing enemies... well it's fine and looks awesome but unfortunately you cant take down enemy planes if you won't use 'intercept mode' . At 'standard' mode they are simply indrestuctible.... and that's awful ;/ Anyway despite those defects game is still great. I'll give it [ 8.5/10 ]			"

												One of the best Ace Combats by far. The new system makes dogfighting incredibly interesting compared to the old more sluggish and underwhelming system that relied too much on the story and less in the gameplay. I'd say the story was good, but the older ace combats, specially 4 and 5 had a better story.			"

												This is not a horrible game by any stretch of the imagination; however, i can see why people may not like it. For one thing, the keyboard controls are garbage and I would recommend that this game only is played with a controller, although, I do know some people who managed to play with a joystick both successfully and unsuccessfully. Anyway, this is not to be thought of as an ace combat game, instead, you should think of this as an extremely fun and relaxing arcade flight sim and not a full on combat flight sim. If you do this then the game is a blast to play, the planes are really nice to look at and the explosions are awesome. For the PC you get all of the DLC planes and skins which are always a plus. Overall I would rate this game a 7/10 (not a bad arcade flight sim). I got mine practically for free ($1.00) through humble bundle, but I can definitely see this game going for anywhere under $5 and it would be a great pickup.			"

												5.5/10A spinoff for Ace Combat series, the second one that set in real world.Gameplay-wise, it's a far cry from the previous Ace Combat games, with its dogfight mechanic, also you can play as a door gunner as well as a helicopter pilot. Which is, quite frankly, doesn't feel like an Ace Combat game at all. Though the mechanics is quite engaging, it becomes stale and overused. Also the game is heavily-laden by scripted events, the TGT_LEAD aircrafts for example, must be engaged in a dogfight mode to take down, including the boss fight.Story-wise, it's not the game's strong point, written by Jim DeFelice, a very obvious patriotic American writer who loves to portray USA in the better light and Russia in a bad way, it's shallow, predictable, and features overused tropes and devices commonly found in a biased story. Overall, as a spinoff, this game does well, it felt entirely like a whole another game. The Ace Combat is only in its title. For hardened Ace Combat players though, better steer clear from this game.			"

												Well, first off I'd just like to say now, I WAS an ace combat fan prior to this game.I played this game previously when I was a console junkie, on the Xbox 360 after loving Ace Combat 4 for many years on my playstation 2, Back then, i was expecting it to be just the same old lovable gameplay mechanics, just updated graphics and a new storyline based in a fictuous world.I was wrong, on all fronts.They brought in dogfight mode, or as I liked to call it, dogshit mode, which held your hand through something that wasn't particularly hard to do in the first place in this franchise, which is dogfight. Now I remember Ace Combat 4 being unremarkable in the sense that there were very few moments where I'd actually have to break contact and fight off an enemy attacking from behind. But dogfight mode goes over the top with it, it happens too much, and suddenly in order to maneuver and engage a radar target behind me, I have to press a button rather than have the ability to, do it myself.not only that but the sudden need to change the camera mode in third person, i don't particularly like 3rd person anyway, but suddenly I need to zoom in on my guns when I fire them, and the same with my bombs, too. okay, namco, keep taking those tablets.  I could no longer pitch and roll like in previous games, no, instead my turning was forced at a certain angle and my speed affected how much I turned, not exactly a wrong thing, speed does affect your turning, but it just felt wrong...not to mention, suddenly your aircraft are like the T-1000 from terminator 2, they have regenerating health... HA! how laughable. Next, the storyline was America vs Russia, oh dear, not only have they removed the fictional worlds I was used to in Ace Combat, but they've also jumped on this bandwagon? seriously?!I won't say too much because, spoilers, but it feels like the aircraft version of call of duty in terms of the story, in fact most of the time it feels like story elements have just been ripped right out of Modern Warfare and applied in the most generic way possible to this game. The characters were very obvious and quite frankly unprofessional at most times, there was the overly masculine edgy black dude, the pretty blonde girl who looks like the woman from Ridge Racer Type 4, who is so obviously into the colonel, who is this really edgy legendary fighter ace (apparently) who likes to say ""♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; and ""damn"" alot, then tell people to cut the chatter when he's the one talking. Then theres Guts, the overly enthusiastic dude who wants to impress his squadron leader. then of course there's the stereotypical vodka drinking russian dude who speaks with a russian accent, and you SO can't tell that he's a bad guy or something, because this game SO isn't obvious(!)so the storyline annoyed me a little but I gave it a chance at the time, trying to find something to love in this game, along with that, your player character is no longer an enigmatic pilot who you only know the callsign of, and also that he/she only flies jets (the addition of helicopters made me want to cry)so it's 2014, I feel like trying it again, following my departure from my Xbox and the entry of my PC.by this point I wasn't really an ace combat ""fan"" anymore I got around to playing 6, and then I started using my PC more, realised that there was more fun to be had so I let ace combat gather dust....I played this on the free weekend after i saw it advertised and old frustrations brewed up, the same criticisms above applied, only worse because of how badly this game was ported.   While I can say, for a 2013, game the graphics are quite good, but the options are horrific, you get to choose whether anti aliasing is on or off, and that's really about it. not only that, but the menu isn't even mouse friendly, no, you have to use your keyboard/controller.speaking of controllers, good luck finding a controller configuration that actually makes any ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sense! remapping the controller is a nightmare, and unless you know what button is what, you're going to find the first level a frustrating guessing game. I spent a good 20 minutes on the first level figuring out whats what. oh and that tutorial level, isn't much fun anyway, its a hand holding bunch of nonsense in which you MUST do what the game tells you or you can't get off that screen or the other guy won't die. in other words, this ""enhanced edition"" is a sloppy console port with upgraded textures... oooh wow.Namco, if you read this... I'd play Ace Combat again if the next one had an option to turn DFM off, and just have classic ace combat controls, and gameplay on a carefully ported game. I'd gladly pay £40 for the next game if it were like that.there's a point where a game can be innovated too much, and people reject it, and this is a classic example. I wouldn't recommend it, purely for the fact it's a sloppily made game with too much hand holding going on.			"

												I think I cannot recommend this game if you are looking for a flight simulator. This game feels like a Michael Bay movie, much eye candy but little substance: graphics are OK, explosions and damage details on the aircraft are amazing, but the over-emphasis over cinematographicness has stripped almost every bit of ""sim"" aspect out of the game. In fact my biggest grievance is over DFM (DogFight Mode) which pretty much turns any close combat into a shooter on rails where you just have to wait for your missiles to have a lock on your target.With this I am not saying that the game isn't any good, but treat it as an action game rather than a simulator, however simplified it could ever be.My vote: 5.5/10			"

												While the gameplay is a lot of fun, the story is as typical as it can get. Some rebel group in the Middle East/Africa is supported by a Russian mercenary group that somehow manages to spark a Russian civil war, now how many times have you heard that ? It's bad enough Namco would think that moving from our beloved Strangereal to real world is a good idea and now they can't come up with a better plot ? Come on guys ! Aside from that i enjoy it. All the mission is a lot of fun and DFM and ASM, although making the game looks like and on-rail shooter is fun enough. The helicopters and bomber mission is a good improvement and it doesn't make the game repetitive which is a good thing. Multiplayer is...well...chaotic, but still fun. Another thing i like is that they included homage to the previous Ace Combat, although the console version gets it as DLCs.Overrall 7/10 it's a good game, but not a good Ace Combat game.ps.sorry for my english, it's not my native language.

												Stopped playing during the tutorial level for two reasons:1. In a high paced fast air combat game, is it REALLY a good idea to have a tutorial that freezes the game to display a message? I failed the first mission a number of times due to this.2. Dogfight Mode - What the hell is this? A gross over-simplfication of flight mechanics to create a ""YEAH EXPLOSIONS WOO"" montage. I'm sorry, that's not why I play games, least of all flight sims, I don't want my hand held and the mechanics dumbed down to the point of infantile.Also, Quick Time Events are a cancer that turns interactive video games into (in the words of Mr Yahtzee) ""PRESS X TO NOT DIE"" movies. Quick Time Events make up the bulk of maneuvers and avoidance techinques and having important aspects of a flight action game reduced to such simplistic levels is frankly painful.Now, don't get me wrong, I'm no flight sim anorak, but the bit of game I experienced made me feel like I was largely watching a vaguely interactive movie. The flight mechanics themselves seemed fairly alright, but are heavily bogged down by unnecessary gameplay mechanics to oversimplify dogfighting to the point of being banal. Enemy on your tail? complete the pseudo QTE and automagically maneuver behind the enemy, rather than you know, actually using skill to outmaneuver.Other reviewers compare this to COD in the sky, maybe that's true, but at least COD doesn't make you enter a CQC mode to shoot someone in the face at point blank range. Imagine how frustrating that would be?			"

												A fun, fast paced aerial combat game that has a bit of history behind the series. I played  the original Ace Combat game, Air Combat which was developed for the Playstation 1 back in 1995. It has been interesting seeing the additions added over the years, not just an improvement of graphics but also gameplay features, an expanding storyline and interesting fictional aircraft. This current Ace Combat has deviated slightly from most of the others by being set in the real world with a different fictional backdrop as well as removing most of the fictional technology seen in the earlier games but is still a great addition to the series. On the whole i think this game is worth playing, there are many highly detailed aircraft to choose from and not just the fighters this time round, bombers and helicopter gunships are available to choose from too adding to the diversity of the game.----------------------------------------------------------------------Decided to play this again tonight after months and months of inactivity on it, and just wow.I've been playing a few other games alot recently, Elite Dangerous, Vector Thrust, as well as a bit of Gmod with friends, along with a few others, but nothing for me plays quite so intense and fast paced as this game.The downside is, the rarity of other players and the inablity to start a match with just AIs.If only more gamers were also aircraft enthusiasts then this wouldn't be a problem. We might also have more Ace Combat games on PC too if this were the case, as a larger player population would result in more income for the company from people buying them.Im going to try logging in from time to time a bit more to see if anyone else does, will be prioritising Capital Conquest.A warning and a tip to other players, I dogfight classic style so don't expect any alert from dfm activating, only the RWR going off from missile locks if im in the match. Just be glad the guns are almost useless without DFM or I'd most likely manage a quicker fight in a tight turn, though I can still use the Railgun on the CFA-44 for close in encounters. :DI find it more fun this way as theres no computer assist involved and as a long time fan of the series. In fact probably the first game I ever played was Air Combat on the PS1 many years ago.PS wish there was an ingame mic mute option as i can't use skype if i play this game or other players get half of a conversation spamming down their headset :(Also if you have rudder pedals with toe brakes, they go mad in the menu and constantly make it scroll with no way to disable it.

The storyline is forgetable the door gunner sequences are boring but survivable ... Personally i like the helicopter missions ... specially when S hits the F in Moscow... that was one helluva intesne fight... for Planes... Its Ace Combat + a few good things and - a few things from the original.Here what i like as new stuff for Jet gameplay: DFM (when not scripted) when you enter it against a normal AI it just kicks♥♥♥♥♥to see the enemy plane from close up and your guns fire rockets fly out and when the enemy goes down... that mini sceen of their plane falling apart never gets old. Here is what i dont like that much ... Health Regeneration (dont event start me on this one .. its just ... just remove it from games PLS) DFM when scripted, I understand the idea of having a crane fall next to my plane or a building collapse by me while i chase an opponent but at one of the boss fights a scene like this played along and the enemy planes movement + mine was just irritatingly impossible... being thrown from ""wall"" to ""wall"" while trying to get back control over my plane that the Scripted scene took away was just a downer... the idea of DFM is good but dont script it next time.also a Con is the lack of settings just like with Dark Souls... you barely can change stuff around to achieve any nice and smooth gameplay (it runs nice in SP but in MP i get some lag)overall the game is good and has the Ace Combat feeling to it when flying jets the Music is outstandingly good, the Scripted DRM can cause a headache but all other aspects are fine (mostly) wonder if any other ACE Combat will come to PC i would weclome them with an open hand (Wallet)			"

												A really cool modern combat flight simulator. It's one of, if not the, most accessible flight sim games I've ever played. Many flight sims are far too heavy, but this game gets it all right in my opinion. You get to control all kinds of fighter planes, helicopters and bombers in combat scenarios. There's also an AC 130 which can be controlled very similiar to how it's done in Call of Duty. The graphics are really detailed but always so smooth. Can't fault the game, it's excellent. I'm astonished at some of the terrible reviews it's got. It's a must play if you want a really accessible and fun combat flying game.			"

												While the gameplay is a lot of fun, the story is as typical as it can get. Some rebel group in the Middle East/Africa is supported by a Russian mercenary group that somehow manages to spark a Russian civil war, now how many times have you heard that ? It's bad enough Namco would think that moving from our beloved Strangereal to real world is a good idea and now they can't come up with a better plot ? Come on guys ! Aside from that i enjoy it. All the mission is a lot of fun and DFM and ASM, although making the game looks like and on-rail shooter is fun enough. The helicopters and bomber mission is a good improvement and it doesn't make the game repetitive which is a good thing. Multiplayer is...well...chaotic, but still fun. Another thing i like is that they included homage to the previous Ace Combat, although the console version gets it as DLCs.Overrall 7/10 it's a good game, but not a good Ace Combat game.ps.sorry for my english, it's not my native language.

												Do not buy this. ace combat 4, 5 and 0 were great.... this is not. more than half the game feels like its on rails... because it is. even in dog fights, half the enemies you come across cannot be shot down. you may score a hit but they are invulnerable. you have to enter ""DFM"" (rail mode) to be able to shoot them down. even in DFM they will avoid your missiles over and over until you are in the right section of the choreographed roller-coaster, then, then you may shoot them down.controls are awful. there are sections when you walk around the airbase (on rails). you can control your characters head... but why? there is nothing to look at except badly animated characters and poor texturing.selecting your aircraft? you had better just remember what they look like because the aircraft  menu makes you load to another screen just to check the paint scheme. BUT WHY? the hangar menu from the previous games was great.and if these things werent bad enough! it requires GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE.why did you make this namco? i want my money back.			"

												This game really divides opinion. It definitely makes a case for a non ""sim"" flight game.If you played HAWX, there will be familiar elements in this game, but even HAWX didn't push it this far.. The atmosphere is great, the visuals are good, the dogfighting is jarring, but does a good job predicting what you mean to do (although it looks sloppy at time.).Do I feel cool playing through as a combat pilot? 60% of the time I guess. However, I would say that the single player campaigns in scripted combat games like Call of Duty deliver a similar cool effect for a higher percentage of your gameplaying time.In many ways this is a great experiment and game worth playing. Currently it is in the ""cheap"" tier in a Humble bundle too.			"

												Oh man, oh man, oh man! I love me some flashy japanese arcade jetfighter action!I got into Ace Combat with AC4 back on the PlayStation and have played every single game since, enjoying each and every one. Assault Horizon is no different, although it is a fairly heavy departure from the series origins. Gone are the Estovakian warplanes and other fictional nations, replaced with the real world, NATO, Russia and terrorists, but with that lovely over-the-top Ace Combat flavor added on top.First things first: I REALLY love the sound design. The music (especially the dogfight music from the intro level, which evokes old musical ques from the past games) is mind-shatteringly GOOD, the explosions and screeches and sputtering of dying aircraft, the BRRRRRT of cannonfire and whooshing of missiles, all accented by the lovely cacophony of both friendly and enemy radio traffic, with calls of ""Fox two"", ""Break, break!"" and ""I'm hit!"" all mixing together. Just writing about it gives me the chills!The game itself is mostly the standard Ace Combat -affair, with you flying a fighter jet, shooting down utterly unrealistic numbers of enemy planes with missiles that simply don't seem to ever run out. The realistic look of the game at first glance is a lie: Assault Horizon is arcade madness with ""flight simulation"" naught but a fanciful idea to the dev team. In addition to the usual flying, you are required to challenge enemy aces into dogfights, frantic challenges where you struggle to match speed and keep the enemy in your sights long enough for your infrared -tracking missiles to achieve a lock (again, completely unrealistic, but who cares at this point? LOOK AT THE EXPLOSIONS!). The somewhat baffling storyline has you also flying bombers, AC-130 -gunships and helicopters, so there is a surprising amount of variety on offer for an Ace Combat -game. The game isn't too easy, either, with some missions demanding some pretty damn quick flying in order to reach all your targets in time, let alone to catch and down some of the late-game enemy aces.All in all: I freakin' love this game! As a matter of fact, I think I'll go and listen to the soundtrack right now. Cheers!Playtime: 5+ hours (Single playthrough, had played game console version before, which cut down playtime considerably)Ratings (1-10)Visual: 9Audio: 9Story: 7Gameplay: 10Overall: 9			"

												Ace Combat Assault Horizon (ACAH)I really dig flight simulators, especially flight simulators of military aircraft.  I'm a fan of Microsoft Flight Simulator and am also a fan of the techno thriller genre from Ace Combat series or the great Tom Clancy HAWX games.  Yes, I get that Ace Combat (or even HAWX) is scarecly a ""flight simulator"", but I also frame these flying games in the realm of flying exotic (and highly classified) aircraft on a console or PC.  The Good:  Flying military aircraft on highly classified if not outright impossible missions.  The developers here did an outstanding job of replicating the aircraft inside and out!  You even fly an Apache and as a gunner on the side of a Blackhawk.  Graphics during the cutscenes are awesome!  Even shooting down some of the enemy aircraft are eyecatching events with the oil splattering and aircraft breaking apart.The Bad:  Why the developers strayed from a winning formula is beyond me.  It would seem that they tried to combine a flying game with a fighting game (think Afterburner meets Mortal Kombat).  There's only one way to destroy certain enemies and that's to engage them up close and fly low to the ground with the cinematography of a Braveheart or Gladiator swordfighting scene.  To escape some of the missiles, you need to pay attention to two arrows lining up.  Basically, they tried to hard to make this game stand out.  Controlling the Apache or the Blackhawk gunner was clumsy.   The Ugly:  Interesting story...from what I know of it.  The game play is awful!  So awful, that I couldn't trudge through it and get immersed in the game.  It pains me to say this as I love these types of games, and wanted to love this game so much as I've loved the other Ace Combat games.   The voice acting (or the script) needed work but it wasn't terrible.  Like other flying games, even the good ones, your missions require you to fly against a numerically superior air force.  Thankfully, your aircraft carries a numerically superior amount of missiles.  IMHO, this ""numerically superior aircraft vs you and your missiles"" theme leads to repetitive and quickly boring gameplay.  It didn't help that some of the missions dragged on adding little if any value to the overall story!    It breaks my heart to do this, but no....I cannot recommend ACAH.  If you get it for free, then maybe.  But no, I can't recommend this game especially since it doesn't even approach the standards of Ace Combat Fires of Liberation.			"

												DO NOT BUY if you're a fan ""Ace Combat"" games.This is not an ""Ace Combat"" game.I'd give this game a 3/10 solely for visuals, the full ability to rebind keys, and the fact it recognizes a gamepad plugged in and you can set and use any input devices it recognizes on the fly if you feel the need to switch between a gamepad to the keyboard and mouse or whatever. I found everything else poor.In my opinion this game is the Silent Hill 4, or Final Fantasy 13 of the series. The point where successfull great games and IP's become multi-million dollar + countless man-hour spent on making something that betray long time fans and are bad games on their own. I often wonder if such horrible games are the developers answer to the few people who griped about how bad certain aspects of previous good games were.Here are the reasons why I think this is a bad game:The controls for this game are absolutely horrible. I thought the $35 price point dropped instead of $50 would be worth the inclusion of random helicopters and stuff, but no. I looked at a review on IGN and I'm a fan of Ace Combat games so I thought ""Hey why not give it a chance, they switched a little gameplay between the other ones I have, and they turned out really well!"".I was wrong. You're fighting the controls in this game every single second. In 4, 5, and Zero the games had VERY GOOD controls that actually did what you wanted and nothing else and flowed really well. After beating those on normal difficulty setting and got skilled I beat them on Ace mode.In this game there's twitchy controls that roll too much, and do nothing when I need to, often at the same time in logic paradox ways. Your personal skill or strategy has very little do with success in missions.Instead of being an arcade-y aircraft game like all the previous ones, it's an On Rails Shooter and the controls similar to previous AC games are just to get you on the rails and used to fool you into buying the game. It's more like a series of quicktime events than anything else.Dogfight Mode has caused me to crash into the ground more times than all the previous titles combined! It will shove you out of DFM randomly sometimes and since many planes go down near the ground when you enter DFM this often leads to heavy damage or death. In the one or two missions with bad weather it's very confusing, as if flying in a storm wasn't disorienting enough. When in Dogfight Mode the camera has a tendency to shake violently the whole time which is hard to look at, and a serious health hazard to anyone who has even the slightest epilepsy or proneness to limb twitching/ convulsions. I'm also glad I don't get sea/car sick because I'm sure I'd have vomited many times by now.Missiles only 1/100 actually hit what you fire at, except in Dogfight Mode, not even the QAAM's which in previous titles were sure hits you saved for enemy aces, nor the SAAM's while having a lock on them the whole time.This is especially bad in the missions to kill enemy bombers which should be easy targets but you still have to enter Dogfight Mode and hit them with half a dozen missiles, even though your allies SAY they'll take out fighter escorts they don't actually do anything helpfull.Enemies are often invincible and not even targetable until you're told to attack them, even though they are already firing at you and your allies, some of them mission critical allies. Even after you are told you can attack them, ground/sea targets are often still invincible unless you enter the bombing run version of Dogfight Mode.One bomber aircraft mission is nothing but that, and it interupts you with ""tutorial tips"" that take control away from you in the middle of a bombing run making you unable to hit the targets causing you to fail the mission over and over.In the ""gunner"" missions where you man the heli gatlin or that huge planes cannons you are fighting the controls to aim at what you're supposed to be hitting because the targets are outside the edge of where you can shoot most of the time.Dodging missiles is difficult because there's hardly a second in the game that you aren't hearing MISSLE MISSILE MISSILE MISSILE (repeat constantly for hours). Flares appear to do nothing whatsoever, not that you can tell when you NEED to use them because of the previous thing, and have a ridiculous reload time. The only mission I noticed Flares actually save me is the above paragraphs bombing mission where you choose between the 117 or the B2 bomber both of which can spam flares and have dozens of flares.The bigger map radar you can switch to shows an area MUCH larger than the actual mission area, and enemies and allies are a worthless blob of colored dots mushed together in a small portion of it.Once an enemy is on your tail in their Dogfight Mode there's no way to shake them except by spamming the DFM button. It tells you to slow down and when there's two icons overlapped to level out... Gee! Okay! I'll just level out and allow the enemy to lock on while my allies are worthless and do nothing while I take several more missiles and die repeatedly! There's a hard to explain thing where you slow down and speed up to get the icons to overlap so you can press the DFM button.TOO MANY of the respawn checkpoints in air-to-air missions start out with a head on squadron of enemies already locked onto you. It's difficult not to get hit right from the start.There's also no mission briefings. The previous games had great mission briefing scenes and screens. You get no information past a little place with two words above where you select your aircraft on whether it will be air-air, air-ground, or whatever. And even that is no real indication of what you might be facing or are expected to do. The couple cutscenes that look like mission briefings give no real information, they just take several minutes to say ""hey these are the bad guys, and look at the bomb we're looking for"" all of which you already knew, the end, pick a plane.The ""story"" for this game is weak and sparse, and in most of the cutscenes there's button presses and looking around for no good reason relevant to story or gameplay. No outcome of the story or cutscene changes based on where you look or if you press a button or not. It's their way of saying ""we know alot of you have ADD so press this button, monkeys"".I might actually like this game if they called it ""Desert Strike: Subtitle"" (remember that game series for the Genesis which included Jungle Strike and Urban Strike?) and only had helicopter missions with the controls from this game. If they improved the camera angles - specifically the lag in cockpit view between looking in a direction and actually turning that way and a further up and back outside the heli view. And if they improved the weapons - you can't see individual targets until you're right on top of them and can't do anything intelligent like firing from maximum range - the 4AGM refuses to have a set target lock so you often waste missiles while strafing unless you sit still taking fire while trying to fire them at specific targets. Minus the annoying physics defying barrel rolls.That's it. End of my review of the problems with this game.Edit: I'm adding that I played this on the medium difficulty ""Pilot"" and turned the controls to ""Original"" AC mode and did not use Flight Assist which I'm not sure what that even does as I never noticed any difference in how the planes handled. I was using a gamepad to play the entire game. I did play this game all the way through because I liked the previous games so much I thought I'd see it through just in case it ever got good. It didn't.			"

Honestly, this is just a huge disappointment.  I'd compare it to HAWX, but HAWX is magnitudes better in every way, and I don't even like HAWX all that much (although, it is a fun diversion every now and then).  I can honestly say I don't think I'll even launch Ace Combat Assault Horizon again, and I've only played through four missions.  It's that repetitive and, well, unfun.  Let's hope we see a lot less of that in the future.			"

												Ever wanted to play something like Top Gun on steroids? Then this is the game for you!You get your cheesy bromance and cheesy saving the world once again from ""evil"" Russians stories in this game. It's done very good and immerses you into the chaos and action that takes places on sea, land and sky. It has one of the best videogame soundtracks and hearing the epic guitar riffs mixed with choir and orchestra in the background as you gun down your enemies really make you feel like a true badass.Now, coming from a gamer who's played Ace Combat games before (Belkan War ftw <3), this game is pretty dumbed down and more simplified compared to the previous titles. This is both good and bad because this game was made to appeal to a much more wider audience this time, leaving hardcore AC fans to scratch their heads in confusion.If you've never played any of the AC games before, then my recommendation is to start with this one! It's pure fun and cheese that will keep you entertained till the end.			"

												This game takes the fun out of dogfights with its DFM (dog fight mode?) feature. Instead of having to tail the enemy as best you, you simply get somewhat close behind them and initiate DFM which takes over control over your plane aside from speed. All you have to do now is spam missiles when prompted until the enemy plane is no more. Even then flying outside of DFM is rather mediocre.All in all I think Uncle Grim's review of this game said it best. So if you enjoy being an amorphous blob of missiles spinning around in fart-circles, this is the game for you!			"

												I recommend this with the following. You cannot come into this expecting an Ace Combat game. You really have to treat this as a standalone title. The DFM mode is fun but gets overused and is irritating when it is forced on you to kill aces rather than use your own skill. A gamepad is HIGHLY recommended as PC controls are too complex to be practical.			"

												I love the Ace Combat series. AC6 was by far my favorite Xbox 360 title. Much as I wish Namco-Bandai would port that one over to PC, this game makes for an adequate substitute. At first I was a little upset about dog fight mode (a semi auto-pilot mode that for the most part keeps up with high-maneuverable enemies automaticlally while you just and and shoot at them), but after a while I realized; 1) It does have it's drawbacks, such as making it more difficult to evade missiles; and 2) You don't ~have~ to use it.Keyboard crontrols are pretty terrible for me. Thankfully I have an Xbox One controller, making the experience pretty much identicle to AC6 on the 360. The only difference (and a negative one in my opinion) is the absence of ""Low-G Turning"". The default controls can be set to classic style, which I've done being an Ace Combat veteran. I can't help but feel classic style should have been the default - a very minor gripe.The story is set in the real world, which I think was a bit of a mistake on Namco-Bandai's part. I'm not incredibly deep into it yet, so I can't comment on whether it's good or not.Overall, if you like the Ace Combat series,..well...this is an Ace Combat game. You'll probably like this one too. Still crossing my fingers for the slim-to-none chance they decide to bring AC6 to the PC.			"

												An alternative version for H.A.W.X. with some additional content such as piloting apaches,using gunships etc.Very good choice of soundtracks and perfect script.I havent tried multiplayer choices,yet singleplayer is fantastic so you wouldn't be mad to buy it. Graphics are not perfect,but it's not bad either. Dogfights are the real joy of the game. 8/10 for me			"

												One has to approach the Ace Combat series with the proper expectations.  If you are expecting a deeply-accurate simulation in the tradition of DCS or even Falcon 4.0, you will be sorely disappointed.  This game is essentially a distillation of Sega's Afterburner -- planes with literally a hundred or more missiles, infinite cannon ammo and explosions galore.  This game is perfect for those who want to fly fighter jets, but don't want to have to memorize a 1000-page tome on how to properly start the plane's engines.  The cheesy but serviceable story serves to move the combat from one setting to the next and you won't mind as you shoot down enemy planes from the vintage MiG-21 to futuristic concept designs straight off the blueprints.  Never has aerial warfare looked so beautiful.			"

												Not the best game of the series. The controls are rather clunky but then again, like Dark Souls, you probably need a control because with a keyboard it feels like you're trying to pleasure a woman by blowing on her. It's damn near impossible. The story isn't anything special, like, just skip the cutscenes, you aren't missing anything special. Graphics aren't bad in the cockpit but the people.... god the people are pretty bad. Plane models are well detailed and the terrain isn't too bad either (then again you're really high up so who knows. In the end of the day I think it's a game for die hard fans and that's it. Buy it and try it if you're still interested but only during a sale when it's dirt cheap. I didn't like it but some people do and you might be one of them.			"

												Not just one of the worst flight combat games I have ever played, but hands down, one of the worst games I have ever played period. Clearly intended for the lowbrow, this offers one of the worst and least realistic flight combat mechanics I have ever seen, and I've been playing flight combat games for 22 years. While some of the visuals and graphics are stunning, and the story is somewhat engaging despite flat-as-cardboard acting performances, the gameplay is jerky, unresponsive, confusing, and.. well, horrible. It fails to deliver any of the excitement that is promised and is frankly just a boring, frustrating mess. It is exactly what you should expect from a console to PC port. A piece of unrealistic eye-candy that does about as much justice to modern air combat as the movie Pearl Harbor did to the battle it is named for.The controls totally ruin an already bad game. Even though I had selected keyboard/joystick setup for my PC play-through, the functionality of both are a total miss as the support kept bugging out, and the game seemed to keep forgetting the controls that I had mapped for functions. Helecopter control was the absolute worst I have ever seen, even worse than the console version, if you can believe that. The ""tutorial"" system is still the most intrusive, unhelpful piece of flaming MiG-15 wreckage ever, and doesn't even display the proper keys to be engaged (it displays the gamepad controls left over from the console version). The infamous dogfighting mode is still like fighting in a tunnel and does not give you any sort of freedom of flight movement that is needed on close combat. I couldn't even adjust my rudder to bring my gunsight down onto my banking target. The gunsight (determined by my aircrafts seemingly on-rails AoA) refused to line up on any target despite my constantly trying to wrestle the controls into place.In the end, the PC port of this game is even WORSE than the console version. I had intended to play this all the way though as I did on console, but after the 3rd mission I found that I was totally unwilling to stomach this ""game"" again in an even worse version. Uninstalling now to make room for games more worthy of a place on my SSD. The only upside: This silly thing cost me less than a burger at Carl's Jr. (I'd rather have the burger).			"

												I got this game based on positive opinons on the series as a whole. Flying was good, DFM was okay, the turret section was boring, the plot was generic in subject matter and execution, and the helicopter mission's controls and level design were so awful that I stopped playing there. I don't understand the principle of cashing in and taking inspiration from Call of Duty, because all of the people that like COD are already dedicated to COD. Also, the Ace Combat series has a smaller audience that didn't appreciate the casualization of their series, so reviews and sales weren't good as it failed to appeal to a larger fanbase. Maybe I'll play this again, but it would have to take some real boredom for me to reach down to the bottom of the barrel that is my Steam Library.			"

												Its not bad at all, with the exception of the ""Dogfight Mode"" that makes it a railshooting jet rather than an actual dogfight. I wouldn't expect a realistic plane sim because this game is far from that. However the action and story is there but could be better. Overall gameplay is good. Music is very well made but hard to hear in the game. IDOLMASTERS and other customizations make it feel better to play rather than looking at the same stock plane.Very Japanese influenced game and plot. Although many Ace Combat Veterans wouldn't appreciate much of this game's direction, they would be best playing Ace Combat INFINITY which seems more at home to them and a better game than this.

												Continues to press forward in what has bothered many in each campaign-release and as a consequence, it is even more ""arcade-y"" than any of the previous games...if that's possible. This becomes immediately apparent with the addition of this ""Dogfight Mode"" where upon you getting a bead on the enemy's six, you must execute this Dogfight Mode to shoot it down and as you do so, this dramatic x-ray vision zoom-effect pulls the enemy tailpipe into your face just prior to firing and successfully shooting down the enemy aircraft. However, with this cartoonish crap, comes with even better overall graphics, aircraft/weapons, and environment and despite the aforementioned ""arcade-y"" crap, remains a fun flying experience with an advancement in graphics and depth of play.

												First of all, I will recommend this game for people who love jet arcade fighting. If you have or like these game (H.A.W.X, H.A.W.X II) you probably will love AC:AH too.if you really want to play AC, don't read my review afterwards.I really love Ace Combat since it's first apperance in PS1, and I just can't deny this AC:AH is a dumb-down version from every Ace Combat ever released. to summarize my review, I'll point out the pro & con.Pro :+ Graphic are nice and well done, the cockpit view are beast+ Loading time is good. lol.+ There's many option for jet, jet color, choice of weapon, in every mission. So you can refining your playstile well.+ Homing missile mechanic are improved from the latest AC, it's hard enough to avoid it, but didn't make it too hard either. You can do tricks like stall tho.+ The story a bit interesting, but back again to Russia vs America fairytale.Con :- The DFM mode really breakdown this game. here's the problem and why; some enemies (like boss or some red target) can't be taken down by just aiming missile, they must be forced to DFM with you to trigger the scripted storyline. And you will notice it just the same if you repeat the mission, even if you are miles apart from the last DFM happening. (the triggered event like, dogfight beyond the building, or valley, or pipe tower, or else). What's the point with that? you just literally, only control to have your opponent in the crosshair, and your speed. The steering is auto-pilot, LOL!- Since when your jet can regenerated health?! There's no damage breakdown like any other Ace Combat, what we like is we know if our wing is hit, or our tail-wing is broken and we can feel the downside of it. not just LIGHT DAMAGE, MEDIUM DAMAGE, HEAVY ♥♥♥♥IN DAMAGE, and you can heal up like nothing happened...........- If you play MGR:R, you'll♥♥♥♥♥♥yourself knowing the story almost have the same background for the protagonist. So people, if you want to be the hero, let yourself having a PTSD.Get it on sale! not worth the full price! "

												In the sense like HAWX did introduce new ideas, for what to do with the air combat simulation games, so does Assault Horizon inject it's own new idea and works with established and classic, perhaps simple arcade-style air-combat with a touch of extra incentive to get up-close and personal. The new Dog-Fight-Mode (DFM) works very well and the story gives at least a small bit of more recognizable characters for the player to care for.All around: Worth the money, even if at full price (for current Steam standard price of about EUR 30,-)			"

												I have always been a huge fan of the Ace Combat series, but this game is a huge let-down.  I will disagree that the DFM system is necessary to take down the Target Leads like many of the other reviews have stated, but the enemy forces the mode far too frequently to be realistic or to make the harder difficulties even remotely enjoyable.  Attempting to bait enemies away from a furball is next to impossible unless they are not a main target.  Main targets remained locked together in a mess on one side of the battlefield and you are forced to go into it to get anything done and that results in constant missile dodging and lock-ons from the enemy and being forced into DFM by two enemies at a time at every moment.  The AI pilots on your side are useless and pretty much never get kills or even assist in combat, unlike in HAWX.  Their only purpose is as a distraction for the enemy and they don't even do that well.  In general, I enjoyed the game up until the obvious betrayal of the Russians.  Many reviewers have said that the storyline is forgettable, but, again, I would have to disagree.  While predictable, the story should interest anyone with a good understanding of military and how warfare is engaged in.  The multiplayer seems to be where this game shines and what it was intended for, because I am completely finding the campaign difficult to enjoy solo.  Perhaps in co-op it would be more fun.A patch to the AI is definitely necessary to enjoy the campaign in this game.  Fortunately, playing multiplayer seems to feel like a much more realistic combat scenario than the BS you go through in the campaign storyline.  I will still recommend this game to people.  On lower difficulties, the game is fun and worth going through, but since higher difficulties are necessary for some of the unlocks, you won't be able to get everything like that.  Multiplayer will be a rewarding experience all around, though more people need to buy into the game so that there is more population available for multiplayer.			"

These parts were by far the worst part of this this game and they are long and unskippable. There are so really good parts tho, you get turret gameplay sections which are like call of duty modern warfare (firing from an AC130 gun ship). The normal plane sections are quite enjoyable, you can choose from a bunch of aircraft to accomplish your mission, its not all dog fighting, theres also bomber parts.			"

												This is game is very engaging, and all the more so if you're a fan of contemporary martial aviation. The graphics are great, which does nothing to harm the feel of flying a decent selection of different air craft from different parts of the world in either third person or♥♥♥♥♥♥pit mode. I'm a big fan of Russian war planes, and this game delivered for me from the MiG-29 to the Su-35 and 37. If you like F-22s and F-15/16s and stuff, or are into European advanced fighters like the Raphael or Eurofighter or something, it will suit you fine as well.The feel of the controls took time for me to get used to, as it's a strange way of doing a flying game for me. I found myself making customized controls for some time before i found something I got comofortable with. Also, I take issue with the apparent need to go into this close-up cinematic combat flight mode that becomes an important part of the cmapaign very often; sort of takes away from the advanced manuevering skills players need to hone that come with just flying around shooting hostiles in air to air dog fights with no assistance but a radar lock. It seems somewhat optional otherwise, as the game has plenty of hostiles that can be taken out in the more fun manner of dogfighting. I'd give this game either a 7/10 or an 8/10; depends on how much you're into contemporary dogfights and military aircraft stuff. It's pretty cinematic, sometimes the levels can be a little boring or reptative, but the flights themselves are still pretty cool.			"

												Ace Combat Assualt Horizons is an Amazing game. You dont entriely have to be into aircraft as such to play it and enjoy it. The game revolves anround basic yet enchanced Dogfighting with easy to use and simple interface that anyone who hasn't played an Ace Combat Game can pick up whether it's a controller or the keyboard and become at one with the mecahnics of the game.

												In the sense like HAWX did introduce new ideas, for what to do with the air combat simulation games, so does Assault Horizon inject it's own new idea and works with established and classic, perhaps simple arcade-style air-combat with a touch of extra incentive to get up-close and personal. The new Dog-Fight-Mode (DFM) works very well and the story gives at least a small bit of more recognizable characters for the player to care for.All around: Worth the money, even if at full price (for current Steam standard price of about EUR 30,-)			"

												Ace Combat Assault Horizon may not be a ""true"" Ace Combat game, but that doesn't mean that it's bad. I enjoyed this game, and i think it's a good one. The difference is basically two things: more variety, meaning that there's missions where you'll fire a helicopter gun, pilot a helicopter, drive a bomber and shoot from an AC-130. These missions are less fun, especially the helicopter ones; secondly, the jet missions have the gameplay aspects that you expect, adding 2 new mechanics: one where you use your plane as a bomber to target ground targets (which is less fun) and the other where you fight other jets up close and personal. This one is the highlight of this game, but it's overused. Beating bosses without it is almost impossible. All these aspects made this game different, but i still liked it. The story and charaters aren't nothing special but get the job done, the graphics are OK and the music good. There's also free mission with ranks and multiplayer to keep you engaged after finishing the 8-10 hours campaing. If you like this genre, grab it on sale.			"

Its not overly realstic, and its really fun especially in the Dogfight mode and when you shoot an aircraft down. The camera will follow it, making an epic little scene of fire and fun. All in all, for £10, its a really good little arcade timewaster. I love it so far, just wished the multiplayer was a little more active. Ill give it a 9/10			"

I played the xbox version of this game but it has less dlc than the xbox version ex the gr4 tornado and  f14 maccross frontier skin , and of course the xbox version control is better than the keyboard i suggest you using controller/joysticks on this game.

												This game is... bad... just so, so badwell the music is good. And the plane models are pretty decent.but the rest...Just imagine you are throwing paperballs at a trashbin. And then a random dude comes by and takes that paperball, pretends it's flying around, holds it against walls to be ""bouncing off"" making explosion noises all the way through to make it more epic and in the end he lets the ball fall into the trashbin. 300 times in a row  because that is all this game is: repetetive ""cinematic"" handholding.ControlsThe Helicopter controls are pure garbage on a flight stick, had to rebind absolutely everything to be even remotely usable. The Door Gunner and AC130 sections i just straight up did with a mouse. The planes themselves are... well it took me almost an hour to solve the stuck yawing problem. after that they were ok, but pointless, as you'll spend 80% of your time in Quick Time Event mode .Storylol what? story? i'm pretty sure this game once had a story and then 2 weeks before launch they decided to scrap that story and just rearanged the missions and just removed all the cutscenes that didn't fit anymore. Cause absolutely nothing makes any sense, there is maybe 1 or 2 missions where you even have the slightest clue of what you'll do in the mission. but atleast there was like 5 missions where i knew why i was doing somethingDamn i remember my first Ace Combat game (X: Skies of Deception) on PSP where they had branching story paths, briefings...GameplayDo you like randomly spawning enemies? do you want to have the mission to defend something and literally instantly 20 new planes will spawn right on top of it? by that i don't mean, there is a cutscene and then you start playing again when they are close, literally without a pause 20 new planes spawning right around you after you shot down the last plane of the last wave. There is maybe 2 occassions in the entire game of enemies actually flying ito the map...Also do you like Scripted fights? yeah better learn to recognize when you are allowed to shoot down enemies and when not. Cause when you are allowed to enemies will go down in 1 to 2 missiles max. if you are not allowed to because the enemy you are in QTE mode with has to fly through the streets of the city below you first so you can have a cinematic chase scene then you can pepper that guy with 50 missiles and he'll just smoke a bit... and then instantly die by 1 more rocket once you finished that cinematic.The End boss took me 4 tries because he broke QTE mode and then the game wanted me to be in QTE mode 5 seconds later to engage the scripted chase or i'd loose the missionVerdictI redownloaded HAWX2 after this and had a blast.

												Ace Combat Assaut Horizon (ACAH) is air fight simulator, as much as Call of Duty is soldier simulator. While it looks like one, it's made to be a game, not a flight simulator. Plot? As American pilot, alongside with russians you fight with some rebels. But it's predictable like kid with knife to us that russians will eventually turn against us. The plot twist? Not all of them. Yay.Ending with plot, ending with sarcasm, I promise. ACAH has some pretty nice mechanics. Most of the time player sees the world from planes' cockpit. Nice thing is, there are plenty of fighters (Not only american!) to choose, each comes with unique cockpit. At the beginning of the mission, player may also choose camo for his fighter. Looks nice when you dont like cockpit sight and preffer to play in Third person camera.  Last camera mode is placed on the fighters'  neb. Mission objectives? Hm... essential part of every level are fighter fights. If you are playing as fighter, you can be sure that there will be air fight. Besides, pilot might have to perform air strike, protect transporters (by fighting planes) or shooting down a warhead. Why if? Namco knew that featuring only fighters would be boring, so in certain missions you use different aircraft. So you provide air support as assault chopper pilot (somehow flying in theese make me feel as I were playing some console port - hitting anything without using lock on is really time-consuming), operate minigun in Black Hawk (as for me - best  part of the game), fly AC-130 (copied from CoD, but still awesome) or drop bombs from B-2 Spirit Tactical bomber. Plenty of attractions, aren't there?Make the metal bleed was the games' motto. I agree on that. Explosions, destroyed fighters and soo many more were awesome. Playing the game for graphics is totally worth it (okay, maybe ground structures could've been done better, but come on, you barely look at the ground!). And all that looked flawlessly on Nvidia GeForce GTS 250 and 4GB of RAM.To sum up, ACAH was great game. If you like fighters, and modern air combat - don't hesitate.P.S: No word about multiplayer, because I havent even tried it			"

												I'll just list off what I liked & disliked, and why.+ Visuals.  While not amazing, they still look a little bit better than Ace Combat 6 (An infinitely better game, go get that for the Xbox 360 instead)- There's no Aircraft and Weapons buying RPG element that I always liked about the old Ace Combat games.  It gave a nice sense of progression and it's sad not to see it here.- DFM.  Basically it automatically tails the target and allows you to shoot or launch missiles at the target.  It's completely unecessary, and sometimes the game won't let you progress until you use it at certain points, not that it would tell you that.(There's a mission where you face an ace and try to defend a jet.  I didn't realize I was supposed to use DFM and trigger a cutscene, so even after I hit the dang guy several times with my missiles I still lost.  Yay.)- Story.  For some reason they decided the best idea would be to transplant the cheesy Ace Combat story into real life, automatically involving real emotions from real people and making it gritty.  I'll be honest, I did not enjoy it at all.It's like the Pierce Brosnan take on James Bond vs Daniel Craig.  James Bond isn't a serious movie series to me, so I enjoyed the former a lot more.  Sidetracking aside, it could do with a little goof to make the game feel better.-Difficulty spikes.  I'm all for having a difficult game (I'm playing on the highest difficulty at the moment) but it comes and goes between so easy you don't have to really pay attention, and 'oh god why are there eight missiles coming at me from every direction'.  It's usually after a cutscene that this happens.  Thankfully usually with a checkpoint.-Small aesthetic points.  One of the fun things about the game series is that you can look around the cockpit at all the details.  With this game that's harder to do, and the planes seem oddly lacking in detail.  You have much less freedom to look around at the panels in your plane.  Yes, maybe this is a small complaint in the scheme of things but it's all the small things that makes the game less enjoyable as a whole.Overall I can't reccomend this game.  If possible, I would go for Ace Combat 4 for the PS2 or Ace Combat 6 for the Xbox 360.			"

												I Totally recomend this game. As a hardcore fan of Ace Combat, i will be the first to admit that this game is very different from the past games in the series and it does take more of a mainstream approach like call of duty, however, the fact that this mainstream approach is being done on a game that is focused on combat flight simulator style of game is something worth seeing and playing. It's fun, distructive, and you still get those awesome vibes that i've felt throughout the whole ace combat series so far. If you are interested in the more traditional Ace Combat  games, there is Ace Combat 4, 5, and zero on PS2 and Ace Combat 6 (my personal favorite of the whole series) on Xbox 360. I give Ace Combat:Assualt Horizon a 4 out of 5 :)BTW, this PC version of the game  is supior to the Xbox 360 version however, this is one fix that u need to do to get this game working right on PC. here is the link and discription of that one fix. http://steamcommunity.com/app/228400/discussions/0/864958088271414103/ besides that, this game runs perfectly.

												The storyline doesn't stand up to the other AC's storylines, but it had the best gameplay out of any of the ACs I've played (4,5,Zero,6)For the best game experience possible go to settings and set the control scheme from optimum to classic (Gives you more control over your craft.) and play with a controller. (However it DOES work with mouse and keyboard.)Even though it's a good game, few people play online and those who do frequently abuse poor balancing decisionsDon't be thrown off by the bad reviews, they're most likely people who didn't know they could change the control scheme to classic, or people upset that the gameplay has shyed-away from slow turn fights.The soundtrack is amazing by the way, look it up.

												Don't buy it, even if you're a fan I wouldn't recommend you to buy it. Only if it's for less than 3USD or your local currency's equivalent.Why? because of this[www.gamespot.com].On my own words, this game went in the wrong direction. It tried to be something it isn't.The game features several mechanisms (minigames) to make it easier or to try to change the formula. The dogfights are part of said minigames (if you don't use the dogfight mode, you're at a very HUGE disavantage), If you don't enter ""ground attack mode""you can't use your A2G missiles. Horse crap.And the stupidity found in certain missions, but that contains spoilers: There's a mission in whichyou have to defend an airfield of being overrrun by tanks and protect the incoming cargo planes of enemy aircraft. The most infuriating part is when you absolutely have to destroy the planes in dogfight-mode before engaging the tanks, or these won't let you do anything. Remember: you have to engage A2G mode to attack the tanks, there'sno way to defend against A2A while in that mode.And, on the final mission, you are supposed to have a 1vs1 fight with your ultra nemesis,however, that nemesis is so OP, he can travel from the ""battlepoint"" where you're supposed to fight him, to where the bombers are located waaaay back in less than a second, you can test that and see that in your minimap. I LOL'd hard when I saw that happening. And of course, you're supposed to take him down in dogfight mode before engaging the bomber that you also have to destroy in dogfight mode.This is the first game that made me RAGEQUIT in single player mode.TL;DR: if you're looking for the classic Ace Combat experience, get it somewhere else. Like from HAWX.			"

												A rant from an old Ace Combat fanboy.Skip to the bottom to get a summary.I don't know what to say about Assault Horizon. I want to like it, but I just can't bring myself to. Being a Huge Ace Combat fan I was hoping to see past the flaws and enjoy the game for what it is. But god damn, is it awful. I thought Ace Combat 6 was the worst Ace game I've played. This takes the cake, bar none. I take it back, Fire of Liberation!First of all, DFM and Gameplay. I hate DFM. It literally ruins the game for me.Some targets are quite obviously unkillable UNTIL you engage the DFM. Why? You can tell. Any plane with TGT will pop flares endlessly and go from 0 to 60 in 1 second to avoid your conventional missles. This is obviously to get you to use DFM. To force your plane into an often very scripted chase scene. Sure, it looks fantastic. But after the eye-candy wears off it becomes an object of pure annoyance. It takes the feeling of being a Sky-badass away and makes it into a very boring rollercoaster ride. Sometimes you'll be asked to do quick-time events as well. Press W to see something happen! If you don't press that button..nothing happens 9 times outta 10. It's completely pointless.-Second. The missions. Endless waves of very dumb Targets. Now I have no problem with scores of enemies. In fact I love it when AC does that. But when it involves mostly being forced into the ""Bogey on Your Six"" Mini-game (that's incredibly easy to boot) and DFM it really does become painful. There is little variation between the Red targets they throw at you. No enemy chatter, or at least none compelling enough to take note. The whole point of TGT was to make them special targets. Not things you hurtle at the player endlessly like the regular grunts.Missions are split between planes, helicopters and bombing missions now. I can appreciate the variation but the Bombers and Helo missions are terrible linear crap. Not to mention very boring. Blah. Toss those out.-Third. Story. Story isn't the worst thing to this game, even though I dislike the real world setting among other things. I will forgive the very typical Modern Warfare-ish plot as well. Don't expect the typical Ace Combat War drama here. It's nothing out of the ordinary.The characters are likable, albeit forgettable. I didn't quite like having the protagonist blabbering on while I'm playing but that's more of a personal nuisance.-Fourth. DifficultyI can really, really tell they lowered the difficulty of this game. I know previous Ace Combats weren't all that hard to begin with (hence the mega-bosses and tunnel missions) but A.H. really drops the bar. Playing on ""Elite"" is no where nearly challenging. Again, this points back to the various mini-games and the DFM.If you get the hang of the DFM (and you will within 10 minutes) you'll be shooting down the hardest Aces in mere minutes (so long as it's not a scripted event). You can take MULTIPLE missle hits on Elite, to which your plane will seemingly regenerate health. You have unlimited bullets (not like they do anything to begin with) and still have over ONE HUNDRED missiles on Elite. You can almost Bounce off the ground on Elite, something only seen in previous games on the easiest difficulties.-Fifth. PC edition flaws and other crapThe controls are quite awful to get a handle on. You really must have a controller to ""enjoy"" this game because Mouse control won't help in the slightest and trying to fly with the bloody Arrow keys is near impossible. Of course, all to be expected from a Console series.There's no real PC settings to get a hold of. Just resolution, AA and some other things. This was quite sad to see, since adding AA also adds significant lag for what looks to be little difference.Now the game itself looks good. Like DAMN good. They finally made the environments you play in interesting and vibrant. Not the flat Google-Earth imagery of old. The planes explode and tear apart magnificiently. Character models are well done. Overall, a good job. On the graphics. Multiplayer is mostly everything above only with REAL PEOPLE.I enjoyed it, even with DFM. Sadly, I don't buy ACE games for Multiplayer so I'll just leave it at that.Another minor annoyance that came with the ""Enhanced Edition"" was the inclusion of those stupid, stupid IDOLMASTER skins that I hate oh so much from Ace 6. God damn, we don't need stupid pink anime skins in Ace Combat. Even if a small ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ portion of the fanbase asks for it. Just don't. Please. The Nagase fanservice was bad enough.-----TL;DR Overall I give this game a 5/10. It's just Average, bargin-bin videogamin'. Nothing wrong with getting it cheap but it's not worth anything above 14 dollars. New-comers will have fun, but older fans might feel a bit left behind. Multiplayer is a nice addition, sadly a little dead now though.I can play it, but it's still probably the worst Ace Combat yet and it has some serious, needless crap thrown on it.Even worse is how it failed to gain that ""new audience"" it was clearly going for, since Ace has now been reduced to a F2P game for the PS3. Shame.;_;7  Mobius One weeps for the future of A.C.			"

												if you are a fan of the Ace Combat series, Assault horizon is a Different kind of beast. so,since now,i warn you. Aproach this one with caution.well,it feels like ace combat,plays for the most part like ace combat, but it has one mechanic that Kills it,DFM and ASM. those sections,when Scripted are Terrible,and makes the fights with aces,Especially the one with a certain shark nosed Plane Pilot, Unfufilling. At First,they are cool,but repeat them,over,and over,and over again,and you'll see what i mean. and this is agravated if you played other Ace Combat games on the consoles, that really demanded skills from you.so,it's a Hard game?! Far from it. Easy,even on the Ace Difficulty,but it has it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t moments.Is a Bad Ace combat game?! by my standards,Yes. Namco has done better with its franchises.But it's a Bad game?! HELL NO.The better pros i gotta say is: the cutscenes that are awesomely made, the Aircraft Collor editor that even to this date i revisit, and the Awesome models,beautifull with full interiors made by Project aces.But the Unforgivable Cons i gotta repeat: The DFM and ASM are not good systems when done Scripted like 60% of the game. some sections are not,but they fell a bit cluncky to control,and i tend to lose control quickly. another Con is that the control on this game is very sensitive,even on the most Non-Sensitive setting,so it doesn't feel like Ace 5,6,or Cross Rumble,and you get to have tighter reflexes to adapt on how the Jets fly on this game. they feel different,but horrible?! no... just,worse. and those aspects i'm glad that namcobandai got right on the next games of the franchise,that can and MUST keep going in the direction it was since Ace Combat 3 (jp)... that by the way i still wait for a remake of that game... but let's not get out of the tangent.My final Veredict: 7/10.  Is not a Bad game, i can recomend for you who want a Different Experience all togheter.But if you are a Ace fan,as a said Aproach with caution or Don't go for it.(or at least,wait untill the price drop if you want to experiment with this beast).

												This game is a disappointment. The single player story is weak, specially when compared to previous titles such as Ace Combat 5 or ACZero (6, the first title on the 360 and PS3 and directly previous to AH, had a pretty short story as well); it feels like the story has been completely cast aside in favor of the multiplayer, which is also extremely poor and mostly dead by now. It feels shallow, and the characters are very dry, with bad voice acting to match. The helicopter missions, one of the new additions of AH, are absolutely terrible, with sketchy controls and no real way to control the heli's nose; on the other hand, the C130 attack plane is very fun to play with. The real world setting made more bad than good to this game - you won't see any of the fantastic boss battles you had on the other games, such as Scinfaxi and Arkbird from AC5 or Excalibur from ACZero, since those were made up technology; instead in AH you'll have unimpressive fights against a cruiser ship and occasionally shoot some missiles off air, and that's it. The battles against other aces (which are too few to actually cause impact on the players) are heavily scripted rail shooting sections, with little to no skill involved.Over all, this game feels like a huge letdown for the series, with many things that made the series great being cut off, in favor of poorly thought and badly realized features. 4/10, a waste of money if you're expecting an actual Ace Combat game.

												Note: I'm burning through my Steam backlog and trying out every game I have so this is based on about an hour of gameplay. I'm a big fan of Ace Combat on PS2. Now I haven't played an Ace Combat game in many years before today and sadly, the series looks to be in worse shape then when I last saw it. Firstly the presentation: The overall presentation and feel of the series I remember is gone and replaced with a more Tom Clancy-ish / Call of Battlefield modern military cinematic style; which wouldn't be so bad if this were some other game. The story is pretty generic and forgetable as are the characters; but then I never played Ace Combat for the story so it's not that big of a deal. Just a little bit of a let down. The Combat: It feels dumbed down. I remember having more control over the aircraft previously. Dogfighting  now comes down to switching to an on the rails mode briefly while AI controls your aircraft following the enemy. It does provide a more cinematic experience I guess but I didn't buy this game to watch a movie. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy arcade style action, but that's not what Ace Combat is about for me. Other Issues: In order to integrate variety into the game, helicopter and turret missions have been added. The helo controls just awfully and I HATE turret missions in any game so there's that. Besides, why would Ace Combat need anything else besides the aircraft missions? This really hurts the game in my opinion.Overall Ace Combat: Assault Horizon is not the worst thing I've ever played but it's certainly not worth 20 dollars. The Fighter Jet missions are still kind of fun despite being dumbed down and the aircraft all look pretty cool. I can not recommend this game based on the price, but if you can pick it up under 5 bucks, it may be worth an afternoon.			"

												Ace Combat Assault Horizon is a turn-and-burn flight-sim-lite that offers stunning visuals even on older hardware, and offered up a good variety of aircraft to fly, including AH-64D Longbow Apache, doorgunner in a MH-60 Blackhawk, various fighters including F-15, F-15E, F-16, F-22, F-35, bomber such as B-1, and even the AC-130 Spooky gunship.  (Though in case of AC-130 and MH-60 you act as the gunner only).  There are even more alternate planes to fly and enjoy if you want to replay the missions. The turn-and-burn roots of the game are obvious when you are armed with several HUNDRED missiles and shot down probably over 1000 aircraft by the mission's end. Though obviously there are some tactics to the whole thing, as you have multi-lock missiles. What's new was Dogfight Mode, where you enter into a ""close pursuit"" mode where you need to keep the aircraft in the aimming circle, and when the circle turns red, your missile does extra damage (possible one shot kills rather than multiple hits).  The ground attack was handled nicely as you are encouraged to adopt ""corridor runs"" where you engage the initial point much like dogfight mode, and while in this your weapons fire faster and do more damage. Obviously most battles are done with guided weapons (except in the Bomber mission where you do need to use iron bombs). Gun kills are possible esp. in the Apache Longbow against enemy Hind gunships. The controls will take a bit of getting used to, and controller is highly recommended. As mentioned before, graphics are very nice, even on outdated hardware, and all the planes are nicely textured and detailed, as are the ground buildings. The visuals are comparable to the Ubisoft HAWX series.  And the controls are responsive. My main problem is the difficulty curve. While the first mission was easy, the second mission (Longbow) was incredibly difficult, esp. near the end, even on recruit difficulty. And subsequent missions have uneven difficulty levels. Some I can pass with a single attempt, others require multiple attempts. Fortunately, game has a savepoint system so you do not need to restart the whole mission if you do choose to quit in the middle of a mission. The game also has a robust multiplayer mode which I did not test. All in all, ACAH is a fun turn-and-burn flight-sim light, though people expecting a flight-sim may be turned off by the very arcade-feeling ""dogfight mode"" (DFM) and the ""counter-move"" (force the guy on your tail to overshoot). But it is exciting to play, and it was fun, except for the super-difficult missions.			"

												This game is an arcade shooter. It is a good looking, mainly QTE-driven Japanisation of a Flight Nonsimulator. Neither enemies nor you follow any laws of physics while flying. There is up, down and the soil you smash into. Some obstacles like buildings scattered around the map. You can even crash into them and survive it. The air combat has nothing particular complex about it. Missiles almost always miss unless you are in QTE mode meaning you enter a rail  shooter like phase during which you have to follow an enemy close. With a little skill and two exceptions during the campaign you always win those encounters. The main story is OK, you see the twists coming from a mile away but thats fine. The motivation of the main antagonist seems plausible though his means are (like in most games) way over the top. But its a japanese action game, right? The planes you are able to fly are are interesting. As PC Gamer its recommended you are willing to face some technical problems. Always first installation and crash after the first mission as well as the game forgetting graphic settings are just a few. The soundtrack of this game is extremly good. If you want to have just some fun shooting stuff and be entertained without thinking to much AND you got a controller - go for it.			"

												Im saying this as a long time fan of the Ace Combat series, THIS IS♥♥♥♥♥♥ THE ABSOLUTE WORST, never since the ps1 and ps2 games has anyone had to run semi call of duty missions of gunning down patches of zero threat ragdolls from a helicopter, that is NOT what Ace Combat is about.It should be about planes and not even a simulator at that end wich brings me to the second point, their attempt to emulate real life dogfights, in wich the only objective is to get close behind a certain target and initiate the event of chasing it, its way too repetitive specialy when the targets also go on a certain path (i.e. fly through a canyon, between buildings,etc) just for the OH THIS GAME IS SO MOVIE LIKE, MUCH ACTION, WOW feel.I hope Project Aces didnt have anything to do with this piece of garbage aside of lending the plane models because their games from ps2 were decent.If anyone wants to try this just to be amazed at how developers can miss the mark so bad remember to keep an eye on the play time because you will want your money back.

												There is still fun to be had from playing this game but like many others i got this in a bundle so i wasn’t expecting it to blow my mind or at least I don’t mind if it doesn’t. DFM, a mode in which you enter a dog fighting chase with the enemy, is overused and the missiles seem to have no AI at all. Normal units are dumb as a rock and TGT_LEADS, equivalent to the elite mob bosses in world of Warcraft have infinite flares and seem to be untouchable, until you engage them in DFM where they toss you round like rag through the ground assets until you crash. This game i think has a steep learning curve and is better played with a flight-stick which i suspect is the reason everyone is having a hard time with the controls. Story line is admittedly a bit point less they should of kept it basic like the ones released on PlayStation one, no talking strait to business would have been better. Money I’d pay = £4.99Personal Rating = 6.64/10Hours of fun = 4-6 hours without friends "

There is certain times when you have climax moments.In conclusion this game is amazing in graphics,gameplay,teamwork.Keep on the good work Ace Combat series!			"

												Remember times, when comparing something to COD wasn't an insult?Well this is like call of duty with planes (when call of duty was cool)Arcady and simplistic, but insanely funny and addicting this is a perfect game to relax, even on high difficulties, when you can die relatively easy.Apart from ace combat being generally an arcade game AH brings this even further with dogfight mode, despite the fact, that you are glued to your opponent, system works exeptionally well by adding more cinematic look, feel of contact with your enemy, and, occasionally, beautyfull scenery around, with falling cranes, towers and planes. Out of DFM its your general flying game, when you can't spin out of control, run out of fuel, or die of some malfunction, since your plane regenerates health at alarming speed.despite its simplicity game has some nice touches - all control surfaces are articulated, flight computer voice changes, depending on the plane, variable wing geometry planes actually thansform if you change speed, all stealth capable planes have their payload hidden inside and properly animated, and the most subtle, yet awesome - all modern russian planes have unique dodge animation - cobra move, which is a signature move for sukhoi planes.Good variability between missions, standart dogfights, AC130 missions, heli missions, bomber missons.Bad things include:dead online, boss fights, helicopter missions( because of bad cockpit view you will have to fly in second camera mode, or suffer unresponsive controlls), and missons on ground attack planes (because some gun emplacements are indestructible, and some others will spawn on spaces you grounded seconds before, sometimes it also hard to understand - is it your mistake, or enemy is just invulnerable right now).Final boss battle is a complete mess, over which you have almost no controll of, in my list of crappy bossfights it takes second place, right after Liquid Ocetot fight in MGS4. (probably devs tried to make a product placement for PAK-FA, but damn, flying at mach15 and shooting rockets backwards, ain't that some hardcore sh*)Story is a total garbage - evil general BALALAIKA stole some nuclear BEARS to seize all VODKA in mother Russia, helping him are two ace pilots BORIS MATRYOSHKA and PYOTR SRAKIN, who apparently care only about nuking Moscow and some other New Yorks. Feeling sorry for voice actors, who really tried their best playing their characters. Also - main antagonist is the only character, that can decently speak russian, but his dialogues are written by a complete mоron. Japan is always falling several years behind when it comes to western market trends, year before AH came out SC:Conviction where russians aren't main bad guys, so seing so much trash is a surprise, (again, think about COD)Graphically game looks rather nice, it has some blurry look to it, but planes are drawn in great detail, and ground surface got quite a lot attention from designers, Flying in Dubai, Moscow, and DC is a real pleasure. you can even see ground troops, if you try hard enough.Overall, recomended even for non flight sim players, and to old AC fans i can recommend to give this game a fresh look and play it as it is, and not as part of legendary series.

												I've played the Ace Combat series from AC3:Electrosphere, right through to the Belkan war (the point i gave up console gaming and moved to PC)So as soon as this version was released, I bought it the second it was available on here...and then quickly gave up with it.Now the AC series is an arcady aerial shoot em up game, but this release takes that to a whole new level...Dog fight mode? Really? And those impossible counter manoeuvres, where you do the stupidest backflip and land perfectly on your enemies 6. Why?Also, if you do not change the game setting, you're forced to fly with limited control and the inability to roll your aircraft upside down, Why would they have that set as the default control setting? You want to get in, go, dogfight and play the game, not fettle with the settings to be able to have full control.Its as if, during the planning and developing of this game, they were like ""hey, how can we make this as arcady and silly as possible""Its still fun to play, but the extreme arcadyness of it takes the old Ace Combat feel away from it.I played the first handfull of missions then gave up...But with the announcement of Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown, to be released on PC, I have been giving this game another go, as I said, its still fun to play, but the nostalgia from the old Ace Combat games has gone, they added features that were never needed.But I really do hope, that AC7 is like the older AC series, and does not have all these unnecessary features that Assault Horizon has.As far as I know, the man who created to storyline for for the PS2 versions of AC, is back with the team for AC7, so heres to hope for an epic story to the game. All in all, Assault horizon has alienated the most of the fans of the AC series, but the game itself is not a complete wash out. "

												I dont get all the hate for this game. I havnt played an Ace Combat since playstation I think so maybe im missing something. anyway the games okay, Im almost done with the campaign and I have enjoyed it. It has moments that get frustrating but most of the things people are complaining about havnt been much of an issue. Not really a fan of the turret missions though.  3 stars.... maybe a hair less but like I said, its okay, I like to pilot stuff though so maybe im biased. If this is on sale id go for it.			"

												                (I played through most of this game on a ps3)This addition to the ace combat series is not as good as the originals but i still found enjoyment in it. Certainly was a bit different with the added (and not too fitting to the series) dogfight mode while in combat, and the missions where you take control of the machine gun on the side of a chopper weren't that enjoyable (honestly really annoying) But I still recccomend this because I do find it to be fun(Ace Combat 7 coming later this year! Can't wait)			"

												Pretty meh.The plane is way too big. It takes like half the screen. It's pretty hard too see anything at all.As far as I found, there is no real tutorial either. Took me some time to understand what I was doing.And also, the multiplayer seems to be either ded or really bugged. Keeps saying ""Unable to join session"". If that is because it can't find a session to join or if it's because it's a broken feuture, I don't know.Overall, it feels kinda like War Thunder, but not as good, although this as more game modes and feels a bit more like a FPS shooter.This game gets 3/10 from me.Try it if it's free and see if you like it. Not worth buying, unless it's like 2.49 or something.			"

												This game is a disappointment. The single player story is weak, specially when compared to previous titles such as Ace Combat 5 or ACZero (6, the first title on the 360 and PS3 and directly previous to AH, had a pretty short story as well); it feels like the story has been completely cast aside in favor of the multiplayer, which is also extremely poor and mostly dead by now. It feels shallow, and the characters are very dry, with bad voice acting to match. The helicopter missions, one of the new additions of AH, are absolutely terrible, with sketchy controls and no real way to control the heli's nose; on the other hand, the C130 attack plane is very fun to play with. The real world setting made more bad than good to this game - you won't see any of the fantastic boss battles you had on the other games, such as Scinfaxi and Arkbird from AC5 or Excalibur from ACZero, since those were made up technology; instead in AH you'll have unimpressive fights against a cruiser ship and occasionally shoot some missiles off air, and that's it. The battles against other aces (which are too few to actually cause impact on the players) are heavily scripted rail shooting sections, with little to no skill involved.Over all, this game feels like a huge letdown for the series, with many things that made the series great being cut off, in favor of poorly thought and badly realized features. 4/10, a waste of money if you're expecting an actual Ace Combat game.

												Note: I'm burning through my Steam backlog and trying out every game I have so this is based on about an hour of gameplay. I'm a big fan of Ace Combat on PS2. Now I haven't played an Ace Combat game in many years before today and sadly, the series looks to be in worse shape then when I last saw it. Firstly the presentation: The overall presentation and feel of the series I remember is gone and replaced with a more Tom Clancy-ish / Call of Battlefield modern military cinematic style; which wouldn't be so bad if this were some other game. The story is pretty generic and forgetable as are the characters; but then I never played Ace Combat for the story so it's not that big of a deal. Just a little bit of a let down. The Combat: It feels dumbed down. I remember having more control over the aircraft previously. Dogfighting  now comes down to switching to an on the rails mode briefly while AI controls your aircraft following the enemy. It does provide a more cinematic experience I guess but I didn't buy this game to watch a movie. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy arcade style action, but that's not what Ace Combat is about for me. Other Issues: In order to integrate variety into the game, helicopter and turret missions have been added. The helo controls just awfully and I HATE turret missions in any game so there's that. Besides, why would Ace Combat need anything else besides the aircraft missions? This really hurts the game in my opinion.Overall Ace Combat: Assault Horizon is not the worst thing I've ever played but it's certainly not worth 20 dollars. The Fighter Jet missions are still kind of fun despite being dumbed down and the aircraft all look pretty cool. I can not recommend this game based on the price, but if you can pick it up under 5 bucks, it may be worth an afternoon.			"

												Ace Combat Assault Horizon is a turn-and-burn flight-sim-lite that offers stunning visuals even on older hardware, and offered up a good variety of aircraft to fly, including AH-64D Longbow Apache, doorgunner in a MH-60 Blackhawk, various fighters including F-15, F-15E, F-16, F-22, F-35, bomber such as B-1, and even the AC-130 Spooky gunship.  (Though in case of AC-130 and MH-60 you act as the gunner only).  There are even more alternate planes to fly and enjoy if you want to replay the missions. The turn-and-burn roots of the game are obvious when you are armed with several HUNDRED missiles and shot down probably over 1000 aircraft by the mission's end. Though obviously there are some tactics to the whole thing, as you have multi-lock missiles. What's new was Dogfight Mode, where you enter into a ""close pursuit"" mode where you need to keep the aircraft in the aimming circle, and when the circle turns red, your missile does extra damage (possible one shot kills rather than multiple hits).  The ground attack was handled nicely as you are encouraged to adopt ""corridor runs"" where you engage the initial point much like dogfight mode, and while in this your weapons fire faster and do more damage. Obviously most battles are done with guided weapons (except in the Bomber mission where you do need to use iron bombs). Gun kills are possible esp. in the Apache Longbow against enemy Hind gunships. The controls will take a bit of getting used to, and controller is highly recommended. As mentioned before, graphics are very nice, even on outdated hardware, and all the planes are nicely textured and detailed, as are the ground buildings. The visuals are comparable to the Ubisoft HAWX series.  And the controls are responsive. My main problem is the difficulty curve. While the first mission was easy, the second mission (Longbow) was incredibly difficult, esp. near the end, even on recruit difficulty. And subsequent missions have uneven difficulty levels. Some I can pass with a single attempt, others require multiple attempts. Fortunately, game has a savepoint system so you do not need to restart the whole mission if you do choose to quit in the middle of a mission. The game also has a robust multiplayer mode which I did not test. All in all, ACAH is a fun turn-and-burn flight-sim light, though people expecting a flight-sim may be turned off by the very arcade-feeling ""dogfight mode"" (DFM) and the ""counter-move"" (force the guy on your tail to overshoot). But it is exciting to play, and it was fun, except for the super-difficult missions.			"

												I've played the Ace Combat series from AC3:Electrosphere, right through to the Belkan war (the point i gave up console gaming and moved to PC)So as soon as this version was released, I bought it the second it was available on here...and then quickly gave up with it.Now the AC series is an arcady aerial shoot em up game, but this release takes that to a whole new level...Dog fight mode? Really? And those impossible counter manoeuvres, where you do the stupidest backflip and land perfectly on your enemies 6. Why?Also, if you do not change the game setting, you're forced to fly with limited control and the inability to roll your aircraft upside down, Why would they have that set as the default control setting? You want to get in, go, dogfight and play the game, not fettle with the settings to be able to have full control.Its as if, during the planning and developing of this game, they were like ""hey, how can we make this as arcady and silly as possible""Its still fun to play, but the extreme arcadyness of it takes the old Ace Combat feel away from it.I played the first handfull of missions then gave up...But with the announcement of Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown, to be released on PC, I have been giving this game another go, as I said, its still fun to play, but the nostalgia from the old Ace Combat games has gone, they added features that were never needed.But I really do hope, that AC7 is like the older AC series, and does not have all these unnecessary features that Assault Horizon has.As far as I know, the man who created to storyline for for the PS2 versions of AC, is back with the team for AC7, so heres to hope for an epic story to the game. All in all, Assault horizon has alienated the most of the fans of the AC series, but the game itself is not a complete wash out. "

												DO NOT BUY if youre a fan of the original Ace Combat series on PS2. An Ace Combat game that's completely on the rails. The only effective way to shoot down aircraft is through a dogfight mode which flies the aircraft for you, the movement is so erratic in this mode that it just gets annoying over time to try and focus the cursor over the enemy jet while it's doing 10g moves. Most of these dogfight sequences are heavily scripted with the enemy jet not blowing up until you pass through scenic explosions and carnage that wouldn't have happened otherwise and that's what bugs me the most. Sometimes planes can take 2 missiles and explode which is usually the fastest some standard jet planes can go down, but sometimes planes can also take up to 4-6 missile hits and a barrage of guns only to explode after we see some stylized collateral damage.The story is also uninspiring when compared to past Ace Combat games. Anything interesting in the plot could've been seen a mile away with as the game tries to hold your hand through its already weak plot.The game tries to make up for its lackluster gameplay by expanding on what you can do in the game: bombing and helicopter assaults. Helicopter missions are a bit weak while the bombing ones are actually interesting althought there is only a total of 1 bombing mission in the game.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this game if you're a fan of the series or want to avoid an on the rails game.

												Tried to turn an arcade stlye flight game into a console game. Then ported the console game to PC and forgot about the arcade style play. Ended up making a flight game that doesn't feel like a sim. That's not a good thing for fans of the older games.It forcing the Dogfighting mode for several opponents doesn't help either, as there's almost no skill involved in these, and depending on where you end the engagement could mean trouble. I've gotten a kill several times only for the pre-scripted debris fly-though to leave me pointed at the ground with 50 feet to go... Not great.			"

												The only Ace Combat in this game is the title. The game itself is a mess of cinematic action sequences they wanted to show off, held together by godawful flight, and a choice of either enemies flying in easy to kill straight lines, or literally unkillable until you trigger this games ""special feature"", the DogFighting Mode (DFM), wherein the enemy will fly in a dramatic straight line foir you to fill with bullets and missiles, right up until you get a dramatic explosion up close and personal. It's disappointing the first time. It doesn't get any better.Then we come to stage two, if you manage to push through the intro stage. Now you're a dude on a turret in a helicopter. You aren't flying the helicopter. You're just stuck on the side of it. This entire mission feels like it was ripped out of Call of Duty, and it 100% feels just...wrong.I can't really think of any redeeming features for this game. The planes are pretty, I guess			"

												What have they done?I was so excited when I saw this on Steam. Been a fan of the series since Ace Combat 2 on the PS1. With a score of 77/100 on Metacritic, I thought it would be a good fun game, since I have enjoyed other games with a similar score. Even though reviews said it was not as good as previous titles, I thought it would still be an enjoyable experience. Boy, was I wrong...Ace Combat has always been an arcade flight simulator - never going for complete realism. But, this game is out of control. it has gone from a fun shooter with an enjoyable story, to a Quick time event (QTE) monstrocity with a the most generic, predictable, over-the-top, ridiculous and boring plot I have even seen. Gone are the days where you fly around picking and shooting bad guys out of the sky. If you try that, you will never get anyone as they just fly around in circles. Now, you have to get up behind virtually every enemy and enter a QT event - press ""Q"" now... press ""Shift"" now - in order to take enemies out. The combat has mostly been replaced with other rubbish too. You have to use a gunship and sometimes take control of a gun on a helicopter. Even your old health bar is replace with regenerative health. You can see they are trying to appeal to idiotic Call of Duty fans.Then there are lazy port problems. I never experienced any bugs, and it ran perfectly well with everything up. That is where I must begin: the graphics options are the most limited I have ever seen. All you can really do is change the resolution. And, when you set your resolution, the game does not look very sharp, as if it has been upscaled to your native resolution. It is also not enhaced in the slightest. Tom Clany's HAWX looks better than this. Textures are all muddy, particle effects are a joke, and models have quite a low polygon count. Then the lighting is just an over-use of bloom. The FOV is also rediculous; the plane takes up far too much space on screen. It is liked you are playing zoomed in the entire time.Then you have the controls. They are just Xbox 360 controls assigned to keyboard keys. Very bad; they take no advantage of the PC's capabilities. Becomes quit irritating, trying to navigate the menus and such.In ""Call of Dutying"" the game, Namco have completely destroyed the seres in the process. Could not even finish this game as a result. This is one of the worst purchases I have even made, and does not deserve the 77/100 on Metacritic. Do NOT buy this game, even on sale.3/10			"

												An insult to the Ace Combat series.You have no controls over the flight, you can't roll or yaw, only go left or right, the game is gonna decide how to do it, when you're upside down it just doesn't let you do what you want and tries to readjust to a ""normal"" position. Most of the shooting mechanics is relegated to a ""dogfight"" mode which takes autocontrol of the plane and you just have to position a reticle over the enemy plane to hit it. Stay away from this, if you want ace combat play 5 or zero, they are the best.			"

												Having played Ace Combat when I was younger on Playstation and Playstation 2, I've always been a huge fan of the series.  This game is not like the others.  Sure it's pretty to look at but I can't get over how the chase feature is completely rammed down my throat.  I should be able to kill how I see fit.  The chase mode should be an option to kill, not THE option.  I can't help but echo some of the reviews below me, the story is bland, the characters are uninspired.  For God's sake... there's a part where you're on a helicopter doing barrel rolls. smh.   I can't believe Bandai Namco did this.			"

												I actually enjoyed the parts where you fly a fighter jet and the parts where you are the gunner on a helicopter were pretty exciting. And then they put me into a chopper and the game just sucked. The controls are terrible, especially compared to the dozen of other chopper games I've played throughout the years. It uses a control method that some early 3-D shooters used in the early nineties where you turn by pushing the aiming reticule against the side of the screen. Of course if you want to aim at something that is now in the middle of your screen you'll have to turn the reticule all the way back. And making a quick turn is impossible so you can't strafe around a target while aiming at it. There is a reason why only a few games ever used this control method and why it rarely makes a come back nowadays (I think there are a few WII games that use this control method, which kinda proves my point) ... it sucks big time. Since there are no alternative controls for the chopper and you can't skip the chopper missions those missions ruin the entire game for me. The developers can't claim they implemented these controls because they wanted to make them more realistic. Either choppers have their machine guns mounted on the sides and the aiming reticule would then move with the chopper (unlike in this game). Or the machine gun can swivel and aim independently from the chopper (in an Apache helicopter for instance the machine gun follows the head movements of the pilot and will aim where he is looking) which also doesn't match with the controls in the game.

												I downloaded this game in a fit of anticipation, but have never felt such crushing disappointment. I hadn't seen a new Ace Wombat game in years, and never dreamed that my childhood favourite would ever hit the PC. Back in the early 90s,  gaming was all about the three big console mascots: Super Mario, Sonic the Hedgehog and the unforgettable Ace Wombat. While Ace never quite had the broad mainstream appeal of Nintendo and Sega's icons, the adventures of the cheeky, baseball-cap wearing marsupial filled my childhood with near-limitless joy. 1993's original The Adventures of Ace Wombat redefined 16-bit platforming with its streetwise style, punishing bosses and catchy gangsta rap soundtrack. The 1995 sequel, Ace Wombat 2: Marsupial Madness, was much of the same, ableit with a superior level of polish and new multiplayer modes featuring Danny the Disco Dingo (I'm sure we all remember his awesome catchphrase: ""Can you dig it?""). 1997 brought the first shaky 3D effort: Ace Wombat vs. the Lizard of Oz. Unfairly maligned at the time for its awkward camera controls and risque tone, Ace 3D pioneered gameplay and storytelling techniques that wouldn't be adopted by the mainstream until the PS2 era. Sadly, following the lackluster commercial performance of Ace 3D, the franchise was put on hiatus for almost a decade, and only the most ardent fans held out hope for a return.

Finally - a new Ace Wombat game, out of the blue after so many years of silence.Sadly, it wasn't to be. They had lied. Exploiting my cherished memories of youth, they'd cruelly duped me into buying yet another cookie-cutter military shooter, albeit with the standard ground combat supplanted by aircraft.

												The best way to experience Assault Horizon is by keeping your money in your wallet and listening to the soundtrack, which is the only good thing it has going for it (Naval Warfare, Release, Rush and Dogfight are great tracks stuck in a bad game). Watch a playthrough on YouTube if you really want to find out what the fuss is about, because there's not much difference between that and being led by the nose through its short, disorganised grab bag of missions, too many of which are wasted on aircraft which aren't jets or particularly fun to sit through.

												I got into Ace COmbat with Shattered Skies. The dogfighting was superb. The ground-attack cotrol was phenomenal.This iteration feels like they couldn't bother to get the controls right, so they added a special ""mode"" (read handicap-disguised-as-minigame) to make it actually possible to shoot down enemies.It made me feel like I was playing a QTE half the time.I do not recommend.

												No doubt the worst ace combat I have ever played.  I play inverted like how a real air plane is, and when it forces you into gun mode/dog fighting mode, its NOT interverted and its so fast that your not really supposed to fly either, your supposed to just chase them down using the basic starfox controller which DOES NOT allow you to do a classic barrel roll when in dog fighting mode.. and whats even dumber is that when your out of dog fighting mode; you go back to the hardcore/classic controls which allows you to roll the plane whenever you want... its so akward and hard to play because you can't get a good feel of the plane each time it engages like that.. and sadly.... MOST of your engagements will do that.  NOW if you played in the basic starfox type controls then I guess you are alright.... BUT you run into the problem with dog fighting.. because in a real chase I want to have that feeling like I can go upside down and go side ways and really move the plane how I want too... which is impossible without the plane having the ability to roll.I have tried again and again and I would really like to LIKE this title, but this maybe the very first ace combat that I have truely disliked and it might be the last of the Ace Combats I will purchase as well... I have lost faith in the company.			"

												It is a shame that a game with such nice graphics has such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameplaye, menu organization, and options. Wikipedia says the game is criticized for being too scripted. That is being super kind to the game! It is so frustrating to play this game and feeling the game is controlling your every movement and is constantly cheating to show you some cut scenes. This game also lacks a free flight mode. DON'T buy this game. You will be frustrated. Also, no DLC, and no online gameplay. There is virtually no one ever playing this game online. As for menu organization, why can't a player reduce the music volume in multiplayer mode without exiting the multiplayer mode? What kind of air combat game does not provide a check box for mouse inversion?! This game seems like the result of obvious mismanagement of the dev team. You can clearly see the talent of the development team is there. BTW, missions are too ****ing long!			"

												An insult to the Ace Combat series.You have no controls over the flight, you can't roll or yaw, only go left or right, the game is gonna decide how to do it, when you're upside down it just doesn't let you do what you want and tries to readjust to a ""normal"" position. Most of the shooting mechanics is relegated to a ""dogfight"" mode which takes autocontrol of the plane and you just have to position a reticle over the enemy plane to hit it. Stay away from this, if you want ace combat play 5 or zero, they are the best.			"

												I downloaded this game in a fit of anticipation, but have never felt such crushing disappointment. I hadn't seen a new Ace Wombat game in years, and never dreamed that my childhood favourite would ever hit the PC. Back in the early 90s,  gaming was all about the three big console mascots: Super Mario, Sonic the Hedgehog and the unforgettable Ace Wombat. While Ace never quite had the broad mainstream appeal of Nintendo and Sega's icons, the adventures of the cheeky, baseball-cap wearing marsupial filled my childhood with near-limitless joy. 1993's original The Adventures of Ace Wombat redefined 16-bit platforming with its streetwise style, punishing bosses and catchy gangsta rap soundtrack. The 1995 sequel, Ace Wombat 2: Marsupial Madness, was much of the same, ableit with a superior level of polish and new multiplayer modes featuring Danny the Disco Dingo (I'm sure we all remember his awesome catchphrase: ""Can you dig it?""). 1997 brought the first shaky 3D effort: Ace Wombat vs. the Lizard of Oz. Unfairly maligned at the time for its awkward camera controls and risque tone, Ace 3D pioneered gameplay and storytelling techniques that wouldn't be adopted by the mainstream until the PS2 era. Sadly, following the lackluster commercial performance of Ace 3D, the franchise was put on hiatus for almost a decade, and only the most ardent fans held out hope for a return. However, in 2006 our prayers were finally answered with the phenomenal 4Ce Womb4t: The 4th Wall. Informed by lead designer Trip Hazard's battles with substance abuse in those dark days, The 4th Wall was a  surreal, dreamlike trip into the psyche of one of gaming's iconic figures.

												Hands down one of the most poorly designed games I have ever had the displeasure of playing. Bought it on sale thinking it might be fun to see what they've done with the Ace Combat series, and I really hope this is not a solid representation of what it has become. Story-telling feels stilted and empty. Gameplay feels scripted; I can deal with the enemies coming in waves, but I can't fathom who would have thought making an enemy ""ace pilot"" invincible unless you use the game's rail-shooter mode in order to make them seem more skilled was a good idea. Absolute waste of money.			"

												I have to say i'm rather dissapointed in this game. I remember the ace combat series being my favorite games back on console and i played it till there was nothing left to unlock, putting hundreds of hours on each game they had. I had hoped to have that happen here with the way the game looked but i can't say that i ever will. I can't blame them for trying new things, but this wasn't the way to do it. From barrel rolling helecopters that feel impossible to crash because you feel completely assisted on flights, to being in an auto lock dog fight where you're lead in combat to an area for a cinematic kill all the while you could have killed your target 15 times with the 30 missles you hit directly into him on the way to the ""scene"". Less the targets a regular green enemy youll just have to accept that you cant usually kill them until you reach that location, and if the autolock dogfight throws you directly into the ground... don't worry... it'll just bounce you off the ground like nothing happened.You're also forced to follow how things happen to the T. You're flight skill means nothing since even if you could out fly the main characters protagonist you still cant technically shoot him down or hurt him since he is suppose to beat you in the fight anyways. Thats one example. Least in some of the other ace combat  games you could shoot some of the main story enemys down and get a different reaction out of them without it changing the game other than you feeling more like a badass.People new to the series may like the game because it looks great and it does have some pretty good action and a decent story, but again... returning players will just want to avoid it and continue playing 4,5 or zero.

												First the pro arguments:+ Quite high fun factor + Good graphics + Nice plane design + Realistic cockpits - Background doesn't look THAT nice.+ Controls are quite good = I played this with the XBOX360 controller for PC, keyboard + mouse may be different in terms of smoothness+ The soundtrack.Following up the neutral arguments:= Multiplayer + Community seems to be sorta active, may be due to FTP weekend = It was laggy sometimes for me, depending on the host + Good hosts mean good fps - Bad hosts mean HORRIBLE fps. - Searching for games takes sometimes forever - Connecting to a match takes also forever.= Gunship parts in the story. They were acceptable. + EH MAH GERD IT'S THE AH-64 APACHE + WAIT IT CAN FLIP TO AVOID ROCKETS?!? + OH MY GOD LOOK AT THE MISSILES IT HAS - The gunship controls were a nuisance though. Kept shooting allies instead of increasing altitude. - Oh and the gunship suddenly turns into swiss cheese once Hinds show up. And in the end, duh, negative arguments:- Story took me 5 hours to play through. There should be some more story. - The story felt like a CoD story, only in short. And with planes. And helicopters. - The ending. I won't spoil here I just didn't like it. - The helicopter minigun parts were just... I didn't enjoy them really. More planes instead of miniguns would've been nice enough.- Is it just me or seem SP and MP map the same... (lazy map designers)- Steam achievements spoiled my story (of 5 hours but still it's about the principle!)In the end I give this game 6 out of 10 possible honey pots.Even though there are more negative arguments, I still enjoyed it. Seems like a mix of CoD and some ""realistic"" air combat. If you're into multiplayer, this game could be for you, cause the story is just... no. But be sure to have some patience cause it may take about 5 minutes until you find a match.			"

												Utter. ♥♥♥♥ing. Garbage.I tried. I really did. I really wanted to like this. Alas, I didn't even make it probably halfway through the tutorial. I knew I was in trouble when I was greeted with the ""Please do not turn off the power..."" splash right off the bat. Plenty of decent console ports, so NBD right?  ""Please press SPACE"", hmm, I guess Space is the new Enter. Wait, did I accidentally pull the mouse out of the USB port? No, one simply cannot manipulate the menu with it aside from mouse wheeling through selections. Press E to rebind? Really? R to reset to default? OK whatever, ♥♥♥♥ it they said I could use a mouse and keyboard with this game so let's see.. Aha mouse steering. There it is, good. Set to on, I'll fiddle with the rest later. Into the game I go. Twenty seconds later I'm back at the main menu. Mouse steering does absolutely nothing. At least in ""plane mode"" And maybe I'm just tired, but I SWEAR adjusting the ""mouse sensitivity"" option actually made turning with the with the arrow keys faster. Go figure. So fiddling with the rebind options I discover that you can rebind pitch and yaw to the mouse axis controls. OK, lets try that. I'll fiddle with the rest later. Two minutes later, I'm back at the main menu. I can turn left. I can turn right. Up and down? Nope. So apparently I'm going to need either A: a controller (which i refuse to use), or a flight stick (which I don't have) in order to get the most out of this. I was about to uninstall right there, but I took a breath. No, lets see if theres any entertainment value to be gleaned from this cluster ♥♥♥♥ at all. Back into the options menus. Well, lets see if we can make the game look any better. Graphics options are as bare bones as they can possilbly get away with. Worse then Borderlands 1. So hooray for ♥♥♥♥ ugly 8 bit pixelated matte painted ground textures with  tufts of green♥♥♥♥♥♥on-a-stick popping out of it to simulate a city-scape. Fine. Whatever. Let's try to get these controls configured in a way I might be quasi-comfortable with. And that is where the REAL game began. I liken it to a sliding puzzle game since you can't use a key that's already in use until you bind that control to a different key thats not in use. Fifteen minutes later the house of cards that was my control scheme was almost complete. Now to bind the mouse keys. No response. Wait, didn't I already successfully rebind these mouse keys the first time I tried it? Now its not working? Wait, did clicking the currently still unbound right mouse button just escape out of the menu? WTF?! OK deep breath. Lets just restart the program, after all the ""saving"" symbol at least appeared so maybe restarting will fix the mouse issues. Game restarted, back into the keybind options and... The whole ♥♥♥♥ing thing is reset to defaults. Game over. Uninstalled. Thank you for the free weekend Steam. At the very least it saved me from buyers remorse. ♥♥♥♥ you Namco/Bandai. Please take this pathetic cash grab port and ram it.			"

												Ace Combat Assault HorizonI loaded Ace Combat 5 into my PS2 and was blown away. Everything about that game was great. I mean, that game was perfection. I beat it on the hardest difficulty and unlocked all the secrets just because I loved the game so much.When I got ACAH it was still GFWL. Now it's not anymore but I've already beaten it at this point. Seeing as the campaign was VERY hand holdy and there wasn't much room for amazing dog fights with the DFM. DFM basically rails you onto a line and takes you through a QTE.The storyline was average. I suppose I shouldn't have expected more. AC5 was corny as well but it was a better corny. ACAH was just convoluted. They dropped the alternate reality in favor of putting it in the real world and they got rid of all the sci-fi elements in favor of... giving the main character a premonition?Also, by default you are in Casual flight mode, which I didn't realize meant that you couldn't preform rolls. Turn that off as fast as you can. It's just not right for it to even be on.			"

												I have no idea how you make high tension dogfights with incredible graphics so horribly bland, but ace Combat accomplishes this perfectly. I found myself just wanting to exit the mission that just DRAGS on but not wanting to have to relive the horribly paced dogfight circle dogfight the game forces you to do AD NAUSIUM.   Its just waves of boring cookie cutter aircraft showing up out of nowhere and attacking, no story, no face to the enemy, not even very well used setpieces.   The best part was the randm missions they throw in where I actually get to shoot something but this requires me to be out of the aircraft the entire game is built around. Not even on sale is this worth your cash.			"

												Ace Combat: Assault Horizon is probably the best arcade/flight simulator I got on PC. Although it doesn't near good enough as the Playstation 2 titles but still fun to play, the Dogfight Mode is kinda awesome although sometimes I hate it when some enemies are requiring DFM to be destroyed. I don't even mind those Modern Military Shooter-esque plot as long as it's sensible.Verdict: 8/10Recommended for those who seeks the fast-paced arcade/flight simulator and not Recommended for those who prefer the old classic AC gameplay.

Regenerating health, freaking turret sections, horrible helicopter missions. The only thing that kept me playing was looking forward to the next fighter section.

												Reviewed in Oct. 29, 2011 at...http://that-riyadh-gamer.blogspot.com/2011/10/review-ace-combat-assault-horizon.html“Make Metal Bleed” as the back cover of the game saidIf you ask me what’s my best jet fighting simulation game i’ve played in my life, that would be Ace Combat series. I played most of them since the first one on PS1. All my life, i never found another game that can par with NAMCOs’ masterpeice. After a long wait for consoles since Ace Combat 6, it’s back with agressiveness pushing away other games that tried to challenge one of NAMCOs’ pride and asset. Though did it delivered well? We shall see as i share my thoughts on the game. Presentation:“Modern Warfare in the sky”The set up is now mentioned in actual world locations, mentioning from previous trailers are Miami, African locations and many more. Surely the game won’t be complete without a storyline and now it’s been aided by a New York Times bestselling military author Jim DeFelice and shaped a story about Lt. Colonel William Bishop from the Warwolf Flight Squadron and his quest to stop a Russian terrorist named Col. Markov “Akula” who has a weapon that can blow up pretty much a city. Unlike the previous and traditional Ace’s direct mission briefing then take off segment, they added some QTE (Quick Time Event) elements for you to react while off the plane (Heavy Rain-ish) which basically pointless for me to be honest. But gladly the phasing is fast & it won’t take long till you get on a mission. It’s a new gesture from the game and also trying other weaponries and aircrafts. Let’s say aside from flying planes, one of them is you can fly an AH-64D Apache Longbow, a gunner on MH-60 Black Hawk and other planes with different functions depending on the given mission. So basically it’s a different curve but it’s still a welcomed add on.Graphics:There are no traces to disappoint the game in terms of visuals. The textures on a blown enemy aircraft is spot on, however I laughed when I saw a blown pilot wasn’t ripped to shreds as I blew his plane sky high. But I guess to avoid being flagged as a bloody game perhaps. But none the less, seeing a shattered plane gives you the sense of sweet victory after taking them down on plane after the other. Gameplay:You fly a plane & blow some stuff up, simple? Well it used to be like that but the new installment has some treats to keep you occupied for a bit by flying attack choppers, bombers and also a gunner. Though the main meat of the game is to be the Ace in the air and fly planes with different specs and specialties for each given mission. The new main element of the game is the Close-range assault “Dogfight mode”. It can be activated when you’re close enough to an enemy plane; there, the controls will turn into a semi automatic tailing enemy planes (which is a bit silly for me but it made up by taking control on a close range attack) and stick with them as long as you can till you destroy them in mid-air, that way you will feel the sense of satisfaction after each kill. However there are two kinds of control mode whereas semi auto pilot “Optimum” for those who are new in the genre (which I don’t like to use) & the “Original” mode for those who are veterans (like me) on the game that will let you fully control your plane and do as many barrel rolls as you pleased. Each plane has their own special weapons and class whether a bomber, an air-to-air or both. There are tons of planes to choose from and that will also please the fans and keep them busy searching for their favorite plan/s (where are my Su planes from the start of the game!!!). Aside from the single player, the multiplayer is back with co-op or a death match for all 16 players and plane customizations. In co-op mode, you can team up with a trusted buddy while on 16 multiplayer, first there’s Capital Conquest where each team has a group base to protect and destroy the other team’s base; there’s also Domination where you capture ground installations and lastly there’s the classic deathmatch where it’s more intense than the single player by taking down a real player to see who dominates the skies. So basically the other half of the fun lies in the multiplayer.Audio:In terms of voice acting, it’s pretty stiff which sometimes feel like the character’s movement didn’t blend well to the voice acting. I also found out that the sound quality wasn’t that epic enough for my 5.1 surround sound headset which I found that the music was louder than rest so I had to adjust the volumes. But on the brighter side, its well done in terms of explosions, weapons and epic OST which has a mixed of Rock Metal & Orchestra feel to it; plus a one of their track called “Rush” gave me Goosebumps whenever I hear the guitar solo. Overall:Ace Combat: Assault Horizon is actually a good game but not as great as Ace Combat 5 for me. The gameplay, graphics, OST are there but the storyline fell short and wasn’t as epic as I experienced in AC5s' “The Journey home” song which the game also represents “world peace” from two giant fictional country fighting earch other that almost made a world war. But none the less, this game is a welcomed from its genre; Project ACES still is untouchable and cannot be compared when it comes to making a good arcade jet fighting simulator game. So if you ask me again what’s my favorite fighting simulation game? I’d still say NAMCOs’ Ace Combat series and this will be one of them but the best of them. This will be welcomed for young aces with the help of putting a modern feel to it; and for the fan of the genre, go get it, it's worth the wait and you can't find anything better than Ace Combat.Pro(s)Intense new Dog fight systemAwesome Multiplayer Breath taking OSTUsing other air craft Faster phased air combat in the seriesCon(s)You can forget about the storylineA few missions doesn’t feel rightPointless off battle interactions at timesPointless QTEs			"

												This game is the end of the classic Ace Combat franchise we all know and love. It is so poorly executed that I deleted it from my hard drive. If you love the old AC games, avoid this like the plague. It just plain sucks. The game basically plays itself, it even flies the jets for you when you are dogfighting. No realism, no difficulty. It belongs in the arcade at a movie theater.PURE GARBAGE 1/10			"

												I am really liking Ace Combat Assault Horizon. It really is easy to learn but hard to master kind of game, I love the action and the speed of the ""dogfights"", overall I find the experiance of flying fighter jets in ACAH thuroughly enjoyable, but nevertheless there are some issues. I have found Ace Combat AH has a ton of bugs (mostly menu related, at least I have experienced a few of them, they are as follows. I crash alot when viewing the leaderbored, I crash during a certain cinematic in single player and there is a ton of wierd for me when I navigate the menus, now I dont always experience these bugs, but they are occurring frequent enough that I mention them in my review. Overall though I think Ace Combat AH EE is worth a play, It is worth the 5 dollars USD its priced at the time of this reveiw, but if you get a chance to try it free even better. You just it may so happen that you will agree with me, A.C.A.H. E.-E. is pretty cool.			"

												A very arcade-heavy game. If you like simple air-shoot-em-up-in-3D gameplay, don't need too much realism and if you're resistant to seasickness (flightsickness?) then this game is for you. All the airplanes and helicopters in the game are rather well modeled and look quite nice, explosions and other effects are mostly decent. The mission backgrounds/maps are rather well made and look quite nice from high above, even though they're not as pretty anymore when you're flying very low.Gameplay, as mentioned before, is very arcade-like. Every plane carries several hundred missiles and the machine gun has unlimited ammo. Enemies fly seemingly entirely unburdened by what few laws of physics the game has, they have no limit to their maximum speed and just about most of them do a lot of turns that would just right out kill any real pilot. Mission design is mostly limited to ""There's a group of planes there, kill them. There's another group of planes there, kill them too. There's another group of planes but they've got a bomber this time, kill the bomber first then the rest."" and so on. Enemies seem to have a limitless supply of pilots and airplanes, coming out of nowhere, the story never even remotely ventures into the areas of ""Where do they come from?"" or ""From where did they launch 120 air superiority fighters this close to Washington DC or Miami or Dubai?"".The occasional rail-shooter sequence as gunner of - OF COURSE - an M134 Vulcan mounted on a Blackhawk don't really make things better. And then there's the parts where you actually get to FLY a helicopter... --- WORST CONTROL SCHEME EVER! --- I will also mention the final bossfight. Now, I hate bossfights, I usually really do, not because I can't beat em, but I have no patience and no interest in unfair fights against entities with ridiculous scripted behaviour and massively overpowered stats that defy any logic and are usually only beatable because there's some ridiculous intentional flaw in their behavior patterns that allows the hero to win by exploiting it again and again.This bossfight, is of course no stranger to this stupid phenomenon. The final boss is invulnerable until you have completed a series of headspinning useless sequences of automatically following him while shooting useless limitless missiles and machinegun shots at him.

 This sequence tends to be extremely annoying, Akula (the boss) flys maneuvers which are impossible to follow and would with certainty kill any real pilot from G forceshe can do 180° turns on the spot at supersonic speeds (not joking). Well... the story.... uhm... what story... ah yes. The americans are the good guys and saviors of the world, and you are the greatest pilot ever along with some of your friends (which are apparently aswell). Everyone else is either completely incapable of everything and the russians are (of course) the bad guys. The story itself centers around some elaborate new form of city-buster-sized warhead which those russians have developed. It does the exact same thing as a nuke, but it can't be a nuke because that would invalidate the entire story, pretty much. (Oh the russians have nukes? That's NEWS!)Dialogues are mostly rather flat and uninteresting. Quick time events are rather pointlessly strewn through the game and don't seem to actually do much mostly. Did I mention that the russians are the badguys and the americans are the good guys? Alright, that's pretty much everything you need to know.Well, all things considered, I cannot really recommend the game. It's nice to play for a short time if you want something arcady but it wasn't too much fun to play. Worth less than 5 bucks I'd say.			"

												As a long time vetren of the Ace Combat Series, I was beyond excited to see a new Ace Combat game. That being said, let me be the first to say, please, do not waste your money. This game has neither the charm, nor the engaging storyline of the parent series. In fact, after reading the reviews before I purchased the game, I decided to investigate for myself, and I was sorely wrong. To all of those on the fence about purchasing the game, please take my advice and skip past it. 1. Camera angles are horrible because the ""kill cam"" cannot be turned off and has caused numerous mission failures for me. 2. The dogfight mode is so intertwined into the game that it is almost impossible to take down the higher level enemies without using this terrible system.3. Continuing on the dogfight system, it removes all skill from the game the parent series held. 4. Missions are so badly written and timers so badly set up, unless you do the mission absolutely perfectly, you WILL lose5. Enemies are so overpowered that you cannot even line up shots without several warnings and missiles flying right up your tailpipe, so you end up failing the mission because you spend half of it evading the idiots behind you.6. The friendly AI is beyond useless and they never do anything to help cover you. In fact, they should be removed completely.I understand this list may seem excessive, however, I have hundreds of hours in the AC series and this steaming lump of crap needs to be scraped off steam and dumped in a trash bag somewhere. I was desperate for a new AC game and was so excited when I saw this game. I wish I could get a refund because it is that bad. To all of you reading the reviews, please move on and save your money. I beg of you, dont waste your precious time because you will be just like me afterward, bitter and upset that your wallet is lighter because you bought a porrly designed game.			"

												Dogfight mode is terrible. Turned a fun arcadey flight game into tedious DOGFIGHT MODE. Nerfed regular combat in order to encourage DOGFIGHT MODE. Not to mention it's a port from console peasants so it looks like crap. Do not buy, do not get any DLC, do not install on free weekend. If you're an Ace Combat fan, this game will make you sad and angry. If you've never played an ace combat game, go back and pick literally any other AC, it'll be better than this and probably look just as good.			"

												I rarely give out negative reviews or shoot down games (aren't I clever?), but this game is unlike any other Ace Combat game (especially my beloved Ace Combat 4) in the absolute worst possible way.  A textbook no-imagination ""Call of Duty"" style story, extremely limitied flight controls and paper-thin characters you can't connect or sympathize with at all.And don't even get me started on dogfight mode.  You are forced into this horrible linear pigeonhole to complete most of the game.  It turns free flight into the dullest, flattest roller coaster ever.I'm glad I picked it up for less than $5 on sale.  It isn't even worth that.If you want to play Ace Combat, go break out the Playstation 2.  Stay far away from this title.			"

												Overall this game is outrageous,full on action gameplay.I recommend this to people who enjoy dogfighting and are interested in Airplanes(fighters).However there are some difficult missions,the stealth power has kick in ya,when it comes to close quarters combat with enemy aircraft.I would rate the game 10/10.As I said earlier it is outrageous and awesome  game to play.You need to be motivated to play the game,don't give in your hate if you continue to get killed in flight. There is certain times when you have climax moments.In conclusion this game is amazing in graphics,gameplay,teamwork.Keep on the good work Ace Combat series!			"

												Pretty meh.The plane is way too big. It takes like half the screen. It's pretty hard too see anything at all.As far as I found, there is no real tutorial either. Took me some time to understand what I was doing.And also, the multiplayer seems to be either ded or really bugged. Keeps saying ""Unable to join session"". If that is because it can't find a session to join or if it's because it's a broken feuture, I don't know.Overall, it feels kinda like War Thunder, but not as good, although this as more game modes and feels a bit more like a FPS shooter.This game gets 3/10 from me.Try it if it's free and see if you like it. Not worth buying, unless it's like 2.49 or something.			"

												                (I played through most of this game on a ps3)This addition to the ace combat series is not as good as the originals but i still found enjoyment in it. Certainly was a bit different with the added (and not too fitting to the series) dogfight mode while in combat, and the missions where you take control of the machine gun on the side of a chopper weren't that enjoyable (honestly really annoying) But I still recccomend this because I do find it to be fun(Ace Combat 7 coming later this year!

It does the exact same thing as a nuke, but it can't be a nuke because that would invalidate the entire story, pretty much. (Oh the russians have nukes? That's NEWS!)Dialogues are mostly rather flat and uninteresting. Quick time events are rather pointlessly strewn through the game and don't seem to actually do much mostly. Did I mention that the russians are the badguys and the americans are the good guys? Alright, that's pretty much everything you need to know.Well, all things considered, I cannot really recommend the game. It's nice to play for a short time if you want something arcady but it wasn't too much fun to play. Worth less than 5 bucks I'd say.			"

												I must say I really enjoyed this game. Well most of it. The story and cut scenes were really long and boring, so half way through I just started skipping them. This is a very arcady flying game. The dog fight mode is cool because it adds more excitement to these types of games. The variety of missions was great. Sometimes it's fun to just sit on a gun and drop guys. A few things I didn't like. When you blew up the last of a group, it would cut outside your vehicle and show the explosion up close. It was neat a few times, but then it started happening too often. Also when you are on the gun in the bomber, it's really jarring. Missions were really long. I probably would have prefered a more smaller missions. The game also tries to automatically flip you upright. I found myself fighting that part of the controls. That feature was useful once you just let it happen. Overall it was a good experince. I didn't try the multiplayer, I've got too many other games to try. If you are looking for more of a flight sim, this isn't the game for you. But if you are up for a fun gameplay experience, give it a shot!			"

												I'm sure you've read on forums that a bad Ace Combat is still better than most other games. Well, it's true. Nothing screams entitlement more than expecting a 9/10, getting a 7/10 and treating it worse than Bad Rats.""But strangereal and DFM ruined the series!"" No, they've insulted the integrity of Resident Evil, Silent Hill, Hitman and Splinter Cell series. This? This was what we used to call, way back in my day, ""fun."" If you don't like fist-bump QTEs or flying through that one hotel in Dubai whose name I keep forgetting, maybe you don't like fun.""But I play crazy explosions-everywhere games all the time and that's not what Ace Combat is supposed to be about!"" Ok, developer/designer on the Project Aces team, is it really the title of the game that bothers you? That's ok, just pretend this game is HAWX: Sky Ops.""But Dogfight Mode is stupid and I keep getting dragged into the crowd by enemies (because the screen didn't tell me to  avoid danger like I'm sure it does in actual war)."" Congrats, you're the guy who can't play Ace Combat: Assault Horizon. That's honestly not the game's problem.""...I'm just mad that we should've gotten a ""real"" Ace Combat game, you know?"" I know, Tim or Matt or Chad, I know. I'm still waiting for Suikoden VI.			"

												Really, I do not see the problem with this game.First of all, the controls are just fine and the controller support is no issue, if you have issues, try lowering your sensivity.The reverse up-down is easily fixed trough controls in the menu. And most important, this is something fresh, something exciting.You who keep within the Strangereal games don't know it's true potential until you lose your mind of there, and go in this game with a fresh mind.This game can be hard at times, sure, but not frustratingly hard, hell, wouldn't be fun otherwise, eh? Either way, this is a good game, if you Strangereal freaks don't agree, open your minds for a moment and think! This is still Ace Combat, merely in a different outfit.And that's everything I have to tell.			"

												It is a shame that a game with such nice graphics has such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameplaye, menu organization, and options. Wikipedia says the game is criticized for being too scripted. That is being super kind to the game! It is so frustrating to play this game and feeling the game is controlling your every movement and is constantly cheating to show you some cut scenes. This game also lacks a free flight mode. DON'T buy this game. You will be frustrated. Also, no DLC, and no online gameplay. There is virtually no one ever playing this game online. As for menu organization, why can't a player reduce the music volume in multiplayer mode without exiting the multiplayer mode? What kind of air combat game does not provide a check box for mouse inversion?! This game seems like the result of obvious mismanagement of the dev team. You can clearly see the talent of the development team is there. BTW, missions are too ****ing long!			"

												It's♥♥♥♥♥♥Do not buy this game, even if it's deeply discounted. Pretty much everything about is an absolute cluster♥♥♥♥. The 'innovative' gameplay features seem like they were specifically designed to disempower the player; you'll be groaning every time an enemy flight lead shows up because you'll know you have to engage in the godawful dogfight mode, flying around in a nauseating chase sequence while your target implausibly and frustratingly soaks up missile after missile. And that's far from the only problem with the game. Especially horrible is the way the game frequently decides to ♥♥♥♥ with you by messing with the camera.Oddly the tacked on Call of Duty-ish elements, namely the helicopter doorgunner and AC-130 fire support missions were the most fun I got out of the game (the attack helicopter ones however are pretty awful). Although I have to say the doorgunner mission at the start of the game is extremely disturbing; it's essentially a war crimes simulation. No, the throwaway line about it being a UN santioned operation and the area being a 'free-fire zone' doesn't excuse it. Anyone who has ever read in-depth about about the Vietnam War knows what utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t a free-fire designation is.On the plus side there's some very nice music (a franchise staple) and the graphics engine is genuinely impressive and versatile, delivering good up-close visuals of humans and other on-the-ground elements in addition to the usual aircraft fare. Which only makes it more of a shame that they decided to waste the effort and budget on this crappy real world Tom Clancy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t narrative, instead of giving us what everyone actually wants, which is a true Strangereal Ace Combat 7.The narrative deserves special attention because of how downright ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and Russophobic it is. I understand why Russia keeps showing up over and over again as villains in these types of stories; it's the only vaguely credible threat to the American Empire left on the planet, aside from China which is too important a trade partner to risk villifying. But generally there's at least an attempt at nuance. Here's the entire message of Assault Horizon: Russians are backstabbing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, all of them. Except the token 'good' Russian, who is a nice subservient pet to our glorious American protaganists. No, just kidding, he's also a backstabbing traitorous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, he was only pretending to be good. That's literally it. The villains entire motivation is that American bombing accidentally killed his waifu in Bosnia. I'm not even kidding or oversimplifying, that is literally it. Compare this to something like Call of Duty 4 (let's try and forget the sequels...) which still had shades of Russophobia but at least bothered to divide them into 'good' and 'bad' Russians via a civil war plotline. In that game the chief antagonist Imran Zakhaev actually had a fairly credible motivation, though it wasn't given much attention. The line he gives in the games intro about Russian leaders prostituting their populations to the West and destroying their cultures and economies is 100% factual. The historical reality is that in the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union Russia was set to make the transition to a Scandanavian-style Social Democracy, because, whatever Americans may think, most Russians genuinely liked many aspects of the USSR, like socialized medicine and education. At which point the West, spearheaded by financial institutions like Goldman Sachs, stepped in and said 'no, what you really want is rampant privitization'. Yeltsin said 'okay', and the country was utterly exploited. A new aristrocracy of oligarchs rose to power, controlling most of the wealth and resources, and around 10 million people prematurely died, many simply drinking themselves to death in despair. Given that reality, the idea of a guy wanting to nuke the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of America isn't hard to believe.Similarly Khaled Al-Asad and his generic Middle-Eastern 'separatists' have genuine grievences, though they're inevitably portrayed as genocidal monsters. Especially in light of the real-world Arab Spring where it became painfully obvious just how despised by their populations the US-backed dictatorships of the region were. Oh but don't worry, that annoying 'democracy' thing didn't last long in Egypt at any rate, and the US is backing a new military dictatorship. Compare both those motivations to 'bombs killed my girlfriend'. Yeah...tl;dr go play Vector Thrust, and/or resume grinding through sorties in Ace Combat Infinity. This game is♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

The chase mode should be an option to kill, not THE option.  I can't help but echo some of the reviews below me, the story is bland, the characters are uninspired.

												If you've played any of the eariler Ace Combats such as IV, V, or Zero, this will be a major dissapointement.  Realism is nonexistant.  You don't have complete control of your aircraft while engaging in a dogfight, which is a major disappointment, especially when performing ""special"" maneuvers.The cutscenes are definitely something out of a Sunday evening soap opera.  Everything they say would never be said by anyone and their actions to match situations are plain embarrasing.  There's not even a decent selection of aircraft to pilot.Graphics are exceptional, but it doesn't make up for the awfulness of this game.  Looks like I'll be pulling the old PS2 out to play some classic Ace Combat!  For those of you die-hard A.C. fans, buy it during a good sale.3.2/10			"

												The worst game in the franchise by far.TL;DR: to summarize: Unsalvageable music and story, horrible and long non-jet missions that play like completely different games even though you bought Ace Combat to play Ace Combat, and the only good part of the game (the jet flying) is mediocre to just about okay. I bought this game for 3 bucks and I still feel ripped off.Stay away. Play the classics (even Infinite, which isn't good, is much better than this) and wait for Ace Combat 7.FULL IMPRESSIONS:The story is completely nonsensical. I'm more than halfway through and I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing, who I'm fighting, why I'm fighting or even who I am and who I fight for!The only actually memorable music is the one that plays in the intro mission. It's absolutely fantastic, even, but then the game immediately drops the ball. I can't remember liking (or even remember, period) a single tune beyond the opening stage.The helicopter, door gunner and AC-130 missions play like something straight out of Call of Duty. Totally unbearable and play nothing like Ace Combat (which, y'know, is the game I want to play if I buy a game called Ace Combat). You'll force yourself to get through them just so you can go back to actually playing Ace Combat. They simply shouldn't have been there at all: Their problem is not that they are done wrong, it's that they couldn't have been done right. They're the equivalent of having a first person shooter segment in your racing simulator.When you get to the actual jet flying, the game is actually pretty decent. It's still the worst Ace Combat has ever been, but even then it's still okay. I could see myself finishing and even mildly enjoying this title if it had nothing but jet missions. By far the worst part of the flying is the infamous DFM (Dogfight Mode, sometimes referred to as the more crass equivalent of ""Dogpoop Mode""). Basically, it locks your view onto an enemy fighter and puts your general flight trajectory on-rails so that you are always flying behind the other pilot. You can still move the jet, but only a little bit so that you can aim the guns and have a fragile illusion of control.It would't be so bad if it was optional, but ace pilots (marked as TGT_LEAD on your screen) dodge everything like madmen and are sometimes straight-up invincible to gunfire and deploy infinite flares when chased by homing missiles, literally forcing you to use DFM. But even with those enemies that do not technically require using DFM, some of them still dodge like absolute gods even on the normal difficulty. It's just very obvious that they designed the game around DFM itself, and that's a huge blemish on the gameplay.			"

												Ugh..  I was really enjoying the missions involving jet planes with my flight stick.  But then this attack helicopter mission started and it and sucked all the fun out of the game.  Awkward controls.  Shame I'll never see the rest of this game because I can't pass this swampy belly-button of a mission.  Nor do I want to try any further.Fortunately I got this from a Humble Bundle so it didn't cost much.			"

												Honestly i don't see why fans of the older Ace Combat games Hate this one so much, It has amazing Graphics a Kick♥♥♥♥♥soundtrack and around 40 planes to Fly into combat.  The DFM mode makes multiplayer possible, Instaid of akward long matches with people Effortlessly avoiding all of your rockets DFM makes your enemy EAT your rockets!,  It does have some problems though, The campain is pretty much Russia Bad, Murica Good! and none of the charecters are really that memorable. All in all this is a Great Arcade sim.			"

												This game was recently patched to remove the GFWL which is good.  However the game is still contains gamebreaking bugs.  At first when I got this I couldnt even start the game using a controller the menu would just infinitely scroll.  While I may expect that using a third party controller this is a standard everyday no frills wireless 360 controller.  Before the patch I couldnt start the game.  With the patch I can start the game and the jet parts with fights work well.  Anything with a helicopter it seems are broken and the triggers dont work for some reason.  I dont know if it will be patched now its been years for them to make the menu work so I could launch the game and maybe in a few years the helicopter part will work, who knows.  The jet flying for aerial combat is pretty strange, enemy planes tend to fly in circles right around you or right behind you for some reason.  There is an odd mechanic where if a plane is behind you, you can QTE by pressing LB + RB and you flip behind the plane somehow and you blow them up.  This is odd because in the game this maneuver cant be performed as in you cant do a flip in your plane.  So yea its real basic and I guess half the game works if its split between jet fights and helicopter fights since the helicopter fights dont work with a controller.  There is also no horizon control meaning if you turn right you turn right, and there is no way to keep the plane level or adjust this making this just a terrible flying game in general since even the basic ability of being able to play is it messed up so badly.The game uses a VATS shooting thing like from fallout but in this game its called DFM for DogFight Mode.  Its a zoomed in battle making it like an FPS in the air.  A strange choice for an aerial combat game and doesnt really feel like it belongs and isnt very fun.  The concept should be fly a plane and blow up stuff, not change to FPS mode to do it, it just doesnt make any sense.Still broken, but the jets controls work now, so its half a game.Rating:  0/10  Value:  $0.00			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.   Let's see...how to begin this.  I love the Ace Combat series.  So much that I have some sort of stockholm syndrome and ignore the normal cheesy 'writers do no research on war' storylines.   First, unless this game is ~$5, DO NOT BUY IT. Period.  Your steam code will not activate GFWL.  That means no multiplayer.   Half the game gone like that.  There is no solution.  Steam will direct you to GFWL and GFWL will direct you to Steam, any further comments will be auto-ignored. Seriously, read the discussion boards.    The highlight of this game was ""Written by americans who professionally write tom clancy style novels"".  Not only does this not fix the writing problem previously stated, but it's more painful because its set in the real world.  The writers obviously did not google ""NATO relations with Russia"".  Real world makes it worse if you know anything about history.  Let's move on to the game.  Plenty to talk about DogFightMode.  You can see the good idea behind it, except that it forces you to use it.  It forces you because half the enemies are immune to damage unless you DFM them.   Camera angles are jacked up.  The camera does not stick behind you like all 7 previous games and when doing maneuvers will face the ground making sure you have no idea where you are guiding yourself exactly.      Speaking of controls, they put a flight game on the PC and gave it no flightstick support.  The xbox AC games have support....and a special flightstick made for it.  WTF.  BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THE GAME : PACING.  Cutscenes are fine and help develop stories, but do I need to be forced to walk through hallways in buildings for 5 minutes only allowed to turn my head and looks a people with no interaction?  It does not help except to give me time to get a beer from the fridge.  In game too, many missions including the helo/gunner missions just drag on...sometimes for 40 minutes.  There is no skill in these modes, but it just wont stop.  I want to pass it to get to the next jetfighter mission, so I just rubber band the trigger (hint: you cant die and you have infinite ammo).  The helo mission don't even fit into the story flow and little reason is given.  It is direct jealousy of the Call Of Battlefield franchises. Just like how the R6 games failed starting with R6V2.  The last part I will comment about is the skill.  There is no thrill anymore because missiles are near infinite, life of you and the enemies regenerate fairly quickly, and you can survive from hitting the ground and other fixed objects.   Final thoughts:  TORTURE.  You can clearly see the AC game and fun you could be having with this, but everything seems to be set up to make it as annoying as possbile all while demeaning you.  Especially with achievements.  ""You passed the tutorial"" ""you pressed 'Y' when we told you""  ""You watched a cutscene"" ""You hit objects with an infinite chaingun"".  Good for you.			"

												Really didn't like the direction that this version of Ace Combat took. It departs from the previous games and turns dog fighting with jets into a series of QTE's. Yeah ok.. I still wanted to play and then the helicopter level happened. It totally sucks. The game sucked so bad I let this game take HD space for over a year. I guess I kept wishing that I would come back to it and forgive it's manys flaws. My fond memories of earlier versions of Ace Combat wasn't enough to overcome the suck. The suck is strong in this one my friends and as such it was uninstalled forever.This is not the ACE COMBAT you are looking for "

												Free is too expensive.But in case you need more convincing, let me tell you what's what. Ace Combat is not - and never has been - a flight sim. It's a long-running franchise hailing from Japan, eminently focused on high-speed arcade action. It has always had very, very little at all to do with reality, save the inclusion of detailed plane models based mostly on real-life military fighters and bombers.As a flight-sim enthusiast, some would consider it a crime for me to admit that I really do enjoy arcade flight games. They're a great fallback for those times when you want to splash some bogies, but you don't have the time or the inclination to go full-real (or even semi-real, honestly). I've played Ace Combat games for years, since I was a kid, and it was probably Ace Combat among other games that helped foster my later interest in more authentic fare. I started with Ace Combat 2: Electrosphere on the original Playstation, and let me tell you: the title of that game says it all. Ace Combat has a track record of featuring crazy, wonky, way-out-there fantasy elements, up to and including the absurdly massive flying superweapons that are a genuine staple of the franchise.Ace Combat was never about being serious. It was about flying around a surprisingly well-modeled, realistic-looking plane incongruously stuffed with 200-plus anti-everything missiles, and blowing things up with reckless abandon. This and Armored Core was where it was at back in the day, and it was a glorious time to grow up in.Now, AC4 tried to shake things up a bit by introducing a ""relatable"" ""story"" with ""characters"" and such. And it's fairly poor. Thankfully, it doesn't detract from gameplay too much, as the background chatter is easy to tune out, but if examined at length...oh boy. The writing was chunky and oftentimes silly, and the low-grade-anime-quality voice actors delivering the lines made for a very embarrassing experience.""Yeah, we won! Now let's sing our dramatically overwrought national anthem as the camera pans dramatically around our planes! YEAH!""But AC5 didn't improve its horrible dialog and hand-wringingly bad voice acting. In fact, it made it *worse,* as ""story"" became an increasing focus. And then AC6? Oh my and dear me. Just go YouTube the intro, or look up ""dance with the angels - "" actually, no. Don't do that. You'll die of embarrassment. Actually, you should, because the sheer temple-drilling horribleness of that dialogue atrocity is actually important to this review.For years, the core gameplay never really changed between sequels. It was all about going from one target to the next, getting a lock-on, and then double-tapping the missile button to launch precisely two missiles, and flying off to the next enemy. It's fun, for a while, but without any real evolution going on in the background, franchise fatigue was inevitable.So what did they change? Is this game ""Call of Duty with wings,"" as so many reviews claim? Ha, well, the answer is that they changed everything, while actually changing nothing. Let me explain in brief.The ""innovations"" consist of one central new ""feature:"" Dog-Fight Mode. That's right. ""Mode."" As in, one of the core aspects of air combat is now a ""mode."" There's also a differently-named variant for ground attacks, but it's the exact same concept: press a combination of two buttons, and you lock into a more or less on-rails scripted sequence where you keep your target or targets centered while your missiles lock on.I don't even really mind the system in theory. Really, they HAD to do something to change things up, because even as a long-time AC fan, I was getting bored of the one-button double-tap missile fest the game had stubbornly been for years.  What they were trying to achieve with DFM was to add some depth to air battles, make them more dependent on timing and reading movements. It actually plays much better in practice than it sounds going by my description of it. But here's the problem: occasionally, the game uses DFM as an excuse to pretty much put you through an on-rails theme-park ride that's scripted to the end. Don't balk too much - after all, Grand Theft Auto has been doing the exact same thing for years with every single one of its ""dramatic car chases,"" and it's a million seller. But let's be honest - it still sucks.DFM is actually okay on its own. It's got flaws, but the core idea is sound. It takes all the concepts of energy and g-forces and simplifies the crap out of them so as not to burden the core arcade experience with excessive realism, giving the occasional dog-fight a fraction of the intensity and strategy of the real thing. The enemy suddenly peels left, so you have to slow and follow to keep from losing him. He dives and burns, so you have to throttle up to keep pace. A lot of scripting is required, sure, and all of these maneuvers do constitute a sort of timing mini-game in all honesty, but still, the nature of the game's AI would ordinarily prevent exciting dog-fights from actually taking place to begin with. So in that regard, it's nice to have a sort-of-dog-fight experience every once in a while.The problem is when DFM triggers a heavily-scripted setpiece, as mentioned above. It tends to happen at least twice per mission, and you have little to no actual control over the events. Your subject plane becomes temporarily immune to all damage until a sufficiently exciting number of explosions occur within your relative field of view, and the setpiece is over.It's fun the first time, sure, but if you eat a missile (or two, or three) and die, and one of those setpieces occurs after your last checkpoint, be prepared for your next DFM attempt to trigger the exact same pseudo-cutscene again. It will do so the next time you die, too. And the next time.Thankfully, most enemies can be defeated the old-school double-tap way, but you're still avoiding an entire facet of the gameplay. It sucks because these scripted moments, when they do occur, detract from the good the devs achieved, and all but ruin the feature completely. Regular DFM battles are just fine.The ground attacks, though, are boiled crap. They force you on a linear path, often against ALL COMMON SENSE, and it becomes a game of struggling with the lock toggle to send your missiles to the right target. It's just plain horrible, and unlike DFM, it's straight-up forced on you. Do it, or mail your fission, 'cause it's game over.The devs know all about the importance of cushioning a bad landing. In case their grand gameplay experiment failed, they needed a scapegoat to blame for the negative reviews. And so: thematic shift! They hired a half-decent American writer to pen an actually coherent script, applied some color-grading to the post, and for the first time placed the game's events in the real world. So of course the new ""direction of the plot"" was the game's real failing. Oh, yeah, definitely. Don't worry, fans. We'll never do that again, we promise.Sadly, this nonsense seemed to have worked. Most people hate the game because it's ""too American,"" while claiming that the prior games' plots were so good, that they moved them to tears. ""Dance with the angels."" Search it. I'll save space in the review. Anyway, it's not the fault of the ill thought-out gameplay mechanics - it's because they Americanized it. Yeah, that's it. Certainly it, no question.Anyway, in summary - I just can't recommend it. It's broken, it's frustrating. At one point, a dozen planes spawn right behind you when the game expects you take out a boatload of ground targets in less than two minutes. Another has you struggling to shoot down an ICBM whose exhaust causes unavoidable damage. Sucks if you get THAT checkpoint while already critically damaged...like *I* did. Time to restart a 30 minute mission!...or not. Save yourself the trouble, and save yourself the scratch. This game needs to go dance with the angels.			"

												This is my first and only experience with the Ace Combat series.  Many reviewers here who are fans of the series often argue that the changes made to the gameplay have deprived the game of any sense of challenge and thus made the experience extremely boring.  I'm inclined to agree with that statement.  The real perpetrator in regard to dumbing down the gameplay is the new ""Dogfight mode.""  Whenever you get close enough to an enemy fighter, you can trigger a mode where the camera zooms in on your opponent and the game glues your jet to his rear.  At this point, the game practically plays itself for you.  In Dogfight mode, staying behind your opponent requires pretty much no skill at all.  Your fighter is basically placed on a set of rails in DF mode, and there's really no sense of accomplishment when you do take down your foe, because, as said before, there's practically no skill involved.   This might not be so bad, if the campaign did not force you to make use of this mode at certain points.On that subject, the campaign itself is equally bland.  Most of the time you will be  in your fighter engaging in the rather dull air-to-air combat, broken periodically by the chance to fly an attack helicopter or control the targeting computer of an AC gunship or some other gimic.  To the game's credit, I enjoyed some of these set pieces.  Manning the door gun of a helicopter was good fun, and I thoroughly enjoyed the AC gunship section of the game.  Basically, any part of the game that wasn't marred by the flawed movement and dogfighting was pretty enjoyable.  Unfortunately, air-to-air dogfighting comprises the vast majority of the game.  Periodically, you will be required to line up your aircraft to do strafing runs against ground targets, but the joy that could have been had with that is also ruined due to the mandatory use of a ""ground attack mode"" that places your jet on a set of rails, again depriving every last iota of challenge or fun.  The one enjoyable aspect that applies to all parts of the campaign is that periodically when you destroy an enemy, the camera will zoom in on your kill, showing off the ensuing fire, explosions and wreckage in all its destructive glory.  These bits were always pretty impressive to watch.  The story is pretty uninspired; something to do with a civil war in Russia and some ultranationalist group.  It's completely forgetable.On a final note, if you are interested in giving this game a shot, I strongly recommend that you use a controller, as this game does not suit itself well to a mouse.  While AC: AH offers some terrific visuals, the game is held back by some terrible gameplay mechanics, and at the end of the day, a polished turd is still just a turd.			"

												Terrible game, If you want to play this game to play it on console not through steam. Huge issues with launching it through steam and having to manually go into program files to install crap which is un acceptable. The game crashes all the time for no reason which is very annoying. You have to connect to a Microsoft windows life account which is fine I have one but it always says I have the wrong product key when this is the original game i bought FROM steam. This is a common issue a lot of people run into. I played the demo on the xbox 360 back when I had one it was cool. This game is not like the original ace combat series of games which were and still are AMAZING in my book with game play and story line. Just be warned and wary of what you get into before you buy this game. It works for some people and plays fine. But a lot of people it does not. The risk and headache is up to you.			"

												I have to say this is one weird game. Keep in mind this opinion comes from a total noob in regards to flight simulator genre, Ace Combat, and any games with planes in it. The first time I ""seriously"" play a flight game was H.A.W.X. on Xbox 360, and I ended up cockpit first into a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ground texture. So yeah, I suck at this kind of games.Things that kind of stick out to me is how the game having ""look over there!""-cutscenes. I don't know about the other Ace Combats, but having told what to do/see via a cutscene always annoys me. You have UI, target designators, stay with it! There are also non-mandatory ones, triggered by a button press when it comes on screen, which I guess you could ignore but I always pressed it anyway.And you also get treated with ocassional slow motion scenes when you destroy a target. I honestly doesn't find it to be a bad thing (and make for a nice footage, if you're into video editing) but it does break the flow of the combat, somewhat.But the mechanics that actually feels like, ""they're kinda watering down the genre, aren't they"" is the DFM, or Dogfight Mode, system. Basically when you are locked on on an enemy, you can activate some sort of an ""automatic enemy chasing"" mode. All you have to worry about is maintaning speed so your enemy doesn't get out of range or being to close to them and being countered by their own DFM (which obviously make that enemy auto-chase your plane.)Although relying too much on DFM could be fatal since limited maneuver means you can't dodge incoming misilles, as the loading screen usually tell you.It's not exactly a bad system, but it does make the flight techniques less... elaborate, for a lack of a better word, especially since the game itself made the use of the system to be mandatory at times. At one point, I even had to restart a very short segment of the game for at least five times because I was out of the DFM too soon and getting a Mission Failed screen, even if the target is already destroyed. You could also argue that the helicopter missions also break the game, but I found it to be an alright distraction from all the plane crashes.All in all, I don't really recommend this game for big fans of flight genres. It feels too ""arcade-y"" and the gimmick system could prove to be an annoyance at times. Unless you don't care about any of that and just want to do some dogfights. Or doing dogfights with (or against) friends. Or you're just THAT desperate to see more of the 765 idols in video games. Like me. (WARNING FOR LIKE-MINDED PEOPLE: Only six idols are featured as skins in the game!) "

												I didn't expect much from this game but it still managed to disappoint me utterly. I don't even know where to start. The gameplay is horrible. You basically have 3 ways of destroying the opponent and none of them is fulfilling in the long run. You either press B (on an XBOX controller) to shoot a rocket when the square mark on your opponent turns red and hope it hits. It usually doesn't so then you enter the dogfight mode. This means pressing RB+LB which puts you just right behind your opponent and then you again have to wait for a circle mark to become red and press B to fire missiles. Sometimes when you're in the dogfight mode a script activates and you can see a cam shot of your opponent exploding, which gets boring really fast. The last way to kill an opponent is to do a turn around on him when he tries to rocket you from behind. In that instance you wait for two arrows to cover each other and- guess what- press RB+LB to appear behind the enemy in the dogfight mode again. The whole game is basically a big, repetetive, boring QTE event.Flying itself is really disappointing. It feels nothing like a plane and every plane model flies exactly the same, despite different stats. The controls are unprecise. Also, I have to mention the camera work- it's just atrocious. The FOV is way too low which makes you see nothing apart from your own machine and after some time spent in the dogfight mode I started feeling dizzy. You can also fly helicopters- don't get too pumped, though. It comes down to pressing LT when your crosshair is set on a land target and then pressing RT to shoot it- the end. It also induces the most camera problems- cockpit view is the only way to play (it's an opposite story with planes- the cockpit view is utterly useless).The story is forgettable (blah blah Russians blah blah betrayal blah blah Murica). Initially I wanted to praise the soundtrack but it becomes repetetive fairly quickly, especially that it plays one chosen track during each mission and hearing it over and over again during missions that can last over 30 minutes makes you sick pretty fast. I'd also like to mention this game features the worst French accent in the history of gaming but it's not a big deal- the voice acting is decent overall.I'm also under impression that the game tries to artificially prolong your gametime, usually by excessive time pressure, at least in higher levels of difficulty. Unfortunately, I didn't really enjoy this game for more than initial 30 minutes- and I've raged through my playtime all the way. It's cheap but I wouldn't recommend buying it. Heck, I wouldn't even recommend playing it for free.If you're looking for a pleasant, semi-challenging game featuring planes (including jets) try War Thunder. It's free and it doesn't try to be something it shouldn't be.			"

												I am just going to go ahead and say it: This game is pure sex.By that I mean that most of the combat invovles pressing the right button at the right time and not making any sudden moves. As shallow as this is, it is intense. It is full of quick-time events and cinematics of destroying targets with insane amounts of fire power. One can also have fun customizing the paint job and load out of your favorite aircraft and flying your favorite mission.All that said, this is not a game for simulator enthusiists. The control is unrealistic and if you can't **** yourself that there is a chance that getting hit with a salvo of missles could kill you, then you will likely get bored. If you're not into flying jets or giant explosions, this game is not for you.Also, I personally love the power metal-esque sound track.			"

												Bought this at a discount, so I don't feel too bad. However, this is not a game like HAWX or similar. Very limited airplane control (no barrel rolls possible for example). It's more a point-and-shoot QTE game than a flight/combat sim.controls are messy, weapons damage is unrealistic, and like I said, flight control is limited to the point of being really weird. Looks great, but flies horrible. Wouldn't recommend.			"

												Pure arcade, not really good for you if you are used to play simulators. People often told me that Ace Combat is better than Tom Clancy's HAWX; now I can see that it is not exactly true. Viewing a fighter cockpit from the inside is not enough to make people's feelings authentic or at least close to such. The unability to control your aircraft completely is especially annoying: it simply doesn't let you move as you want to, and it automatically returns to horizontal flight if you stop pressing the movement keys. As a result, you feel clumsy against those super agile enemies, who move so swiftly and easily as if they were flying dishes of some remote sci-tech alien civilization.At the same time, the game is rather spectacular, it is intense, and it offers some lengthy and difficult missions. Graphics is good, storyline is... engaging. An interesting alternative to HAWX. A combination of the two would have made a perfect game.			"

												Let me just say I'm glad I got this game for $6 on the humble bundle. There's unfortunately a lot of flaws with assualt horizon. Let's start with the story it's bland and generic with truely awful voice acting and I usually skipped all the cutscenes because they are just so boring. The pacing is not so good and it's all over the place during the gameplay and the story. The turrent sections are by far the worst part about Ace Combat AH as not only do the sections drag on for far too long but this doesn't belong in an ace combat game at all. What's worse is the helicopters controls are just awful and it results in a lot of cheap deaths. Thankfully the rest of the game including the fighter stuff and the dogfights are just awesome and extremely enjoyable. The number of skins for your plane are insane and there's a good reason to go back and earn them. The flying is exteremly good and is very high odrelen and I love that the debree can fly in your face which is awesome and I wish more flight games did this. Outside of that there are a few things I would like to mention. The PC port itself is good, the controls for both flightsticks and controllers are really good however the game sucks with a keyboard as it's almost unplayable. The graphics and the options are also good I'm glad the game runs above 60FPS and it looks quite good despite being a PC port. I'm happy to say that as of 2015 the game does not have GFWL anymore so If you were worried about this being in there then fear not it's been removed and replaced with steamworks. The music on the other hand is just terrible and Ace Combat games usually have an awesome soundtrack but AH is just terrible and not a single track stuck in my head.So overall would I reccommend AH, for me if you can get past the awful turrets sections and the forgettable story then I think this would good flight game for you to pick up on the cheap. At $20 it's not worth but if you're looking for a good flight game with a lot of high impact moments then assualt horizon is a good choice.			"

												First of all, if you are an veteran in Ace Combat, forget everything you know about this game before judging. This game, like the developers said, is a test for new systems such as the DFM. Although we have seen that DFM did not work as great as they expected, it was a good try to add more content into the Ace Combat series. For the ones that just picked this game up and know nothing about Ace Combat, it is important to note that this game itself is quite satisfying. The DFM may be boring and repetitive in the single player, but it is the most thrilling part in the multiplayer. However, there aren't many players in the multiplayer, so try to stick to capital domination and deathmatch or bring a friend to join you in the air.Overall, AC:AH is a great game in itself. Although it does not fit to the traditional Ace Combat series, it is important to note that this game was a testbed for new ideas, and it has served its purpose well.			"

												All is 8/10 because this game presents a new mid-air combat.I give 5/10 for the story because you have to control the aircraft then switch to control the helicopter. Some missions for single mode still confusing me. The story is too wide for the game.9/10 for the graphic. All of design is awesome. The most fighter aircrafts look so real.

												I do not like a mouse/keyboard setup for any flying game. However the game should have options for it that actually work. This game has options for it but they do not work. There are instructions on the steam forum on how to manually edit your configuration file to get them to work. You shouldnt have to do that. I found with my joystick Saitek X52 the controls were sketchy at best and required a lot of fine tuning just to get a manable plane. Requested a refund. Would not reccomend this game and that is sad as I love the Ace Combat series.			"

I don't care if its for realism or whatever, when a player cannot see his targets because the game itself and I cannot change the settings on said fuction on the game it becames aggravating and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.

												TERRIBLE FOR AN ACE COMBATE GAME DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! UNLESS YOU HAVE NEVER PLAYED ACE COMBAT, AND LIKE TRAINS GO AHEAD.but incase you have no idea how a dogfight takes place, this one  puts you on the shreck train to ♥♥♥♥ you if you think you can kill this guy in anyother way ( i.e long range missiles) because the devs want to put cinimatics spooging over your face like a particullar cirlce of 18 years old who havent seen a women hoo hoo in 3 years. the rail combat is that terrible you might as well play janes advanced strike fighter. at least your not forced into a railway only to arrive at dissapointment station platform 1f off. controling the planes isnt great I found it juttery so having to fiddel arround with the settings i finnaly found a free movment rather than it snapping back to wonder land.I did find that the graphics where ok and the sound quality, how ever the one rotten egg in the room ruined it all for me and it quickly killed off wanting to progress further in the game......AND TO THINK I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS GAME, SO DEVS TAKE THE TRAIN RIDE OFF AND LET US DOGE FIGHT HOWEVER WE LIKE!!!

												Let me just say I'm glad I got this game for $6 on the humble bundle. There's unfortunately a lot of flaws with assualt horizon. Let's start with the story it's bland and generic with truely awful voice acting and I usually skipped all the cutscenes because they are just so boring. The pacing is not so good and it's all over the place during the gameplay and the story. The turrent sections are by far the worst part about Ace Combat AH as not only do the sections drag on for far too long but this doesn't belong in an ace combat game at all. What's worse is the helicopters controls are just awful and it results in a lot of cheap deaths. Thankfully the rest of the game including the fighter stuff and the dogfights are just awesome and extremely enjoyable. The number of skins for your plane are insane and there's a good reason to go back and earn them. The flying is exteremly good and is very high odrelen and I love that the debree can fly in your face which is awesome and I wish more flight games did this. Outside of that there are a few things I would like to mention. The PC port itself is good, the controls for both flightsticks and controllers are really good however the game sucks with a keyboard as it's almost unplayable. The graphics and the options are also good I'm glad the game runs above 60FPS and it looks quite good despite being a PC port. I'm happy to say that as of 2015 the game does not have GFWL anymore so If you were worried about this being in there then fear not it's been removed and replaced with steamworks. The music on the other hand is just terrible and Ace Combat games usually have an awesome soundtrack but AH is just terrible and not a single track stuck in my head.So overall would I reccommend AH, for me if you can get past the awful turrets sections and the forgettable story then I think this would good flight game for you to pick up on the cheap. At $20 it's not worth but if you're looking for a good flight game with a lot of high impact moments then assualt horizon is a good choice.			"

												A good air ""Modern Warfare"" version game. (Note: I play this game using keyboard & mouse, if you use controller/stick, your opinion/review MAY be different)Pro : -DFM/ASM are really helpfull if you NOT play this game with a controller/stick (For aircraft)-DLCs are included (CFA-44, ASF-X, F-4, and color scheme for other planes and helicopters)-Customable color for all planes/choppers (Including the DLCs)-A lot unlockables (Not mention the DLCs, aircrafts, and choppers, though)-Unboring mission/campaignCons :-Play this game with ""Original"" control type for aircrfat, it little bit hard if you NOT use controller/stick, especially when use ASM/DFM. While ""Optium"" is grant more ""advantage"" to DFM/ASM, it's make original feeling of previous Ace Combat is fading-Customable color name can't be changed-Skills making more easier for me (But, its helpfull when play on Hard or Ace difficulty)-(For myself) Lack of the ""Legendary"" Aircraft form previous AC's series (Ex: ADF-01 FALKEN, ADFX-01/02 MORGAN)Overall, it's a good game to me. Bring me to memories when i play previous Ace Combat series, altough lack of Falken and Morgan, though10.5 of 10 "

												First of all, if you are an veteran in Ace Combat, forget everything you know about this game before judging. This game, like the developers said, is a test for new systems such as the DFM. Although we have seen that DFM did not work as great as they expected, it was a good try to add more content into the Ace Combat series. For the ones that just picked this game up and know nothing about Ace Combat, it is important to note that this game itself is quite satisfying. The DFM may be boring and repetitive in the single player, but it is the most thrilling part in the multiplayer. However, there aren't many players in the multiplayer, so try to stick to capital domination and deathmatch or bring a friend to join you in the air.Overall, AC:AH is a great game in itself. Although it does not fit to the traditional Ace Combat series, it is important to note that this game was a testbed for new ideas, and it has served its purpose well.			"

												Just by the name alone, if you ask any of the long time fans, they'll tell you what they think at the drop of a hat. Having played through the campaign fully, I can see just why this game was made. The article I read prior to playing the game comparing it to a certain hyper-popular first-person shooter cemented my opinion in stone already. One part of me wants to like this game, but the other part screams at it in disgust.Ace Combat Assault horizon is a frank departure from the series established bizzaro earth in which it takes place in the more familiar setting of our world. It seeks to establish a cast of loveable characters from the outset with plenty of dialogue inbetween missions. While the game certainly stands on its own as a certifyable Ace combat game, it definitely has the feel most fans of the series have come to expect, but has a flawed core that sours the experience.From the core, it tends to lean to hard on its own gimmicks to draw in new players, and it shows in the gameplay, the addition of Dog-fight Mode is a sort of,""On Rails"" mode to help new players take on enemies. its an easier to control help-to-kill method, and concurrently show off the much touted,""Aircraft Gore"" as defeated planes spiral and tumble helplessly with much unnecessary amounts of oil, flames, and debris splattering on the screen, and an unskippable dramatic camera to show you your kill in gruesome detail as it suspends you from play. Counter DFM, is a feature called,""ASM"" which is initiated in the same way as DFM is. ASM allows you to turn on your persuer and take THEM in DFM.As a whole, the usual Ace combat control scheme is bogged down by this new control addition and a step back from the tight controls many have come to expect from the series. the timing required to pull off the ASM is far more strict and leaves  you more vulnerable than outmanuvering your opponent and mashes itself in your way, and many of the mission components require you to use this DFM to complete some objectives properly. Many of the games enemies seem to have been made with this mode in mind as they all zoom and boost impossibly out of your reach if you decide to engage them in any other form of combat other than DFM, I saw this mostly on the ""required"" targets and seemed to me as a way to railroad the player into using it at expense of artificially lengthening the game time.Moving on.From its mission structure to its characters, it tries real hard to make Ace combat fit within the confines of the modern game while still leaving a bit of salt from the previous games to flavor it. In the end, AC:AH Feels short, shallow, and unmemorable, nevermind the technical issues that mar it.the choice to cast the title in the current modern world left the game with a bland pastel of identity to draw upon let alone the suspension of disbelief to hold, the characters have no origin, we know nothing of why the characters have the motivations they do, they cast off the primary reason for conflict and instead leave a revenge plot with no plausability for its existence.The story for me wrapped up in 8 hours, accounting for deaths and failures due to awkward DFM controls along the way. To draw some comparisons between this and one of the previous titles, some of the titles had branching mission structures, and depending on how you play, or what you do, the story unfolds in a different way, giving some area of control and feeling of detail. The mission structure of AC:AH is linear, the missions are short and there isn't any replayability in them as most missions are roughly 5 or so minutes long.(they can drag on because the game wants you to rely on DFM) The details of each mission are traditional for the Ace Combat library, in fact, as far as to say, they don't use any of the more interesting mission structures that the previous titles have. It goes to highlight the limited scope the modern world presents from a reality standpoint. From what I gather from this game, it was made with multiplayer in mind, (Singleplayer is just one long tutorial) and I'm sure it does it acceptably, but doesn't warrant me trying as coming away from the singleplayer, left me a lot more sour than sweet.As a fan of the series, I'm dissapointed that Project Aces had to push out a title that was more than likely a cash grab to monopolize on the current trend of modern military shooters, not of their own volition, but by their parent company.The good I gather from the game is, that I hope any form of success has made Bandai-Namco think strongly about porting previous Ace combat titles, and developing future numbered games to the PC as a viable platform. This review isn't supposed to be to complex or properly formatted or well worded. but it does get across a number of gripes I have with the game, and goes to highlight what happens when game companies try to,""Follow the leader"" instead of doing their own thing or doing something new.TL;DR: As a fan of the series, steer clear (but I'm sure I don't need to tell you that), but if you're someone who wants an arcade-y flight game to kill some time online. look no further.

They basically wanted a share of the Call of Duty bro crowd and made the game as such, making it complete crap.  The set pieces aren't fun and neither is the dogfighting.			"

												Pure arcade, not really good for you if you are used to play simulators. People often told me that Ace Combat is better than Tom Clancy's HAWX; now I can see that it is not exactly true. Viewing a fighter cockpit from the inside is not enough to make people's feelings authentic or at least close to such. The unability to control your aircraft completely is especially annoying: it simply doesn't let you move as you want to, and it automatically returns to horizontal flight if you stop pressing the movement keys. As a result, you feel clumsy against those super agile enemies, who move so swiftly and easily as if they were flying dishes of some remote sci-tech alien civilization.At the same time, the game is rather spectacular, it is intense, and it offers some lengthy and difficult missions. Graphics is good, storyline is... engaging. An interesting alternative to HAWX. A combination of the two would have made a perfect game.			"

Meaning, you can try to shoot down as many planes as you want using the old ways of manual flight. Try... The game is so bent on wanting you to like this new mechanic that it makes it nearly impossible to hit anything unless you slap on the training wheels, especially the higher ranking pilots. Many of these ace pilots can be shot for days with missiles, bullets, doesn't matter. You can't actually damage them at all unless you turn on DFM and surrender control to a pre-determined flight path. The worst thing you can do in a game is to make the player feel like a spectator, and  watching this cutscene  playing this game will do that to you. "

												The Ace Combat series was for a long time my favorite series in the genre of Jet combat, and in many cases its the only series in the flight genre that has tried to find a nice balance between gameplay and realism. Ever since I first picked up and played Ace Combat 4 on the playstation 2 I have always been a fan of what ever project aces has done even though most of the titles in the playstion 2 and even 3 were very similar and really didn't bring anything new to the table, the past Ace Series titles and always gotten the most important platormer basics down. Fun combat, decent story telling, and a large variety of weapons, paint jobs, and fighters to trade missles with. While air to ground combat was never impressive, this never was the center of attention for fans of the series such as myself. Fun intense dogfights should always be the main focus in a series that has always been about jet on jet combat.Ace Combat Assault Horizon is clearly an attempt by Namco and Project Aces to mix things up a bit and try to add and improve on the genre and for that goal in mind I applaud them for attempting to bring something new and fun to a genre that has not seen any real changes to gameplay other than improved graphics. The introduction of Helicopters, and gunships and the new dogfight mechanics were very intresting ideas, and since we have been in the middle of the summer video game drought I figured I would give this title a spin for nastagia's sake and see if the new game features were as fun as the trailers looked.While I like the idea of the Dogfight mode and while it even looks pretty, the controls seem odd, clunky and poorly designed. Graphically stunning but it felt like it was to scripted at times and not natural. Helicopters were a huge disappointment. The machincs are almost outright broken and while it isn't always fair to compare titles I was hoping for gameplay closer to the feel of the Battlefield series of games. Overall I want to like this game but its cluncky controls prevent me from being able to recommend the title.			"

Yeah, it's nothing like those, so, that takes away all the playability. It has a new feature called Dogfight mode (DFM for short), and fans don't really like it. Me neither. Also, there are pointless turret segments. ""Break away the monotony..."" some say, but really, this game is about plane dogfight, not stupid turret segments. There is a nice amount of planes to fly, and even helicopters. HELICOPTERS. Sounds bad already, but, guess what? It's because it is. But, they have alot of skins to pick, including hentai skins (Vomit inducing hentai skins). But, alot of missions and nice variety. It's not the worst game ever, but, it's still awful.5.5/10 (Disapproved)			"

												I actually really like the franchise and I give them credit for making 5, 6 & 7 have different play styles rather than letting it go stale like, say, CoD.I don't like the close range chases, I don't like how after the cam focuses on the kill and spawns you in a location near it. I would prefer holding the B or O button and watch it when I want to.Pros :Good variety*, bombing, AC-130, helicopter beside the usual dogfight.Action packed, Micheal Bay would be proud. Good PC port.Free paint jobs.Great vehicle models, choices and planes talk the language of the country they were made in. ^Attention to detail.Cons :Gets stale fast after you play your favorite missions a few times which there are not enough of compared to 31 or so of AC5.Story and narrative is meh compared to 5 or 6 having some layers besides ""I'm mad at this guy, I gotta stop him"", no real depth. ""Boss"" fights were a let down. Chasing a missile, ICBM and a dogfight. The on-rail dogfights is not something I would like to see in the future, won't blame them for trying something new or differnt though.No Pre-game map showing some ground/air targets, I brought bombs to a dogfight here.Little replay value, compare to 5 which you have to play at least 2 times just to get the secret plane or 6 where once you get the CFA, you just want to keep coming back to it and just destroy everything in your path.No Fuel Air bomb, not even on the A-10, I miss dropping mini nukes :(.Would gladly buy 5&6 if they were available.What I'd like in the future :Abilities of 6 (friendly/enemy electronic support on the map).Narrative of 5 (letting us make choices on what we say midflight makes me care more about wingmen).Gameplay of 5&6 (chasing dogfight is better than a dogfight on rails going from target to target. Having the ability to command wimgmen is welcomed).Variety* of 7.Cutscene interactions of 7 but with more depth would be appriciated maybe make it have impact or consequence.Difficulty of 5&6, Planes less agressive unless in a swarm, larger numbers and easier to kill with dmg that doesn't heal (AC6 ""WMD"" mission) unless I go land and come back to the battlefield. Please don't force me to on-rail dogfight every time just because it makes it easier.Soundtrack of 5&6 (I still have both the OST's and love em).Smacking into the ground should be instakill on any difficulty. Bumping into a plane since its softer, is a good idea though.Bosses of 5&6, This game took itself too seriously and ended up not being as fun. I love the Aigion and Megalith, needs more of that.On the bombing mission, it's the only time to go on a bombing run, I would rather not be OP and actually put in effort into bombing ground, which needs more targets on every mission.A bomber with 99 flares going on approach for a corridor of death is cool, a plane with 6 flares VS a destroyer wrecking you that you can't even shoot missiles at is sad.

												Right...So after 6 hours(im going to say 2 were for getting shot down or crashing and resetting.) I am going to vote this down.  Its not an Ace Combat game.  It should not be called that.  It should be called...ANYTHING ELSE!  This is how you kill a series!Now to get into the reasons.The DFM...Intrusive and quite possable the worst addition to the game.  More then once, Ive gone into a dive chasing a target, killed him only to have the camera follow the missle, follow the wreck and by the time it got back to me, im in the ground.  Its terrable.Enemies that somehow have unlimited flairs with no cooldown....Way to force us to follow it until its story relevent.  Terrable!There were a few missions where I had to restart from a checkpoint due to the game jumping ahead.  Target being out of range yet i could make out the words painted on the side of the hull...What the hell is that!The cheesy dialog...Both in the air and on the ground.  I found myself not identifying with the characters and even less with that guy who I was suspose to be.Autorepairing Plane....Whos screwed up idea was this?  Who thought this was even slightly a good idea!  This comes in a close second to why this game is just terrable!What was with that ending?  The crowed looked like they were an afterthought with no detail at all...this is minor but still...I could keep going, but kicking a dead horse and all that...There are some pros.For the most part, the game isnt boring.  It has its moments of frustration and the several ""Hell yeah"" moments but they are few and far inbetween.The planes are detailed enoughGot to fly a Stealth Bomber.  That was kinda badass....One of the games highlights.The chopper missions were a nice change and there wernt many of them to dilute the rest of the game.Thats all I got...  There wernt enough positives to make this game even close to worth 33$...  I got it on sale for peanuts and thats really all its worth.  Otherwise its negative.			"

												This game is basically arcade-flight game. I prefer simulators more, those where you can actually feel wind beneath your wings and enjoy thrills of aircombat to the maximum. There really ain't that much control over your plane here, it's bit like sitting in a flying sledge full of stones and shooting missiles like some b-a Santa from hell. So if you're seeking for simulator consider something else.  But if you're ok with nice graphics, nice action and don't expect anything else for you money - well, that's actually what you will get. I liked it even though I felt disappointed. With proper flying model this game would be really good, now it's only ok.			"

												I'm a very big fan of air simulators, arcade or not, but i can't recommend this game.The graphics are ok, the story is your usual ""bad russian dude, good americans"" but everything else is just ... gah, even for someone used with doing tedious things.Your allies are just useless, the controls are terrible with kb (maybe with a controller or joystick are better) and the ""boss"" battles are just♥♥♥♥♥♥ The designers really dropped the ball here and created the ultimate CoD air sim, all the dfm scenes seem to be on rails and everything you do is just waste time until you hit the hidden trigger to deactivate the boss's god mode and be able to shoot him down.As a closing note, i really hope the 7th game will be more in the spirit of the old console versions and not another cod with planes.ps: i got this game for 1$ from humblebundle and i'm happy that the other 2 games were better than this horse dung on rails.

												dont get this game! (hopeing you read this before you buy it) reason:lots of bugs/glitches theese make the game unplayable such as the second mission where the minigun on the heli is forceing itself into the bottom right of the screen you cant controll when it shoots ( it alaways shoots you cant stop it) also in the mision where you control a heli its alaways zoomed in and once again automatically firing and you cant turn around to the left or right your locked to moving forward and going up and down. but the jet gameplay is amazing i love it the issue being you only get 1 jet level before you get to use a bugged heli (this is all assuming you are playing with a gamepad/xbox360 or ps3 controller) and dont even try to play with keyboard and mouse because you cant its just impossible unless your really dedicated ps. i tried doing it with the keyboard and mouse and th bugs/glitches are still there ps.s.for some reason this only happens for some people wich is really wierd so if you want to try your luck and waste some of your money on it be my guest this is just a warning so you wont be all♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off and angry at the company if you do get a ♥♥♥♥ed up copy ps.s.s.again there are fixes for a few of the glitches online but not all of them.

Posted: July 26, 2014
												A subpar entry in a series of great games.A few things you need to understand before buying/trying this game:Ace Combat is not a flight simAce Combat is not meant to be realisticAce Combat is primarily a console gameFirst off, the only graphics option is resolution, and that maxes out a 1440p. Even so, the game looks fairly nice, aside from the annoying static cockpit reflection in cockpit view. The story is a wannabe Tom Clancy USA vs. Russia, which is particularly annoying considering the previous games were set in a very interesting alternate universe with fake countries that are allusions to real life counterparts. Sure, the prewvious stories were corny, but you could get really into them. The story in Assault Horizon is both difficult to get into and corny. Another issue in this entry is limited plane selection according to the mission. The game has a fairly large selection of planes, but it's wasted potential since you can only use a few each mission.The music is composed by the same guy who was doing it since 04/5, so it is superb as usual. However, in this entry, the music is different from others in regards to their style.My biggest issue with this game is that they wanted to attract new fans by making the game Call of Duty style with more emphasis on on-the-rails action than the freeforming fun of previous games.I recommend all the other games in the series before this one, but Assault Horizon is still a decent arcade air combat game.However, as an Ace Combat game, Assault Horizon fails in many aspects.I recommend every previous entry other than this one.Also, make sure you have a joystick/controller, as it is near unplayable otherwise, especially online.

Well, it isn't.The dogfights in the game are nothing more than quick-time events. The gameplay in this garbage has NOTHING to do with past Ace Combat titles.This is was dumbed down version of Ace Combat. It's like an Ace Combat for the modern gamers and gaming journalists, in other words, it's a game made to please idiots with no skills that only want to look are pretty explosions on screen while thinking they are hardcore because they are playing a game with no color and angry military characters.If you have a 3DS, go buy Assault Horizon there... The 3DS version is actually an awesome remake of Ace Combat 2.			"

 I gave it a shot	The game is an air combat simulator with never before seen so in-your-face combat. The game itself looks ok to the most part when not looking into detail. The cutscenes are fairly funny since i've never seen a guy moan that much aswell as the great voice acting and character models. you can see they really tried but it really didn't work out. Of course it's not about the cutscenes but the gameplay and the base of the game looks ok, But it doesn't work out. when compairing to other flight simulators like war thunder or even gta V is it fairly boring and a bit of ♥♥♥♥♥♥. The mechanics are really simple and a bit chaotic. the tailing function is not very interesting. The fact that you fly around with 20 teammates against 30 enemy fighters and still have to do it all by yourself is ruining the experience. Of course this is a somewhat arcade kinda flight simulator but its still not very good. a bit of a bummer.			"

												The only Ace Combat game to be properly released on PC and it is the worst game in the series.It ♥♥♥♥♥ on the old games by adding real world locations, helicopter missions, giving the faceless pilot not only a face but also a voice which happens to be a stereotypical American white guy.The planes are still as good as ever, I can say that with absolute certainty. The F22/A Raptor makes a glorious return and looks and feels amazing. The overall quality in graphics is nice, a definiate improvement over the 2D textures that the older PS2 games had.Oh here we go, the helicopter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. This is by far the biggest problem in the game. They are boring and lobrious. Helicopters are slow, awkward to control and don't feel as satisfying when you control them. Like when you shoot another plane down in a plane, it's fast moving, you have skill in that. In a helicopter, you move so slow and aim so easily it is a joke. They are filler missions which pad the game more than they should.There are other benefits though, mid-level check points. A long overdue feature. Nothing more annoying than playing Whiskey Corridor only to die about 1 minute from the end because you get rekted by an AA gun you neglected to see. Dog Fight Mode (DFM) was an interesting concept as well, but felt poorly integrated. A few times after exited that mode because I downed the enemy I crashed into a wall/floor because of the exiting angle. Enemies in this mode also seem to take about 50x more missiles to take out, which makes no sense at all. Also, planes now bleed all over your screen when you kill them.Music in this game is also pretty lame in comprassion to the others. Megalith Agnus Dei, Zero both classic music from the games. Even Sea of Chaos from AC Unsung War is memoriable. I can't even name one track from this game.The game is only not recommended because I am a ♥♥♥♥ing AC fan and it shocks me this was released.ALSO DEAD MULTIPLAYER.TL;DRWould I recommend this game? To a new player, yes. Someone who has no idea of the past games it will be okay to play if you like flight sims. Buy it on sale though. It isn't worth the £10 they want to charge. It goes on sale for like £2.50 sometimes. Still a rip off, but a bit better.For a classic AC player? No. This game ♥♥♥♥♥ on the game series you love.			"

												This is merely just a spin-off Ace Combat with some elements featured such as Close Range Assault (DFM and ASM) that mostly obligatory thus kinda ruins the freedom of the dogfight, aircraft usage restrictions on several missions, and the lack of the emphasized drama appeared on past titles (most of those featured superb anime-styled storylines that distinguish Ace Combat from most of other combat flight series ) makes it very detached from the entire series. The good thing about this that it has good graphics, sounds, and still fun gameplay even though some features mentioned above kinda ruins it. The flight dynamics are good for the game of this genre. It also has a fair amount of playable aircrafts to choose. Since I've played most of Ace Combat games in the series before, I found this one kinda disappointing if compared to the other titles in the series, but still enjoyable. Still, I personally think it's a good thing there's an Ace Combat game on PC officially (although the spin-off one) remembering there haven't been any Ace Combat games on PC officially before. Maybe someday there'll be another Ace Combat game on PC that will remain faithful to its Strangereal saga.In general, I'd still recommend this to those who enjoy arcade combat flight genre in general. But if you're an avid Ace Combat fan who trully miss and wants the iconic Strangereal elements in terms of story, atmosphere, and gameplay-feels from AC1,2,3,04,5,Zero, X, and 6, then maybe this game isn't for you.

												This is as simple as a review as it gets...This game took the air combat out of ace combat and turned it into a shallow quicktime event.  This is the worst ace combat in the entire series.  The missions are dull and lifeless.  It feels like a quick time generator.  Its  a video game designed in a board room full of people who want more ""Call of Duty"" in every game.  Pass on this one.Final Grade: C			"

												Ace Combat AHEE is a fast action air combat game. The controls on the control pad feels great. The music and sounds are fantastic. The chatter during mission make the game exciting. Story is simple and predictable. Graphic are decent. I have not played other AC games recently, I can't compare it to previous installments. It might had been more fun if you could only activate DFM (Dogfight Mode) against TGT_LEAD planes and when you have a plane trailing you. I had a blast playing Ace Combat. It felt like an arcade game. I completed the game around 8 hours. I recommend this game when its under 20 bucks for people who are looking for a fast action arcade roller coaster shooter.			"

												I'm a very big fan of air simulators, arcade or not, but i can't recommend this game.The graphics are ok, the story is your usual ""bad russian dude, good americans"" but everything else is just ... gah, even for someone used with doing tedious things.Your allies are just useless, the controls are terrible with kb (maybe with a controller or joystick are better) and the ""boss"" battles are just♥♥♥♥♥♥ The designers really dropped the ball here and created the ultimate CoD air sim, all the dfm scenes seem to be on rails and everything you do is just waste time until you hit the hidden trigger to deactivate the boss's god mode and be able to shoot him down.As a closing note, i really hope the 7th game will be more in the spirit of the old console versions and not another cod with planes.ps: i got this game for 1$ from humblebundle and i'm happy that the other 2 games were better than this horse dung on rails.

 I gave it a shot	The game is an air combat simulator with never before seen so in-your-face combat. The game itself looks ok to the most part when not looking into detail. The cutscenes are fairly funny since i've never seen a guy moan that much aswell as the great voice acting and character models. you can see they really tried but it really didn't work out. Of course it's not about the cutscenes but the gameplay and the base of the game looks ok, But it doesn't work out. when compairing to other flight simulators like war thunder or even gta V is it fairly boring and a bit of ♥♥♥♥♥♥. The mechanics are really simple and a bit chaotic. the tailing function is not very interesting. The fact that you fly around with 20 teammates against 30 enemy fighters and still have to do it all by yourself is ruining the experience. Of course this is a somewhat arcade kinda flight simulator but its still not very good. a bit of a bummer.			"

												I wouldn't recommend this game if you are a hardcore Ace Combat fans. The gameplay is somewhat different from the usual Ace Combat series. The control have so much assist, even if you used the original mode and turn off all assist, it still have Dog Fight Mode and Air Strike Mode which is an automatic version of dogfight and air strike, all you have to do is fire a missile. I've played Ace Combat Assault Horizon on my Xbox 360 for many hours, and still kinda have a love-hate relationship with it.I like the little details they put in the game, like the missile warning, it featured a different language and voices depend on your aircraft like French, Swedish, English or Russian. The HUD is so minimalistic and didn't feature a damage percentage. If you have taken a damage, just fly around until your aircraft is recovered. It also featured a skin editor, so you can edit your aircraft color schemes and even your missiles smoke.If you want this game just wait until it's on discount. It does features all DLCs from the consoles version, although they remove the Tornado in the PC version because of license issue. You can also fly a helicopter and do a barrel roll with it to evade a missile, and there's one mission that let you play as a gun operator on AC-130, not so much Ace Combat.I only recommended it because you can take photos of your favorite aircraft using the Replay feature and screenshot it in action. And I got it from HumbleBundle for $1.			"

												Oh man I so wanted to like this game, and I bought it thinking the negative reviews must surely be too harsh. Well, I tried, and sadly the game just wants to be hated. The first few air combat missions were fun, the new mechanics got a little tedious but all in all it was exhilerating. Until I got to the first helicopter mission, which just went on and on, and then required me to precision snipe around a friendly target while overpowered enemy helos tore me to shreds. The first few tries I kept killing the friendly, and then 8 tries later I gave up. It wasn't fun, it's not what Ace Combat is about and I want my $5 back.			"

												Not only ""No"", but dear god NOOOOOOO!!!!Okay, let me save you.. Yes. Yes... it REALLY IS THAT BAD. I had to find out for myself, even after reading all the reviews. If you have ever enjoyed any of the previous Ace Combat titles (I have... every one, since the original Playstation..) THIS TITLE OFFICIALLY KILLED ALL THAT WAS GOOD. It gave it a graphics facelift, then put it all on rails. Spare yourself, and remember AC fondly with whatever your last game was. Why? Just WHY!!?? In case you're still thinking about it, here's more. For a PC title, I would expect these to be a given.. they are not: AWFUL peripheral/joystick support, no TrackIR... Trust me, I tried desperately to find some redeeming value in this title.. I thought, ""Well, if it's awful, maybe being able to use my peripheral w/ Ace Combat (childhood dream come true!) would make it worth it."" Forget it. This game should be burned at the stake. P.S. Folks... Medal of Honor did a better job (much better really) with an Apache.. and that's SAD!Do yourself a favor, pretend Ace Combat died peacefully in it's sleep with the previous title. If you're looking for just some fun arcade-themed aerial shenanigans, I don't know what to tell you. If you're looking for excellent graphics, realism, and peripheral support... it's time to come over to DCS. Cheers!			"

												I owned AC6 on Xbox 360 and had a great time with that game. Unfortunately, AC:AH feels like a terrible port of a mediocre AC game.The fun jet fighter elements of this game are obscured by frustrating and boring helicopter missions and extremely clunky controls (and I'm playing with a Xbox 360 controller). I was expecting at least 90% of the missions to be in a fighter jet. 2 of the first ~4 missions are in a helecopter.That said, I did enjoy some parts of the game. Dogfight Mode (DFM) is a fun aspect of flight missions where your perspective is soft-locked onto your nearby target, and you have to maneuver your camera to get a quick missile hit. It's like a mini-game within the mission. This adds to the intensity of the game.I bought the game because I was desperate for an AC experience, but this has been a major let down. Fortunately I got it for super cheap from humble bundle. Otherwise, I would be really upset.This game is NOT worth full retail price. If you're reallllly desperate for a jet fighter game and this has a deep discount (<$5), it's probably worth it. Otherwise, try to find some other jet games.			"

												If you are going to buy this game, you should first find out if it suits you. I bought it, because this fast paced over-the-top immersive action was very appealing to me from all those gameplays. Am I happy with the purchase? Hell yeah, because this game rocks and makes a lot of fun. I usually don't play flying games, but I always loved airplanes and so on. It was the main reason why I loved San Andreas so much, to be honest. All those negative reviews are fans of the original Ace Combat games and I understand that their points, after watching some gameplays of older games. But to be honest? Even by the packagin, the backcover and all the screenshot you clearly see that this is not your typical flying-sim. I was watching reviews before buying and I am really statisfied. The game looks, except those mushy ground textures, really good and all those effects are neat. Especially the camera changes from normal gameplay into dog mode...everything is really fluid and has a nice feel. I really recommend this game to anybody who wants to have fun shooting down other jets. If you are a fan though, you should probably pass. This game only gets hate because of not being like the old ones, so don't worry about the quality of the product it self. There are surely a few mission where I was just cringeing e.g. those chopper missions. Just why, damnit!? Anyway - very fun game for only a few bucks, when it's on sale. You definetly should try this one.			"

												A seriously terrible game. Ignoring the trite, jingoistic, racist narrative: the gameplay consists of on-rails segments that are heavily scripted; there are only a few missions for each type of aircraft (bomber/fighter/heli); in-mission enemy aircraft do not fly into the area--they spawn out of nothing right beside you; there's very little SP content--once you finish the campaign, that's it. No reason to re-play missions, no free flight option, no way to set up your own dogfights, etc., etc.Extremely terrible game.And to cap it all off, there's no way to exit the game in-mission (and these tedious Call-of-Duty-inspired mission can be upwards of 40 minutes long) so to escape this putrid rubbish you have to alt+tab out to close the program, or manually cut the process.

												The Ace Combat series was for a long time my favorite series in the genre of Jet combat, and in many cases its the only series in the flight genre that has tried to find a nice balance between gameplay and realism. Ever since I first picked up and played Ace Combat 4 on the playstation 2 I have always been a fan of what ever project aces has done even though most of the titles in the playstion 2 and even 3 were very similar and really didn't bring anything new to the table, the past Ace Series titles and always gotten the most important platormer basics down. Fun combat, decent story telling, and a large variety of weapons, paint jobs, and fighters to trade missles with. While air to ground combat was never impressive, this never was the center of attention for fans of the series such as myself. Fun intense dogfights should always be the main focus in a series that has always been about jet on jet combat.Ace Combat Assault Horizon is clearly an attempt by Namco and Project Aces to mix things up a bit and try to add and improve on the genre and for that goal in mind I applaud them for attempting to bring something new and fun to a genre that has not seen any real changes to gameplay other than improved graphics. The introduction of Helicopters, and gunships and the new dogfight mechanics were very intresting ideas, and since we have been in the middle of the summer video game drought I figured I would give this title a spin for nastagia's sake and see if the new game features were as fun as the trailers looked.While I like the idea of the Dogfight mode and while it even looks pretty, the controls seem odd, clunky and poorly designed. Graphically stunning but it felt like it was to scripted at times and not natural. Helicopters were a huge disappointment. The machincs are almost outright broken and while it isn't always fair to compare titles I was hoping for gameplay closer to the feel of the Battlefield series of games. Overall I want to like this game but its cluncky controls prevent me from being able to recommend the title.			"

												First of all, the biggest complaint about quicktime events is true. There is an overwhelming amount of them, however still few enough for you to get a feeling for the great beautifly designed graphics and gameplay.Unfortunately, if you are getting this game for multiplayer, you are wasting your time. It is dead, nobody plays it anymore.			"

												This game is an unfortunate case.If you're a PC-exclusive gamer, this is likely the closest you will ever get to experiencing Ace Combat. The problem is, this isn't Ace Combat. It's Call of Duty where you control a plane instead of a burly white dude. It even has turret sections and an AC-130 mission.If you don't have access to a Playstation 2, then maybe pick it up. The dogfighting in this game isn't terrible, but the pacing is constantly broken up by QTE's and the so-called ""dogfight mode"", which essentially takes all flight control away from the player and engages ""WICKED AWESOME CINEMATIC CAMERA"" mode.If you do have a Playstation 2 however, do yourself a favour and pick up Ace Combat 4, 5 and Zero off of Amazon or something, play a proper Ace Combat game and hope to the holy Christ of gaming that Ace Combat 7 gets a PC port.

												I owned AC6 on Xbox 360 and had a great time with that game. Unfortunately, AC:AH feels like a terrible port of a mediocre AC game.The fun jet fighter elements of this game are obscured by frustrating and boring helicopter missions and extremely clunky controls (and I'm playing with a Xbox 360 controller). I was expecting at least 90% of the missions to be in a fighter jet. 2 of the first ~4 missions are in a helecopter.That said, I did enjoy some parts of the game. Dogfight Mode (DFM) is a fun aspect of flight missions where your perspective is soft-locked onto your nearby target, and you have to maneuver your camera to get a quick missile hit. It's like a mini-game within the mission. This adds to the intensity of the game.I bought the game because I was desperate for an AC experience, but this has been a major let down. Fortunately I got it for super cheap from humble bundle. Otherwise, I would be really upset.This game is NOT worth full retail price. If you're reallllly desperate for a jet fighter game and this has a deep discount (<$5), it's probably worth it. Otherwise, try to find some other jet games.			"

												TLDR: Bad PC port, don't buy.Game can't handle a HOTAS, especially not in combination with foot pedals.It could easily be fixed with settings for deadzones, as most games have, this game however does not. Ends up with you having constant inputs all over the place, good luck trying to change your settings when the menus keeps scrolling because you have imputs from all over the place.Also, the game won't let you barrel roll on the standard settings, you need to go into settings, controls and change from their default setting ""optimum"" to the setting ""original"" to even be able to roll your plane all the way around. Took a while to figure out.			"

												So, here I am, at the end of the game so I can finally write a review. I still haven't beaten it, but i'll get to that in a second. I love the Ace Combat games. I played many of the other Ace Combat games and this one remains fairly true to the series. I don't care much for the helicopter scenes, but the AC-130 and B2 missions are pretty cool. The graphics are fine and the gameplay itself is good.....overall.So, why a negative review? Because of DFM, dog fighting mode. The concept itself is a neat idea, but it doesn't work in reality. But is something like that really worth a negative review?Spoiler*****Yes, god yes, it is so worth a negative review. At the end of the game you must fight a boss who is invincible. Not invincible hard, LITERALLY invincible. Missles LITTERALLY appear out of thin air and start flying at you in AND out of DFM while you try to shoot the boss down. It's a timed event and it's stupid. I don't know how many times I have repeated the final mission just to try and kill the final boss, but I end up dying just before the end of my timed invincible boss event. I'm giving it a negative review solely because of this right here. This moment is one of the most frustrating in gaming I have ever played and I don't know that I will ever have the patience to beat the final boss.			"

												A few notes before we begin. This game is truly and sadly unplayable without a controller or joystick. A mouse and keyboard simply won't grant you any enjoyment. Furthermore, I'd make this review neutral but since I did have fun and the co-op is great and story decent I'll give it an upvote to compensate for the negatives without much sense.For the rest of it, can be summarized by the fact that it's ""lesser"" in everything. The previous games had masterful soundtrack, this one has a good one but it's still inferior. The very same applies to gameplay which is far more casual and can be applied to everything besides graphics essentially.Nonetheless, on steam I highly doubt you’ll find a more enjoyable game when out there looking for some fun without actually needing flying skills. Casual is key here.. Assuming you fork up a controller - which kinda defeats the purpose of PC gaming in the first place.			"

												I am highly disapointed by this game. I played 2 other games of the Ace Comat series (Shattered Skies, Squadron Leader), but this doesnt feel like a Ace Combat game.The game basically consists of Quick-Time-Events, which is boring and annoying. You cant fly like you want to.pro:- grafics looks nice (as far as i am concerned with it, the ground still looks a bit ugly for an ""enhanced"" version)- combat (has it's moments, but still not what i expected)- combat diversity (you can choose between different planes and helicopters)- works fine with a xbox360-controllercontra:- story (for a war game, mostly the story is dull, but in the previous ace combat series, the story was quite nice and beatiful narated)- subtitel font (the font looks stupid, who came up with this one? i dont like it, it doesnt fit well)- radio sound (i miss the good old ""fox1, fox1"" or ""nothing but air, hands up"", yes sometimes he says it, but often there is nothing but silence or♥♥♥♥♥♥chatter- Quick-Time-Events (there are to many, you cant avoid them, you have to use the Dogfight-Modus to get some targets, and this is annoying, because you just push the button combination annnnnd it's done)- helicopter controlls (they are stupid, and make no sense to me, but if you figured it out, you will come to the conclusion that you nearly dont need to steer the helicopter, just use the autoaiming system and it will be soon over)- there is one mission where you cant change the camera, i prefer to fly form the cockpit-view it wont let me change itOverall: If you are a fan of the series, dont buy this game, or buy it when it's cheap like very cheap.

												It's nothing like the other previous titles, not even close. I would rather have played fires of liberation if I still had my 360. The game has a  boring, no feeling of accomplishment story with heavily scripted battle system. The dog fight systems is sometimes disorienting  and in some levels it needs to be done in order to advance. You will sometimes fire lots of missles on an enemy plane hitting it multiple times and it would still be up. So will be stuck in some cases why is that plane not going down. I wish they would have added a solo wing fight instead of this dog fight system. The AC-130 and Apache missions felt call of dutyish and added nothing exciting to the game. Throughout the whole game I only wanted to see if I could spot Kei in the background. Buy it not out of curiousity for flight sims or if you're a fan of the series. Only buy it if you stole money from a friend who betrayed you. Then after giving them the game as a gift showing what you wasted their money on.			"

												Flight sim fan here and don't recommend this game. Horrible controls. I played the game with my good old MS Sidewinder joystick. The problem is that the plane seems to have an auto-level mode so you don't have the full range of motion vertically and horizontally. Especially vertically. You can only dive by pushing the stick forward but you can't really roll the plane and then dive upwards down or sidewards. Thus it's very unintuitive to follow targets. Due to the ""broken"" controls it's just not fun and is getting a thumbs down from me.Note: Your mileage may vary if you have a console controller and are used to this very limited kind of flight mode.

												Not much like the Ace Combat I know and love from Playstation and Playstation 2, too cinematic, action not super-tight like in those console games.  Yeah I know, I'm playing on a PC which isn't really optimized for games the way that a console is, but I'm okay with turning down the graphics settings until its barely more than blocky polygons but the game just won't let me go that low.  I think this game tries too hard to be like some other games like call of duty where you have a bomber gunning stage and a helicopter stage, while forgetting what made this series so great: the epic dogfights.  I think they also messed up the controls, seems like too much stuff is on automatic mode where in the console releases they left a lot up to the player's skill.  This game is taking the modern trend of putting you in like a cinematic press X repeatedly to advance the cutscene crap instead of letting the player make their own cutscene by shredding up the enemy with clever combat.  Also, this game pretty much forces you to use a controller, the keyboard controls are really clumsy and I don't think they had keyboard and mouse users in mind when they tested it.  Still fun to play, since I like blowing stuff up in the sky, but not really the Ace Combat game I was hoping for.			"

												This is with out a doubt the worst air combat game I've ever played. The controls are the worst, you can't set anything because it auto defaults to a control that is on an axis that was never touched. I couldn't even get past the first mission because the keyboard and the joystick where fighting for control and the plan did not respond the way it should. The throttle was stuck open so I had to use both the key board and the joy stick for throttle control. Avoid this game at all costs! I wouldn't even play it if it was free! If the controller mapping gets fixed then this might be an okay game, until then, no go for launch.			"

												Initially when this came out, I felt the controversy surrounding it was justification enough to hold off until the price dropped and then decide for myself if this game was a good direction to take the series.I gave it a chance, but the moment that an enemy locked onto me with DFM and subsequently near teleported behind me to blow me out of the sky... I just said screw it. I have no qualms with hard games and have played the previous titles all on Ace difficulty to my immense enjoyment. But the mechanics of this game are just over the top asinine. Some people say that DFM is option, and it's not. Whenever the game wants to put a tutorial in your way to show off the new system you can't opt out of it, as planes will literally spam flares, pull off absurd manuevers, and if all else fails disappear and reappear to the side to dodge an attack until you let the game put you on rails and watch the pretty explosions. No indication that it's a tutorial or rails showcase until you waste ~10 misslesGames like this that put the spectacle above the gameplay are becomming far too common. I enjoyed with the prior games just how much control you had, and the times where you had to fly through seemingly impossible turrain and tunnels gave the best adrenalline rush. It was the perfect level of arcade action that still felt 'grounded' because in the end, you were always in control. Also, moving away from a fictional world to 'modern' era ballocks... I'm tired of reality and the current political bull that plagues us with varying shades of gray. So I count this against the game as well. At least I got this on sale, but as of now I think I'm done with the series. I wouldn't mind seeing an HD collection of the prior games though, 1920x1080 @144hz... that would be something I'd definately pay a good price for.			"

												This game will definitely appeal to certain people...but I'm not one of them. It is, overall, a pretty braindead game that you will never really put much thought into. Dogfights, though visually appealing, aren't strategic in any way. No interesting story or characters to speak of. The overall experience felt like a bif explosive rollercoaster that was designed for me to win rather than for me to think my way through an actual challenge (think singleplayer Call of Duty in the air). I'm no grapgics junkie, but the ground textures were the absolute worse I've seen in any case of recent memory. A few trees and buildings are actually rendered in 3D over a mesh, but the rest of the world is a extremely low res flat texture laid out on the floor like a newspaper. Homeless people sleep on prettier things than this. This is not a game where you will want to fly very close to the ground...ever. If mindless, Japanese military-wannabe games is your thing then you'll enjoy it. I personally wish I could have the time I spent on this back.			"

												Ace Combat Assault Horizon - Enhanced Edition is the Seventh Ace Combat game in the series, released on the PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2011 and on Steam for the PC in 2013. This was my first foray into playing the Ace Combat games on the PC, so I was surprised by the keyboard controls without the need for the mouse. This Ace Combat features CRA, Close-Range Assault, in-game known as Dogfighting Mode. This is different, as once it is engaged you are zoned in on a target and must navigate in tandum with the enemy pilot to lock missles, or just blast it with guns. Visually, I like the way Ace Combat Assault Horizon looks, especially in Dogfighting mode. This game would definitely be next-level with a flight stick and controls, as opposed to a keyboard, but is still fun. I recommend playing on harder settings as the easier settings do not present much of a challenge. The game allows you to control a stealth bomber, AC-130, fighter jet and a helicopter throughout campaign play. You can also play in Multiplayer mode, either through coop missions or in a free for all deathmatch. In all it was a fun game to play, as well as exciting. I think if you like games where you have to pilot aircraft and enjoy a fast-paced gameplay, this is going to be up your alley. "

												If you like doing the same thing over and over during missions that seem to just drag on, then this is the game for you! The graphics are meh, the gameplay is about as deep as IOS game, and the physics are from a different planet or something. I mean an apache doing a barrel roll? wtf is that? One annoying thing is that you have to go into ""dog fighting mode"" to kill VIP enemies and it ends up just being an on rails sequence that you probably won't even notice because you're trying to kill the guy but he's actually invincible until the sequence is over, it's a dumb mechanic. Overall this game sucks and is maybe worth like $5 if you're really jonesing for a flight game, but I'm sure there are better ones out there than this.			"

												I was a huge fan of Ace Combat Shattered Skies.

Major issue for a game charging 19.99. Luckily I bought it on sale.Next, the story mode, so far, is just meh. (I will update when I finish) - Doesnt seem like it will be anything as great as shattered skies was =/Being completely honest, I find it boring. Shoot down some MiGs. Oh look, here come some more. Even worse, they force you into dog fight mode?? weird. I also could have done without the Apache missions.. but why is it my Apache can barrel-roll while my F-16 cant?I think on sale - Yes, give it a shot.Full price - Just save your time and money.			"

												***If you're sensitive to educated rants, please avoid this rant/game review***(as I only write revs if a game's getting *unjustified* downvotes)So a lot of kids are getting all butthurt due to AC deciding to try a hollywood take on a part of their franchise......a lot of butthurt kids......a lot....You've gotta be kidding me.A normal review woul look like...""it's not as good as the other ACE Combat games but it's still the usual one-of-a-kind arcade jet dogfights w/ epic hollywood-level camera effects that's coupled with bomber missions and the new AC-130 mission.""Instead they keep on saying ""it's not like the usual Ace Combat... iz 'murican, iz set in modern times, eiw russhians, ermahgerd iz like Top Gun eiiiw.....""  OTL...Okay, my thoughts on the game.... as my first AC game, it's a good game. Well worth the AAA price.=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=STORY=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=Tired of Russian-as-bad-guys story? I've played all CoD and BF games, and no, this one isn't as cliche as the 'haters' imply. This is an original story complete w/ sudden plot twists(!) and rising tension, albeit not your AAA novel-based but still original. This game's made in Japan, and putting oneself in a japanese gamer's shoes(even try setting the voiceover in JP(original))..... you'll realize it's a diff made game. Kinda heavily influenced and a ""try"" on ""west's hollywood action pew pew stories/effects overuse"" by the JP game industry, great job.(Haven't you noticed? It's like the devs were inspired by CoD or BF, ain't that a good kind of globalization ^o^ )=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=GAMEPLAY=-=-=-=-=-=-=Check youtube. I've played all kinds of naval, fps, and flight games. From Microsoft's Simulator to Warthunder's multiple modes. This one is ARCADE.As a first time AC player, it feels unique cuz of the camera-effects, this technique capitalizes on the normal effects(e.g. explosions, missile trailes, shell tracers) REALLY well.Oh, and I said 'check youtube' because it's *kinda* standard throughout, but it doesn't get tiresome!! try watching multiple dogfights XD!!=-=-=-=-=-=STEAM PRICING=-=-=-=-=-=-=Game pricing on Steam. Back in its day, it deserves a high price since it's one-of-a-kind among the few flight games. Today its selling point is its AC signature gameplay and name.IMHO, get it on sale instead since the norm nowadays... have set game prices cheaper.But being the first time AC-player that's also a flight junky, this being the only PC-compatible version... I'd still buy it full price, the experience was great. ^.^(y)!!=-=-=-=-=-=-=NOTES=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=Music is good, sounds great w/ the action.NO bugs so far, crashed one time while loading next mission, likely because I was recording.Played w/ Mouse and Keyboard. Standard rating, no rants.Final Note: funniest part of the game are the kids ♥♥♥♥♥ing bout the game not having the other ACs' setting then giving a thumbs down. great.			"

												Long story short, tl’dr version? It’s a completely sub-average action game that has a few high moments but also has some really low ones evening it out. If you can get it on sale then it’s probably worth your time, but at full price I can’t recommend it. Also as I always like to mention when reviewing a game in this genre, Ace Combat is an ARCADE flight game, meaning it’s not a hyper-realistic flight-sim but instead an action game in the air which is something I see getting confused about a lot. Much longer version? Assault Horizon isn’t a horrible game, and if you enjoy the arcade flight genre you’ll likely get at least one playthrough out of it. That said it’s definitely one if not the weakest entry in the Ace Combat series and some really weird design decisions keep it from being infinitely replayable like its forbearers.  Positives include some attractive if not top-of-the-line visuals, good voice work, and a really strong score.  But that’s where the praise ends really and it can’t make up for what the game’s lacking, and some really atrocious gameplay mechanics. First-and-foremost is the big elephant in the room that every review touches on, the automated dogfighting mode (DFM). Basically once you’ve gotten within shooting distance of an enemy you hit a key and the game pulls into a close-cam attack that has the computer automatically trailing the enemy, with you focusing on achieving lock-on.I think I know what they were going for here. They wanted to create a more cinematic experience allowing you to go through all sorts of tight turns and close-ground fly-bys that just aren’t possible for most players. But in actuality what you get is a system that takes 90% of the gameplay out of your hands, and is buggy to boot. Now I can hear what you’re saying, “Don’t use it then”, which I would love to do but the game forces you to make use of it. Enemy planes are capable of pulling impossible moves (not in a thrust vectoring way, in a literally turns 180 on the spot way that I’m pretty sure is a straight out bug) that absolutely require the use of this mode as trailing enemies, and switching between them is sluggish in manual. To make matters worse things get really…obvious as the max speed of the planes you fly increases. If your plane is faster than the enemies you enter a jumpy, stilted slide-show as your plane forcibly slows down so that you don’t go flying past the enemy making the fact that the system is totally on-rails really blatant. I’m not averse to making the experience more cinematic and entertaining, but it shouldn’t sacrifice gameplay in the process. You also have a similar process for ground assaults and bombing runs but they’re a little less on-rails making them bearable. Additionally perhaps about 1/3 of the game isn’t even in a plane. Several large parts or entire missions are from the perspective of a helicopter pilot or the door gunner. Another misguided attempt at expanding the experience but as all these missions are little more than “Hold mouse to win” it falls short. In particular the gunner levels require no skill as you only have to hit in the general vicinity of an enemy to kill them.Lastly there’s the story that’s gotten a lot of flak from longtime fans, personally I can see it from both ways but I do think it’s one of the weaker ones. On one hand they ditched the somewhat fantastical Ace-world where unrealistic super-weapons and corny but enjoyable characters were the norm for a more stock story set in the “real” world. At the same time there are the makings of a traditional Aces story.  Impossibly skilled protagonist, betrayal, crazy over-the-top unlikely war that only you can solve, etc. It’s all here and on occasion when the situations right and the music kicks in you get those warm waves of nostalgia. But the gameplays too broken and the whole “set in the real world” thing makes it hard to buy. The reason AC could get away with those silly stories was because it took place in a world where technology was different than ours, and where there were about a billion countries all vying for control, regularly splintering into new countries resulting in constant battles. It wasn’t realistic per-se but it took place in its own little bubble world that made things easier to digest. When you try to tack those same rules and morals on to the world as it exists the ridiculousness of the situation starts to shine through and become harder to enjoy. It’s not without its moments but it also limits the story. Because it takes place in the real world, or some approximation of it, that means we also don’t get any super planes/vehicles/weapons or any of the other crazy stuff AC liked to throw at you. So you’re stuck somewhere between the real and the crazy but since it can’t go full bore either way it’s just left dangling in limbo.So, yeah, if you liked previous Ace Combats or just action games in general and can pick this up on the cheap then you’ll get your 6-hours-or-so of enjoyment out of it. But too many issues plague it to make it more than a passing fling you’ll quickly abandon for something else. My time with the game wasn’t totally unenjoyable but if I hadn’t picked it up on sale I’m not sure I would feel so forgiving.			"

												What a shame.In an attempt to revitalize a series that didn't really need it, Namco and Project Aces wound up just dumbing it down and ripping out any charm it had in the process. The game certainly looks quite nice, it is too bad you won't get to control it half the time you're playing.The game seems intent on forcing you to watch Michael Bay-esque explosion and destruction setpieces, through the use of a new ""feature"" called Dog Fight Mode. I'm not sure what the intent was here, but what they did was made roughly half of the enemy fighter pilots in the game nearly impossible to shoot down by giving them an infinite amount of flares that recharge instantly, an apparent invulnerability to gun fire, and twitchy flight patterns that their aircraft should not be capable of performing.All that is to force you to activate Dog Fight Mode, a glorified Quick Time Event. It takes control away from the player (pretty much always a sign of a bad game design idea) and instead lets you nudge the plane around slightly on a preset path, with the goal of firing missiles when a circle turns red and lining up the gun sight with the enemy. It feels incredibly janky and unsatisfying.Even then, the game will pull impossible stunts and prevent you from killing the enemy jet until you fly past whatever dumb falling crane or explosion they want you to see. Because god forbid we have these things trigger naturally, that might actually be satisfying for the player. No instead the developers decide you have to see THIS exact sequence of events EXACTLY like this.Rather than having a goofy flight game with solid mechanics in an absurd setting, they went with a boring real world setting and broke the mechanics so they could shoehorn in an unwanted feature that does nothing but effectively force you to view cutscenes. I was hoping that I would be able to avoid using DFM entirely, but I guess I'm not allowed to have fun.I went into this trying to have an open mind about DFM, but the fact that the game forces you to use it is unacceptable. I honestly did not expect them to do wrong one of the few things that Tom Clancy's HAWX did right, that you never have to use the gameplay gimmick. And even as far as gameplay gimmicks go, Assistance Off is more interesting, creative, and enjoyable than DFM.In conclusion, if you are an idiot who likes games where you push a button occasionally to watch complex cutscenes instead of actually performing those actions and think yet another story about Americans and Russian terrorists fighting each other is exciting, you might like this. Otherwise I cannot recommend it.Port the PS2 games to PC instead Namco, there's money in that.In any case, I'm going to see if I can mod this game to remove DFM altogether and try to salvage something out of this mess.

												i got this game on Steams Summer sale. I got it because i just wanted a jet game and it was cheap. When i saw the gameplay of the DFM mode it put me off the game thinking that it was a complete failure and put the game on rails. However after playing a lot of the ace combat series and coming off of ace combat 6 as my last one which was the best game ever for me i feel this game could actually be better. It has an advanced flight mode which gives you complete control over the aircraft and allows you to do what ever you want. The DFM mode actually needs to be played to be loved and i enjoy getting close to another aircraft to use it because it is new and completely entertaining. I wish i got this game when it came out and id recommend it to everyone who loves jet games. 10/10. LOOK AT THE SETTINGS PEOPLE IT IS NOT A GAME ON RAILS. YOU CAN TURN THAT OFF AND IT WILL BE LIKE ANY OTHER ACE COMBAT			"

												Positives-HUD is very nice, as is usual with Ace Comabat games-Still somewhat has the feel of the Ace Combat series-Nice graphics (nothing to write home about, but it lets you feel like a pilot)-Still fairly fun, especially the air combat missionsNegatives-Short Campaign-A story about as complex as a fanfiction written by Donald Trump on a power trip-Literally 0 emotional attachment to any of the characters-Awkward controls on the keyboard (customizable but still not too great) -Controls sometimes feels stiff-Number of helicopter missions that are really boring (basically just point and click)-Final boss is abosultely stupid. Basically a ""♥♥♥♥ You"" from the game. You learn a bunch of skills and tricks through out the game, and the final boss just negates all of those skills. You learned how to counter manuver? You cant do that without being hit. You learned how to follow a counter manuver? Cant do that here. You thought that being on someone's six means you're safe from enemy fire? ♥♥♥♥ you, there are 5 homing missles coming at you OUT THE BACK SIDE. Literally all the skills it has you learn slowly through the game is useless. All you can do is attempt to follow it and rely on you reactions and not any learned skill. -No real replayabilityFinal VerdictDont buy it unless you are a super fan of Ace Combat OR you really like plane sim + CoD			"

												If you thought Ace Combat 2 - 6 were fun... you should save your money because this game throws the entire evolution of the series out the window and replaces it with Quicktime events and automated dogfighting.  Missions have no briefings and no choice of strategies, and therefore no context to what you are doing.  There are no wing leader commands.  Battles are boring and tedious because you must kill a majority of enemies using DFM.  I never needed DFM to dogfight before so It's a very confusing thing to not only add... but to make a requirement.  The graphics are pretty good but sadly the immersion is destroyed by the ""in your face"" stylings of the game.  If you know who Mobius 1 is, you won't like this game.			"

												This game is terrible, the missions are really boring and long, they want you to fly one jet and finish the mission for a whole division!  And the enemies you destoried in each mission are propably more than the entire military forces of a small country like Pakistan! And your AI allies are all dumb and useless, all their job is endless request for your assists, they can not even handle one lonely enemy tank or fighter you ommit to clear, and if they die, your mission is failed. And your enemy's fighter is sooo good that even it's hit by a missle, it can still be operated normally unless you finally destory it!There are still many annoying or dumb things in this game i dont bother to mention, generally speaking, this game sucks!

												Having played the first game in the Ace combat series years ago on PS1, Air combat, I came across this on steam and figured it'd be sweet.I was terribly mistaken.Compared to other ace combat titles and flying aircraft in other games (not simulators), the flying, particularly combat, is terribly oversimplified and takes the fun out of it.""Dogfight mode"" is required to kill ""ace"" pilots, and is tedious and boring. Helicopter flights are a nightmare, the controls and menuvering was a massive pain.Save your money, and your time.			"

												Pros: Soundtrack is solid. Not the best IMO of the AC series, but better than most other games soundtrack. Features a nice blend of orchestra, rock, and electronic, but doesn't sit as well as other orchestra AC soundtracks. Proably becuase of the electronic sounds. Lots of eye candy. First couple missions feel really damn cool. Dog Fight Mode(DFM) is a cool idea(at first)Cons: DFM gets old fast, especially since there are tons of situations where it is forced on the player.A lot of the DFM battles are actually scripted, and prevent a plane from being shot down until they do something (like fire a missle at a building)The helicopter missions need a lot of work, The AC-130 mission seems like a re-text of a mission in COD4. Bomber mission is ok, but doens't bring much to the table.Aircraft selection is restricted based off of the mission. Sorry its a multi-role mission, you can't fly the Su-33.No wingman or allied control. Due to the sheer number of DFM and ASM moments(think DFM but for ground targets), the game feels like its on rails. If your a fan of previous AC games, I would recommend letting this one go. I wouldn't pay more than like 10 dollars for it. DFM and the sheer amount of eye candy the game offers are really cool for about 3 missions.  I find myself playing a select set of 3 missions, and its mainly for the soundtrack. Proably the single most annoying thing is how forced the DFM and ASM modes are. Some planes will take infinite damage unitl you start DFM, in which case they will only be shot down after a particular event occurs(ie, a bomber will not be destroyed until you start DFM with it and it is also .3 miles from its target)If your new to the series, I would recommend starting on one of the 3 AC's for the PS2 or AC6 for the Xbox-360.

												Sadly, would NOT reccomend. As much as I love the Ace Combat series, this game sadly falls short. The story and graphics aren't too shabby but the actual gameplay brings the whole thing down. I've always loved Ace Combat's not too sim-y and not too arcade-y feel but this game is way too arcade-y.They've added a Dog Fighting Mode (DFM), that you are pretty much forced to use to progress, that is basically auto-aim for planes. The little side / mini-games. where you get to use a minigun or helicopter. don't help much either when it changes the pace significantly and brings you up close and personal with the low res textures most aircraft games use for the ground you rarely see unless you are crashing. They've even added a little tweak to the turning mechanic where instead of the usual turn faster while braking they've changed it to turn extremely fast when tapping the brakes so you end up doing a feathering motion of accelerating and braking constantly to turn around quickly to jump into DRM with an opponent.All in all, I think they've gone way overboard turning this game into a pure arcade jet fighter. It seems like they changed the usual Ace Combat feel to a dumbed down version for all the pvp pwnkiddies for the great multiplayer experience that this game apparently has.			"

												The controls are good the graphics are good, and dropping near the dirt and buildings popping up (still mostly flat) is pretty nice.  But lets get to it, the game is about fighting, and i have to say, that even early in first thing that stuck to me was that this is a turn simulator.  you just hold onto the turn until you get a target to cross you and either hit your missles, or enter dog fight mode (dfm).  This is really it.  in the tutorial, the simplest part of the game, i was told to hold the brake and pull up until the two arrows lined up, and then level off.  What happend was i wound up doing loop the loops literally for about 2 minutes.  the arrows never lined up, and eventually i tried squirming in other directions.  The arrows never lined up.  The point of the arrows lining up is apparently to 'pull off a maneuver'.  This is to lose the fighter on your tail.  If this were to happen. . . EVER. . . id probably just want to restart and hope it didnt happen rather than push another 3 to 5 minutes trying to line up these arrows.  And then you of course go back to the circle simulator.  Going in circles and circles, gotta get that lock to auto fight.  Much of the game is auto played.  I just didnt really feel like i was piloting.			"

Then again you have NO options to reduce Graphics settings as its a cheap and fast port from the console version.All in all a poorly ported cash grab by the developers, if your into flying games and have a joypad and a latest spec system you may have some fun with this. If flight sims and realism are your thing, and you have a Joystick or HOTAS then don't waste your time or money, even in a sale this is a waste of both.			"

												I really had high hopes for this game. I waited until it was on sale for half the price (I believe $20~25) and purchased it. The story is, as expected, complete garbage. The twist was more predictable than putting water in the freezer for ice cubes. It was clearly written by someone who should stick to the cheesy anime pornos rather than serious war stories. Speaking of serious war stories, why are Russians always evil? Why can't it be America for once? We're evil, just look at our drone strikes and Snowden and!..... Okay, getting ahead of myself.Anyway, this was the first ""jet"" game that I got that tried something new other than playing as a camera w/ turrets (a UAV) rather than a jet: A chopper. Lemme tell you: I wish it didn't. THe worse parts of this game are the chopper sections and they are a good chunk.Avoid this one, go get HAWX 1 instead. It's cheaper and has more dog fights.			"

You also need to change the controls so that can actually have full control of the jet. After the 4th mission the difficulty ramps up and becomes almost unplayable.

												How can I say this. Oh yes. If you want to port Ace Combat to the PC, why don't you just USE THE NORMAL CONTROLS EVERYONE ELSE, FOR THE PAST 20 YEARS, HAS BEEN USING???This pains me. I have Ace Combat (one of them) for the PSP, and that is a good game, very entertaining.This shining turd, on the other hand, is UNPLAYABLE. The controls are just broken. The graphics are amazing and I don't even much care about the whole ""dogfighting"" thing (noob babysit), but the controls ruin the game. Couldn't make it past the first mission. The bloody TUTORIAL. Mouse control is available, but doesn't work. Keyboard controls just don't cut it. And joystick control (yes, I am one of the few people that actually has one, in this year of our Lord 2014) cuts you out of one of the three axis. IF I WANT TO TURN THE PLANE, LET ME ROTATE ALL THE THREE AXIS!!! HOW DO YOU TURN A F35 INTO A DAMN B52??? NO DECENT LOOPINGS, NO TIGHT TURNS??? Last time I checked, ALL PLANES COME WITH SEPARATE CONTROLS FOR THE FLAPS AND THE RUDDER!!!Don't buy this, it's garbage. A complete waste of your money, however little it might be.			"

												While it looked like a HAWX style game, it certainly has NONE of that series' quality... the controls are plain junk as the game doesn't know it's a flight sim or a afterburner clone...It's always a bad sign when you spend most of the time playing wrestling with broken controls to even get the damn thing to do what you asked, and I've played all the big name arcade and sim based games... but it's a little better if you turn of optimised controls and go to original mode than at least you get some control over the stuff, but even so you feel like it's got mouse acceleration issues (even on a gamepad).It's probably worth the £2.49 sale price but I'd feel really annoyed had I paid ( I was gifted it from a mate)			"

												I'm still going through this game as I type this out but so far my experience hasn't been exactly good.As someone who has experience with the previous Ace Combat games (primarily for PS2), it's very hard for me to even accept that this game is part of the series. The controls are wonky and they offer very little customization. also, I'd like to be able to an actual roll in this game, where the controls seem to really NOT want me to do that kind of maneuver. Unacceptable.The story is meh, the flight characteristic (especially in DFM) are pushing the boundaries of what an actual jet can do.Oh, and in the beginning of the game you're in a flight of 5th generation F-22s fighting against 4th generation Russian SU-47's (or some other SU model. It was the Russian equivalent to the F-15) as if there were any realism in that kind of combat whatsoever.I also really hate DFM altogether. It takes away from the gameplay experience.Now, if I were to say some good things about this game, I would tell you that from an Air Force POV, the uniforms were designed well enough for what the game is (officers have their rank stitched onto the shoulders of their flight suit but I won't hold that on the game makers), the creators did a magnificent job in the design of the aircraft, which is one reason I bought the game to begin with.. Basically aesthetic things.That's really all I can say I like about this game, is the aesthetics. The experience and the mechanics of the game totally overrun the the aesthetics though.3/10 would not reccommend			"

												If you're a fan of the PS2 era Ace Combat games, then this is something to keep in mind about Assault Horizon:-Missiles have been gimped, bringing their range from ~5000 (in the PS2 games) to about 2000.-Machine guns have been buffed, making them a better option than missiles in most cases.-Dogfight Mode is unavoidable.  If you want to kill certain enemy aces, you need to give up control of most of your plane and play something that feels an awful lot like a mini-game.  -On-rails helicopter missions where all you do is point and shoot. Also unavoidable.   If AC4, AC5, and ACZ are your jams, I wouldn't pick this up.  It's going to bother you.  Oddly enough, I think that Strike Suit Zero comes the closest on PC to replicating that PS2-era Ace Combat gameplay.			"

												If you love Ace Combat 5 or similar, you will not like this one. It is very much on rails and eliminates the freedom that was once so precious about the Ace Combat series. Helicopter levels are not particularly fascinating, and it beautifully displays a lack of realism as well.. Helicopters can do barrel rolls to dodge missiles (I'm serious!), and if you're in that DREADFUL 'dogfighting mode' that the game forces you to activate, your jet fighter will exhibit similar characteristics. Multiplayer is also kind of tricky to get into. Have heard good things about the music (and I don't disagree), though the story is very bland and uninspiring. In short: donotwant! x			"

												The graphics are good, except for ground textures, which are what you would expect from games of this genre – low-resolution and blurry. But there's a plenitude of 3D buildings, the jets and helicopters are well crafted, explosions look nice, and even characters don't look bad at all.Fighter jet gameplay is simple enough and shooting down enemies while in DFM (dog fight mode) is very satisfying. The only problem is that the HUD (heads-up display) can be a little intrusive, with too much information on screen. This can prove distracting at times, especially with the amount of dialog going on.Helicopters are absolutely dreadful to control, however. Luckily there are only a couple of helicopter missions in the campaign, and they're far between.As a side note, I might add that the game can be perfectly played with mouse and keyboard, but was clearly designed with a gamepad in mind.The story is utterly forgettable, but I reckon it is not the selling point of this game, so it can be safely ignored.The sound effects are decent. On the other hand, the soundtrack, while not bad per se, is very repetitive and does not go together well with the action.Lastly, multiplayer is fun, even if few people bother with it due to Games For Windows Live.Overall, a solid game.UPDATE: Since the writing of this review, Games For Windows Live has been patched out of the game.

												This game definitely falls short of what I have come to expect from the Ace Combat franchise. You are forced to use a no skill dogfight mode that only requires you keep you're target within a circle on the screen and fire missiles. There are a few levels, such as the helicopter gunner ones, that have you ""on rails"" for the entire time. These are tedious and can't be completed until the action sequences run their course. It's also no longer set in a fictional world, which destroys the suspension of disbelief that made it so you don't question the unbelievably huge aerial battles. You are also given regenerative health on your plane, which means that if you take damage you can just play conservatively for a bit and not have to worry about being shot down. Overall, I would say this is definitely the weakest offering of the series. I bought it at a mid range discount (~$15), and feel that was still too much for this mediocre game.			"

												Ace Combat Assault Horizon... where to begin.If youre interested in buying this game because you've played past Ace Combat games, please take the time to read this review.You will not find the Ace Combat experience you've come to know and love from this game. This is not Ace Combat; Its little more than an arcade shooter masquerading as a successor to Ace Combat 6, simple as that. If you've played the past games and have loved the sim style, then avoid this game, as its now focused more to an arcade style. That coupled with a lackluster story have me dissapointed in Assault Horizon. If you're new to the Ace Combat franchise and are looking for cheep and easy arcade sim, this game might be for you; but buyer beware, it might not be worth it even then.			"

												This game is great. Don't be discouraged by the people that played previous Ace Combats. This is the first Ace Combat game I have played and it was easily worth my money. Only problem I had is that the audio was out of sync in the cutscenes (great grpahics by the way for the price) but that might just be my laptop. This didn't really matter though because I had subtitles. Also this game ran smoothly on my laptop. (Dual core 2.2Ghz, 8g ram, Amd mobilty Radeon HD 5470)			"

												Let me state I've already played and completed this game when it initially came out on the xbox 360. I've always been an ace combat fan so I'll admit to some bias in that regard, along with a love of military aircraft in general. That said, this itiration of the Ace Combat series, while fun, full of adrenaline, and still top notch in visual quality as you'd expect, I still felt the new Dog Fighting mechanic took away from some of the imersion. In previous titles, dog fighting was as you'd imagine, difficult. Trying to follow your target while staying in range for your main gun and leading the target so you actually hit. While at the same time making sure you did not crash into anything. This, obviously takes some skill and practice, which I felt was a good challenge to the game.Assault Horizon however takes the burden of piloting and has you focus more on the target. Now it's a matter of making sure your crosshair is on target for your main gun or missles (whichever you prefer) and the plane is essentially on auto pilot after the target. You can change your pitch and angle, sure, but you are certainly only following the target aircraft.This was more a design decision to add cinematic fluff than anything else. That hollywood sequence of flying just underneath a crane while at Mach 2 is undeniably impressive and enjoyable for most. But after repeated intervals, it begins to feel cheapened. This is certainly a good game for those new to the flight combat sim, or new to Ace Combat in general to get a feel for series. While I wish they kept the old dog fighting mechanics in this, it does allow for a lot of 'wow' moments when you do pull them off.			"

												I wish there was an in-between rating besides Yes and No for recommendations.  The game has an interesting story, beautiful graphics and a good variety of mission types, but the controls aren't as tight as I'd expect, it gets repetitive quickly and simply gets boring the more you play.  If you can get it really cheap, pick it up for a (brief) good time, but unless you're a huge fan, don't buy it at full price.			"

												Have owned every single Ace Combat game. This one is completely different and much more linear. This means that many of the battles will require you to enter a ""dogfight mode."" Dogfight mode is pretty much an autopilot that places the player on the tail of an enemy fighter, following him untill he shakes you or you make a tally. If you are a fan of the old Ace Combat games be prepared for a fun game with lots of change.			"

												I'm torn, like really torn.  I have enjoyed Ace Combat for as long as I can remember.  From going to the arcade and sitting in the, awesome at the time, faux cockpit living out my fantasies of being a fighter pilot to playing Ace Combat at home with my friends on Playstation 2.  Ace Combat, to me, has been the hands down best arcade style flight game for a long time.  Yes there were some weak games in the series, but there wasn't really anything else like them (maybe Hawx, but I have to imagine there's a reason only 2 of those were made while every other Tom Clancy game gets sequal after sequal). Now for me the best games in the series are the PS2 generation, I'm talking Shattered Skies, Unsung War, and Zero (Zero being imo the best game in the series, for story, presentation, and just sheer variety of jets).  Nothing beat going against the Yellow Squadron at the end of Shattered Skies, or being able to command my wingmen in Unsung War, or going aginst the aces of Zero.  Yes, the playstyle could get repetitive, some could even compare it to Nascar in the sky with missles, with all the constant left turns and all, but the variety of missions, the awesome stage design (chasing enemies through canyons and going all out Death Star style on giant miltary bases and destryoing giant fleets of ships just to name a few), and the insane balls to the wall story telling (Demons of Razgriz, do I have to say anything else?).  Ace Combat was  game that seemed to know what it was, first and foremost an overtly arcade flight sim (and I use the word sim very lossely).  That doesn't seem to be the case here.  Let me explain.As I stated Ace Combat has always featured crazy fictional storylines about nation against nation all out air combat.  That's not the case here.  Once again we are ""graced"" with the classic tale of crazy Russians doing crazy things.  Now I don't want to spoil anything, but I will say that the story, like so many others, is about revenge.  I know, real original right?  Now there have been a lot of comparisons to Call of Duty, and as someone who has played both Ace Combat and Call of Duty, I can say the comparison is apt.  There is a lot to the story that invokes thoughts of the current Call of Duty campaigns.  Once again, crazy Russians, doing crazy things, based around revengs.  I don't know if all of these game developers are delving into the same writing pool, but it sure seems that way.  The story overall, for all of it's cliches, isn't what I would call bad, but it's not what I would call good either.  Rather I would call it forgetable.  I want to say that it is a good lead in, as motivation, to the missions you play, but honestly, you could probably drop all of the cut scenes and still get the jist of what's going on.  Not that it would matter to much.  Needless to say, don't come to this game for the story, you can find the same thing, but better, in just about any movie about flying from the 80's (Top Gun, Iron Eagles), and that's not saying much.Gameplay wise is where things start to get divisive though.  Before Ace Combat was about skill, to a degree, having to keep up with your target, know when to fire missles so they would have a better chance of hitting, being able to stay in close for guns range, etc. but now that seems to have been circumvented in place of scripted action that's what many would describe as being ""on rails"".  Assault Horizon introduces Dog Fight Mode, or DFM for short.  Ini DFM you can engage enemies in scripted (though not to be fair, not all the tim) ""on ralis"" segments usually not being allowed to shoot down an enemy till you have gone through some cinematic moment the game wants you to see.  Sometimes this is a plane crashing into a stadim, as seen in the demo, othertimes it's till a plance decides to counter you, engaging you in a back and forth DFM challenge.  This can become quiet tedious, especially as the game progresses and it forces you to use such more and more.  For those that want to avoid this, I hate to inform, I don't think you really can.  There are portions of the game where it is not even possible to shoot the enemy down till you engage them in DFM and then follow through the cinematic at which time the game will actually make your weapons begin to do damage.  This, as I'm sure you can guess, get's rather old.  Thankfully though much of the previous combat does remain.  As I stated you can still engage enemies without the use of DFM and these engaements feel the same as before, if not even better, as the enemy seems to be a little bit smarter this time around, and that's not a bad thing in this case.  What is a bad thing though, is the friendly AI.  They are useless.  I don't say this lightly, but I don't think I have ever seen such horrible AI before.  I mean that.  All I'll say is this, there is a level in the game, about mid way through were you are tasked with destroying a target, you have at this time multiple aircraft in the air with you, friendly and hostile.  The friendlies task you with targetting particular aircraft informing you that they will take care of the ""escort craft"", they don't.  Not at all.  Nothing is more frusrtrating then seeing the sky filled with friendly aircraft only to watch them fly around not going after a single target as they tell me not to be concerned.  These targets are all over you at this point, not being concerned isn't really possible.  Especially considering it's impossible to destroy your targets without engaging the other aircraft.  oh, and did I mention you were on a timer?  Yeah, there's that.  Like I said, horrible AI.  I won't even get into the helicopter sections, this review is already long enough.  I will just say this, they aren't as bad as you may have heard, but they definettly aren't good either.  They are once again forgettable; like most of this game to be honest.I don't want to end this by doing nothing but bashing the game so I will say this, the game looks good.  It does.  It's hands down the best looking Ace Combat game.  The ground textures are still laughable, but what do you expect?  The aricraft though, beuatiful.  Also, the aircraft selection, it's good.  Granted there has been better in previous games, but what can you really expect?  It's not like there is a whole lot of modern jet fighter today.  Some of the missions were alright, but nothing to really write home about, but nothing to seriously decry either, they were just, well, forgetable.  And I guess that about sums it up, a forgetable game.  Like I said I'm torn, I really wanted to like this, it's Ace Combat, but sadly it's not.  It has the name, but none of the feel.  I'm pretty sure that JSAF may honestly be better, and that's saying something.			"

												AC:AH handles like the usual Ace Combat formula with the bombast and overzealous scripting of the latest Call of Duty games thrown in. Numerous times the game uses it's on-rails Dogfight Mode (DFM) or it's even more restrictive cousin Airstrike Mode to force the player to fly under -that- collapsing smokestack or -that- inexplicable jumbo jet, completely irrespective of the direction or location in which it was initiated. Allies/enemies vanish and materialise as the mission scripting decrees, or are completely invulnrable until they become a later mission objective. The DFM is also lacking in options for the player; you can just hold MG and accelerate and watch the pretty colours.The (apparently) mandatory AC-130 level, the door gunner sections and the helicopter gunship bits, I'm afraid I can't speak fairly on them. Generally I slogged through them until I got my jet back, and certainly wasn't taking notes, other than to say the ground /building textures weren't designed for hovering that close to them.The story is, well, the typical ""US saves the world from someone who wants specifically to attack the US"" fare we've seen everywhere since CoD 4. The comms chatter and recurring callsigns that has always made allies seem interesting is still there, but sparser and sandwiched in between asking for help and spontaneous bravado. The sense of edging along with a ground war is missing from the AC formula too - your team can hop between continent as if on an extended holiday, and the sense of bring under threat suffers. I didn't feel much attachment to the callsign either; Warwolf's leader is no Mobius One. As good as the real-world setting is, I feel Strangereal is a better setting for these games.I'm giving it a negative rating, but that's not to say a bad game. The combat is wonderfully involving in its freeform state, with an excellently majestic soundtrack (Kieki Kobayashi et al doing what they do best), a great selection of planes and enough variation in weapon loadouts / handling / mission objectives to keep it fresh. There's some character to all four members of your flight, as well as the allied squadrons and land-dwelling elements, and even the traditional objective-dispensing AWACS operator has some colour to him.In summary, what's good is most of the parts I liked from AC's 4 and 6 (you can even get the Estovakian fictional superplane from AC6, in original Strigon Squadron colours), and the parts i disliked were clearly taken wholesale from CoD and grafted around the Ace Combat experience. People looking to get the thrill arcade digfighters give would do well to look at JASF (interesting story idea there) or look to play Fires of Liberation.			"

												Without a doubt, one of the worst flying games I've encountered. It's clearly a lazy console port, with no regard given to actual playablity with anything other than a console controller. There's no cursor in the menus, cutscene are ruined by the lack of ability to look around as you would with a controller, and any buttons onscreen flicker between joystick and keyboard options, leaving neither particularly clear to see.Your most difficult enemy will be the flight mechanics themselves, as you can't (fully) roll your plane, making most actual flying techniques impossible to pull of, and keeping track of the enemy whilst they constantly turn on the spot against you quickly becomes a chore.The helicopter controls are beyond explaination. I'm not sure how they'd work with a controller, but with a joystick, I don't think they could possibly be any further from the real controls of a helicopter. I can't really explain them, but let's just say that CoD: Black Ops did a better job of helicopter controls when they stuck on the Hind mission to mix things up a bit. Imagine that, but even worse.That's how the whole game feels: like it's a flight level that's been stuck onto a game that's got nothing to do with flying.And that's when I stopped playing. Good luck to those that buy it.			"

												As an Ace Combat game, it's not great. Assault Horizon does away with the pretty in depth fictional universe that the Ace series was known for on PS2. Gone are Mobius Squadron, Razgriz, Thunderhead, Skye Eye, and the various fictional countries with their histories. This is basically MURIKA VERSUS THE TERRORISTS like you'd see in CoD or the like, only in planes. It's pretty silly and modern war-sy, but it's tolerable.As an action / arcade dogfight game though, it's fun. It still maintains the ""Planes carry absurd amounts of missiles"" feature from the Ace series, and the graphics are pretty awesome. Not only that, but as scripted feeling and over the top action movie-ish the new Dog Fight Mode may be, it can still be fun at times. Weaving between buildings, struggling to maintain a lock, and peppering an enemy fighter with cannon fire is genuinely thrilling. I can't say I'm a big fan of the helicopter levels, nor the AC-130 one (Because what modern war game would be complete without an AC-130 level?), but in terms of overall enjoyability, I liked it. It was worth buying on sale, and while it may not be as amazing as 4/5/Zero, it's worth a look if you just want to fly around and take down entire wings of planes with your Ultimate Hero Guy abilities.

												The graphics are good, except for ground textures, which are what you would expect from games of this genre – low-resolution and blurry. But there's a plenitude of 3D buildings, the jets and helicopters are well crafted, explosions look nice, and even characters don't look bad at all.Fighter jet gameplay is simple enough and shooting down enemies while in DFM (dog fight mode) is very satisfying. The only problem is that the HUD (heads-up display) can be a little intrusive, with too much information on screen. This can prove distracting at times, especially with the amount of dialog going on.Helicopters are absolutely dreadful to control, however. Luckily there are only a couple of helicopter missions in the campaign, and they're far between.As a side note, I might add that the game can be perfectly played with mouse and keyboard, but was clearly designed with a gamepad in mind.The story is utterly forgettable, but I reckon it is not the selling point of this game, so it can be safely ignored.The sound effects are decent. On the other hand, the soundtrack, while not bad per se, is very repetitive and does not go together well with the action.Lastly, multiplayer is fun, even if few people bother with it due to Games For Windows Live.Overall, a solid game.UPDATE: Since the writing of this review, Games For Windows Live has been patched out of the game.

												This is one of the worst games I've played. Why? It's mostly fun in very short bursts, but incredibly brainless in its combat as not a lot changes throughout the game, enemies all all pretty much identical with the exception that some are faster as you get towards the final missions. The story is terrible - something I would expect from an arcade game, I half expected my princess to be in another castle for how phoned in it is. Bosses were largely scripted and I as a player were unable to really do much but follow the rails left for me. In the end I uninstalled it at the last boss because I just couldn't take it anymore. I would be hesitant to recommend this even if it were free. The best part about this game is you have some pretty decent helicopter missions which are more fun than the fighter jet missions, but also makes you wonder why they even called this an ace combat game to begin with.

												Very good game. The controls for the helicopter missions will catch you off guard. You have to control the gunner and pilot at the same time even if you are using a gamepad. One thumbstick aims the weapons and one controls the pilots direction. I am a old school gamer that played apache helicopter games like microprose's gunship from the 90's where the aim and piloting were controlled by a joystick all in one control set where you where you went is where you aimed. As for the gunner and aircraft missions are simple and straight forwards for controls where for the aircraft, one thumbstick controls the flying and the other is used for camera angles/views. As for views, you can view at least from either the pilots HUD display view of the game or you can view from behind the planes. Both views allow you to see all of the enemy tracking while flying, I wish I could have played the ubisoft HAWX series to compare the air combat. But this game gets a thumbs up from me.			"

												You've probably heard all the negativity about this game by now. How DFM ruined the game because no skill is needed; a casual QTE click fest that dishonors the Ace Combat franchise. I wouldn't know because this is the first Ace Combat game I've played. But you know what? I haven't had this much fun flying since Strike Commander. A very immersive experience. And yes, I got shot down often while learning the controls. This game requires skill, perhaps not the kind of skill required of the other Ace Combat games, but skill nonetheless. I'm not a hardcore flight sim enthusiast by any means, but I've done my fair share of simulated flying, from biplanes to X-wings.This game is not playable for me with keyboard and mouse in the dogfight sections; a gamepad is required. I use an old PS2 controller connected to a USB adapter with buttons remapped by X360CE. In the doorgunner and helicopter section, keyboard and mouse worked the best for me. Yes, I found them fun too. A minigun that doesn't overheat is just what I wanted for mindless shooting fun. The graphics in the gmae are decidedly not cutting edge, being rather low-res in parts, but it all looks perfectly convincing in the middle of combat.I'm knocking out this review before the current sale ends in case someone needs to have another opinion before making a purchase. I thought about it all weekend, watching a ton of gameplay videos on YouTube. It was a lot more fun playing the game myself than watching those videos.			"

												UPDATE: Games For Windows Live DRM was recently removed and Steamworks added instead. Fantastic move! Although, my saves from my past playthroughs aren't recognized by the game's latest update.Well, since this is my first ACE COMBAT game, I would admit I had fun playing it. I can't compare this game to previous ACE COMBAT games since this is the only ACE game on PC although, I did read that apparently, previous iterations were better according to ACE COMBAT fans. The game offers a good variety of missions in the single player campaign. Aerial combat (jet mostly) gameplay is simple enough but do take some learning curve to only focus on the Keyboard to fly the jet. Shooting down enemies while in Dog Fight Mode rocks! It actually reminds me a bit of that old TOMCAT ALLEY SEGA CD game.But I really gotta emphasize on the terrible helicopter control. At least, the helicopter missions are in minorities! Apparently, this game doesn't have Joystick support but I can't comment on this yet as I don't have any Joystick yet. I could say though, that this game was heavily gamepad focused but still very serviceable on Keyboard + Mouse control scheme. The story ain't this game the strongest aspect but it is not the worst either!PROS:+REMOVAL of Games For Windows Live DRM and replaced with Steamworks.+Graphical engine is impressive.+Plane models are well done.+The sounds and voice acting are decent.+Gameplay, while having simplistic combat scheme, is still enjoyable as an action arcade game.+Great variety and pacing of missions (Aerial combat, air to ground combat, bomber runs, gunship raids, gunnery on a BlackHawk Helicopter).CONS:-Helicopter controls are terrible!-Annoying soundtrack (better turn it off!)-Quick-Time Events (I hate those with passion!).-Saves from GFWL aren't recognized anymore with the game's latest update on Steamworks.RECOMMENDATION:Overall, as a newcomer to the ACE COMBAT franchise, I quite enjoyed it. I would however advise to all hardcore simulation fans that this game is more action-arcade oriented than simulation and realism. If you're wary, then wait until you find a good deal and check it out!RATING:7.5 / 10			"

												Ok, isn't ace combat at all, in order to let you feel the same feeling you need to turn off the ""assist"" and put the control scheme as ""original"" and not optimized. I read a lot of bad reviews, imbo, the multiplayer game will make you feel addicted. So except this stuff about what you will expect about an Ace combat title, and i can feel a lot of stuff similars to HAWX 2, the game itself isn't bad. The graphic's ok, not a miracle but simple ok. What i must observe and i think it's important: this game will never drain your graphiccard, BUT...it wants a good CPU. remember that, because if you read the min specs and you think ""yeah i can play it"" that isn't the true. Graphic options: except of Antialiasing and vsynch you can't change anything and this is bad for PC. So you will not have the possibility to change your texture, shadows or other stuff quality. Another thing: i think the multiplayer is cross-platform and most of the times you will got stupid weird people without an headphones and you will got everytime a sort of ECHO on all the matches. Another stuff, no keyboard chat, just speak. Imo i loved Ace Combat series and i don't think that this game is soo bad, this PC version got some bad points at all, but the game itself isn't bad. Ok you can play it in a more ""simple"" way but i got addicted after few rounds on multiplayer. Final vote?! nearby 75, not bad not good, a good game for 7.XX euros but not for 30. imo i didn't play the campaign mode except for the first mission that's a sort of tutorial and helps a lot for multiplayer games.

												I should not have played this right after I played Ace Combat Zero.I've only played an hour of this, but a ton of its flaws are visible right from the start. Uninteresting characters (that you've already seen in nearly every modern shooter game), forced scripted sequences in the middle of missions, a dogfight mode that locks you behind an enemy in a really terrible simplification of actual dogfighting in earlier AC games, regular enemies that FORCE you to use that dogfight mode, excessive tutorial prompts (that pause gameplay until you follow the damn prompt), regenerating health, and turret sections in an Ace combat game. The enemies were also really stupid, but it might have been because it was the start of the game.This game pretty much exemplifies everything I hate about modern gaming. Excessive handholding, ""AWESOME"" scripted sequences at the expense of actual gameplay, bland story, and shoehorning in elements meant to dumb down the gameplay then balancing the game around said dumb element.

												The game is fun for what it is. Fancy airplanes, a solid story with nice cuscenes and a variety of missions.That been said. I wasn't able to finish a mission at all, because it forces the player to enter the ""Dog Fight Mode"", opens a 10 second time window and saves the checkpoint JUST then. So you can't finish at all. Only re-doing the mission gets you a second chance to ""maybe"" success. This dampens the whole fun I had with the mission prior to that (Yay for the AC-130 'Shootingrange' mission).I recommend getting the game when it is on sale for under 10 bucks. But for the full price it's just not worth it. For that one can release the inner child that liked to play with aircraft toys or has used his hand if none was in reach~			"

You have to mode the Default_Input.ini file just to get a glitch taken care of that constantly holds the down button. From there, you have to manually set all of your mouse controls everytime you launch the game, because it doesn't save your settings. This is coming from a major bug where my mouse and keyboard won't send signals to my aircraft in game. Nothing happens. I haven't made it from the first 2 minutes of game play because I am unable to control my plane. Do not buy, even on sale. Not worth it at all.			"

												Stupid game made by stupid people. You are fighting alone against 50(or more) aicrafts per mission, your plane is carrying 200 primary rockets + ~25 secondary and your allies are useless, made only to disturb you and make the game harder. Maybe this is becouse i was playind the highest difficulty level, but the mission above Dubai has crown it all. You have about 20 fighters against you siiting on your back and you have to shot down three ♥♥♥♥ing bombers(you need about 5-10 rocket hits to shot one) in about 2 minutes, or mission will be failed. All alone. Just ♥♥♥♥ing great. Do not touch even with a stick. Edit: I forgot to say that the amount of enemies is the only difficult of this game, fights are mercilessly scripted, you can see the same tower falling on your head in ""dog fight""(but it cant kill you whatever you do) 10 times in one mission and there is only few types of enemy behavior. Especcially on the begining you have to waste a lot of time to avoid enemy attacks, because everyone is focused on you and you are lucky if game gives you 10 seconds to lock-on and shot down the enemy. Just flying around and waiting the scripts let you do anything. And sometimes just to make you angry the script will lock enemy on your♥♥♥♥♥and the only way to avoid attack will be using flares. Which is 6 in one mission. 6 flares when your plane can carry even 250 rockets. And you have 50 opponents to kill only by yourself. They were trying to be funny or something?			"

												On its own, this game could be ""passable."" But as an Ace Combat game, it's nothing but disappointing.Yes, it fits well under the guise of ""Call of Duty in planes"" and that's what's wrong with it. Combat and missions are repetitive, the story is as cut-and-paste as it gets (OMG the Russians have a superweapon... again. 'Murica to the rescue!) and pretty much everything that made the old Ace Combat games great have been removed (New Game Plus, wingmate commands, plane EXP to unlock jets, etc.). Ace Combat used to take place in a distinct world that resembled our own but had unique lore. This time around they chose real-world locations so instead the story world is filled with boring real-world characters and a boring real-world story - Just like Call of Duty!Dogfight mode is a new on-rails addition that makes you semi-cinematically chase after and shoot down more skilled pilots that, simply because the game doesn't want you to, can't be shot down by conventional methods. A successful hit rips apart the enemy jet and leaves your plane splattered with oil and shrapnel and looks cool... the first few times you do it. After about mission 4 when you realize you have to do this A LOT in EVERY MISSION it gets old real fast - just like Call of Duty!Thankfully, the campaign's missions in planes are intermittently broken up by missions where you either pilot a helicopter, man the turret on a helicopter, or man the guns of a gunship. Oh, and there's one where you fly a bomber. Problem is, the control schemes were not optimized very well at all compared to when flying a fighter jet. The bombers handle like beluga swimming through jelly, and to add insult to injury they make you basically do an obstacle course in that aircraft for the one mission you get to fly it. Meanwhile the helicopters can maneuver decently but for whatever reason can't rotate left or right while precision aiming at targets, so you're left with no choice but to fire randomly while strafing. Also for some reason they think helicopters can barrel-rol without their propeller blades ripping into each other. And, of course, turret sections are, well, turret sections that add nothing to the story and are effetively action-packed story padding - just like Call of Duty!Oh, and there's a mulitplayer feature. But with how late this game's PC port was to the party, and the fact that it used to use GFWL, there's basically no one online.TL;DR: Bottom line, the trailer shows you pretty much everything the game has to offer. If that's what you like, then by all measn enjoy. But if you're a fan of previous Ace Combat titles like me, steer clear and wait for either a PC port of Ace Combat Infinity or for Namco-Bandai to finish milking Dark Souls so they can come back to this franchise. GET IT ON SALE, DO NOT BUY FULL PRICE.Pros:+ Gorgeous visuals+ Unleashing destruction in Dogfight and Airstrike Mode+ Aircraft variety (and you can mix and match secondary weapons)+ Soundtrack kicks some serious♥♥♥♥♥...Cons:- ...but the horrible song in the credits almost ruins it all- Generic 'Merica-versus-Russians story- Main antagonist's motivation is a generic revenge tale- Dogfight mode gets old fast- Planes magically unlock automatically in the story and you have little reason to try anything other than the F-22- Story missions generally give really vague objectives meaning even if you do what it says, more than likely it'll kill you anyway or randomly fail an objective and send you back to a checkpoint- Final boss is complete and total bullsh*t - He can lock 6 missiles on you at once WHILE YOU'RE BEHIND HIM- Has decent multiplayer features that aren't any use since no one plays this			"

												Love it! It's different from the previous games in the series (coming from an owner of AC3 and newer), but it's still good! The on-rails parts of the game do get annoying at times, but the game is quite entertaining. If you're a long-time Ace Combat player, it's different and won't be as good as the older ones, but if you're a new Ace Combat pilot, you'll thoroughly enjoy this game.I'd give this game a solid 7.5/10.

												Great game, awesome with friends. Easily fixable glitches.The campaign has a nice story so far. The combat is a mixture of a flight sim and a rail shooter. You get in close using standard flying, and then press a lock-on button to move into a rail shooter. This makes the combat easy to approach as well as fast paced without just constantly spinning in circles.Paint jobs on your craft are customizeable, though you can't use them in the campaign.Co-op missions are unlocked by playing through the campaign, and are really fun with friends.Multiple voice-over options, including Japanese.My friends are using xbox controllers, and have no complaints.I'm using dual flight stick. **Glitch Fix: ( http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Ace_Combat:_Assault_Horizon_-_Enhanced_Edition#Control_and_graphics_settings_reset_between_sessions )I don't recommend keyboard, it's super awkward.P.S.I hope you like long missions, cause the enemies just don't stop coming.

												Decent game, ok story (that means average) Found the forced qte events annoying. Forced, because you can't shoot the plane down, or progress, until you enter the close combat mode. That stuff is annoying, but ok in this case. As it isn't too many of those (unlike a certain Croft game) Graphics is OK, considering when it was made. On a side note.. being an artist myself, I always cringe when animators seem to think the neck joint is placed in front of the throat. Something I still see today *shudders*, but I digress. The game is 50/50,  you will probably enjoy or hate it.. depending on what you prefer in a fighter game. But on its own, the game is decent. The downside is playing with the keyboard. I suggest using a game pad, because it was made for it. And at 5 bucks (sale at time of writing) it isn't a bad game, regardless what may you end up thinking about it.			"

												I will share the same remarks as most people here.I used to play Ace Combat 3 hundreds of hours a long time ago.MissionsAC3 had various types of missions, like refuelling, night, escort missions, etc.Also there were special missions where you could go into space to blow satelites up, and then you had to make a renetry in the atmosphere a special way to not screw your UberSpaceShuttlePlane up.The missions in Assault Horizon lack diversity and they are dull.Except that sometimes there are side scrolling shooting missions, and I still wonder why.When I play AC, I want to FLY, not shoot shït up!GameplayIn AC3  there were crazy åss sci-fy planes that would fire plasma thingy, or would be extremely fast.There were secrets and hidden missions. And the Japanese version even had a story rich anime included in the game.But, comparing AC: Assault Horizon to AC3 is like comparing the original Rainbow Six to the New Vegas ones, or worst, CoD.AC3 was extremely rich in content.OversimplificationThe flying scheme is oversimplified, and I was wondering why I couldn't  stall much at first. My plane was levelling itself without me doing anything.Turns out there is somewhere in the controls, an 'optimum' option or whatnot.Switch that shït to 'original' and you got a popup telling you that you should better finish the game and be über pro first, warning, warning... wait wat?!Such warnings so I could just control my plane the way I want!? Like using the pedals and rolling at the same time without auto-leveling!? o.O;This very option pretty much sums up AC: Assault Horizon: it's an arcade 'flying' game for total n00bs.New dogfight featureSome tangos (with a 'leader' tag) are tough to splash if you don't lock on them and activate some kinda 'pursuit mode' where you do not control your plane no more and just shoot: your plane will follow the tango by itself.Of course the enemy will then have a scripted path so that you can take it down near pretty buildings and stuff.It's cool but... it's all fake.They really like rail shooter games, too bad I want to play a FLYING game.However, I gotta say, there are good idea beyond this new feature.Tango planes can also initiate a dog-fight with you, and then it's up to you to loose them, or do some crazy tricks, like slowing down so that you end up behind then and engage a counter-dogfight.Cool, but it'd rather do this MYSELF, without the need to 'activate' this feature.Hollywood styleBig budget game with big explosions and particles everywhere, and bling...We got many cutscenes, a story and a plot, voice acting, etc.But it's all... bad. The actors lines are cliche as fûck. When flying I seriously can't concentrate because the friendlies are chatting like an asian pack of women all the time. Of course it's not even funny ""you will owe me a beer, you'll see"" which in turn you, the leader, being all cool and serious and stuff reply ""Tone it down guise. We got a mission.""...COME ON!This is just lame, just stop it, just, just ... stop...Realism?I mean, the Ace Combat franchise is not a simulation, and is definitely an arcade style game. But still...I can crash my plane on the ground, and it will BOUNCE BACK (!) with a Critical Damage warning. WTF.Looks like we regain health / repair ourselves over time too... omg.I'm not asking for a simulation like X-Plane, but damn man. AC3 was crazy, and had a futuristic environment and planes and stuff, but there was no MAGIC!So AC: AH wants to be all realistic and stuff, and have a uh.. 'serious' story, but my planes bounce on da ground? And I regain health? I see there a contradiction your honor.MusicAC3 had seriously awesome tracks. I even tried to rip then when I was a kid, ending up with 22khz mp3 that sounded like crap.Do I need to say that AC: AH has got nothing? There is no emotions in the tracks.They are typical american hollywood war movies.ConclusionIf you are new to the genre, and flying games, then by all means, do buy the game and have fun.But if you are looking for an Ace Combat game, just don't do it!This game doesn't have the soul of our beloved AC3, that had such an awesome gameplay and musics.It's like playing CoD when you want a tactical shooter. It's just not working.			"

If you want this because you enjoyed Shattered Skies then you will more than likely be dissapointed. The very scripted battles, the generally terrible non-plane-combat missions... I don't can't even really describe why this game bothers me so much, but as a huge fan of Ace Combat 4 I was extremely  dissapointed.			"

												A departure from the rest of the series, but actually not too bad if you don't compare it to its predecessors. That just about sums up the entire experience as a whole. The single-player campaign takes place in the real world this time and is the first of the series to remove the player from the ""silent protagonist"" position. This is probably the single worst aspect of the game's setting, though there's much more to complain about as the story goes on (and ends). Unfortunately for Ace Combat fans, this isn't an enjoyable story.The gameplay is hit or miss. At first, the new DFM mode that latches you onto enemy aircraft is extremely annoying because enemies marked as TGT_LEAD are usually invulnerable until they take you for a ride between some buildings or otherwise show you a spectacle. The mode itself isn't terrible, and it isn't an auto-win; It's easy enough for enemies to break away, and the game of cat and mouse can be pretty exciting. Fans of gun kills will be disappointed, though; The traditional (useful) gunsight is gone, replaced with a static crosshair that doesn't lead targets, and the gun itself is pretty weak and unreliable to aim in DFM mode.The graphics are beautiful, if more than a little overdone on the HDR front, and the game is not limited to 1920x1200 like the trailer says; You can crank it up to any resolution you want, including Surround View / EyeFinity resolutions. There isn't much in the way of graphics settings beyond resolution, vsync and anti-aliasing, however, and there are no specific PC-only graphics features other than those. Even so, disintegrating enemy aircraft with the ""steel carnage"" system is impressive to watch at higher resolutions.The music and sound design are overall pretty amazing as usual. There are a few tracks that don't really impress me, but overall it sets the tone pretty well. There's a fair departure here from previous games in the series as well, though, with the music generally taking on a grittier tone, though the orchestral tracks are still there. The creaking and snapping of metal as part of the ""steel carnage"" system is a great touch as well.The multiplayer is where this game both shines and falls flat. When the connection is good, between good players, the game is a blast to play. While it has only four game modes, they're extremely well done. However, the netcode is very poor, and DFM mode suffers for it. It's entirely possible to be chasing someone in DFM mode only to stop in mid-air for a second and find yourself slamming into buildings and the turf because the game decided that in order for you to get to your enemy's new position, it had to rubber band you in a straight line towards them. Another problem with it is what I call skipping; If an enemy starts DFM with you, particularly if you're in an attacker, you merely need to point your nose at the ground and pull up at the last instant. No matter how far back they hang or how careful they are, they'll either have to disengage or eat the dirt. It's entirely possible to completely kill other players this way.Issues with lag aside, the game is rife with cheaters using trainers to fire infinite flares or missiles with no downtime. A good player can overcome this, but it seriously degrades the game's fun factor. As a result, there aren't that many people actually playing the game online anymore, which is sad because it actually is a lot of fun when it works.Still, while this isn't the Ace Combat game everyone wanted, it's not a terrible game overall. It has its problems, and a lot of the new things they tried with it didn't work out, but that doesn't stop it from being a lot of fun. Now, if only Namdai would release an Ace Combat HD collection with online multiplayer...			"

												Who need ultra realism or just realism in flight simulators when you can have fun addictive arcade'ish gameplay? No one. So, about this game. Have you played mig-29 fulcrum, from nova logic? Imagine the same but with even more arcadish physics/controls, ai automatically performing combat turn, and also high presence of drugs a.k.a. close-up dogfighting.Top if with voice acting and interesting story and here you go - AC: AS. I like it. Alot. Although it doesn't stand as close to older installments in series, it still holds up as proof that for a fun plane game you don't need to go all the way up with realism.			"

												Despite it not being a title worthy of the name ""Ace Combat,"" It's still a decently fun game. The Dogfight mode was an interesting mechanic, but it runs it's course very fast. Like 2 hours in. The story is terrible. Granted, the story of previous iterations wasn't jaw dropping amazing, but AC4, 5, and Zero stand out as some of the more interesting story lines. I enjoy the lore too.I applaud them for trying something new at least, but at the end of the day the game is built around the dogfight mode mechanic, and as fun as it is initially, it becomes a meddlesome headache to endure.All in all, pick it up on sale if you want some dog fighting arcade style play.

												The be clear, I have played abouth 20 minutes of this game, so maybe I don't have that much say, but maybe that fact says a lot in it self. This game is boring, plain and simple. The gameplay is easy, the controls are simple and the experience is bland. The simple controls make it so that you never actually feel like you're steering something flying, as losing your handle of the aircraft is virtually impossible, etc. The viewpoint of the game, FOV, as some call it, is too close to the plane - further increasing the feeling that you aren't really flying.

												Bit of a letdown considering the surprisingly good story-driven Ace Combats of the past. In short the story is a pathetically cliched jingoistic mess barely worth of CoD. The gameplay is pretty standard AC fare for the most part, however a rather boring and sometimes frustrating dogfight mode mars the enjoyment. The helicopter missions are at first an interesting change of pace but quickly become repetetive and dull. On the plus side it looks reaaaaally nice for the most part, and they mercifully removed the god-awful GFL rubbish. If you like the Ace Combat or Hawx series this is worth getting in a sale. All in all it's an okay game if you just wanna blow some planes up really.			"

												This game should have never been made. I'll review the game in the form of a pros and cons list, but with a brief preface. I refuse to compromise my experience in a flight sim. I don't care if a dev or community says ""It's meant to be played with gamepad!"" or ""It's not good for a stick"". I don't care. I expect my flight sims to work well with a stick, and when they don't, that's an incomplete game to me. I was not able to get very far without quitting due to frustration.PROS+Graphics are great. Naturally better than the consoles due to being on PC+Actual menu options+Similar HUD style to the console ACE gamesCONS-Atrocious controls, the game will abscond with aileron control if you so much as even think about not being 100% level with the ground-Bad joystick optimization. It's either oversensitive or undersensitive and the default button layout is pretty bad, IMHO.-Weird key mapping. Controls and commands are not clustered for your fingers' convenience or by similarity in function or frequency of use. If you expect to use a keyboard, get the stretchy guy from Fantastic 4 to help out.-Storyline is thin gruel. Voicework, story, setting, and characters are all 100% generic or overdone. It is the opposite of ACE 04, which had an interesting story and method of delivering it and an effective, interesting cast of characetsr (that interestingly enough didn't really include the player)-Dogfight sequences. It's like a bad on-rails shooter sequence that makes you control the rails as well as shoot, and you can't damage a lot of important enemies outside of this sequence.-You are required to pay money to experience this. Goat Simulator is much cheaper (ignoring current sale price) and is far more intuitive and motivating			"

												As an Ace Combat game, it's not great. Assault Horizon does away with the pretty in depth fictional universe that the Ace series was known for on PS2. Gone are Mobius Squadron, Razgriz, Thunderhead, Skye Eye, and the various fictional countries with their histories. This is basically MURIKA VERSUS THE TERRORISTS like you'd see in CoD or the like, only in planes. It's pretty silly and modern war-sy, but it's tolerable.As an action / arcade dogfight game though, it's fun. It still maintains the ""Planes carry absurd amounts of missiles"" feature from the Ace series, and the graphics are pretty awesome. Not only that, but as scripted feeling and over the top action movie-ish the new Dog Fight Mode may be, it can still be fun at times. Weaving between buildings, struggling to maintain a lock, and peppering an enemy fighter with cannon fire is genuinely thrilling. I can't say I'm a big fan of the helicopter levels, nor the AC-130 one (Because what modern war game would be complete without an AC-130 level?), but in terms of overall enjoyability, I liked it. It was worth buying on sale, and while it may not be as amazing as 4/5/Zero, it's worth a look if you just want to fly around and take down entire wings of planes with your Ultimate Hero Guy abilities.

The controls are by far the worst thing however, not because i suck at plane games. Because this games controls are near enought unplayable without either a joystick or a controller. (yes i know D:) The games mechanics are not on par with even the old games and the fov is terrible and almost unplayable, giving you motion blur wherever possible with a healthy dose of lock on spam, just what we all needed... I can only recommend if you have a controller, and no other flight game liek tom clanceys Hawx or the old games. Its just better for your health and your wallet to go and play warthunder, its a free to play (with perfect flight controls) overall 4/10 (not god-awefull, but my god its just a console game from the very begining)			"

I am sitting here with a great wireless x-box type controller and wireless joystick plus a fantastic gaming keyboard. I use them all but when flying, I expect to use a stick, it's just natural. X-box type are great for AA3, Alien vs Preditor, hitman, metro, Doom3, left for dead etc.,etc., but for flying, I expect to use a stick. After all, it is a form of flight simulator >> right??? I don't have a problem with people flying SIMs with controllers and keyboards but how hard would it be to write in lines of code to have a stick option for people like me and there are a LOT of people like me???????   The other problems I have and I only played 20 minutes or so are these. It seems like you ALWAYS start and end ""in flight"", no landings or take offs. Also, no refueling or anything???? Maybe I missed something that might be in there but I don't think so. From what I can see (and I really never got past the tuitorial stage before being bored to insanity) all you do is fly, shoot and die. Where's the fun???? I could be wrong but, lacking a joystick option, I don't have the patience to dig any deeper into the game. I woud rather fly the slow, prop spinning, tail draggers on Ace's High.    I don't know if anyone out there remembers ""JANE'S USAF"" or ""Eurofighter 2000"" but those were ""GAMES"". Especially JANE'S,,,,, fantastic flight sims. I still have them and keep a beefed up Windows 98SE computer around just for them.    As far as this Ace Combat, if I had paid full price, I would be fighting for a refund. I'll just let it sit in my ""library"" and collect dust.    I just want to say that I have made a lot of purchases through Steam over the years and this is my first disappointment..			"

												As an avid player of the Ace Combat series I had high hopes for this title. The game is nearly unplayable. It's dogfighting mode is possibly the worst gimmick to come to any flight sim game since TOP GUN for the NES. Good luck trying to shoot down enemy aircraft or avoiding enemy aircraft with it. The aircraft handling seems like you're trying to fly the Exxon Valdez and the transition to dogfighting mode can literally whip you 180 in an instant to dogfight. It's like they based the entire game around that mechanic.  "

												Definitely not the best Ace Combat game ever but its the only one on pc, but that doesnt mean its a bad game at all. The game is kinda all over the place because its more of a test to see how new mechanics work than an actual new Ace Combat game but in the end it is still an Ace Combat game on pc.			"

												This entirety of the plane based combat in this game was merely a series of quicktime events. There was little to no influence on the outcome of a mission based on the player's piloting skills as everything was determined by how good your timing is in an extremely dull and unfulfilling interactive cutscene. When there are so many other quality arcade/flight sims on steam there is no justification for playing. Even when it was free.			"

												I love the ace combat series...or should i say loved. I started with ace combat 4 shattered skys, and if your looking for a truely fantastic game I suggest you pick that one up, there's nothing quite like the story in that game, and by the end mission every time the radio crackled with chatter from other pilots it would send a shiver up my spine. similarly six was a very good game as well but this....this isn't ace combat. First and formost I was very excited for multiplayer co-op, however if your like me and you were hoping to jump into it right away, don't bother. you need to unlock missions first, not to mention single player is the only way to learn some of the core mechanics and controls. it's not a big deal a minor gripe really. this reallly sets the tone for the game however, a sad clunky mess. the dogfight mechanic is more annoying then anything else. I like that they tried something new, and the effects given to this is neat...but it quickly loses it's appeal and it seems to compensate or more likely FORCE people to use it, missles and specials seem ALOT less accurate...it also seems to me that specials seem almost completely useless in air to air unlike previous games which is disappointing. it's simply easier to fly up behind an enemy and dogfight them, likewise countering a plane flying after you is stupidly easy too...and while it seems they were really trying to intensify the action it seems instead I end up fighting with the controls more then the targets. likewise the story is unappealing, it's personal preference but I prefered the non real places, it allowed them much more freedom with the plot, the characters themselves have no real life to them unlike the previous games. all in all playing this game makes me wish I was playing one of the previous games instead. If you like the previous ace combat games stay away from this.			"

												Ace Combat Assault Horizon... where to begin.If youre interested in buying this game because you've played past Ace Combat games, please take the time to read this review.You will not find the Ace Combat experience you've come to know and love from this game. This is not Ace Combat; Its little more than an arcade shooter masquerading as a successor to Ace Combat 6, simple as that. If you've played the past games and have loved the sim style, then avoid this game, as its now focused more to an arcade style. That coupled with a lackluster story have me dissapointed in Assault Horizon. If you're new to the Ace Combat franchise and are looking for cheep and easy arcade sim, this game might be for you; but buyer beware, it might not be worth it even then.			"

												The good : - Visuals, particularly destructive side of animation- Music, even if a little repetitiveThe bad : - Controls (particularly the helicopter). Turning is ridiculously slow, regardless of mouse sensitivity settings (took 6 or so swipes across the mouse pad to do 180 degree turn, and that is at max sensitivity on mouse and in game)- Lack of even smallest dose of realism. I know the game is not meant to be a proper sim, but still... While DFM mode is somewhat bearable in that respect, and I can overlook the fact of having 600+ missiles (!!!) loadout, the fact that when fighting one on one in certain part of the game (no other enemies on the sky), the opponent was able to lock and fire multiple missiles while I was tailing DIRECTLY behind him is just ridiculous. Since when fighter jets can fire in reverse ???- Murrica' factor.  Good americans, bad russians. And the good russians that suddenly need american help with literally everything. Murrica saves the world again ...All things considered, I would still recommend it, as there will be good number of people who will like this game. Especially players with gamepads. Entertaining, and easy enough to play. Fans of ""real"" simulators (DCS or such), give this one a pass. No way to use proper flight controller, and physics are just made up :)			"

												No one is happier than me that Ace Combat finally made a debut on PC, but Assault Horizon was not the title to do it with. Ace Combat's strong point, since Ace Combat 2, has been its strong singleplayer with spine-chilling stories of just-unreal-enough jet capers to keep the mythos of the unique Ace Combat world alive and believable.Ace Combat: Assault Horizon's spineless story falls on its face, and I'm not saying that just because I'm partial to the alternate world presented in Ace Combats 2-6, Zero, X, Xi and 3D. Assault Horizon's campaign simply a cookie-cutter CoD story with your average, predictable shooter drama.That being said, multiplayer is genuinely fun and presents a new challenge than just shooting down mooks by the thousands. Dogfight Mode, although it kind of nerfs single player, I think is a necessary evil for multiplayer--it keeps players in the game and prevents campers from hiding on the edges of the mape with long-range missiles. That's when anyone is on, that is--Games for Windows Live means almost no one wants to play online. Fingers crossed that once it's completely phased out I'll be seeing more challengers on the server list!Great graphics, especially with the high frame-rates afforded by the PC.All in all, I would recommend this game once Steamworks is fully implemented.Dance with the angels!

												I love the Ace combat series.... well, i did for the episodes on PS2, since i skipped the 360-PS3 era. So, i was enthusiastic when i  knew of Assault Horizon on Pc. Not for long though; this game is such a disappointment, and so different from the original Ace Combat - in fact, this is mostly a clone of HAWX2, which is not a compliment. Bad storyline with russian rebels as villains? Check. Missions way too long, way too boring and spent mostly moving in circles to avoid enemies or missiles? Check. Multiplayer only half working? Check.... even though they are fixing that by switching off from GFWL, or so they say. I could say something positive about the actual dogfighting, which is not too bad... if it was not that, halfway trough the 4th mission, i noticed that the ""duel mode"" (which is the *only* way to kill certain enemies) is often used as a gimmick to show the admitedly nice graphic in forced cut scene. Basically, once in a while the enemy in the duel mode becomes invincible, no matter how many times you hit it, because this way the enemy plane can lead you to certain point of the map to show an action scene. Once you understand how it works, you cant avoid rolling your eyes to the sky. I dont suggest this game.... unless its on a deal for 5$ or less. Otherwise, you are better served by playing HAWX1, JASF, the old but still somehow fun Rebel Raiders or the ps2x-emulated series of ace combat from 4 to 6.			"

												This is an Arcade game and nothing like any of the previous Ace Combat games I have played (And I have played them all from the first on PS1 to this♥♥♥♥♥♥) And I loved them all (At the time) This game forces the player to use some sort of lock on mechanic.... where your plane will automatically stay on the tail of the enemy plane and will basically act like a cinematic or quick time event. Requiring no skill what so ever to shoot down the plane you are automatically tailing. And even worse off... if you don't use this mechanic... the enemy planes will godmode... no matter how many missiles you fire at the target and no matter how many of them hit. The targeted plan will not die unless you use the autopilot thing.... Which really just makes the game pointless and no fun since it can all be played in a quicktime event. Though I will admit I didn't get far into the game due to my disgust of how it played for the first two missions... (You are armed with 300 missiles... yes that is normal for Ace Combat, but when you use 50 of them on one plane and 80% of all those missiles hit and the plane does not die I have to call this game♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Horrible control scheme, next to no mouse support, flying jets is done purely by keyboard. The story feels slapped together, and makes plaing campaign almost cringe-worthy. The cinematics are the only real redeaming quality, but they can become dificult to admire when fighting the restrictions of the controlls just to stay alive at times. Wouldnt reccomend it unless the controlls were seariously reworked (for example, all roll is done automatically, the player cant make the jet roll on his/her own accord) and some of the animations were fixed. Apache's shouldnt be doing barrel rolls at 10 meters above ground to dodge rockets. The game is riddles with quick-time events and dogfighting is just a quick-time  event mini-game.			"

												What else do you have to do on a weekday night waiting for the unevitably better Ace Combat Infinity to release on PlayStation Network in full, glorius English? Oh. You want to buy this game.Well Ace Cobmat Assault Horizon is a very special game. You fly around in a plane that autopilots you towards your enemies while all you do is sit back, gun, and shoot missiles. This game basically wants you to enjoy the explosions happening around you and make you feel like some badass pilot, but in reality you're occasionally tilting your stick, holding down one button, and when you hear the right sound you want, press the other button.Let's get down to the meat. You're a pilot who's scared of dying or something so he pisses his pants everytime he's about to die, but also tries to stay badass. He doesn't know who the ♥♥♥♥ he is and you'll lose track of his internal conflict after the first mission because he barely talks about it again until the end of the game. Some Russian group is up to no good and you got to beat them up. So pick your plane out of the preset ""please use these planes because they don't break the mission"" list, then you're off. Oh wait, that's not every mission. Some missions require you to be in a helicopter that can take collisions into buildings and other missions make you be the machine gunner on the helicopter. That's cool but it's not Ace Combat.Ace Combat is about jerking off to people calling you the legendary beast or having some Spanish guitar in the background strumming a catchy chorus while you ejaculate over the screen to some female saying that she doesn't want to fight a war. In this game, you're Beef McTruckHam fighting for the greater American good with some heavy thrashing music in the background every other level.Levels get frustrating as you may get annoyed by the DFM system and end up not holding a button long enough to shoot something to death. Other times you get distracted by optional enemies during a sudden timelimit. This game gets frustrating and you'll probably only replay 3 or 4 missions.So should you buy this?Yeah, but don't treat it like an Ace Combat game. Treat it like you're playing Call of Duty in the skies, because that is what it'll ever be.			"

												Ace Combat Assault Horizon... where to begin.If youre interested in buying this game because you've played past Ace Combat games, please take the time to read this review.You will not find the Ace Combat experience you've come to know and love from this game. This is not Ace Combat; Its little more than an arcade shooter masquerading as a successor to Ace Combat 6, simple as that. If you've played the past games and have loved the sim style, then avoid this game, as its now focused more to an arcade style. That coupled with a lackluster story have me dissapointed in Assault Horizon. If you're new to the Ace Combat franchise and are looking for cheep and easy arcade sim, this game might be for you; but buyer beware, it might not be worth it even then.			"

												Imagine if one day Michael Bay decided he wanted to direct the next Top Gun; that the story would be penned by a japanese writer and that there would be no limits to spend on special effects.That's basically Assault Horizon, and it's basically what makes it so great.Sit back, relax, enjoy the light show of billion-dollar jets dogfighting at incredible speeds and with impossible, neck breaking maneuvers; feel the thrill of chasing down a bandit at ground level through a city only to end in a cinematic kill.This is why I loved this (a bit short) game, and I *love* flight sims.

												The single player campaign is too Call of Dutyified for it's own good, with too many scripted moments and a truly horrible AC 130 mission. It does still have some great moments though, but where the game really shines is in it's Capital Conquest multiplayer mode, a large scale battle where all classes of aircraft are necessary. There are also co-op, deathmatch and domination modes.			"

												I see a great deal of ""Not Recommended"" in the reviews, and it seems a great many of them tout faulty controls as a game breaker. I will tell you right now, the default controls are designed to appeal to the kind of person who has never played a flight simulator. If you go through the control menus, you will find an option to revert to a more traditional flight simulator. Something to take the majority of the game ""off the rails"" as it were. There will still be the occasional track shooting section, as the gunner of an AC-130, or a Blackhawk, but the meat of the game, the flying, will feel considerably more natural. This was a mistake on the developers part, to default to a more infantile method of control scheme, while bearing the relatively trusted name of ACE COMBAT, but to err is human.That being said, if you are looking for a tight, hardcore, physically sound, flight simulator, you will likely be disappointed. However, if you are a video game enthusiast, and are looking for a fun experience, this game is certainly worth a try. The game opens powerfully, focusing primarily on a hyperbolic view of dogfighting, but quickly spreads out to encompass other methods of flight to simulate. Before you know it, you'll find yourself in the seat of an AH-64 Longbow, as new mechanics are introduced. Then, you will make use of the aforementioned AC-130. Make no mistake, this is an attempt to broaden the horizons of the series, and draw in a more ""action-phile"" crowd. As I've seen, video game elitists hate things like this. I hope this explains the majority of the negative reviews, but if you're on Steam, you've seen the state of the internet, and you know that some people like to gripe, as they lack other methods of communicating.The tl;dr of it, I found this to be a fun game, full of amusing content, and wrought with controller breaking challenge. Admittedly, the story is bland, but I defy you to find a war game that has a truly scintillating and hereto for untold story. Take a chance, make sure to change the control scheme, and test your mettle. I wasn't disappointed, and I don't think you will be either.			"

												Ace Combat Assualt Horizon Enhanced Edition. What can I say about this game that most haven't already said about it already? Well for one this is one of the only games I actually bought off steam on release because I was a fan of the ace combat from the Playstation era and I saw a bunch of previews as well a friend on steam had it. I wasn't dissappointed with the game. It met most of my expectations.+ Gameplay - great gameplay. It simulates a good dog fight what you would expect (at least what I imagine an actually air combat dog fight would look like)+ Variety of planes - This game has a whole selection of planes, and even helicopters. As well as a range of weapons from Air-Air missles and Air-Ground missles+ Story isn't too complexe but it gives the game some plot that makes it interesting enough to want to see it through to the end. +Graphics - The graphics are top notch for a game of this genre. The cockpit view is astonishing though I wished they'd make taking off and landing a bit more complex to give it an actuall sim feel. Though I didn't like the obstruction in some of the cockpits of some of the fighter jets as it made that view unplayable but I also liked how u could swivel your head and look around in that view. Now some of the negatives. Albeit I thought and read at the time that normal difficulty wasn't the way to play this game as it made things a bit too easy. So I went full out and had it on elite. The first half of the game was exillerating as it made things intense and in Elite your jet didn't recover from damages as opposed to the other difficulty modes. So if you're looking for a good challange then I suggest you go this mode and its ment for veterns of the series. This is a plus and some what a negative. The DFM or (Dog Fight Mode) its the selling point to this game but I think its more of a gimmick. Well on the higher diffuculty its a must to get into this combat mode as it makes taking down enemies a neccessity as without DFM you'd have to expend a ton crap of missles to take down one or two enemies. But overall DFM mode on easier difficulties made the game too easy, and to continue on my first playthrough on Elite it became so frustrating during the Spooky mission where you were in a B2 bomber doing bombing run and helping out ground units. I kept dying and it♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off that I stopped playing this game but eventually I came back and preservered and then I came onto another hurdle in Elite that frustrated me so much that I had to bumb it down to Ace mode, it was also another non fighter jet mission which seems to be a trend. I get that they wanted to expand on the story and give the series a change of pace but the combat in the chopter and the B2- and stealth bomber missions just made the game feel off and it broke up the pacing of the game. That's also a Plus for this game as you can set the difficulty at any mission. But that also leads me to one of the biggest negatives of the game:- Different missions that require non-fighter jets.These missions over stay their welcome imo. You're introduced early on to a black hawk chopper which at first wasn't bad but the missions length go on and on. When you think its done they throw one or two final objectives and thats through out the game its just in non fighter jet missions these become tidiuous chores rather than fun objectives. Overall this is a fun game and it made me feel like I was actually pilioting and dog fighting. The fights were intense and the wide range of vehicles makes it enjoyable. I give this a 8.5/10 its worth a buy and I haven't really bought any game off release besides a couple but this is one of the games I would happily purchase full price again.			"

												This game sucks. Not because it isn't like the other Ace Combat games, but because it fails to do so many things adequately. The slow motion kill cam ruins your ability to do strafing runs when you're hitting ground targets. Certain game sequences just throw you in there without ever introducing the mechanic by which you're supposed to progress. The ♥♥♥♥ing difficulty bounces back and forth from being exceptionally easy to just plain infuriating. Friendly AI controlled pilots are utterly ♥♥♥♥ing worthless. I admit I rage quit from this game near the end.  Punched and broke my keyboard in the process :( It was just too infuriating. The game told me to ignore the enemy bomber's escorts, and then I would get targetted by EVERY ♥♥♥♥ING ESCORT without friendly AI planes doing anything to support me.			"

												Ace Combat Assult Horizon ""Enhanced"" Edition is one of the worst games I have ever played. As far as graphics go, it's pretty good, but gameplay becomes repetitive, and instead of being fun it just becomes tedious. This game is just Call of Duty in airplanes. There are several missions where you sit in a helicopter turret and shoot enemy infantry. Having a few moments of this that go on for maybe 3 minutes would be fine, but I found myself sitting there, gunning down countless enemies for forty minutes. FORTY MINUTES! However, most of the game is not like that. For most of the game, you are instead piloting your jet fighter and shooting down other aircraft. The controls are easy to learn and easy to use. That is the only good aspect of the game. Every level of this game is drawn out to the point that when you think ""This is a good point for the level to end,"" you get another wave of enemies to kill. And another, and another, until you just get bored of it and uninstall the game, never to come back to it. Also, to add insult to injury, this game defies the laws of physics. You can do a barrel roll in a helicoptor. So to wrap up my review, I will leave you with this: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. It would be much easier to just burn your wallet.			"

This game however is basicaly played for you while you sit and wonder why 12 missiles are like BBs bouncing off the side of a tank. I kinda liked the story but the gameplay is depressing. The end battle is absolutly terrible. Six trillion missiles and 3 Million Railed ""Dogfights"" later you shoot a missile and win. Lovely. Don't waste your money. I got it on sale for $3 and some change and thats not even worth it. I miss that $3 and some change. That could have been $3 and some Change worth of KitKats......			"

												Terrible game. The way the gameplay is set up makes all the dog fight encounters run on autopilot, so it’s super easy. The story line was decent, though not as interesting as other Ace Combat's in the past. There is no buying and selling of aircrafts or weapons - they're all just given to you. Each aircraft has so many missiles; it’s beyond ridiculous - like 200+ missiles, and 40+ special missiles, plus infinite machine gun. Overall I found the game too easy during most encounters and frustratingly dumb in other parts.What is so hard to understand, Project Aces? I want Ace Combat 4, with new airplanes, updated graphics, and new missions. That’s it. Stop experimenting with these stupid game play changes. "

												DO NOT BUY!!!I remember playing Top Gun for the GameCube and loving it.  So when I saw this on sale I thought ""Hmm, it would be nice to play an updated version of Top Gun"", thinking it would be kinda similar.  Well, after speding hours troubleshooting (navigating through crappy Microsoft software) I finally got the game to launch. 5 minutes into the tutorial mission I quit because I couldn't handle how bad it was.  Over sensitive controls, terrible control scheme and directions and horrific and unrealistic voice acting make me want to say that it was the worst game I've ever played.  I much rather would have spent my money on 4 more copies of Terraria than this.  Most ancient arcade games are better.In short, this game is not worth $2 much less $10.  So don't waste your money.

												AC:AH handles like the usual Ace Combat formula with the bombast and overzealous scripting of the latest Call of Duty games thrown in. Numerous times the game uses it's on-rails Dogfight Mode (DFM) or it's even more restrictive cousin Airstrike Mode to force the player to fly under -that- collapsing smokestack or -that- inexplicable jumbo jet, completely irrespective of the direction or location in which it was initiated. Allies/enemies vanish and materialise as the mission scripting decrees, or are completely invulnrable until they become a later mission objective. The DFM is also lacking in options for the player; you can just hold MG and accelerate and watch the pretty colours.The (apparently) mandatory AC-130 level, the door gunner sections and the helicopter gunship bits, I'm afraid I can't speak fairly on them. Generally I slogged through them until I got my jet back, and certainly wasn't taking notes, other than to say the ground /building textures weren't designed for hovering that close to them.The story is, well, the typical ""US saves the world from someone who wants specifically to attack the US"" fare we've seen everywhere since CoD 4. The comms chatter and recurring callsigns that has always made allies seem interesting is still there, but sparser and sandwiched in between asking for help and spontaneous bravado. The sense of edging along with a ground war is missing from the AC formula too - your team can hop between continent as if on an extended holiday, and the sense of bring under threat suffers. I didn't feel much attachment to the callsign either; Warwolf's leader is no Mobius One. As good as the real-world setting is, I feel Strangereal is a better setting for these games.I'm giving it a negative rating, but that's not to say a bad game. The combat is wonderfully involving in its freeform state, with an excellently majestic soundtrack (Kieki Kobayashi et al doing what they do best), a great selection of planes and enough variation in weapon loadouts / handling / mission objectives to keep it fresh. There's some character to all four members of your flight, as well as the allied squadrons and land-dwelling elements, and even the traditional objective-dispensing AWACS operator has some colour to him.In summary, what's good is most of the parts I liked from AC's 4 and 6 (you can even get the Estovakian fictional superplane from AC6, in original Strigon Squadron colours), and the parts i disliked were clearly taken wholesale from CoD and grafted around the Ace Combat experience. People looking to get the thrill arcade digfighters give would do well to look at JASF (interesting story idea there) or look to play Fires of Liberation.			"

												Graphically, it's a very shameless console port with literally NO settings apart from vsync, resolution, and AA being on/off. At least it isn't a demanding console port.Gameplay wise - if you want a real combat flight sim, stay away from this game. If you've always wanted a Battlefield mode where everyone just flies a jet, then this is the game for you! It's a fun arcade fighter jet game where you just fly around giving the middle finger to the laws of physics (in an entertaining way). And with no infantry using Stinger missiles to shoot you down :P (even if there are, you have flares from the start). Buy this game on sale. Also, it has completely stripped out GFWL (good job Namco), which was the #1 thing holding me off a purchase at first.			"

												Well, I bought this game on a special promotion and since I am an Ace Combat veteran, I had to get it. I was a little nervous about buying an Ace Combat game for the PC and it appears that I was rightly so. This one is not your typical Ace Combat game. There is a new dogfighting mode, helicopter piloting and door gunning. My first challenge was to get control of the game. The jet fighter was easy enough (grab my PS2 controller with pc adapter, plug in and configure), but for the helicopter and gunner sequences, that controller didn't cut it. I had to configure my Belkin n52te controller in concert with my mouse to accurately control the helicopter and the mouse was really key to being effective with the gunner sequences. Once I got a handle on the controls, the fun began. Flying the jet for me was pretty much a blast from the past. Machine guns, missiles, special weapons, etc... all there. DFM (Dog Fighting Mode), however, was a new one on me. In the past, there were enemies that were better than the other ones and if you killed them, you got medals and such. Well, on this game there are lead targets and the only way you can take them out is by following them until you can activate the DFM and shoot them down. There have been mixed reactions to the DFM, I personally have no problem with it and it does come in handy in many situations. Also, you can BE engaged by an enemy in DFM. In this instance, there is a little button that can be pushed at the right time that will perform a dizzing evasive manuver that will put you behind the plane and you then have your chance to shoot it down. Pretty sweet to me, I like it. Also, the other new feature is flares. Someone fires a missle at you, deploy flares and turn to evade. Simple enough. The jet fighter sequences are definately enjoyable. Helicopter flying is a different story. I HAD to get my n52te and mouse to fly this thing effectively. There was no way that my PS2 controller or my keyboard was going to cut it on this one. I had to be able to turn, hover to the left or right and be able to fire at the same time. That was too much of a challenge for a PS2 controller. So, once I got a handle on controlling it effectively, I had fun with it. There is your turrent gun, rockets and air-to-ground missiles. Once you learn how to control the helicopter well, it is just as enjoyable as the jet fighter sequences. And the dialogue from the helicopter pilot will crack you up on occasion. :-)Door gunning is fairly simple. You have a set of cross-hairs that you put on the enemy and shoot. Right mouse button zooms in. Shoot all enemies. Shoot, kill, kill, kill, shoot, kill, kill, kill. The mouse will assist you with more accurate shots than the keyboard or controllers will. Once you get into it, you'll love it.Overall, this is a successful game. The controls took a lot of getting used to, but once you got the hang of it and customized the controls to your playing style, you'll love it. Buy it with confidence.			"

												its pretty much the same as the previous Ace Combat's only really difference is that the story ode is shocking and the new combat system which demands you to buy a controller Overall I had a blast blowing up the A.I. with an unrealistick reloading system but it is better than ' flight simulator x ' by far			"

												Game was fun on Xbox but is unplayable on PC. When you change control settings to use mouse your aircraft gets stuck leveling out and makes the game unplayable. Keyboard is used for all menu navigation and default controls. Actual game isn't bad you just can't play it on the PC.			"

												Without a doubt, one of the worst flying games I've encountered. It's clearly a lazy console port, with no regard given to actual playablity with anything other than a console controller. There's no cursor in the menus, cutscene are ruined by the lack of ability to look around as you would with a controller, and any buttons onscreen flicker between joystick and keyboard options, leaving neither particularly clear to see.Your most difficult enemy will be the flight mechanics themselves, as you can't (fully) roll your plane, making most actual flying techniques impossible to pull of, and keeping track of the enemy whilst they constantly turn on the spot against you quickly becomes a chore.The helicopter controls are beyond explaination. I'm not sure how they'd work with a controller, but with a joystick, I don't think they could possibly be any further from the real controls of a helicopter. I can't really explain them, but let's just say that CoD: Black Ops did a better job of helicopter controls when they stuck on the Hind mission to mix things up a bit. Imagine that, but even worse.That's how the whole game feels: like it's a flight level that's been stuck onto a game that's got nothing to do with flying.And that's when I stopped playing. Good luck to those that buy it.			"

												If you can get the game on sale. I would totally recommend it. But I got it for less than 10 dollars, which is what I would say is the limit for this game. If you want this because you enjoyed Shattered Skies then you will more than likely be dissapointed. The very scripted battles, the generally terrible non-plane-combat missions... I don't can't even really describe why this game bothers me so much, but as a huge fan of Ace Combat 4 I was extremely  dissapointed.			"

												A departure from the rest of the series, but actually not too bad if you don't compare it to its predecessors. That just about sums up the entire experience as a whole. The single-player campaign takes place in the real world this time and is the first of the series to remove the player from the ""silent protagonist"" position. This is probably the single worst aspect of the game's setting, though there's much more to complain about as the story goes on (and ends). Unfortunately for Ace Combat fans, this isn't an enjoyable story.The gameplay is hit or miss. At first, the new DFM mode that latches you onto enemy aircraft is extremely annoying because enemies marked as TGT_LEAD are usually invulnerable until they take you for a ride between some buildings or otherwise show you a spectacle. The mode itself isn't terrible, and it isn't an auto-win; It's easy enough for enemies to break away, and the game of cat and mouse can be pretty exciting. Fans of gun kills will be disappointed, though; The traditional (useful) gunsight is gone, replaced with a static crosshair that doesn't lead targets, and the gun itself is pretty weak and unreliable to aim in DFM mode.The graphics are beautiful, if more than a little overdone on the HDR front, and the game is not limited to 1920x1200 like the trailer says; You can crank it up to any resolution you want, including Surround View / EyeFinity resolutions. There isn't much in the way of graphics settings beyond resolution, vsync and anti-aliasing, however, and there are no specific PC-only graphics features other than those. Even so, disintegrating enemy aircraft with the ""steel carnage"" system is impressive to watch at higher resolutions.The music and sound design are overall pretty amazing as usual. There are a few tracks that don't really impress me, but overall it sets the tone pretty well. There's a fair departure here from previous games in the series as well, though, with the music generally taking on a grittier tone, though the orchestral tracks are still there. The creaking and snapping of metal as part of the ""steel carnage"" system is a great touch as well.The multiplayer is where this game both shines and falls flat. When the connection is good, between good players, the game is a blast to play. While it has only four game modes, they're extremely well done. However, the netcode is very poor, and DFM mode suffers for it. It's entirely possible to be chasing someone in DFM mode only to stop in mid-air for a second and find yourself slamming into buildings and the turf because the game decided that in order for you to get to your enemy's new position, it had to rubber band you in a straight line towards them. Another problem with it is what I call skipping; If an enemy starts DFM with you, particularly if you're in an attacker, you merely need to point your nose at the ground and pull up at the last instant. No matter how far back they hang or how careful they are, they'll either have to disengage or eat the dirt. It's entirely possible to completely kill other players this way.Issues with lag aside, the game is rife with cheaters using trainers to fire infinite flares or missiles with no downtime. A good player can overcome this, but it seriously degrades the game's fun factor. As a result, there aren't that many people actually playing the game online anymore, which is sad because it actually is a lot of fun when it works.Still, while this isn't the Ace Combat game everyone wanted, it's not a terrible game overall. It has its problems, and a lot of the new things they tried with it didn't work out, but that doesn't stop it from being a lot of fun. Now, if only Namdai would release an Ace Combat HD collection with online multiplayer...			"

												Despite it not being a title worthy of the name ""Ace Combat,"" It's still a decently fun game. The Dogfight mode was an interesting mechanic, but it runs it's course very fast. Like 2 hours in. The story is terrible. Granted, the story of previous iterations wasn't jaw dropping amazing, but AC4, 5, and Zero stand out as some of the more interesting story lines. I enjoy the lore too.I applaud them for trying something new at least, but at the end of the day the game is built around the dogfight mode mechanic, and as fun as it is initially, it becomes a meddlesome headache to endure.All in all, pick it up on sale if you want some dog fighting arcade style play.

												The be clear, I have played abouth 20 minutes of this game, so maybe I don't have that much say, but maybe that fact says a lot in it self. This game is boring, plain and simple. The gameplay is easy, the controls are simple and the experience is bland. The simple controls make it so that you never actually feel like you're steering something flying, as losing your handle of the aircraft is virtually impossible, etc. The viewpoint of the game, FOV, as some call it, is too close to the plane - further increasing the feeling that you aren't really flying. Save yourself from some really boring gameplay by not buying this!			"

												I have very high acceptance of arcade games, meaning - mindless fun of shooting stuff, dodging missiles blowing things up. I don't mind fantasy settings and fantasy manouverablity of planes, that act more like UFOS than planes. With that ll said and done, I can't even play this game. I literally twisted my wrist inside out, using logitech extreme 3D pro, trying to control the craft. I speed up to put some distance between me and the enemy, because the SU35 seems to be flying at balloon speed, or I don't know, my aircraft (I'm guessing F22) 10x faster? I close on, launch 2 missiles and --- nothing?  Then I engage the so called ""dogfight mode"" or whatever, where the plane is literally 2 inches away from my cockipt and I shoot close range missiles and machine guns, while my eyes are tearing up from the in-out of focus special effects and explosions, while literally ripping apart my joystick. The game should have stayed on PS3, I can't recommend this, unless you want to get a carpal tunnel syndrome and don't mind hallucinating from blurred vision after you turn it off.			"

												So I had no idea a Ace Combat game was available for purchase on Steam until the free weekend on July 24th to July 27th. As a long time Ace Combat fan on consoles(mainly the Playstation and Xbox 360), I've gotta say, this is not a Ace Combat game, at least not what they used to be.This is a simplified version of Ace Combat for CoD kiddies. I had more fun playing the HAWX series. If you want a fighter jet game with a craptastic story and everything given to you, then here it is, but if you want more of a fun experience, I'd say look at the HAWX series and War Thunder.Would I recommend this game at all though? Yes, but even on the current sale of it being $5 USD, this game isn't worth even that. Dollar bin material is what this is.Oh and I tried it with both my keyboard/mouse and my Logitech F310, both work fine, but the controling of the jet is abysmal. The game works great for the port that it is.			"

												Generally, a fun game. It's a mixture of arcade sensibilities and modern military FPS-on-rails action. There are intermittant situations where a ""DFM / Dog Fight Mode"" needs to be employed while flying. The DFM mode at worst gets in the way of what would be an otherwise pleasantly polished arcade game. In short the DFM mode tries to be special, tries to be a frantic adrenaline driven mini-experience. Fortunately the need to engage DFM mode is uncommon. The game would be much better without it. Or at least if it had the option to turn it off. As is? It's alright.In closure, if you want an arcadey, non-serious game that features flying, modern combat machines, give this a whirl. The draw here is the easy going combat that doesn't take its self too seriously.			"

												As an Ace Combat game, it's not great. Assault Horizon does away with the pretty in depth fictional universe that the Ace series was known for on PS2. Gone are Mobius Squadron, Razgriz, Thunderhead, Skye Eye, and the various fictional countries with their histories. This is basically MURIKA VERSUS THE TERRORISTS like you'd see in CoD or the like, only in planes. It's pretty silly and modern war-sy, but it's tolerable.As an action / arcade dogfight game though, it's fun. It still maintains the ""Planes carry absurd amounts of missiles"" feature from the Ace series, and the graphics are pretty awesome. Not only that, but as scripted feeling and over the top action movie-ish the new Dog Fight Mode may be, it can still be fun at times. Weaving between buildings, struggling to maintain a lock, and peppering an enemy fighter with cannon fire is genuinely thrilling. I can't say I'm a big fan of the helicopter levels, nor the AC-130 one (Because what modern war game would be complete without an AC-130 level?), but in terms of overall enjoyability, I liked it. It was worth buying on sale, and while it may not be as amazing as 4/5/Zero, it's worth a look if you just want to fly around and take down entire wings of planes with your Ultimate Hero Guy abilities.

												Ace Combat was an OK game with a relatively boring story line.While some might perhaps appreciate the warbirds, I can't say that the selection was amazing, nor that your average coinesseur would be impressed with the selection. The music and sounds were alright, but again, nothing to write home about. As a flying game, this isn't going to be taking back any medals in that department.My main gripe is with how short this game was - playing for only a couple days, with maybe 30-45 minutes of cutscenes, the majority of that time was spent re-doing annoying parts of missions - not so much annoying due to their difficulty or finesse so much as due to dumb, brokenness of the game itself. After a couple short battles in which you learn the basics of gameplay (read, you learn how simple it is to play), you are introduced to the game's cast and go on a couple, mildly interesting runs to quash some rebels. You quickly learn who the bad-guys are, and from there, its mostly predictable ""go kill this there"". Hardly any character development, no interesting fights, a lot of 'more of the same' dogfights. Well, almost.There were a couple levels which were really enjoyable, like the bomber levels and the rail-shooter helicopter level - and the helicopter level at the end. Unfortunately, nearly all the action was spent spinning in circles, auto-locking the enemy in a warbird. But each one of these levels had no other level like them in the whole game - maybe development time was limited, but it didn't feel so much like a game as a prototype experiment with a couple test modes to play. And most of the air-levels were 'more of the same' ones - chase flocks of 'bandits' around, in a methodical manner, take them out one by one, while your team sits around getting maybe one kill for every five that you get. Your team, which usually consists of a single air squadron that, guess what, flies around in circles. This got so bad, the final level feels downright anti-climactic, since you end up just in another 'more of the same' fights, with less actual birds than in most of the rest of the game - or at least it seemed that way. Sure, at least you get to go one-on-one with your archnemesis, but beyond that battle being difficult, the game finishes with a weak wheezle. I kinda think the team fired their game designer, because I don't see much evidence that a game was designed at all, and its not just some bad jet-fighter simulator.So is it any good as a simulator then, perhaps? Maybe, the actual flying seems to work ok and you can pretend to fight other jets. Five stars there. But the mechanics, as mentioned are somewhat broken. First off, very annoying, you cannot turn off hints. If, for whatever reason, you need to redo part of a level, or even if you just want to replay that level, you must have your fun interupted for 5 seconds by instructions written for a five year old. Yes, yes pressing that button might be helpful. First time's good, 10th time, not so much. Not to mention, the instructions given are garbage - they are simple enough, but given the highly actionable nature of the game, it would be much better to give a visual representation of the maneuver and let the player practice than to present a paragraph of text which doesn't mean a whole lot to someone in the middle of a battle. Though, as I said, they are pretty simple anyways, and you will pick them up during play, but better to scrap the instructions as they are entirely in my opinion.There were also a couple of quirks in the game; in the second bomber run, after your initial bombing streak, when you switch to guided penetration missiles, the game will run you through one of its 'guided runs', and then confusingly position you so that you can't see any of the targets, as well as start you out going too fast. Yes, its relatively simple to fix this, but its a 'guided run', why on earth is it like this if you're going to force me into a pseudo rail-shooter mode? Its not even like you need to alternate height. Secondly, in the same level, actually, during the ICBM chase mode, if you fail to catch the missile the first time, you will be autospawned and given 3 seconds to figure out what to do. Given the instructions 'catch the missile' and the results for failing to do so 'it is out of your altidue range', it is in no way obvious that 'accelerate at breakneck speed after the missile' is the solution. Finally, again, in the same (poorly desinged) level, in the third section of the first bombing run, the solution is a bit at random, as the vehicles will change direction at random, and sometimes escape, yet they count towards a failure. Not technically a bug, and as there is a solution, its just challenging and not broken, but wondering why you keep failing that run despite carpeting everything the first three times, is a bit annoying.All in all, it could have been a better game - fix some quirks, add a bit of depth and storyline, and this could have gone from 'OK game' to 'Good Game', but its nowhere close in my books.For the price that I got this, 7 bucks, I'm out no more than the price of a bad film at the theatre, but I'd still not recommend it unless you have nothing better to do or play. And that's pretty unlikely. "

												As a fan of the Ace Combat series from its early PSX days to X360 I can say that they have only gone from strength to strength.Sadly this iteration isnt faithful to its predecessors and has decided to throw some COD in, shake it up and see what sticks. Whilst some of the new features are welcome the flight model isnt as free as id like compared to the older AC games however I've juts found some new settings that ight change that.The story is very Clancy esque  but still entertaining and the great aircraft models and scenary are still here so thats one thing.To summarise if your looking for an easy going arcade style combat flight sim then jump in.

												Campaign mode, traditionally the strongest / only game mode in most of Ace Combat's history, is made significantly weaker in this iteration by the inclusion and required usage of ""Dogfight Mode"", which is essentially a minigame that is only tangentially related to successfully piloting your plane (not hitting the ground). It is in fact required to defeat a wide variety of opponents in campaign, and the sole method of delivering a number of required, scripted, scenematic moments that honestly may have been better served with a two second cutscene, instead of pretending the player has any control. The final boss, in particular, has a lengthy script that you cannot see, but must follow, lest you automatically die from missiles that spawn directly behind you, regardless of the boss's location. The premise of Dogfight Mode is a fairly obvious attempt at copying/competing with Tom Clancy's HAWX's ""Enhanced Reality System"" mode, in which you get a flight path to follow that guarantees some end result, be it avoiding a missile, or having a clear shot at the enemy's tail. However, unlike HAWX's ERS, DFM feels tedious and frustrating.			"

												ACE COMBAT: ASSAULT HORIZONPROS:+Wide selection of modern jet aircraft to choose from, even some older ones like the F-4 Phantom+Customizable paint job option+Simple controls+Decent graphics+Camera angles are handled pretty well+Missions are challenging and fun+Only a few escort missions with most being focused on shooting down aircraft, which is why we play air combat games to begin with+Action follows a story with charactersCONS:-Dogfight Mode is overemphasized, being necessary to take down certain enemies, making the game feel a bit too scripted-Combat is unrealistic as it usually takes 2+ missiles and tons of bullets to shoot down an enemy-Enemies can engage you in DFM and do so endlessly, limiting your maneuverability and pulling you away from whatever you're doing-Allies hardly help you at all except in missions where they are specifically assigned to cover for you-Helicopter missions feel disconnected and don't really seem necessary-Characters are underdeveloped and flat, making it hard to feel anything for them-Story is generic and predictable, rife with cliches -Too many Russian stereotypes-Only the campaign missions are available to choose from in free mission, limiting replayability-Characters never salute commanding officers (what kind of military is this?)FINAL VERDICT:I would rate this game a 6/10. It is a fun pick up and play game, but don't expect realism because you'll be disappointed. I recommend it, but don't pay full price. Full price doesn't feel justified.			"

												I see a great deal of ""Not Recommended"" in the reviews, and it seems a great many of them tout faulty controls as a game breaker. I will tell you right now, the default controls are designed to appeal to the kind of person who has never played a flight simulator. If you go through the control menus, you will find an option to revert to a more traditional flight simulator. Something to take the majority of the game ""off the rails"" as it were. There will still be the occasional track shooting section, as the gunner of an AC-130, or a Blackhawk, but the meat of the game, the flying, will feel considerably more natural. This was a mistake on the developers part, to default to a more infantile method of control scheme, while bearing the relatively trusted name of ACE COMBAT, but to err is human.That being said, if you are looking for a tight, hardcore, physically sound, flight simulator, you will likely be disappointed. However, if you are a video game enthusiast, and are looking for a fun experience, this game is certainly worth a try. The game opens powerfully, focusing primarily on a hyperbolic view of dogfighting, but quickly spreads out to encompass other methods of flight to simulate. Before you know it, you'll find yourself in the seat of an AH-64 Longbow, as new mechanics are introduced. Then, you will make use of the aforementioned AC-130. Make no mistake, this is an attempt to broaden the horizons of the series, and draw in a more ""action-phile"" crowd. As I've seen, video game elitists hate things like this. I hope this explains the majority of the negative reviews, but if you're on Steam, you've seen the state of the internet, and you know that some people like to gripe, as they lack other methods of communicating.The tl;dr of it, I found this to be a fun game, full of amusing content, and wrought with controller breaking challenge. Admittedly, the story is bland, but I defy you to find a war game that has a truly scintillating and hereto for untold story. Take a chance, make sure to change the control scheme, and test your mettle. I wasn't disappointed, and I don't think you will be either.			"

												Ace Combat Assualt Horizon Enhanced Edition. What can I say about this game that most haven't already said about it already? Well for one this is one of the only games I actually bought off steam on release because I was a fan of the ace combat from the Playstation era and I saw a bunch of previews as well a friend on steam had it. I wasn't dissappointed with the game. It met most of my expectations.+ Gameplay - great gameplay. It simulates a good dog fight what you would expect (at least what I imagine an actually air combat dog fight would look like)+ Variety of planes - This game has a whole selection of planes, and even helicopters. As well as a range of weapons from Air-Air missles and Air-Ground missles+ Story isn't too complexe but it gives the game some plot that makes it interesting enough to want to see it through to the end. +Graphics - The graphics are top notch for a game of this genre. The cockpit view is astonishing though I wished they'd make taking off and landing a bit more complex to give it an actuall sim feel. Though I didn't like the obstruction in some of the cockpits of some of the fighter jets as it made that view unplayable but I also liked how u could swivel your head and look around in that view. Now some of the negatives. Albeit I thought and read at the time that normal difficulty wasn't the way to play this game as it made things a bit too easy. So I went full out and had it on elite. The first half of the game was exillerating as it made things intense and in Elite your jet didn't recover from damages as opposed to the other difficulty modes. So if you're looking for a good challange then I suggest you go this mode and its ment for veterns of the series. This is a plus and some what a negative. The DFM or (Dog Fight Mode) its the selling point to this game but I think its more of a gimmick. Well on the higher diffuculty its a must to get into this combat mode as it makes taking down enemies a neccessity as without DFM you'd have to expend a ton crap of missles to take down one or two enemies. But overall DFM mode on easier difficulties made the game too easy, and to continue on my first playthrough on Elite it became so frustrating during the Spooky mission where you were in a B2 bomber doing bombing run and helping out ground units. I kept dying and it♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off that I stopped playing this game but eventually I came back and preservered and then I came onto another hurdle in Elite that frustrated me so much that I had to bumb it down to Ace mode, it was also another non fighter jet mission which seems to be a trend. I get that they wanted to expand on the story and give the series a change of pace but the combat in the chopter and the B2- and stealth bomber missions just made the game feel off and it broke up the pacing of the game. That's also a Plus for this game as you can set the difficulty at any mission. But that also leads me to one of the biggest negatives of the game:- Different missions that require non-fighter jets.These missions over stay their welcome imo. You're introduced early on to a black hawk chopper which at first wasn't bad but the missions length go on and on. When you think its done they throw one or two final objectives and thats through out the game its just in non fighter jet missions these become tidiuous chores rather than fun objectives. Overall this is a fun game and it made me feel like I was actually pilioting and dog fighting. The fights were intense and the wide range of vehicles makes it enjoyable. I give this a 8.5/10 its worth a buy and I haven't really bought any game off release besides a couple but this is one of the games I would happily purchase full price again.			"

												Ace Combat Assault Horizon is a good game but i felt it was a bit short vs the older ace combats and the sorty was not as good as past games it took me about 5-6 hours to play and beat on the hard setting the conrtols did not feel right and it felt very hard to target other aircraftalso worth noteing is that it is very hard to find a MP game the one i was in was good over all its a good buy for 7$ on sale			"

												How can I say this. Oh yes. If you want to port Ace Combat to the PC, why don't you just USE THE NORMAL CONTROLS EVERYONE ELSE, FOR THE PAST 20 YEARS, HAS BEEN USING???This pains me. I have Ace Combat (one of them) for the PSP, and that is a good game, very entertaining.This shining turd, on the other hand, is UNPLAYABLE. The controls are just broken. The graphics are amazing and I don't even much care about the whole ""dogfighting"" thing (noob babysit), but the controls ruin the game. Couldn't make it past the first mission. The bloody TUTORIAL. Mouse control is available, but doesn't work. Keyboard controls just don't cut it. And joystick control (yes, I am one of the few people that actually has one, in this year of our Lord 2014) cuts you out of one of the three axis. IF I WANT TO TURN THE PLANE, LET ME ROTATE ALL THE THREE AXIS!!! HOW DO YOU TURN A F35 INTO A DAMN B52??? NO DECENT LOOPINGS, NO TIGHT TURNS??? Last time I checked, ALL PLANES COME WITH SEPARATE CONTROLS FOR THE FLAPS AND THE RUDDER!!!Don't buy this, it's garbage. A complete waste of your money, however little it might be.			"

												While it looked like a HAWX style game, it certainly has NONE of that series' quality... the controls are plain junk as the game doesn't know it's a flight sim or a afterburner clone...It's always a bad sign when you spend most of the time playing wrestling with broken controls to even get the damn thing to do what you asked, and I've played all the big name arcade and sim based games... but it's a little better if you turn of optimised controls and go to original mode than at least you get some control over the stuff, but even so you feel like it's got mouse acceleration issues (even on a gamepad).It's probably worth the £2.49 sale price but I'd feel really annoyed had I paid ( I was gifted it from a mate)			"

												I'm still going through this game as I type this out but so far my experience hasn't been exactly good.As someone who has experience with the previous Ace Combat games (primarily for PS2), it's very hard for me to even accept that this game is part of the series. The controls are wonky and they offer very little customization. also, I'd like to be able to an actual roll in this game, where the controls seem to really NOT want me to do that kind of maneuver. Unacceptable.The story is meh, the flight characteristic (especially in DFM) are pushing the boundaries of what an actual jet can do.Oh, and in the beginning of the game you're in a flight of 5th generation F-22s fighting against 4th generation Russian SU-47's (or some other SU model. It was the Russian equivalent to the F-15) as if there were any realism in that kind of combat whatsoever.I also really hate DFM altogether. It takes away from the gameplay experience.Now, if I were to say some good things about this game, I would tell you that from an Air Force POV, the uniforms were designed well enough for what the game is (officers have their rank stitched onto the shoulders of their flight suit but I won't hold that on the game makers), the creators did a magnificent job in the design of the aircraft, which is one reason I bought the game to begin with.. Basically aesthetic things.That's really all I can say I like about this game, is the aesthetics. The experience and the mechanics of the game totally overrun the the aesthetics though.3/10 would not reccommend			"

												A fantastic fighter jet simulator game with a much improved experience in my opinion from the early PlayStation days.Pros & ConsPros:+ The PC specs for running this game are good+ Splendid picture quality+ A decent soundtrack+ New game modes (bomber, heli) such fun..+ Has quite a few arcade elements from the previous games which gives the game that greatness from the early PlayStation days.Cons:- Using the ""chase"" mode against targets can be slightly annoying and you are forced to use it is what makes that feature annoying.I would especially recommend this game for the price when the steam sales are on, because I managed to get my Enhanced edition of this game for £3.79!

												If you are a thirteen year old boy living in the United States who comes from a family of over-the-top nationalists, with a heart full of patriotism and 'MURICA, this game may be for you. Throw in a complete lack of exposure to any decent fiction with a liking for any repetitive task, and this game really is for you.Otherwise, it's a trashy, lazily written game with promise but no follow through as you engage in wave after wave of the same dogfights and too little gameplay. With some more missions written for the different types of aircraft this could have been a very interesting and replayable game - it's a pity they waited on the writers, who under-delivered anyway.

												This game was kind of an illusion to me. I bought it trying to remember the good PS 1/2 times, when I played Ace Combat for many hours. Only foud deception. Even though the graphics are nice, the game playability is not good. I got bored and angry many times with the game mechanics, that didn't seemed to make sense.It is too much arcade. That wouldn't be a big problem. But some difficult levels and situations just doesn't make sense for the kind of arcade the game is.The ""dogfight mode"" ensures that you almost don't need to control your aircraft,  just shoot missiles. Even more than this, I found the minimal sensibility to not be as low as I needed, so I couldn't have good control over my plane (was using joystick).Overall, sad to say, the experience I had with this game was not good, and I still prefer Ace Combat 3.5/10			"

												The black sheep of the Ace Combat franchise. I was EXTREMELY hyped for this title prior to release. Ace Combat 5 is my favourite game of all time, and I thought this would kick the franchise back into gear again. How foolish.Cons:- The gameplay is nothing like the earlier games, so die hard fans will find almost nothing of value here. - The infamous and bizarre dog-fighting sections play like some on-rails arcade shooter. - There are enforced helicopter sections (admittedly a little fun sometimes), enforced third-person gunner sections (again, sometimes fun) and awful bombing missions with overly-complicated recommended flight paths. - The colour scheme is mostly grey/dark green. - The over all combat is ultimately tedious due to over powered nature of your plane. -  The story is forgettable at best. Nothing compared to the grand and bombastic entries into the Strangereal lore in earlier games.But, for all of that. there is some light to this.Pros:- The port is solid (I'm only judging this after 30 minutes of playing, but nothing has crashed and there are minimal frame drops. Graphics settings are sparse though.)- There are a few jaw-dropping moments, usually involving something to do with ejecting from the craft.- The later missions get extremely intense. The penultimate one is actually fantastic.- The gameplay is solid if you enjoy what it offers. Planes are responsive and destroying enemies is satisfying.- Nagase from AC5 makes an easter egg appearance.- The main theme is Ace Combat-esque, and thrilling for it. Also has a couple of other good tracks, like the free mission hangar OST, which serves as a nice throwback to the PS1 days of the seriesMost of my negativity is just from being so heartbroken that this essentially damned the franchise. I don't want to be an♥♥♥♥♥♥and not recommend it for that reason. If this is your first time playing Ace Combat, give it a whirl.Then get a PS2 and play the better ones			"

												NOTICE - THIS REVIEW WAS WRITTEN USING GAME RESEARCH AND ALSO ME EXPERIENCE AFTER 3 HOURS OF PLAY.No, this is not worth buying, whether it be full price or on sale. Ace Combat is a series that has yet to join PC and is a series that may not ever join the PC even though flight games are right at home here. Firstly, the game's port is bare bones. The game did not work for me at first and I had to keep restarting Steam and validating the system files etc. Alongside that, there are very few options, the game doesn't look that great even on the highest settings, and the game can crash if you alt-tab. However, in it's defence, the game does run well on my GTX 960, but that is by no means a low end card.The game is breaks down in to two chunks, on rail turret sections and dogfight sections, both of which are very dull and last way too long. The on-rail shooting sections are about as fun as they sound - click the mouse to make an explosion, do it again until the section ends...which takes a long time. The sections can last about 20 minutes at times, and if it is shorter, it certainly feels like they go on forever. The dogfight sections are pretty much - get behind the target, lock on, shoot them with missiles, maybe lock on further to get more accuracy and watch them explode. It is boring, goes on forever, and feels unrealistic. You also get a minigun which is useless and does no noticeable damage to the enemies, and you can't tell if you are hitting them because there are no hitmarkers.As for the story, I didn't get what was going on and I didn't even know who I was fighting because the game bored me so much I didn't care to get far in the game. There is also mouse acceleration in the on-rail shooting sections and no mouse control at all in the flight sections, so if you REALLY care to play this game, a controller is reccomended. The world also looks like they ripped a world from Google maps, as the skyscrapers, ground and even the explosions look very low resolution. The planes do look decent however. The game is boring, the PC port is mediocre at best, and levels last way too long, and judging from other reviews, this is not what Ace Combat is really like and I am taking their word for it as I haven't played any other games in the series. Do not buy this game even if it is on sale. +Planes look decent+Performance is acceptable-Boring combat-Over-long levels-Barebones PC port-Boring visuals-Multiplayer is dead-Story is boring-Only 8 hours long with no replay-OVERALL BORINGEDIT - I have been informed that there are also Helicopter sections, however these are similar to the flying sections without the speed. Also apparently the game is supposed to give you an adrenaline rush? Does it f*ck. I stand by what I have said in this review.			"

Speaking of buying the game, I will say that it is definitely not worth $20, but it can be a fun advanced arcade game.			"

												Been a huge fan of the Ace Combat Series on the PS2. When I heard this coming out, and saw it (Got it on sale a while back) I was super excited! HD AC sounds fantastic! Though shortly after beginning to play, I found myself feeling let down. One of the biggest let downs was the DFM (Dog-Fight Mode) and what it does is cause your plane to vaguely trail the enemy, and allow you chances to shoot at it crom closer up. While it sounds interesting, it really felt like I wasn't doing much. Just occaisionally adjusting my angle and firing over and over. That was only one. To me, the Ace Combat series captured me with the story. That was my favorite part. The story here is somwehat cliche in my opinion, and lacks the immersion I would get with other titles. All in all, even though I wouldn't recomend this came (Unless it was on sale for DIRT cheap) I still find myself coming back to it. I don't know why however. "

Lots of well known aircraft and not so well known aircraft.Negatives:Its close to impossible to find multiplayer matchs.Unless you have a console like Playstation or Xbox with a controller that uses wires, controls are difficult. Do not recommend buying on PC unless its on sale.You can't use joysticks or even a simple mouse.I realize a lot of people dislike anime. So just a warning, a good amount of plane paint schemes are anime related.Not very realistic...			"

												So far what little I've played, a Controller is an ABSOLUTE must. Whether that be joystick or gamepad. Keyboard controls are... borderline adequate. And even then its frustrating dogfighting in them.Of course then there's the little bugs like during cutscense my character's head constantly turns to the left or right. Thankfully keyboard controls swap on the fly with the controller which is an A+ in my opinion.I play on easy mode and dear lord. i can not imagine this on normal or hard. Mission objectives just fly by so fast that if you're not in the optimal position you can easily lose the mission real quick.As for the story...Well.I havent gotten too far like I said.But it appears to be the standard: ""Grr. we r teh russians we r teh bad guyz.""Throw in a cup of ""Terrorist group #456127"" Stir in a little coup.And tadah thats what Assault Horizon's story appears to be shaping up as.A side note: One of the pilots in the Black Hawk. I swear to god, every modern warfare game uses that guy as generic Marine/Army guy shouting ""You got him! Tango down!"" and other such.Dog Fight Mode: Coming as a newcomer to the Ace Combat franchise. I thought it was nice. I actually liked it if not for that terrible terrible zoom in when you use your machine guns. Started giving me motion sickness at some point so I had to put down the controller and take a walk. Came back and just used missles. If there was some freaking way to turn off that zoom in it would be great. Graphics options: Of which there are none.No really.I'm serious. There's no texture/LOD/FOV/Gamme/AA levels. Just on and off buttons for Vsync, and AA iirc. But at least there's a resolution button. Bottom Line: Buy or Not?At 20? Eh. On sale? At 15? 10? 5? Worth it.			"

												I wish this game would describe it is a  keyboard only game . If you are used to play H.A.W.X. series for example, at the beginning you will probably keep trying to grab the mouse for quick steering to dodge an incoming missile, which obviously will not work because of the keyboard only controls. This requires some time to master at the beginning but does not damage reaction time too much.I am not acquainted with previous versions of ACE Combat, but this game particularly is pretty much what I expected it to be and therefore I am recommending it.

Solid controls, many configuration options, realistic planes.Gameplay: Dogfighting is action-packed and very fast, but gets repetitive. Some are annoyingly scripted dogfights where you cannot shoot down the targets until certain points. Very cinematic moments are satisfying, though. Helicopter missions are not difficult and drag on. A few missions are on-rails as a heli or AC-130 gunner, kinda boring. The air-to-ground missions shine the most.Score: 7/10. It's not a bad game by any means, it's just not perfect either. Plus, I got it for $5 when it was on sale, definitly worth it.			"

												Worst experience ever. CTD on every 20~30 minutes for well known issues. Do initial setup everytime cuz of messed registry strings(http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Ace_Combat:_Assault_Horizon_-_Enhanced_Edition). NAMCO didn't fix these critical problems so it's nearly impossible to play. Many of issues are not solvable.The game is better than console edition. Improved gameplay experiences.But if you can't play it's meaningless. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥It's the last one to recommend. NEVER RECOMMENDED.			"

												I'm a huge fan of the Ace Combat Series. I however am not a huge fan of this title. The Dog Fight Mode is not needed, but you are forced to kill some of the planes this way. The Devs would have been better off making it optional. The graphics are pretty good, but the annoying linear gameplay produced by mandatory DFM just sucks this title down.			"

												The key to tolerating this game is to ignore the ""Ace Combat"" in the title.  If you pretend this game has nothing to do with the other games in the series, you'll find it only mediocre instead of mediocre, disappointing, frustrating and offensive.Definitely, definitely, definitely do not buy Assault Horizon at full price.  I got it 75% off ($5) and even then it's just barely worth it. "

												I would recomend this game, but it has many flaws...FYI; you can do barrel rolls in a helicopter, peppy hare would be so proud!The story goes something like this. So these Russian rebels hate Russia and Amurica, and they have aquired a mini nuke and threaten to use it on people. They then take over Moscow and other♥♥♥♥♥♥♥happens and bleh! My question is, how dafaq did they take over Russia! Russia, the country with the worlds second or third largest millitary.The story sucks...... :P On another note, gameplay is outstanding, with fast action, dogfights and fun flight. And while its graphics are fair the astetics and frame reate are exelent. Many people complain of the absolute mess of a pc port, they would be right, but they dont take the extra 30 seconds to plug in a controller or change the godamn controls. I played most of the game with a Logitec Extreme 3D PRO joystick, (which makes the game a blast to play) but if you dont want to buy it just use your PS3 or Xbox controller/turn on mouse steering. If you play it with the origional port you will be really annoyed with terrible controls.The game is very fun, and realistic. Aside from the fact that your plane regens health or you cary 400 missiles and shoot down more aircraft in a mission than normal pilots could do in a lifetime..... It has good physics and attention to detail and bases alot of gameplay on what people actually do in the air force. MANY people call it ""call of duty in the air"" and I agree to some extent. Yes you regen health and you have the cliche ""Russians are Evil"" storyline, and it is not at all superior to any preveouse Ace Combat games, it is very fun in many ways. But if I had one complaint it must be the duration of the missions. Its really annoying when after you wasted all your missiles, the guy says ""oh look 10 bad guys inbound"" and you have Dog fight mode stuffed down your throat one again. The helecopter and gunship missions don't get old, and are SUPER fun, but very short.  Gameplay (with good controls) Aircraft- 8/10Attack helicopter- 10/10Gunship/bomber - 10/10Story- 4/10Over all 8/10			"

												If you want a realistic flight simulator, skip this game and go look somewhere else. This game is about pure action and does not bother with realism the slightest.If you don't mind carrying 200 missiles in your fighter jet, shooting down fleets of enemy aircraft, and dodging missiles by making barrel rolls with your helicopter, as long as the adreline rush is there - then this is the game for you.Ace Combat: AH will not impress you with its story and its many seen-from-miles-away plot twists. It will however keep you in the heart of the action from the beginning till the end; it is very good at keeping the tension up all the time, making you feel like you're in a constant rush - and you will be. You're the guy defusing the bomb with its timer nearing zero, except you're doing so in an aircraft, and there's a new bomb every 5 minutes.While the difficulty curve is erratic at best (some missions are very easy, while some can get frustrating - especially the last one which sees a huge spike in difficulty and can result in many a scream at the screen), the adreline rush is there all the time - whether you're engaged in a dogfight with another fighter jet and trying to match its movements as it zig zags between buildings in the heart of a city, whether you're saturing the sky with missiles to keep enemy jets out of the hair of the transport you're defending, whether you're dropping dozens of bombs on an enemy base to blow it up while dodging incoming SAMs, whether you're sending salves after salves of rockets from your Apache helicopter at incoming columns of armour to prevent them from reaching your too-vulnerable infantry, or whether you're trying to out- or counter-manoeuver an enemy jet who's tailing you, your breath will be held from the beginning till the end of the fight. That's the real strength of this game.So if you want an fast-paced, action-packed aerial shooter with a much appreciable soundtrack which complements its intensity in a very fitting way, go ahead and give this game a try. It's not the longest one of the bunch nor the most mind-blowing, but it'll keep you entertained for its 10~ hours worth of material, and will offer you more if you want to keep at it.			"

												This is *not* a simulator of any kind, it's a crappy 90's arcade jet shooter with 2010's graphics.  The controls are a joke, the flight model is an even bigger joke.  The aircraft carry so many missiles that you'd need a Falcon Heavy rocket to get the payload off the ground.  Roll?  What's that?  Pushing right on the joystick?  It's yaw you want right?  ""Enemy aircraft flew under you?  Just push forward and nose dive into an upside down loop!"" - no air force flight instructor, ever.Just for once, I'd like to have a decent mil sim developed by people who can at least spell aerodynamics, made some time in the last 10 years.Seriously, avoid this like the plague, buy yourself a beer (or 5 after the sale is over) and enjoy the sensation of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it up against a urinal, much better use of money.

												Your reaction to this game, be it positive or negative, will likely mirror your reaction to the following sentence:This is not Ace Combat.If you just want a quick review, that's probably all you need to know. If, for whatever reason, you would like me to ramble aimlessly elaborate, I will do so.   First, it is necessary for me to admit here and now that as a longtime fan of the Ace Combat series, I personally, am unable to give a truly unbiased review of this game. As such, my issue with this entry in the series is primarily the drastic departure from the core gameplay of said series. There are a multitude of these ""departures"", many of which you've likely already heard complaints about, and thus I won't go into. Now if upon reading this your assumption is ""This person is just bitter that they changed the gameplay around"", I wouldn't hold it against you, as you'd be right.   To be fair, there is a lot of good in this game. The presentation is great. Everything looks good, and this game has probably the best visual detail we've seen in this series so far. The sound is excellent as well, ranging from punchy and immersive (if not always realistic) sound effects, to the little things, like the multilingual onboard computers of the various planes, not to mention a fantastic soundtrack.   One may ask, ""Who then, is this game geared towards?"" Well, to put it bluntly, this is a game for casuals. I'll spare you the old jaded gamer diatribe, and say this; If you simply want a flashy casual action game, then this game was deliberatly developed and marketed towards such a demographic. It even says so on the cases of physical copies of the game; ""Call of Duty in the air"", and that's exactly what it is. That, in and of itself, is not bad. That said, this game, being what it is means I must repeat this sentiment:This is not Ace Combat.   Why then, are these contentious issues? Well, quite frankly, Ace Combat is a niche series. This game could quite easily have been presented as a spinoff with a different title, which may or may not have alleviated some of the negative reaction, who knows. Thing is, this game carries the Ace Combat name for brand value. A brand that, in all honesty is not as popular or widespread as my fellow fans and I, and perhaps Namco-Bandai as well, would like to believe.   Having said all of that, it seems as though the developers have realized this, as the game that followed this title; Ace Combat Infinity (PS3 exclusive as of this writing) has gone back to the ""old"" style, though not without its own share of issues, which I won't waste even more of your time with. So perhaps this game was, in a way, a necessary step. By that, I mean, in regards to seeing what would work and what wouldn't. In the end, did it work? Well, that depends on your personal viewpoint on this statement, which i'll repeat for the last time:This is not Ace Combat.   When all is said and done, this is not a game for us, the Ace Combat fanbase. But what about you? Maybe you don't consider yourself a ""hardcore"" fan. There's nothing wrong with that. And if that is indeed the case, you might just enjoy this game.			"

												Ace Combat Assault Horizon is actually better than what people say it is.  Although the storyline isn't as clear as titles such as Ace Combat 6: Fires of Liberation, it is still pretty decent for a video game.The gameplay mechanics are also great.  The dogfight mode really gets me into the game and makes me really focus hard on what I am trying to do.  Just like the other Ace Combat titles, I love how you have a special weapon and a regular one, just to help you out in fast-paced dogfights or trying to kill multiple enemies at once.The graphics are just wonderful.  There is not much to be said with that, but I think that lots of people can agree the graphics are very well-done.One thing I do not like about it is how there aren't very many missions.  I completed the game very quickly, which isn't really a good thing.  If there aren't that many missions, I think they should at least have something else to make you play it a little more.  The multiplayer was made for probably this reason, but have you found sessions that often?If you do not have time to read all of this, I'll give you the pros and cons right here.Pros:Great mechanicsGreat graphicsGreat missionsCons:Very short gameNot many/no people are on multiplayer a lot of timesOverall, I really like the game, and I think it stands next to my favorites in the Ace Combat series.

												Just to get this out of the way first, yes I have played previous AC games before. nearly all of them actually. Ace Combat 2 was one of the first games I ever played back in my PS1 days and I loved it. I continued that with Ace Combat 3, 4, 5 Zero, Joint Assault, X and X-2. And I loved every single one of those gamesKnowing that, you'd probobly think ""Oh, he's probobly gonna hate this game because of the added chnages, like evryone else has been.""Wrong. I love this game. And it's slowly starting to become my favorite of the series. Here's why:All the long time fans keep hating on the DFM mode here. I can see why they would if they just wanted more of the old games. Me? I loved the old games just fine...but I didn't wan't more of it...because there was too much of it already! by the time Assault Horizon came out, I was like ""What, another game were I fly around for nealry an hour each mission, throwing endless missiles at tiny red boxes on my screen that I guess is supposed to be an enemy plane? Didn't I already do this for EIGHT games already?""But then I gave the game a chance and started up the first mission. I was thinking that I do miss this kind of gameplay, and they'll probobly have good storylteling; they always do with this series, so just go with it. But then the mission begins, the music starts pumping up and the game is like ""Press LB and RB to enter DFM,"" I'm confused for a brief moment but went along anyway...And then my mind is blown.As soon as I finished that first mission I thought, ""This is EXACTLY what I always wanted in this series!""Every engagement with an enemy plane is now this intense roller-coaster ride where you get upclose and personal with the enemy! Even if you do it many times, it never seems to get boring. It's always unpredictable, always keeps you on your toes, always a bit of a challenge on any difficulty setting. A lot of long-time fans hate DFM. I one of the few who will defend it to high heaven. If you guys love the old games so much...well there's already a ton of those, take your pick. Me? I was so ready for somehting new. Something to add to an already niche gameplay. and Assault Horizon delivered for me. Now if you are totally new to the series and played this first, i reccomend you don't go for anything else previously. You'll likey find the older games repetative as hell. Just stick with this and you'll be fine.Now that doesn't mean I don't have my share of complaints. I do find the story a bit lackluster and too short. Really, the story feels like a alt version of the story from Call of Duty...just with planes. And I do miss the alt world setting from the old games, but that's not enough for me to detract from the very fun gameplay. If only this had the epic feel of the settings and characters of the old games, I would've given this top marks. Still a good game though.In fact...hey Namco, if you're somehow reading this, here's an idea for you:Remake AC5 and Zero...but with Assault Horizon's game engine, DFM and all. That would be so awasome, don't you think? Especially with Zero and the ridiculous amout of enemy Aces you can DFM with.			"

												As a huge fan of this series I purchased this game shortly after it came out. Since then I have made numerous attempts to finish it but find myself completely turned off by what they did with it. The new dog fight mode is basically forced into your face and youll find it virtually impossible to complete some missions without using it. All too often while in DFM the AI would make some impossible turn and I would inevitably be guided straight into the ground by the handy dandy DFM I was locked in. Other times I would find myself struggling to shake off a basic enemy attacker, not a TGT, but I would be fighting to stay alive against a mig-29 while I was flying an F15 or F18 which I am all for tough AI, but not at the expense of realism. Sorry to say but mig-29s cannot execute a hairpin turn or a pinch loop. Beyond the mechanic issues the story of this game is all over the place. You go from piloting a fighter jet in a dog fight to piloting an apache helicopter back to a jet and then a door gunner on a blackhawk and then back to jets. I understand they wanted to introduce new mechanics and broaden ace combat but they did so at a terrible price. As a true fan of the series, the world they created for ace combat 4, 5, and zero was amazing and the story in those games was equally great. I cant help but feel like they shot themselves in the foot by switching to a real world setting.			"

												Decent game, ok story (that means average) Found the forced qte events annoying. Forced, because you can't shoot the plane down, or progress, until you enter the close combat mode. That stuff is annoying, but ok in this case. As it isn't too many of those (unlike a certain Croft game) Graphics is OK, considering when it was made. On a side note.. being an artist myself, I always cringe when animators seem to think the neck joint is placed in front of the throat. Something I still see today *shudders*, but I digress. The game is 50/50,  you will probably enjoy or hate it.. depending on what you prefer in a fighter game. But on its own, the game is decent. The downside is playing with the keyboard. I suggest using a game pad, because it was made for it. And at 5 bucks (sale at time of writing) it isn't a bad game, regardless what may you end up thinking about it.			"

												I will share the same remarks as most people here.I used to play Ace Combat 3 hundreds of hours a long time ago.MissionsAC3 had various types of missions, like refuelling, night, escort missions, etc.Also there were special missions where you could go into space to blow satelites up, and then you had to make a renetry in the atmosphere a special way to not screw your UberSpaceShuttlePlane up.The missions in Assault Horizon lack diversity and they are dull.Except that sometimes there are side scrolling shooting missions, and I still wonder why.When I play AC, I want to FLY, not shoot shït up!GameplayIn AC3  there were crazy åss sci-fy planes that would fire plasma thingy, or would be extremely fast.There were secrets and hidden missions. And the Japanese version even had a story rich anime included in the game.But, comparing AC: Assault Horizon to AC3 is like comparing the original Rainbow Six to the New Vegas ones, or worst, CoD.AC3 was extremely rich in content.OversimplificationThe flying scheme is oversimplified, and I was wondering why I couldn't  stall much at first. My plane was levelling itself without me doing anything.Turns out there is somewhere in the controls, an 'optimum' option or whatnot.Switch that shït to 'original' and you got a popup telling you that you should better finish the game and be über pro first, warning, warning... wait wat?!Such warnings so I could just control my plane the way I want!? Like using the pedals and rolling at the same time without auto-leveling!? o.O;This very option pretty much sums up AC: Assault Horizon: it's an arcade 'flying' game for total n00bs.New dogfight featureSome tangos (with a 'leader' tag) are tough to splash if you don't lock on them and activate some kinda 'pursuit mode' where you do not control your plane no more and just shoot: your plane will follow the tango by itself.Of course the enemy will then have a scripted path so that you can take it down near pretty buildings and stuff.It's cool but... it's all fake.They really like rail shooter games, too bad I want to play a FLYING game.However, I gotta say, there are good idea beyond this new feature.Tango planes can also initiate a dog-fight with you, and then it's up to you to loose them, or do some crazy tricks, like slowing down so that you end up behind then and engage a counter-dogfight.Cool, but it'd rather do this MYSELF, without the need to 'activate' this feature.Hollywood styleBig budget game with big explosions and particles everywhere, and bling...We got many cutscenes, a story and a plot, voice acting, etc.But it's all... bad. The actors lines are cliche as fûck. When flying I seriously can't concentrate because the friendlies are chatting like an asian pack of women all the time. Of course it's not even funny ""you will owe me a beer, you'll see"" which in turn you, the leader, being all cool and serious and stuff reply ""Tone it down guise. We got a mission.""...COME ON!This is just lame, just stop it, just, just ... stop...Realism?I mean, the Ace Combat franchise is not a simulation, and is definitely an arcade style game. But still...I can crash my plane on the ground, and it will BOUNCE BACK (!) with a Critical Damage warning. WTF.Looks like we regain health / repair ourselves over time too... omg.I'm not asking for a simulation like X-Plane, but damn man. AC3 was crazy, and had a futuristic environment and planes and stuff, but there was no MAGIC!So AC: AH wants to be all realistic and stuff, and have a uh.. 'serious' story, but my planes bounce on da ground? And I regain health? I see there a contradiction your honor.MusicAC3 had seriously awesome tracks. I even tried to rip then when I was a kid, ending up with 22khz mp3 that sounded like crap.Do I need to say that AC: AH has got nothing? There is no emotions in the tracks.They are typical american hollywood war movies.ConclusionIf you are new to the genre, and flying games, then by all means, do buy the game and have fun.But if you are looking for an Ace Combat game, just don't do it!This game doesn't have the soul of our beloved AC3, that had such an awesome gameplay and musics.It's like playing CoD when you want a tactical shooter. It's just not working.			"

												Ace Combat - Call of Duty Edition. Boring super weapon (bombs), based on real earth instead of Strangereal. Boring planes. Multiple perspectives. Unkillable enemies until certain time. No enemy radio chatter freaking out about your skill. Avoid if not less than 5 bucks and you're really hankering for some flying action, or if you're a multiplayer ♥♥♥♥♥ since this game has one of those modes. I can't judge that though since I never touch multiplayer modes.			"

I've never played this series before, and I wouldn't recommend it to you either.The story was ignorable, the sound was whatever. The graphics were alright.			"

												Without a doubt, one of the worst flying games I've encountered. It's clearly a lazy console port, with no regard given to actual playablity with anything other than a console controller. There's no cursor in the menus, cutscene are ruined by the lack of ability to look around as you would with a controller, and any buttons onscreen flicker between joystick and keyboard options, leaving neither particularly clear to see.Your most difficult enemy will be the flight mechanics themselves, as you can't (fully) roll your plane, making most actual flying techniques impossible to pull of, and keeping track of the enemy whilst they constantly turn on the spot against you quickly becomes a chore.The helicopter controls are beyond explaination. I'm not sure how they'd work with a controller, but with a joystick, I don't think they could possibly be any further from the real controls of a helicopter. I can't really explain them, but let's just say that CoD: Black Ops did a better job of helicopter controls when they stuck on the Hind mission to mix things up a bit. Imagine that, but even worse.That's how the whole game feels: like it's a flight level that's been stuck onto a game that's got nothing to do with flying.And that's when I stopped playing. Good luck to those that buy it.			"

												When I bought this I was expecting an arcade game with no realisitic qualities, but it really does take the unrealistic to another level. Enemies break the laws of physics with regards to being able to constantly turn on a dime and seemingly having the ability to get a lock on you without even being pointed in your direction. The game forces you to use the horrible 'dog fight mode' in order to shoot down enemies because without it, missiles just barely ever hit anything. I think  if they removed the dog fight mode and tweaked the manual dogfighting it would be a much more enjoyable experience. Also they need to tone down the whole super evil Russian bad guy with god like flying abilities thing -_- They really ruined it by pushing a whole bunch of cheesy gimicks and cliches.			"

												It's a little bit hard reccomending this game, since the game has many good and bad points. The game is not a flight simulator, and tends to be an arcade flight game, where most of the time all you need to do is press space bar while you crosshair is red. With beautiful graphics, some skippable CGs and an nice soundtrack during fights, it can be a very fun game.My first sensation while playing the game was that it was a lot flashy, and designed to be something easy for your free time, and it can be enjoyable, but with times get a little boring and repetitive. When you are too close from the ground, too close to the map end or in DFM (Dogfight Mode), almost all of the controls are taken from you to make the game easier to new players. But sometimes, it gets too easy, and during chopper flights you almost only have to hold the two mouse buttons and A/D to kill everything.If you are looking for a game where the first challenge starts in getting familiar with the controls to have complete control over the aircraft, this game is far from it. This game has a feel of being targeted to more casual players, not exactly excluding hadcore gamers, but the major part of the game is made to be fun, not challenging. "

												Had some crashes, game is really intrusively scripted - pretty much quick time events which leave you wondering if you are actually doing anything at all... it seemed a nice addition at first, but it is used far too often. Feels like auto-aim in a first person shooter. I loved the older games back on the PS1 or 2 (whichever it was - probably both) so it is a little disappointing. Having said that, it isn't TERRIBLE. If I had an option to choose maybe rather than yes or no, I would. Works with Xbox controller quite well otherwise, and looks decent. Might be more reliable on different PC setup. (drivers etc)			"

												Well well well, Ace Combat eh?I can't tell you how bad this game is.  I don't know if it's the arcade feel of it, the horrible controls, the undeditable graphics settings and the incredible unrealism to it or if it's just me.  I work in the aviation industry which could play a part in all the quirks that♥♥♥♥♥♥me off about this game but aside from that the controls are absolutely horrible.  The story seems fake and the graphics are on sub-par levels.  The gameplay feels cheap and it seems like a game targeted to 10 year olds dreaming of becoming an idiot pilot.  All in all I do not recommend this game and I', happy I got to try it for free this weekend.  Get a game like War Thunder, that is a great air battle game, although the A/C are historical recips.

												I love the Ace combat series.... well, i did for the episodes on PS2, since i skipped the 360-PS3 era. So, i was enthusiastic when i  knew of Assault Horizon on Pc. Not for long though; this game is such a disappointment, and so different from the original Ace Combat - in fact, this is mostly a clone of HAWX2, which is not a compliment. Bad storyline with russian rebels as villains? Check. Missions way too long, way too boring and spent mostly moving in circles to avoid enemies or missiles? Check. Multiplayer only half working? Check.... even though they are fixing that by switching off from GFWL, or so they say. I could say something positive about the actual dogfighting, which is not too bad... if it was not that, halfway trough the 4th mission, i noticed that the ""duel mode"" (which is the *only* way to kill certain enemies) is often used as a gimmick to show the admitedly nice graphic in forced cut scene. Basically, once in a while the enemy in the duel mode becomes invincible, no matter how many times you hit it, because this way the enemy plane can lead you to certain point of the map to show an action scene. Once you understand how it works, you cant avoid rolling your eyes to the sky. I dont suggest this game.... unless its on a deal for 5$ or less. Otherwise, you are better served by playing HAWX1, JASF, the old but still somehow fun Rebel Raiders or the ps2x-emulated series of ace combat from 4 to 6.			"

												What else do you have to do on a weekday night waiting for the unevitably better Ace Combat Infinity to release on PlayStation Network in full, glorius English? Oh. You want to buy this game.Well Ace Cobmat Assault Horizon is a very special game. You fly around in a plane that autopilots you towards your enemies while all you do is sit back, gun, and shoot missiles. This game basically wants you to enjoy the explosions happening around you and make you feel like some badass pilot, but in reality you're occasionally tilting your stick, holding down one button, and when you hear the right sound you want, press the other button.Let's get down to the meat. You're a pilot who's scared of dying or something so he pisses his pants everytime he's about to die, but also tries to stay badass. He doesn't know who the ♥♥♥♥ he is and you'll lose track of his internal conflict after the first mission because he barely talks about it again until the end of the game. Some Russian group is up to no good and you got to beat them up. So pick your plane out of the preset ""please use these planes because they don't break the mission"" list, then you're off. Oh wait, that's not every mission. Some missions require you to be in a helicopter that can take collisions into buildings and other missions make you be the machine gunner on the helicopter. That's cool but it's not Ace Combat.Ace Combat is about jerking off to people calling you the legendary beast or having some Spanish guitar in the background strumming a catchy chorus while you ejaculate over the screen to some female saying that she doesn't want to fight a war. In this game, you're Beef McTruckHam fighting for the greater American good with some heavy thrashing music in the background every other level.Levels get frustrating as you may get annoyed by the DFM system and end up not holding a button long enough to shoot something to death. Other times you get distracted by optional enemies during a sudden timelimit. This game gets frustrating and you'll probably only replay 3 or 4 missions.So should you buy this?Yeah, but don't treat it like an Ace Combat game. Treat it like you're playing Call of Duty in the skies, because that is what it'll ever be.			"

The acting is so bulls**ted  together. The actual storyling, ""russian rebels betray america"" is so horribly forced with no implimentation of foreshadowing that it makes me feel ashamed if any person thinks this is ""how americans feel about the world."" You can pick out good guy bad guy from the moment you see people, your teammates make the worst jokes if not the most offensive jokes ever. I actually had to laugh because the attempt at comedy was so bad. THE HELICOPTORS This... addition to the game should have just been handed off to infinity ward where it belongs. With such large maps, the close up on horrible streached out landscape is vomit worthy, The controls are backwards as all hell. THE AIR COMBAT SIMULATIONthey got rid of my scifi planes, and replaced them with stat based air rocks that spit in the face of the joy I recieved in prevous installments. All that twirling around and airial freedom is locked even harder by the dog fight mode. A rather bothersome requirment for some opponents, ripping the controls out of your hands and dragging your laggy♥♥♥♥♥around space like a rag doll while you play ""get the birdy in the circle"" Its just not fun. and it saddens me that I don't have the proper console to play infinity as when I went online searching for some airial compatriots to save me from this hell, I was greeted with emptyness as nobody is on any of the servers at any time in the day.

												Terrible game. The way the gameplay is set up makes all the dog fight encounters run on autopilot, so it’s super easy. The story line was decent, though not as interesting as other Ace Combat's in the past. There is no buying and selling of aircrafts or weapons - they're all just given to you. Each aircraft has so many missiles; it’s beyond ridiculous - like 200+ missiles, and 40+ special missiles, plus infinite machine gun. Overall I found the game too easy during most encounters and frustratingly dumb in other parts.What is so hard to understand, Project Aces? I want Ace Combat 4, with new airplanes, updated graphics, and new missions. That’s it. Stop experimenting with these stupid game play changes. "

												Generally, a fun game. It's a mixture of arcade sensibilities and modern military FPS-on-rails action. There are intermittant situations where a ""DFM / Dog Fight Mode"" needs to be employed while flying. The DFM mode at worst gets in the way of what would be an otherwise pleasantly polished arcade game. In short the DFM mode tries to be special, tries to be a frantic adrenaline driven mini-experience. Fortunately the need to engage DFM mode is uncommon. The game would be much better without it. Or at least if it had the option to turn it off. As is? It's alright.In closure, if you want an arcadey, non-serious game that features flying, modern combat machines, give this a whirl. The draw here is the easy going combat that doesn't take its self too seriously.			"

												I'm usually not this harsh on most games but it is not even worth paying 5 bucks for this game in the current Steam Sale. It's a step backwards for the Ace Combat franchise in every possible way. The flight controls have been atrociously dumbed down and every plane has the same cartoonish feel. The combat system constantly forces you into annoying pre-scripted quick time sequences. The story boils down to cliche American bros fighting evil Russian terrorists who somehow have a super advanced air force. Oh and the graphics are horrible. It would be like Activison trying to make ""Call of Duty with Planes"" and farming out the development to the most incompetent studio they could find.			"

												It's different from the other ace combat games, it's the red headed stepchild of the family and that's what makes it so hated. It's so different and unfamiliar as it tries to appeal to a larger audience than just the ace combat one. I enjoyed it, but if you're an ace combat fan you probably won't.			"

												Ace Combat Assualt Horizon Enhanced Edition. What can I say about this game that most haven't already said about it already? Well for one this is one of the only games I actually bought off steam on release because I was a fan of the ace combat from the Playstation era and I saw a bunch of previews as well a friend on steam had it. I wasn't dissappointed with the game. It met most of my expectations.+ Gameplay - great gameplay. It simulates a good dog fight what you would expect (at least what I imagine an actually air combat dog fight would look like)+ Variety of planes - This game has a whole selection of planes, and even helicopters. As well as a range of weapons from Air-Air missles and Air-Ground missles+ Story isn't too complexe but it gives the game some plot that makes it interesting enough to want to see it through to the end. +Graphics - The graphics are top notch for a game of this genre. The cockpit view is astonishing though I wished they'd make taking off and landing a bit more complex to give it an actuall sim feel. Though I didn't like the obstruction in some of the cockpits of some of the fighter jets as it made that view unplayable but I also liked how u could swivel your head and look around in that view. Now some of the negatives. Albeit I thought and read at the time that normal difficulty wasn't the way to play this game as it made things a bit too easy. So I went full out and had it on elite. The first half of the game was exillerating as it made things intense and in Elite your jet didn't recover from damages as opposed to the other difficulty modes. So if you're looking for a good challange then I suggest you go this mode and its ment for veterns of the series. This is a plus and some what a negative. The DFM or (Dog Fight Mode) its the selling point to this game but I think its more of a gimmick. Well on the higher diffuculty its a must to get into this combat mode as it makes taking down enemies a neccessity as without DFM you'd have to expend a ton crap of missles to take down one or two enemies. But overall DFM mode on easier difficulties made the game too easy, and to continue on my first playthrough on Elite it became so frustrating during the Spooky mission where you were in a B2 bomber doing bombing run and helping out ground units. I kept dying and it♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off that I stopped playing this game but eventually I came back and preservered and then I came onto another hurdle in Elite that frustrated me so much that I had to bumb it down to Ace mode, it was also another non fighter jet mission which seems to be a trend. I get that they wanted to expand on the story and give the series a change of pace but the combat in the chopter and the B2- and stealth bomber missions just made the game feel off and it broke up the pacing of the game. That's also a Plus for this game as you can set the difficulty at any mission. But that also leads me to one of the biggest negatives of the game:- Different missions that require non-fighter jets.These missions over stay their welcome imo. You're introduced early on to a black hawk chopper which at first wasn't bad but the missions length go on and on. When you think its done they throw one or two final objectives and thats through out the game its just in non fighter jet missions these become tidiuous chores rather than fun objectives. Overall this is a fun game and it made me feel like I was actually pilioting and dog fighting. The fights were intense and the wide range of vehicles makes it enjoyable. I give this a 8.5/10 its worth a buy and I haven't really bought any game off release besides a couple but this is one of the games I would happily purchase full price again.			"

												NOTICE - THIS REVIEW WAS WRITTEN USING GAME RESEARCH AND ALSO ME EXPERIENCE AFTER 3 HOURS OF PLAY.No, this is not worth buying, whether it be full price or on sale. Ace Combat is a series that has yet to join PC and is a series that may not ever join the PC even though flight games are right at home here. Firstly, the game's port is bare bones. The game did not work for me at first and I had to keep restarting Steam and validating the system files etc. Alongside that, there are very few options, the game doesn't look that great even on the highest settings, and the game can crash if you alt-tab. However, in it's defence, the game does run well on my GTX 960, but that is by no means a low end card.The game is breaks down in to two chunks, on rail turret sections and dogfight sections, both of which are very dull and last way too long. The on-rail shooting sections are about as fun as they sound - click the mouse to make an explosion, do it again until the section ends...which takes a long time. The sections can last about 20 minutes at times, and if it is shorter, it certainly feels like they go on forever. The dogfight sections are pretty much - get behind the target, lock on, shoot them with missiles, maybe lock on further to get more accuracy and watch them explode. It is boring, goes on forever, and feels unrealistic. You also get a minigun which is useless and does no noticeable damage to the enemies, and you can't tell if you are hitting them because there are no hitmarkers.As for the story, I didn't get what was going on and I didn't even know who I was fighting because the game bored me so much I didn't care to get far in the game. There is also mouse acceleration in the on-rail shooting sections and no mouse control at all in the flight sections, so if you REALLY care to play this game, a controller is reccomended. The world also looks like they ripped a world from Google maps, as the skyscrapers, ground and even the explosions look very low resolution. The planes do look decent however. The game is boring, the PC port is mediocre at best, and levels last way too long, and judging from other reviews, this is not what Ace Combat is really like and I am taking their word for it as I haven't played any other games in the series. Do not buy this game even if it is on sale. +Planes look decent+Performance is acceptable-Boring combat-Over-long levels-Barebones PC port-Boring visuals-Multiplayer is dead-Story is boring-Only 8 hours long with no replay-OVERALL BORINGEDIT - I have been informed that there are also Helicopter sections, however these are similar to the flying sections without the speed. Also apparently the game is supposed to give you an adrenaline rush? Does it f*ck. I stand by what I have said in this review.			"

												This game was kind of an illusion to me. I bought it trying to remember the good PS 1/2 times, when I played Ace Combat for many hours. Only foud deception. Even though the graphics are nice, the game playability is not good. I got bored and angry many times with the game mechanics, that didn't seemed to make sense.It is too much arcade. That wouldn't be a big problem. But some difficult levels and situations just doesn't make sense for the kind of arcade the game is.The ""dogfight mode"" ensures that you almost don't need to control your aircraft,  just shoot missiles. Even more than this, I found the minimal sensibility to not be as low as I needed, so I couldn't have good control over my plane (was using joystick).Overall, sad to say, the experience I had with this game was not good, and I still prefer Ace Combat 3.5/10			"

Sure, it doesn't care for physics, mechanics, realism, or almost any aspect of realistic flying, but hey, it isn't what you buy the game for. Speaking of buying the game, I will say that it is definitely not worth $20, but it can be a fun advanced arcade game.			"

												So far what little I've played, a Controller is an ABSOLUTE must. Whether that be joystick or gamepad. Keyboard controls are... borderline adequate. And even then its frustrating dogfighting in them.Of course then there's the little bugs like during cutscense my character's head constantly turns to the left or right. Thankfully keyboard controls swap on the fly with the controller which is an A+ in my opinion.I play on easy mode and dear lord. i can not imagine this on normal or hard. Mission objectives just fly by so fast that if you're not in the optimal position you can easily lose the mission real quick.As for the story...Well.I havent gotten too far like I said.But it appears to be the standard: ""Grr. we r teh russians we r teh bad guyz.""Throw in a cup of ""Terrorist group #456127"" Stir in a little coup.And tadah thats what Assault Horizon's story appears to be shaping up as.A side note: One of the pilots in the Black Hawk. I swear to god, every modern warfare game uses that guy as generic Marine/Army guy shouting ""You got him! Tango down!"" and other such.Dog Fight Mode: Coming as a newcomer to the Ace Combat franchise. I thought it was nice. I actually liked it if not for that terrible terrible zoom in when you use your machine guns. Started giving me motion sickness at some point so I had to put down the controller and take a walk. Came back and just used missles. If there was some freaking way to turn off that zoom in it would be great. Graphics options: Of which there are none.No really.I'm serious. There's no texture/LOD/FOV/Gamme/AA levels. Just on and off buttons for Vsync, and AA iirc. But at least there's a resolution button. Bottom Line: Buy or Not?At 20? Eh. On sale? At 15? 10? 5? Worth it.			"

												Been a huge fan of the Ace Combat Series on the PS2. When I heard this coming out, and saw it (Got it on sale a while back) I was super excited! HD AC sounds fantastic! Though shortly after beginning to play, I found myself feeling let down. One of the biggest let downs was the DFM (Dog-Fight Mode) and what it does is cause your plane to vaguely trail the enemy, and allow you chances to shoot at it crom closer up. While it sounds interesting, it really felt like I wasn't doing much. Just occaisionally adjusting my angle and firing over and over. That was only one. To me, the Ace Combat series captured me with the story. That was my favorite part. The story here is somwehat cliche in my opinion, and lacks the immersion I would get with other titles. All in all, even though I wouldn't recomend this came (Unless it was on sale for DIRT cheap) I still find myself coming back to it. I don't know why however. "

												I only played a little bit but from what I tried didn't seem like a very good flight combat sim, even if the action is supposed to be a little arcade like. It's the dog fight mode I think that ruins it. It controls where your jet flies and you have a little control to try to hit the jet you're tailing, but it moves way too unrealistic. You can roll in all different ways but your jet will still be following the other jet making sudden movements. It's too unrealistic for any flight game. I think it takes all the fun out of the dog fight. One reviewer compared it to VATS in Fallout, but I was okay with that. It just has your character choose targets to hit at in slow-mo, and you choose when to use it. This dog fight thing takes any skill or strategy out of a dog fight. (unless I missed something?) I barely played it, and I chose the option for original control but still didn't like it.			"

												I went into this game expecting another great installment like Shattered Skies or The Unsung War, set in the universes they were in, with a great story and similiar flight mechanics. What I got was a game that felt like it had been ""CODified"" so to speak. The campaign in Ace Combat games has always had an anmazing story with great characters. This just felt like call of duty but with planes instead, using re-hashed cliches and ideas of having the russians be the bad guys and installing parts like the helicopter gunner which does not belong in this game. I hated it the more I played, very little that i did. The whole system of the close-range assualt system was just complete garbage. It adds no value to the game, just more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t they pile on to give it a ""cinematic"" feel. The ""dramatic realistic storyline"" was another insult as well. Something that has been done time and again, its just a lazy♥♥♥♥♥♥story they cobbled together to try and have some sort of setting made with no effort for the game. All the intense moments in Shattered Skies and Unsung War were amazing, like when Nagase was in danger as her plane was going down, but then she ends up rescuing fellow soldiers and taking some enemies hostage right after ejecting like a hardass; or you are protecting a rocket that needs to deliver a ♥♥♥♥ing laser to a low orbit plane to give you an edge in the war, or when you have to shoot down that same plane when the enemy takes it. All of the banter between the pilots and command was really funny, dramatic, and had actual emotion to it. Unique, colorful, and masterpieces of missions and storytelling. This entire game is a stain and shameful mark upon the legacy and awe left by those earlier games, not fit to share the title of Ace Combat. If I could I would wipe this game from my library just so I dont have to look at such a pile of excrement. Do not buy this game if you have played the previous masterpieces. If your a COD fanboy who likes campaigns that only take a few hours to complete, and the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t story cliches time and time again, this is right up your alley.			"

												It is a beautiful game with a great story and good elements.  Those are woderful but the part I came for is the gameplay and that is terrible.  The door gunner game is just boring, the DFM (Dog Fight Mode) is forced and the battles are repetitive.  DFM is the worst because the same controls on the XBox controller that enter DFM are the ones you use to level the plain.  If you miss your target and hit them you vere off and level.  The entire thing is forced and shoved down your throat.  I am okay with escalating difficulty of enemies but this is just a new mechanic they beat like a dead horse.			"

												Ace Combat Assault Horizon is actually better than what people say it is.  Although the storyline isn't as clear as titles such as Ace Combat 6: Fires of Liberation, it is still pretty decent for a video game.The gameplay mechanics are also great.  The dogfight mode really gets me into the game and makes me really focus hard on what I am trying to do.  Just like the other Ace Combat titles, I love how you have a special weapon and a regular one, just to help you out in fast-paced dogfights or trying to kill multiple enemies at once.The graphics are just wonderful.  There is not much to be said with that, but I think that lots of people can agree the graphics are very well-done.One thing I do not like about it is how there aren't very many missions.  I completed the game very quickly, which isn't really a good thing.  If there aren't that many missions, I think they should at least have something else to make you play it a little more.  The multiplayer was made for probably this reason, but have you found sessions that often?If you do not have time to read all of this, I'll give you the pros and cons right here.Pros:Great mechanicsGreat graphicsGreat missionsCons:Very short gameNot many/no people are on multiplayer a lot of timesOverall, I really like the game, and I think it stands next to my favorites in the Ace Combat series.

												""Press READ MORE to read the rest of this review.""................Kay, <i>now</i> you can read it. 9_9The game has some serious port and coding issues. From the start when we're instructed to press Space (and not Enter, not Escape, not mouse click, nor any other key, but Space speciffically) simply to enter the main menu, over inabillity to change keys on-the-fly if one of the keys is already binded, to dreadfull mouse implementation (almost useles) and early-last-gen textures. This should have been an enhanced edition, but it still looks crappy and is almost incompatible, from these day's usability perspective, with keyboard.For me, who is a complete plane-sim noob the airplane battles get fairly long and tedious. Chopper battles were nicer, but had very familiar feel to standard bland millitary (FPS, sic!) shooter - regenerative ""health"" and all. But storywise, the whole game is like that. ""Yeeeah, 'Murica, let's blow some sheept up!"" I got to the part where (deep vawering astonishment) Russians, those wacky rascals, turned sides and started attacking good Americans and friends, and I couldn't get on with it. Promo demo version for some reason didn't save my keyboard settings and has crashed on me after 2 hours playing. Since I didn't have enough strength to get through the logical puzzle of rebinding all the keys again (Exchange object A's place with  object B! Get object A into slot B. But slot B is occupied, so.. Get object B into slot C, Get object A into slot B. Get object B into slot A...) I promptly uninstalled it and have no wish what so ever to buy the whole game.			"

												Ignoring its title and separating it from the previous Ace Combat games does little to save it from its own faults. Ace Combat: Assault Horizon takes a step back from the interesting, if not corny world of Strangereal, and plays the Russian/American conflict card. This tired formulaic story is complemented by a downgrade in gameplay. Dogfighting is made simple, and boring, with the introduction of a near-rail-shooter experience that removes the freedom from flight and negates the need for skillful airmanship. It would be acceptable to have a “boss” flight lead require this mechanic, but every flight lead requires that you lock into dogfight mode; even if you land missiles on target, the game ignores the hits and will not progress until you put on your training wheels and go for the ride. The game does include a new diversity of aircraft with the introduction of helicopters and bombers, which if properly executed would nearly save the game, but bomber runs are not particularly fun and the helicopter sections are tedious and awkward. Overall, the game looks great graphically (although the graphical settings are sparse) and gives you a decently realistic flight simulation, but its glaring flaws make it just an okay experience. Personally, I would award 3/5 stars to this game and would recommend picking it up only if it happens to be on sale.			"

This game is more of an arcade game that defies the laws of phisics too much.  ex: if you press c while being tailed, your jet pulls a loop with the radius of the length of the airplane, in which the pilot would almost certianly be crussed to death by the g-forces, and the jet would break appart.

												This game has too many flaws in it to be enjoyable.  This game isn't worthy of the title of Ace Combat.  I want to go in with an open mind but it just has terrible game mechanics.  From planes performing impossible moves to the dog fight not engaging at the correct time, this game can aggrivate even the most hardcore veterans of the Ace Combat series.  The development crew must have been a bunch of guys who grew up with COD and wanted to emulate it to the letter, with bad story telling and just making certain that there is an explosion every 3 seconds.The story could have been a lot better, but the writers decided to go with the most severly ADD pilot I have ever met and to have no depth with character development.  They also wanted to go for the whole Russia is bad theme that COD has beaten to death and then some.  I mean I get the fact that from the Cold War, Russia has never got rid of their stigma of being evil, but I mean come on, lets see something more interesting.  The main villian of the series lacks a true motive for what he is doing, and, personally, they really needed to expand his backstory.  I got to say it was pretty boring when the AC-130 level came into play, cause I was spoiled by how good COD's version was (I will say that that was my favorite level in COD).  You would think that a game producer who focuses just on aircraft would have a better grasp on this.  I will say that the helicopter missions were definitly interesting and a breath of fresh air, once you died 20 times just trying to get used to the new controls.The gameplay mechanics are another point in the game that actually hurt it.  The dogfight mode is intersting, but annoying when you lockon a target and face an invincible fighter plane, because the producers want you to go through their house of explosions before you can take him out.  Also I have had this little problem affect me multiple times, I will be in the dogfight mode and the enemy plane nose-dives into the ground, and you would think that that is one less plane I have to worry about. Wrong, because your plane will also quickly follow suit and explode, just because dogfight wants you to have the nose of your aircraft so far up the enemies exhaust, that you could just pull the fuel lines, that you also share the fate due to bad AI pathing.  Also while the cinematic following of the missles is pretty cool, it just detracts from the game and causes you to sit in your chair for an extra 5 seconds, while you could be shooting down the other guys who is in front of you.  Once you come out of it 9 times out of 10, they have escaped.  Also the quicktime events are dumb, they offer no, I repeat no, effect on the game, but their are about 3 out of 20-something quicktime events that will make you fail a mission.The last major problem I had is that the game isn't that hard.  Changing the difficulty isn't really a test of your skill, like having less ammunition or the AI being smarter, rather it's just how much more that the AI can defy physics and perform outragious moves.  One example is the final dog fight and it has to be done in dogfight mode.  If you break dog fight with the enemy, then the enemy can perform some weird 360-180 backflip, with a double axial from hell and be right on your rear.  Sure it makes it harder but it is just something that isn't that fun to deal with.The good thing about this game is the normal dogfighting, not that stupid lockon behind them crap.  It was a blast to relive the old system of using the IFF to track down targets and just shoot them down.  That was a method that proved your worth in the old games, where if you couldn't manually track behind your targets and tack them out with missles of guns, you were dead.If you are a new flyer to the Ace Combat series and were either turned off or interested in the series, I recommend that you get a ps2 and play Ace Combat 5 and/or Ace Combat 0.  The reason is simple, the Ace Combat series is hands down one of the best jet fighter sims out there, and this version was just a disgrace.  Now maybe I'm a guy who just enjoys living in the past, but I can tell you that this game had potential but terrible execution.Keep those skies clear.(PS I don't like to put spoliers in my reviews, so I am unable to explain, in this already long review, certain key elements in the story that are just bad.  Also I don't really play multiplayer due to internet problems.  So my review is focused towards those who enjoy the campagin of games.)			"

												Well...it looks pretty at least.I wouldn't call this an Ace Combat game seeing how far it goes from the old gameplay from previous titles. Despite being mostly open-world, the gameplay is extremely linear and the game will punish you for going out of your way. Time critical objectives are very stressful especially on higher difficulties. On some missions the AI will berate you for not shooting particular targets and yet you have such a hard time finding them with a questionable interface on the chopper and bombers. (straying again from AC). The missions are also too damned long and often repeating itself with objectives without any of the charm.Story-wise it kinda sucks, I had no idea what was going on half the time and whatever I gathered is lackluster.This is not a flight simulator, the gameplay has always had unrealistic flight physics and weapons(200 missiles!). It's purely a action fighter game. That's just part of the rule of fun, but the non-flight missions really grate on me.If you do buy this game, I highly reccommend a controller, changing keys result in unresponsive controls, its strictly port gone wrong.

												It's no Fires of Liberation but it's a good aircraft flight game (not sim, it's arcade like).DFM (Dog Fight Mode, it's pretty much rails....) is pretty much the worst thing in this game, but with a bit of skill you can get away without using it for all the non ""Target_LDR"" aircraft (Target_LDR are scripted and usually have some massive building dropping event that you fly under) , the QTEs are basically ""press y"" which if you ignore just continutes the game anyway with no effect.I would say that an xBox controller is essential for this though as i couldn't get it to work with normal mouse and keyboard.It it worth buying a £15 USB xBox controller over? Not on it's own but you'll find other uses for an xBox controller.There are some challenging bits that are more frustrating than anything (could autosave between the bomber runs...)Like i said, it's no Fires of Liberation but if you ignore the Ace Combat title it's a decent standalone aircraft game.

												The black sheep of the Ace Combat franchise. I was EXTREMELY hyped for this title prior to release. Ace Combat 5 is my favourite game of all time, and I thought this would kick the franchise back into gear again. How foolish.Cons:- The gameplay is nothing like the earlier games, so die hard fans will find almost nothing of value here. - The infamous and bizarre dog-fighting sections play like some on-rails arcade shooter. - There are enforced helicopter sections (admittedly a little fun sometimes), enforced third-person gunner sections (again, sometimes fun) and awful bombing missions with overly-complicated recommended flight paths. - The colour scheme is mostly grey/dark green. - The over all combat is ultimately tedious due to over powered nature of your plane. -  The story is forgettable at best. Nothing compared to the grand and bombastic entries into the Strangereal lore in earlier games.But, for all of that. there is some light to this.Pros:- The port is solid (I'm only judging this after 30 minutes of playing, but nothing has crashed and there are minimal frame drops. Graphics settings are sparse though.)- There are a few jaw-dropping moments, usually involving something to do with ejecting from the craft.- The later missions get extremely intense. The penultimate one is actually fantastic.- The gameplay is solid if you enjoy what it offers. Planes are responsive and destroying enemies is satisfying.- Nagase from AC5 makes an easter egg appearance.- The main theme is Ace Combat-esque, and thrilling for it. Also has a couple of other good tracks, like the free mission hangar OST, which serves as a nice throwback to the PS1 days of the seriesMost of my negativity is just from being so heartbroken that this essentially damned the franchise. I don't want to be an♥♥♥♥♥♥and not recommend it for that reason. If this is your first time playing Ace Combat, give it a whirl.Then get a PS2 and play the better ones			"

												If you are a thirteen year old boy living in the United States who comes from a family of over-the-top nationalists, with a heart full of patriotism and 'MURICA, this game may be for you. Throw in a complete lack of exposure to any decent fiction with a liking for any repetitive task, and this game really is for you.Otherwise, it's a trashy, lazily written game with promise but no follow through as you engage in wave after wave of the same dogfights and too little gameplay. With some more missions written for the different types of aircraft this could have been a very interesting and replayable game - it's a pity they waited on the writers, who under-delivered anyway.

												Having played Ace Combat 4 and 6, I can say that this was a bit of a letdown. It isn't a bad game by any stretch, but it  does some things that really take away from the experience. Forced Scripted airplane chases at point blank range that require you to stay as close to the enemy as possible kind of ruin the jet fighter combat dynamic for me. Often, I would unload enough missles into a TGT_LEAD to take out at least three other TGT's before it goes down. Other gripes include the difficulty in some of the controls (you will ABSOLUTELY need a controller/gamepad) and how the aircraft handles. I'll post more as it comes, but overall, this is a rather dissapointing game for ardent fans of the franchise. This feels more like an ""arcade"" entry as opposed to the more ""simulation"" that the previous entries felt.			"

												This game is pretty awful.  I've got the 3DS game and while they may share a similar name and franchise, this PC game is terrible.  They throw up extremely cheap odds against you on each round, not so much a deal when you don't have a life bar, it's the FPS 'pressure' system to death.  The problem comes with this awful system of hitting L+R to get behind something otherwise you can't hit it except rarely so it's not dogfighting it's chase to an assist which gets tedious.  The deal breaker is that the enemy can get a lock on you and they make it very hard to break the lock, and with a missile in the air, the chaff they give you must be confetti as it sure doesn't stop anything from doing damage, EVER.  Making things worse, you don't have good flight controls so you really can't steer properly so you often end up doing odd flat spins or just not being able to turn how you want to evade or keep on something (outside of assist.)  It's a hot mess, and I'm mad, but I'd be furious if I didn't pay more than a buck or two over the holiday for it when it came up as it's trash.  Namco, you suck, fix your franchise because if this is the future count me out.			"

												If you were a fan of the PS2 Ace Combat games, then I'd suggest staying away from this. The DFM mode is Gimmicky and you are more or less forced to use it every flying mission. I was annoyed I couldn't fly similar to how I could in Ace Combat 4,5, or Zero, where I'd be able to invert the plane then push up on the LS on the controller to change the direction of the plane. When going up against enemies, and having to change directions frequently, I've had to stop moving the stick on the controller to let the plane level out before I could continue because for some reason how the setting are set up in the beginning doesn't let you do that. For the five dollars it is right now during the free weekend, it might be worth it, but I wouldn't suggest buying it at higher prices because it doesn't live up to the reputation, nor stay within the world that the Ace Combat games are known for.I want to love this game, I really do, but I've decided to go back to my PS2 and break out Ace Combat 5.

												Cool! A free weekend! So I wanted to like this game, but even free, turns out to be not worth my time.Air combat: really weird. No point in an Immelman, or using an F-16s superior turning radius to get right on a Mig-21s rear. It's just stupid turning circles in the sky. You see a jet fly past while you are already initiating a turn into that path, and in seconds its on your side, leading to... more circles. And what jet carries hundreds of missiles? Ludicrous.Helicopter: Could be cool if you didn't have to do the work of two crew. There is a pilot AND a gunner in an Apache for a reason. Maneuvering to get clear firing between buildings while depressing the turret to allow targeting while watching for enemy fire and evading SAMs... more frustrating than fun.Gunship: This part I liked, on par with the Modern Warfare 1 Spectre chapter.Storyline: A bit lame. The UN/NATO/US mish-mash was just distracting... if it's a US pilot, stick with a US focused storyline, then include NATO allies and UN plot points. General La Pointe? Ribbit.Interface: I'll only remap my joystick controls so many times. Seriously, won't save the settings? I thought that hurdle was conquered 20 years ago.It was really the ridiculous air combat that made me say this game is not worth playing, even when free.			"

												Compared to Ace Combat 6, this is a big let down. -Gets repetitive extremely fast, ideally you can just dogfight and then only have to get into the DFM(dog fight mode) on the hard targets.. but the controls are not even close to ace combat 6 in precision so trying to lock on and killing even scrubs is a pain and your missles might just be walking over there, so the only viable solution left is DFM, so every mission become a DFM 90% and 5% your missles luckily strike and kill an enemy and 5% the AI luckily kills an enemy.

												Very good and fun arcadey flight game (note i did not use the word sim) Do you remember back in the late 80's early 90's when flight game sused to be fun instead of all simulator? well this harkens back to those days. It's sacrifices realism for fun.And isnt that all you want from a game?P.s. You must have a controller preferably a xbox one.			"

												As a long-time fan of the Ace Combat series, having played every Ace Combat game (not including handheld consoles), and being a lover of airplane based games, simulator or not, I can only give this title a THUMBS DOWN. This game is a huge letdown when compared to other games of the series, Assault Horizon has turned the arcadey, over-the-top, epic plane shooter into an rail-based, quicktime event shooter. The game takes away any challenge by holding your hand in DFM or Dog Fight Mode- a poorly executed game design to put the player very close to the action. By doing so the game turns all of the ""difficult"" fighters into scripted events, and quite planely feels like yes, you saw it coming, COD, mixed with a Michael Bay movie in the sky.If you're a veteran of flight sims/arcade flight shooters like me, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, you'll likely want to punch a hole in your moniter.If you're a casual gamer, and you're completely new to the series, you may enjoy this game.TL;DRIf you're a fan of the entire Ace Combat series or flight sims, ♥♥♥♥ this game.If you're a casual gamer, new to the series, you MAY like it.

												For me the most fun I ever had in the ace combat series was the intense dog fighting between myself and the best planes the computer could muster.  This version removed that.  Now they have their version of a quick time event where you mash the missle button until the baddie is dead, and too bad if you don't want to do the QTE, that enemy has infinite flares outside the QTE so you will never take him down without it.  I've never been so dissapointed in a game.  1/10.			"

												In one word: Disappointed. Two words: Very disappointed. I've played all the Ace Combar Titles on the PSP and as some may know, many games on the PSP are usually weaker versions of the full game on the console. Nevertheless I enjoyed them very much, even though they were quite simple in terms of control of the aircraft. But this game here is different. Not the good kind of different. Most annoying is this Dogfight Mode (DFM, they even created an acronym to sound cooler), where the camera locks onto an enemy in front of you and you are pretty much glued to their asses. It's supposed to help you kill the good pilots. It's supposed to make the game look cool and cinematic. But frankly, it's just plain stupid and lame. Here's why: - The enemy aircraft flies differently when you engage Dogfight mode. Why would they? How do they know that our camera angle changed? - You get a warning when an enemy does the same with you and you need to evade him. Yes, you absolutely need to because suddenly he's behind you all the time until his Dogfight mode gets disengaded by your crazy manouvers.- And here's the worst part: Some enemies are marked as Aces or Squadron Leaders. The game wants you to use the Dogfight mode on them ""because they are very difficutl to kill otherwise"". It's not difficult, it's impossible! Your shots don't hit at all, your missiles will miss and even your Machine Gun will NOT HIT. Even though you're clearly shooting at the guy, the machine gun simply misses UNLESS you engage that Dogfight Mode (motion sickness comes with that mode naturally). Sadly I bought this game without reading the reviews because I was such a hardcore Ace Combat fan. Trust the other reviewers! This game is rubbish.			"

												Having been a big fan of the series so far, Squadron Leader in particular (I think it's called Unsung War outside of the UK), this has already disappointed me. After struggling for a bit with their ""optimised control"" option (no roll control, just basic WASD style controls that ping back to centre screen with an N64 Goldeneye aiming system feel) I put it into classic which brought back some feeling that this was after all an Ace Combat game, however the dogfight system is nothing like Ace Combat. The whole focused dogfight thing where you lock in is a novel idea, but it feels like they're trying to reward using it, so missiles out of this system seem to miss around 95% of the time. In Squadron Leader you had to be careful that they wouldn't turn out of your range, but as long as you were chasing, a quick doubletap of missiles would bring most enemies down. With this I struggled for quite a while just trying to pin the last plane in a dogfight down for long enough so I could actually fire at him in a straight line or even get in close enough to trigger the dogfight system without him turning off. This would have been less frustrating if the dogfight was one on one, but I had about 10 allied pilots engaged in the same fight that didn't even seem to be attempting to bring him down at all! I think this game would be okay for someone who has no prior experience with the Ace Combat series, but otherwise I'd avoid it.			"

												I bought this game because I loved Ace Combat 5 and Zero--replayed several times, loved. I almost destroyed my controller in rage with this game. Complaints:* Bugs and lag that make you fly into the ground when they let up* Dogfighting mode segments that add enemies* Odd minigame-ish modes for ground assaults and dogfighting* Controls for gamepad that mean either certain things are too easy to hit accidentally or you can't actually satisfy key combinations you neeed to press* Complete absence of a meangful sense of progress, planes unlock when they unlock* Truly incompetitent AI wingmen, you'll ""keep them off me""? Is that why I have four missiles in my back right now?* Randomly shoving the player behind a minigunSo I have a list. I did not like this game. It made me angry with how cheap the gameplay felt.			"

												Not impressed...Pros:-Honestly after thinking long and hard about the pros...I honestly can't find any.Cons:-Graphics are not even the slightest great. They are ok at absolute best.-The dog fight system takes control of your plane and keeps the enemy lined up. Honestly, if you're going to make a dog fighting game...give it a challenge aspect of actual aireal combat.-The controls are the worst i've ever seen in any flight game. Even not set to standard layout and your own, they are still horrible.-If you are looking for something with a shred of realism look elsewhere.Would recommend War Thunder far over this game. They have proper dog fights. They have single and multiplayer. Controls can be as easy or as hard as you'd like. They can also range from semi-realistic...to down right accurate.			"

This means the computer is not limited to the same phycics as the player and that is just irritating.  In this game you will feel that its unfair and that is the case exactly.Next to that i did like the dog fight mode though it does get boring.			"

												TLDR: It's like buying the exact same copy as the PS3 version.I played this a lot on my PS3 and even completed all the trophies and maxed out and dominated (Since you get overpowered skills on max rank) on the multiplayer.Gameplay wise, this game is pretty much entertaining. The new dogfight mode makes you feel like a badass but it also makes the game easier. I like it though but many people seemed disappointed with it. Especially the long time fans of the series. But it's completely optional though. You can even pick between the new and classic controls.Story is okay. It has a typical military action storyline. It entertains you during the cutscenes. It has a COD cutscene feel to it but overall, the story is forgettable. Obviously, it was made to fit the gameplay.Multiplayer is pretty much dead. You can play with your friends though. Coop or other competitive modes but this game's multiplayer shines with a full lobby of people with planes flying around like a swarm of flies killing each other.Now last but not the least, the graphics. I just have to say that this is not a good port but it's not bad either. I was excited to try this game on PC with max settings. But the graphic settings doesn't have a deep graphic customization. There are no advanced graphic settings. That would be cool if it weren't originally made for the PS3 but you can see the lack of texture on this one. It looks like a quick conversion from the PS3 to PC. It's not that bad though, it runs smooth and PS3 graphics still looks good but it could've done better with more textures, more effects and etc. Somehow they didn't take advantage of the superior graphics a PC can offer.

												ACE COMBAT: ASSAULT HORIZONPROS:+Wide selection of modern jet aircraft to choose from, even some older ones like the F-4 Phantom+Customizable paint job option+Simple controls+Decent graphics+Camera angles are handled pretty well+Missions are challenging and fun+Only a few escort missions with most being focused on shooting down aircraft, which is why we play air combat games to begin with+Action follows a story with charactersCONS:-Dogfight Mode is overemphasized, being necessary to take down certain enemies, making the game feel a bit too scripted-Combat is unrealistic as it usually takes 2+ missiles and tons of bullets to shoot down an enemy-Enemies can engage you in DFM and do so endlessly, limiting your maneuverability and pulling you away from whatever you're doing-Allies hardly help you at all except in missions where they are specifically assigned to cover for you-Helicopter missions feel disconnected and don't really seem necessary-Characters are underdeveloped and flat, making it hard to feel anything for them-Story is generic and predictable, rife with cliches -Too many Russian stereotypes-Only the campaign missions are available to choose from in free mission, limiting replayability-Characters never salute commanding officers (what kind of military is this?)FINAL VERDICT:I would rate this game a 6/10. It is a fun pick up and play game, but don't expect realism because you'll be disappointed. I recommend it, but don't pay full price. Full price doesn't feel justified.			"

												This might be fine for someone who just wants an air combat game to play, but if you're a fan of the older AC titles like AC04 this just isn't for you.Several major elements have been changed for jets: Your machine guns never run out of ammo, and neither do your missiles, they simply have a cooldown period. There's also a new ""chase"" mechanic which locks you onto an enemy and autopilots you around, making aiming your only concern in a dogfight. It's basically rail shooter mode. Not only is this boring and unchallenging, but it also looks ridiculous as you weave between buildings and oil rigs at mach two. Use of this mechanic is optional against most enemies, but certain VIP targets force you to use it in order to take them down.The helicopter missions come in two flavors: awkwardly controlled attack helo and boring rail shooter transport helo. There are also gunship rail shooter missions straight out of CoD.Overall everything feels very scripted like a CoD game and there isn't a lot of room for stages to play out differently when you replay them. There's no tension because you never run out of ammo, and there's no challenge because of the autopiloting chase system.If you're a long-time AC fan like me you'll probably hate this game. If you still buy CoD games then this is for you.			"

												The best dogfight simulator so far in my opinion.I have been playing Ace Combat series since Ace Combat 2 for PS1 and I haven't found a better simulator!Sure they made some mistakes in this new title, but it's not like the game is unplayable, like Ace Combat 4 was (their first PS2 title). Many companies have problems when launching a game for the first time in a new platform. I also think the story was the worst so far and they should make the other missions optional, such as chopper and gunship, as this is not the focus of the game. Plus, the game is relatively short compared to other Ace Combat titles.But this is still a pretty dam good simulator! DFM doesn't make things worst, people just don't like changes. And it's very nice to play online too! It adds a nice innovating mechanic to the game.Totally worth it, specially when it;s 75% off!I have this game now for PS3 and for PC =D(some will say I'm stupid because of that, but I don't care, I really like this game)			"

												Not totally recomended but Good game.Not your typical flight SIM, I haven't played previous Ace Combat games but I've heard a lot of fuzz about them being pretty much the closer thing to a realistic Air Combat SIM, much more than the H.A.W.X. series.In the 7 hours it took me to finish the Campaing I've found it to be unrealistic when it comes to Dogfights and AA combat, the controls are quite slippery but very responsive depending on the plane you choose and it is nice to be able to switch between the standard controls and traditional plane SIM controls.The game itself encourages the player to enter the DFM (Dog Fight Mode) to engage other planes which otherwise cannot be eliminated by normal means, but making reality aside it is quite an eye-candy show of Badassery and adrenaline, it is a shame that most of the dogfight is pre-scripted so you take little participation in that insane airshow but it just looks so damm awesome that after quite some time came to PC to show-off its capabilities.I played Ace Combat Assault Horizon: Legacy on the 3DS and it quite matches the gameplay portion of engage and destroy with physically impossible manuvers that look cool.

												Purchased this for PS3 and now for the PC. Although the game is a bit different from previous versions it's still fun and challenging to play! Want to make it more immersive ? Throw on some top gun music like ""Danger Zone and ""Mighty Wings"" while using a Logitech Rumble Pad 2 controller! : ) Learn to counter maneuver and you won't become as frustrated when you are being chased down by enemy squadron fighters.  The game is well polished and has plenty of replay value. You got tons of air craft options to choose from and you get to experience air to air combat, air to ground combat in various styles which include cool cinematics.I understand it's not the same Ace Combat we all loved back when the PS2 version was released but this is still a fun game to play. Just learn the controls to avoid frustration! Once you get the hang of it you will enjoy it so much more.  The game looks incredible graphically at 1280x720 resolution. Give it a shot!			"

												I've been a long time Ace Combat fan and I will admit that this game is not all that bad, but I simply cannot recommend it to people who are thinking that they're getting an Ace Combat game when they're purchasing it.1.  The storyI'm well aware that story was never the strong point in Ace Combat games, sure, but they were at least charming enough that you could connect with them.  The story of this game was just too ridiculous to take seriously;  I couldn't help but roll my eyes and think ""What.....seriously?"" when the ""motives"" of the main antagonist were revealed (Won't spoil, but it's just STUPID).2.  Helicopter/Gunship missionsThey're kinda neat at first, but the more you do them the more you get to wondering ""So when am I getting back into the jet again?"".  Ace combat was always based around dogfighting with the best aces around, and these missions just felt completely out of place, like they didn't even belong in an Ace Combat game.3.  DFM (Dog Fighting Mode)It's kinda cool at first.  Makes the game very cinematic and gives you the feeling that you're the badass ace that you're supposed to be; only problem is that they take it WAY too far.  Some parts of the game are literally impossible to complete without it and aren't properly designated so you could be repeating a segment upwards of 10 times without knowing that you HAVE to be in DFM to win.  And I'm sorry, those ace fights where you're literally pumping 10-20 missiles into the back of some ""Ace"" pilot's plane?  That's not fun, that's just ridiculous.4.  ReplayabilityThere is none.  Sure you could go back and replay missions in the ""Free Mission"" mode after you unlocked them, but because of all the above problems it's just not FUN to do so.  All those new planes that you unlock after you beat the campaign are basically meaningless because the game forces a set playstyle on you with DFM.Summary/TL;DR:  It was fun for the initial run of the campaign, but not beyond that.  Worth it if you're buying it for the sale, not so much otherwise.			"

Regardles of it i was trying to get my focus on the game but there just was to many stops, explanations and stuff. When it comes to a an end, summary of my gameplay was like 5 minutes or so. Not much to say.			"

												Hi,i had this title on my whishlist, and then game the play free weeekend.Unfortunately i could not play because in the first mission when i should activate the Dog Fight Mode (DFM) it crashes with ""not responding"" message. Tried different things, verify game cache, install the stuff in ""support""-folder and requested support from the community. Nothing helped to solve the problem.I have a lot of games but none of them had a problem with my system.So if a friend wuold ask me if he should buy it, i would recommend  to try out first before the buy.

You can do a gosh dang barrel roll in a helicopter.Games is not buggy but I can't complete mission because of ridiculous checkpoint system.Story rips off modern warfare. American super-pilots helps Russian just pilots to fight with Russian super-criminals. And Russian super-criminals got tons of jets and tank for you to destroy.I didn't expect to get such western product from japanese developers.All These high scores (77 on metacritic) are probably bought.

												not a good ace combat game this game was the end of good a good game that was alot of fun. the problem is this ace combat changes up the fighting and camra so much that it just ruined the game for me not to mention the story isnt the best it could be alot better seeing the past storyline.also the control set up sucks and for the first 2 min of the game the plane is fling itself. the combat in this game changed so much since ace combat 6. it changed into a more arcade type game were it just felt like point and shoot. in ace combat 6 the combat came down to skill,knowing your aircraft and would often have you replaying partss you messed up on or felt need work, it just felt like after completing the story you were fufilled with a sense of skill. the story in ace combat 6 speaks alot more were as in this ace combat its just action now story later.  if you can buy ace combat 6 dont waste money on this even if its on sale its really not worth it			"

												When I bought this I was expecting an arcade game with no realisitic qualities, but it really does take the unrealistic to another level. Enemies break the laws of physics with regards to being able to constantly turn on a dime and seemingly having the ability to get a lock on you without even being pointed in your direction. The game forces you to use the horrible 'dog fight mode' in order to shoot down enemies because without it, missiles just barely ever hit anything. I think  if they removed the dog fight mode and tweaked the manual dogfighting it would be a much more enjoyable experience. Also they need to tone down the whole super evil Russian bad guy with god like flying abilities thing -_- They really ruined it by pushing a whole bunch of cheesy gimicks and cliches.			"

												It's a little bit hard reccomending this game, since the game has many good and bad points. The game is not a flight simulator, and tends to be an arcade flight game, where most of the time all you need to do is press space bar while you crosshair is red. With beautiful graphics, some skippable CGs and an nice soundtrack during fights, it can be a very fun game.My first sensation while playing the game was that it was a lot flashy, and designed to be something easy for your free time, and it can be enjoyable, but with times get a little boring and repetitive. When you are too close from the ground, too close to the map end or in DFM (Dogfight Mode), almost all of the controls are taken from you to make the game easier to new players. But sometimes, it gets too easy, and during chopper flights you almost only have to hold the two mouse buttons and A/D to kill everything.If you are looking for a game where the first challenge starts in getting familiar with the controls to have complete control over the aircraft, this game is far from it. This game has a feel of being targeted to more casual players, not exactly excluding hadcore gamers, but the major part of the game is made to be fun, not challenging. "

												Awful, awful game. Not just is it unlike any of the previous Ace Combat games, the gameplay mechanics are annoying and tedious. Some enemies can only be killed in the cinematic DFM or Dogfight Mode, maneuvers rely on use of quick time events, and the autosaving isn't very reliable. The cinematics and models look nice, the soundtrack is fitting and there is a large smattering of aircraft, but don't pick up this game. Even for $5, it's not very good.P.S. As far as the game instructed me, there is no roll control, you just have to use the arrow keys and trust the autopilot to guide you in the right way.			"

Feels like auto-aim in a first person shooter. I loved the older games back on the PS1 or 2 (whichever it was - probably both) so it is a little disappointing. Having said that, it isn't TERRIBLE. If I had an option to choose maybe rather than yes or no, I would. Works with Xbox controller quite well otherwise, and looks decent. Might be more reliable on different PC setup. (drivers etc)			"

I work in the aviation industry which could play a part in all the quirks that♥♥♥♥♥♥me off about this game but aside from that the controls are absolutely horrible.  The story seems fake and the graphics are on sub-par levels.  The gameplay feels cheap and it seems like a game targeted to 10 year olds dreaming of becoming an idiot pilot.

												SINGLEPLAYER Pilot Difficulty REVIEW: I really really wanted to recommend this game. But there just isn't enough going for Assault Horizon for me to do so. The gameplay can get really fun and intense at some parts but in many other it can feel like a drag. Mainly due to the controls and game mechanics. The Dogfighting Mode (DFM) seemed cool at first and to be honest, I really thought it was a nice change for a spinoff game. What I disliked about it is that many of the dogfights (Including the final boss battle) that require DFM require you to wait until you have flown around exploding setpieces before you are allowed to actually damage the target. This can get very annoying and once you discover this you lose that feeling that you are actually using tactics to beat that enemy ace.And then we get to the story by the highly acclaimed millitary writer ""Jim DeFelice"". Maybe there is something more hidden behind this dull, cliche story but even so, the story itself is a pain to get through. To sum it up: you get betrayed by the Russians who later turn out to just be revolutionaries in a against Russia. Then you work with the Russian loyalists to defeat the coup. Though the bad guy ace escapes with the superweapon to america so you follow him and kill him. The characters are another level of boring too. Most characters are your stereotypical cast: An ace who has a nightmares, a black man who seems interesting if only they dove into his story more, a cocky wingman, and a manly female. All of which are extremely predictable in the cliche things they do.As a player of both AC 4 & 5, I tried to keep the comparisons to a minimum but even so, it is still hard to recommend a game with such potentioal when it's mechanics and story are so lackluster.If you REALLY want to give this game a try. I would say go for it. It's not a terrible game and there are many parts that are really fun and thrilling. But if you are on the fence or expecting the top quality of it's predecessors, I would suggest waiting until the next numerical installment in the series.			"

												""Press READ MORE to read the rest of this review.""................Kay, <i>now</i> you can read it. 9_9The game has some serious port and coding issues. From the start when we're instructed to press Space (and not Enter, not Escape, not mouse click, nor any other key, but Space speciffically) simply to enter the main menu, over inabillity to change keys on-the-fly if one of the keys is already binded, to dreadfull mouse implementation (almost useles) and early-last-gen textures. This should have been an enhanced edition, but it still looks crappy and is almost incompatible, from these day's usability perspective, with keyboard.For me, who is a complete plane-sim noob the airplane battles get fairly long and tedious. Chopper battles were nicer, but had very familiar feel to standard bland millitary (FPS, sic!) shooter - regenerative ""health"" and all. But storywise, the whole game is like that. ""Yeeeah, 'Murica, let's blow some sheept up!"" I got to the part where (deep vawering astonishment) Russians, those wacky rascals, turned sides and started attacking good Americans and friends, and I couldn't get on with it. Promo demo version for some reason didn't save my keyboard settings and has crashed on me after 2 hours playing. Since I didn't have enough strength to get through the logical puzzle of rebinding all the keys again (Exchange object A's place with  object B! Get object A into slot B. But slot B is occupied, so.. Get object B into slot C, Get object A into slot B. Get object B into slot A...) I promptly uninstalled it and have no wish what so ever to buy the whole game.			"

												Ignoring its title and separating it from the previous Ace Combat games does little to save it from its own faults. Ace Combat: Assault Horizon takes a step back from the interesting, if not corny world of Strangereal, and plays the Russian/American conflict card. This tired formulaic story is complemented by a downgrade in gameplay. Dogfighting is made simple, and boring, with the introduction of a near-rail-shooter experience that removes the freedom from flight and negates the need for skillful airmanship. It would be acceptable to have a “boss” flight lead require this mechanic, but every flight lead requires that you lock into dogfight mode; even if you land missiles on target, the game ignores the hits and will not progress until you put on your training wheels and go for the ride. The game does include a new diversity of aircraft with the introduction of helicopters and bombers, which if properly executed would nearly save the game, but bomber runs are not particularly fun and the helicopter sections are tedious and awkward. Overall, the game looks great graphically (although the graphical settings are sparse) and gives you a decently realistic flight simulation, but its glaring flaws make it just an okay experience. Personally, I would award 3/5 stars to this game and would recommend picking it up only if it happens to be on sale.			"

												As most of the other reviews have said the game takes control away from you. The Dogfight Mode simply flies the plane and you wait for the green circle to turn red and then fire your missile, I also suspect it is impossible to destroy TGT_Leads without it. The Counter Maneuver mode works the same way, wait for the red and green arrow to overlap, press the button and you're now behind the offending plane. I want fly the plane, not have it done for me. To put the final nail in the coffin the planes regenerate health. Yes you read that correctly, they regenerate health. Can anyone explain this, I'm terribly confused, was I picking up med packs in mid-air or does my X-wing come with an R2 unit for in-flight repairs? On a side note you also have infinite missiles, once you hit zero wait for the timer and you get two more. Both of these anomalies occur in the Elite difficulty as well.I'll be waiting for something akin to the previous Ace Combat titles.			"

The campaign is short, I finished in 10 hours and though there are some extra gameplay with free missions, tons of customizables avions (only in color) and multiplayer, I recommend try first the game before buy it. If you are a fan of pure arcade games and lot of action, is an OK game for play in a weekend. In case of you are a fan or purist of simulator games, you better check other options.As a game of a franchise once time recognizable in the consoles, is more Call of Duty than Ace Combat.

												I've been a long time Ace Combat fan and I will admit that this game is not all that bad, but I simply cannot recommend it to people who are thinking that they're getting an Ace Combat game when they're purchasing it.1.  The storyI'm well aware that story was never the strong point in Ace Combat games, sure, but they were at least charming enough that you could connect with them.  The story of this game was just too ridiculous to take seriously;  I couldn't help but roll my eyes and think ""What.....seriously?"" when the ""motives"" of the main antagonist were revealed (Won't spoil, but it's just STUPID).2.  Helicopter/Gunship missionsThey're kinda neat at first, but the more you do them the more you get to wondering ""So when am I getting back into the jet again?"".  Ace combat was always based around dogfighting with the best aces around, and these missions just felt completely out of place, like they didn't even belong in an Ace Combat game.3.  DFM (Dog Fighting Mode)It's kinda cool at first.  Makes the game very cinematic and gives you the feeling that you're the badass ace that you're supposed to be; only problem is that they take it WAY too far.  Some parts of the game are literally impossible to complete without it and aren't properly designated so you could be repeating a segment upwards of 10 times without knowing that you HAVE to be in DFM to win.  And I'm sorry, those ace fights where you're literally pumping 10-20 missiles into the back of some ""Ace"" pilot's plane?  That's not fun, that's just ridiculous.4.  ReplayabilityThere is none.  Sure you could go back and replay missions in the ""Free Mission"" mode after you unlocked them, but because of all the above problems it's just not FUN to do so.  All those new planes that you unlock after you beat the campaign are basically meaningless because the game forces a set playstyle on you with DFM.Summary/TL;DR:  It was fun for the initial run of the campaign, but not beyond that.

												If you were a fan of the PS2 Ace Combat games, then I'd suggest staying away from this. The DFM mode is Gimmicky and you are more or less forced to use it every flying mission. I was annoyed I couldn't fly similar to how I could in Ace Combat 4,5, or Zero, where I'd be able to invert the plane then push up on the LS on the controller to change the direction of the plane. When going up against enemies, and having to change directions frequently, I've had to stop moving the stick on the controller to let the plane level out before I could continue because for some reason how the setting are set up in the beginning doesn't let you do that. For the five dollars it is right now during the free weekend, it might be worth it, but I wouldn't suggest buying it at higher prices because it doesn't live up to the reputation, nor stay within the world that the Ace Combat games are known for.I want to love this game, I really do, but I've decided to go back to my PS2 and break out Ace Combat 5.

												Cool! A free weekend! So I wanted to like this game, but even free, turns out to be not worth my time.Air combat: really weird. No point in an Immelman, or using an F-16s superior turning radius to get right on a Mig-21s rear. It's just stupid turning circles in the sky. You see a jet fly past while you are already initiating a turn into that path, and in seconds its on your side, leading to... more circles. And what jet carries hundreds of missiles? Ludicrous.Helicopter: Could be cool if you didn't have to do the work of two crew. There is a pilot AND a gunner in an Apache for a reason. Maneuvering to get clear firing between buildings while depressing the turret to allow targeting while watching for enemy fire and evading SAMs... more frustrating than fun.Gunship: This part I liked, on par with the Modern Warfare 1 Spectre chapter.Storyline: A bit lame. The UN/NATO/US mish-mash was just distracting... if it's a US pilot, stick with a US focused storyline, then include NATO allies and UN plot points. General La Pointe? Ribbit.Interface: I'll only remap my joystick controls so many times. Seriously, won't save the settings? I thought that hurdle was conquered 20 years ago.It was really the ridiculous air combat that made me say this game is not worth playing, even when free.			"

												This game, for the short bit that I had played it for, came off as your typical Namco action game; silly plot with sillier twists and even sillier paint schemes for some aircraft along with very arcady controls; not a game for the simulator enthusist, but that's not whom this game is catoring for.  This is for the action junky who wants to feel badass while flying some flavor of jet fighter or one of the other aircraft.  Yes, for the first time in the series you get to fly something other than jets!  From door gunner on a black hawk to an Apache Longbow, it'll have something that is both ""airborne"" and ""not jet fighter"" for you.On the whole, this is a solidly built game that will test your computer's speed.  I would have bouts of momentary lag due to having a system that uses DDR2 ram and a low-ish bus speed.  Other than that, it ran smoothly even at maximum settings on a mid-grade graphics card.  Enemies do not easily present themselves to be spanked by you, and even on easy difficulty will make attempts to shoot you out of the sky.  Just remember that, when you boot up the game, to leave your thinking caps at the door.  You will not be needing that here, and you will have more fun that way.			"

												Tried this for free, I could only stand to play it for about 20 minutes so consider this a quick and dirty first impression. So the game starts with you shooting down a few planes during a kind of tutorial session, culminating in an enemy called ""TGM_LEAD""  I put over 20 missiles and countless bullets into him but he must of been flying an invincible plane because nothing I did actually did any damage. He eventually gets behind me and 2 rockets later I'm dead. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. And the entire time my 3 ""wingmen"" simply fly in a circle doing bugger all.  "

												Basically Call of Duty meets Michael Bay in the air with Skyrim killcams. Reminds me of CoD because the health system is like it, which is fine by me. The explosions and destructions are neat for like an hour, then repetitive or overdone. Killcams completely disrupt the flow of combat and immersion, to summarize them, ""Hey, I can't aim my 120 mm cannon on this gunship until they finish blowing up!"" or ""Am I playing a game or just watching them blow up? OH CRAP I'M FLYING!"" Dogfight mode is kind of neat (albiet quicktime event-like) and I was hoping I could avoid dogfighting altogether with it (I've never cared for dogfighting and turning in circles all day long, bombing is way more fun to me), but you have to already be close behind a target before it can be engaged so you have to dogfight anyways, and, like many others have stated, dogfighting mode gets old quickly and, furthermore, THE ENEMIES USE IT ON YOU! (hax!)Controls are a little awkward to start (by default you can't go upside-down, only 90 degrees sideways - A.K.A not flying a plane), but after some fiddling it played like any other Ace Combat. The helicopter mission was truely awful. No Battlefield helicopter controls means you are not actually flying a helicopter, especially since you can't circle strafe targets or roadkill them when you run out of ammo, also apparently you can do a barrel roll to avoid all missiles forever (wish I had that in BF). I ended up having to cower and wait until my missiles reloaded so I could fire them all at once (because it doesn't let you actually conserve ammunition) and then later I found out the helicopter had a gun too, oops. I suppose the helicopter controls can't be like the BF helicopter controls though because the learning curve is steep and unforgiving.The story is real-world based, which I thought might be cool, but from what I saw was really boring and the ""rebels"" were some undefined group with no background. I miss Osea and Yuktobania, bring them back Ace Combat!The point where (I think) mutliple enemies started using dogfighting mode on me where I could not shake them at all even after stalling in a much slower plane I just put the game down (forever) and wrote this review. Apparently there is a system of counters, but it was so poorly explained and displayed on the screen I never figured it out in like 3 lives of getting rolled by their shenanigans.Glad to not see GFWL on this game though (go steam!) and glad I could try it out on a free weekend to know not to spend my money on it (again, go steam!). All in all, if you're looking for an Ace Combat game, dust off that PS2.			"

												Compared to Ace Combat 6, this is a big let down. -Gets repetitive extremely fast, ideally you can just dogfight and then only have to get into the DFM(dog fight mode) on the hard targets.. but the controls are not even close to ace combat 6 in precision so trying to lock on and killing even scrubs is a pain and your missles might just be walking over there, so the only viable solution left is DFM, so every mission become a DFM 90% and 5% your missles luckily strike and kill an enemy and 5% the AI luckily kills an enemy.

												Although it seems most people don't recomend this game, I say don't believe this game to be a bad game. Although its true what everyone says about this being very restrictive and scripted and very Call of Duty like, the game itself is still very funThe story line isn't the greatest thing, but there are some super dramatic and epic parts that keep the campaign interesting. However the rest of the story line is pretty generic, but that doesnt really matter because the missions are fun enough that they could stand alone without a story line at all and still be really good on its own.For the gameplay, some parts are scripted with the ""Dog Fight Mode"" which pretty much holds your hand and walks you through a dogfight, or just automates the flying so you can shoot. I can see why people dislike this feature, but I think it doesnt necessarily ruin the game because you don't HAVE to use it if you don't want to (although some scripted parts you'll be forced to use it anyway but that isn't very often), and sometimes the feature is actually useful because the game does get very chaotic and intense.(but thats probably because I'm a noob at flying games) Aside from the ""Dog Fight Mode"" thing, the rest of the gameplay is very immersive and fun with a great combination of stellar graphics and effects, and flying around shooting the crap out of things. (except for the helicopter parts, those were more annoying that fun due to bad controls.)In conclusion, I must say that this is the first game in the Ace Combat series that I really played in depth, so I guess I did miss out on all the previous titles, and I wouldn't know how much better they were according to the veteran players. I can understand why fans of the series would hate this, but despite what they say, its still a pretty fun game.  "

												As someone who played AC4 and AC5 I was very skeptical. The game leaves the anime like feel in favor of a gritty modern setting. However, the game redeems its self with its revamped gameplay. The game seems WAY more fast paced than previous titles. The downside is that the characters are flat... epecially the protagonist who is as vanilla as you can be. He also wont stop saying ""damn."" While I played through the campain (which is reasonably long even on medium difficulty) I am quite sure he said it 23 times or so. Give this game a try.			"

												I wish this game would describe it is a  keyboard only game . If you are used to play H.A.W.X. series for example, at the beginning you will probably keep trying to grab the mouse for quick steering to dodge an incoming missile, which obviously will not work because of the keyboard only controls. This requires some time to master at the beginning but does not damage reaction time too much.I am not acquainted with previous versions of ACE Combat, but this game particularly is pretty much what I expected it to be and therefore I am recommending it.

												Great game to play.While it's not as good as the previous games of the series, it's a blast to play both mutiplayer and single player (though the story is quite bland). Some tweaking with the DFM and replacement of the helicopter missions with something else, this can be one of the best. Veteran Ace Combat players can use the Original Mode for plane controls but it will take you time to learn piloting it in DFM.			"

												So this game is alot differnent form older Ace Combat games, but the negative ratings are not deserved.  Once you get to know the game abit more, you see some things that are pretty cool. For one, it's acually faster to shoot down AI planes in the multiplayer the old fashioned way.  I have no idea what kind of weed Project Aces was on when they thought DFM was a good idea, but the few who at least gave it a chance still had fun playing.  So normally in like AC04, you get behind the planes and shoot them, here you just press 2 buttons insted of press the missile button.  It's not as different as it seems, and Ace Combat infinity is there if you want to play something closer to a ""real"" ace combat game.  Plus this is the only AC game on PC, aka the best gaming platform in all but convienece.  Also, CHECK OUT VECTOR THRUST, IT'S ON STEAM!  It's cooler, or going to be, than AC infinity.			"

												Fast paced, intense arcade action.  Fun til I got to the first apache mission; i never got past that during the free weekend.  It seems like most of the negative reviews I read were either coming from disappointment that it is not like other AC games, or that this is too arcade-like, or that is a quick & dirty console port with shoddy control options.I have never played any other AC game, so I had no expectations from playing those.  I don't know anything about their stories or gameplay.  I don't even own a Sony console.I also was not looking for a realistic jet fighter simulation; I have Falcon 4.0 for that.  I am OK with the DFM even if it is sort of a rail shooter sequence - Panzer Dragoon Orta is a rail shooter and one of my favorite games ever.  The DFM adds some cinematic excitement, and you still have to do some ""real"" flying to initiate it.  I don't mind that it is mandatory for some enemies; I often initiate it on my own anyway.I have running into some buggy controls (i don't think the game likes my Saitek keyboard). And although I was disappointed that my MS Sidewinder Force Feedback 2 did not work right away and i didn't want to waste my limited gaming time during the free weekend trying to get it to work, it runs fine using my Xbox 360 controller.  However I got stuck on the first apache mission and didn't have the time to work through it.  I might just need to tweak the control settings.  I saw a ton of help with controller configuration on Steam forums and out on the web.I read somewhere that there is only one other apache mission after the first one, so I think I have decided to go ahead and buy it.  If I can get past that, it should be a fun game for a while.			"

												With a Controller in ""Optimal"" control mode, it plays like an awesome arcade flight game. Very intense action, and a quite varried set of quick-time kills and manuvers. Each plane handles differently, and each weapon behaves differently. The multiplayer is non-existent, but the campaign was awesome. I'm going to play it through a few more times on a higher difficulty.With a controller in ""Classic"" control mode, it's a blood-pumping combat sim. I haven't tried a joystick yet, but I imagine it will still play quite well. Some of the dogfights are are still arcady, but I don't think you'd be able to take on some of the enemies without it.

												This entirety of the plane based combat in this game was merely a series of quicktime events. There was little to no influence on the outcome of a mission based on the player's piloting skills as everything was determined by how good your timing is in an extremely dull and unfulfilling interactive cutscene. When there are so many other quality arcade/flight sims on steam there is no justification for playing. Even when it was free.			"

												I love the ace combat series...or should i say loved. I started with ace combat 4 shattered skys, and if your looking for a truely fantastic game I suggest you pick that one up, there's nothing quite like the story in that game, and by the end mission every time the radio crackled with chatter from other pilots it would send a shiver up my spine. similarly six was a very good game as well but this....this isn't ace combat. First and formost I was very excited for multiplayer co-op, however if your like me and you were hoping to jump into it right away, don't bother. you need to unlock missions first, not to mention single player is the only way to learn some of the core mechanics and controls. it's not a big deal a minor gripe really. this reallly sets the tone for the game however, a sad clunky mess. the dogfight mechanic is more annoying then anything else. I like that they tried something new, and the effects given to this is neat...but it quickly loses it's appeal and it seems to compensate or more likely FORCE people to use it, missles and specials seem ALOT less accurate...it also seems to me that specials seem almost completely useless in air to air unlike previous games which is disappointing. it's simply easier to fly up behind an enemy and dogfight them, likewise countering a plane flying after you is stupidly easy too...and while it seems they were really trying to intensify the action it seems instead I end up fighting with the controls more then the targets. likewise the story is unappealing, it's personal preference but I prefered the non real places, it allowed them much more freedom with the plot, the characters themselves have no real life to them unlike the previous games. all in all playing this game makes me wish I was playing one of the previous games instead. If you like the previous ace combat games stay away from this.			"

												The perfect example of what a plane game should be. Easy controls, no elitist controls like all those boring simulations, you dont havetpo land a lot when you play(landings have always been boring), fights are fair and easy. May all developers who consider to create flight games take example on this wonderful ace combat assault mode.			"

												This game... Rated top dog by all the review critics, well they obviously havnted played the pc port, the graphics options are nill. The controls are by far the worst thing however, not because i suck at plane games. Because this games controls are near enought unplayable without either a joystick or a controller. (yes i know D:) The games mechanics are not on par with even the old games and the fov is terrible and almost unplayable, giving you motion blur wherever possible with a healthy dose of lock on spam, just what we all needed... I can only recommend if you have a controller, and no other flight game liek tom clanceys Hawx or the old games. Its just better for your health and your wallet to go and play warthunder, its a free to play (with perfect flight controls) overall 4/10 (not god-awefull, but my god its just a console game from the very begining)			"

												    Extremely disappointed, even at 75% off($7.??). Game is set up for keyboard or X box controller but NO JOYSTICK, how unatural. I am 64 years old and love combat games. I am sitting here with a great wireless x-box type controller and wireless joystick plus a fantastic gaming keyboard. I use them all but when flying, I expect to use a stick, it's just natural. X-box type are great for AA3, Alien vs Preditor, hitman, metro, Doom3, left for dead etc.,etc., but for flying, I expect to use a stick. After all, it is a form of flight simulator >> right??? I don't have a problem with people flying SIMs with controllers and keyboards but how hard would it be to write in lines of code to have a stick option for people like me and there are a LOT of people like me???????   The other problems I have and I only played 20 minutes or so are these. It seems like you ALWAYS start and end ""in flight"", no landings or take offs. Also, no refueling or anything???? Maybe I missed something that might be in there but I don't think so. From what I can see (and I really never got past the tuitorial stage before being bored to insanity) all you do is fly, shoot and die. Where's the fun???? I could be wrong but, lacking a joystick option, I don't have the patience to dig any deeper into the game. I woud rather fly the slow, prop spinning, tail draggers on Ace's High.    I don't know if anyone out there remembers ""JANE'S USAF"" or ""Eurofighter 2000"" but those were ""GAMES"". Especially JANE'S,,,,, fantastic flight sims. I still have them and keep a beefed up Windows 98SE computer around just for them.    As far as this Ace Combat, if I had paid full price, I would be fighting for a refund. I'll just let it sit in my ""library"" and collect dust.    I just want to say that I have made a lot of purchases through Steam over the years and this is my first disappointment..			"

												I don't even know where to start with this game. From the moment I launched it, it has been rife with bugs. You have to mode the Default_Input.ini file just to get a glitch taken care of that constantly holds the down button. From there, you have to manually set all of your mouse controls everytime you launch the game, because it doesn't save your settings. This is coming from a major bug where my mouse and keyboard won't send signals to my aircraft in game. Nothing happens. I haven't made it from the first 2 minutes of game play because I am unable to control my plane. Do not buy, even on sale. Not worth it at all.			"

												Ace Combat with PC frames is RIDICULOUSLY GOOD.Since you can turn the dial up to pretty damn high levels on the framerate side, there's pretty smooth flying, Fox.Would still recommend playing with a gamepad, though it's easy enough played with keyboard and mouse. Planes are strictly keyboard based, helichoppers are mouse and keyboard combo, side gunner is strictly mouse and can be likened to a point and click adventure.IT SHOULD REALLY BE SAID however that Assault Horizon is not Ace Combat as those familiar with the series would remember it as. While the helicopters are neat (albeit limited) and planes are still the focus, it's a story mode with talking protags and a very arcadey DFM (DogFight Mode) system. Incredibly cinematic, and I enjoy it personally, but it's not the good ol' method of taking out the baddies.Still, if you've tried AC:AH already, the PC version is the one taking it to eleven.			"

												TLDR:  HOTAS (Saitek X45) won't work with this game.  Probably others as well.  Only playable with a gamepad, and a let-down if you want the classic Ace Combat experience.As a long-time fan of Ace Combat since Ace Combat 4, I can say that this game really is a departure from the old, Ace Combat experience that most fans of the series have come to know and love.  That being said, when I played this game before on my 360, I thought it was still a fun addition to the series.  It could be enjoyable to someone newer to Ace Combat.I got this game while it was available for free one weekend on Steam.  I wanted to see how it would feel controlled by a HOTAS, specifically, a Saitek X45.  I figured this would be simple; after all, Saitek made an Xbox 360 version of the X45 for special editions of Ace Combat 6.  After fumbling around the options screen for 30 minutes, I've determined that it's not possible to use the X45 with this game.The default controls bound my throttle to an axis of movement the X45 isn't capable of.  For X45 users, it was the sliver paddle behind the throttle, usually used for rudder control.  Left and right were both used to yaw left and right, and up and down were used to throttle up and throttle down, except the paddle is only capable of moving left and right, leaving the plane stuck at max throttle.So, why not just bind the throttle control to the X45 throttle?  First I had to learn how to control the menu, because each action I could perform was not listed as a key on the keyboard, but an obscure button from the X45.  Also, the mouse didn't work.  In order to unbind the throttle control, I had to press button 9 on the X45.  After trial-and-error, I learned that button 9 was apparently pressed when I switched the throttle into mode 3 (M3).  Then I selected to choose a key binding, only to have the game immediately tell me that the key I wanted to use was already in use, and needed to be unbound first.  After even more trial-and-error, I just unbound the entire stick and tried to bind the throttle.  That was when I found the source of the problem.  The X45 has several sliders on it that it uses to toggle modes.  The game was interpreting each of them as a button being held down.  The mode switch in particular was either button 9, button 10, or button 11, depending of if it was in position M3, M2, or M1 respectively.  Digital button presses could still be bound by holding the button down when selecting to set a binding, but all analog controls were overridden by the mode switch.And that is where my biggest problem lies.  Why you would put a game about flying a plane on a computer and let that game be incompatible with what is arguably the most recognizable HOTAS available is rediculous.  Even as a port from consoles I would expect a little more effort than what they gave.  I have literally had an easier time getting my X45 to work with games that no-one in their right mind would try to play with an X45 that this one.  I would have been more than happy to buy a poorly-recieved game a second time from NAMCO just for the experience, but now that I know the experience is gone, I'll just stick with my 360 if I really want to play this game again.

												Easily the weakest entry in the main Ace Combat series- primarily due to its over reliance on its oversimplified, yet cumbersome ""Dog Fight System"" mechanic, which somehow manages to turn ""open"" flying missions as linear and lifeless as the chopper gunner rail sequences that bookmark them.The writing is the same old extraordinarily bland, ""oh here's why we're sending you on worldwide operations"" modern military fare. SPOILER ALERT! The bad guys are Russians. On the bright side, I suppose that's a step above the usual ""middle schooler's DeviantArt fiction"" school of writing employed in the series.The music is still great, at least.			"

												Ignoring its title and separating it from the previous Ace Combat games does little to save it from its own faults. Ace Combat: Assault Horizon takes a step back from the interesting, if not corny world of Strangereal, and plays the Russian/American conflict card. This tired formulaic story is complemented by a downgrade in gameplay. Dogfighting is made simple, and boring, with the introduction of a near-rail-shooter experience that removes the freedom from flight and negates the need for skillful airmanship. It would be acceptable to have a “boss” flight lead require this mechanic, but every flight lead requires that you lock into dogfight mode; even if you land missiles on target, the game ignores the hits and will not progress until you put on your training wheels and go for the ride. The game does include a new diversity of aircraft with the introduction of helicopters and bombers, which if properly executed would nearly save the game, but bomber runs are not particularly fun and the helicopter sections are tedious and awkward. Overall, the game looks great graphically (although the graphical settings are sparse) and gives you a decently realistic flight simulation, but its glaring flaws make it just an okay experience. Personally, I would award 3/5 stars to this game and would recommend picking it up only if it happens to be on sale.			"

												With a Controller in ""Optimal"" control mode, it plays like an awesome arcade flight game. Very intense action, and a quite varried set of quick-time kills and manuvers. Each plane handles differently, and each weapon behaves differently. The multiplayer is non-existent, but the campaign was awesome. I'm going to play it through a few more times on a higher difficulty.With a controller in ""Classic"" control mode, it's a blood-pumping combat sim. I haven't tried a joystick yet, but I imagine it will still play quite well. Some of the dogfights are are still arcady, but I don't think you'd be able to take on some of the enemies without it.

												Ace Combat Assault Horizon - Enhanced Edition is both a fun and entertaining addition to the Ace Combat series.  It is an arcade, nervous, pick and play, flight combat game that I really enjoyed playing.  It is clear that the game makers were trying to mirror the Call of Duty's campaign mode strengths.  In other words, the campaign is explosive, very intense, nervous, and chaotic at moments, as if you are part of a Michael Bay movie.   I personally found it very refreshing and I hope that future sequels will keep this vision.  Finally keep in mind that this is not a hardcore/realistic flight simulator.  Below are my pros and cons :Positives:*  Awesome campaign mode.*  Easy gameplay (with depth at high levels)*  Nervous  (dog)fights.*  Great music and sounds (The japanese voices are outstanding.  The english ones are not so good/bad).*  Pick and play (meaning you don't need to know who is who, or what is what, or what combination of buttons you need to press to make X or Y spell, or when you need to meet Z person at N's location, etc...  Just relax, pick your pad, get in this explosive universe, and enjoy yourself).Negatives:*  The scenario is a very ""japanese"" take on US politics/conflicts.*  Short campaign (but very intense and fun).Thanks to the developers for the enjoyable experience!Verdict: A-			"

												Wow... Just wow... I LOVE ace combat games, have ever since 4. This! this I will not qualify as an ace combat game.THE STORYis horrible. Oh lordy is it bad. The acting is so bulls**ted  together. The actual storyling, ""russian rebels betray america"" is so horribly forced with no implimentation of foreshadowing that it makes me feel ashamed if any person thinks this is ""how americans feel about the world."" You can pick out good guy bad guy from the moment you see people, your teammates make the worst jokes if not the most offensive jokes ever. I actually had to laugh because the attempt at comedy was so bad. THE HELICOPTORS This... addition to the game should have just been handed off to infinity ward where it belongs. With such large maps, the close up on horrible streached out landscape is vomit worthy, The controls are backwards as all hell. THE AIR COMBAT SIMULATIONthey got rid of my scifi planes, and replaced them with stat based air rocks that spit in the face of the joy I recieved in prevous installments. All that twirling around and airial freedom is locked even harder by the dog fight mode. A rather bothersome requirment for some opponents, ripping the controls out of your hands and dragging your laggy♥♥♥♥♥around space like a rag doll while you play ""get the birdy in the circle"" Its just not fun. and it saddens me that I don't have the proper console to play infinity as when I went online searching for some airial compatriots to save me from this hell, I was greeted with emptyness as nobody is on any of the servers at any time in the day. Just go get a different game kids. Don't even waste your money if its 99 cents unless you wanna do a youtube joke vid for a lets play.			"

												""Ace Combat is finally on the PC!!"" Is probably what you're thinking when you see this right? Well unfortunately, this isn't the Ace Combat game anyone wanted on PC. Why is that you ask? Well if you've played any AC game pre-AH, then you already know the answer. If you haven't, then allow me to explain why.#1 DFM (Dogfight Mode)DFM is a feature that's supposedly the game's main selling point, which turns the game into an on rails shooter. It's activated when the L and R bumpers are pressed (playing on a 360 controller) when you're in close proximity of an enemy aircraft (green circle flashing). DFM is completely optional to use, except when combating lead targets. Lead targets requires the use of DFM as they're nearly impossible to shoot down without it; even with the CFA-44's EML cannon (OP weapon, more so in AC6). #2 Deviation from the Strangereal world to the real worldStrangereal is the main setting of all the AC games pre-AH. In layman's terms, it's a world with fictitious nations based on their real world equivalents. A lot of people liked the idea of dogfighting in a place that isn't the same ol' boring real world Earth setting. The same people absolutely hated the change of scenery to a real world setting for this game.#3 The StorylineThe abridged version: NATO task force vs a separatist Russian movement armed with a stockpile of bombs with the yield of a nuclear bomb (only they're not). Lamentable, derivative, and boring as some people would say. Honorable Mentions Any of the UH-60 Blackhawk door gunner escort missions, the AC-130 gunner mission, and the Heli gunship missions.Now despite its shortcomings, this game does have its crowning moments of awesome#1 The VisualsThe game itself is absolutely gorgeous. Everything from the environments to the planes themselves. The only downside is that the graphics options are severely limited to AA, Vsync, and resolution. But the sight of an enemy plane exploding into pieces with copious amounts of oil splashing everywhere never gets old. Oh, and the occasional pilot falling out of the cockpit too.#2 The GameplayDespite being heavily reliant on DFM, the game itself is actually really fun to play. Just remember to change the control scheme from optimal to classic. Because on optimal, you can't roll your plane.#3 The PlanesThere is a wide variety of planes to choose from in Assault Horizon; fighters, multirole craft, and even bombers believe it or not. Each and every plane has their own special paint schemes; some are unlocked at the start, some are unlocked when you finish the game, and all are customizable. Oh, and there are Idolmaster themed jets (returns from AC6) as well because Namco.Final Verdict6/10It's not the best Ace Combat game available, but it's worth playing at least once. So yes, I recommend you try it for yourselves.Addendum: If you plan on buying this for the multiplayer, then DON'T. Multiplayer for the most part is a graveyard.			"

If I could I would get my money back on this game... Trust me when I say this is a waste of money... If you want to play it... Torrent it first before you pay a cent for it and see for your self it sucks...  If you want a flying game with Airplanes and Jets, Check out War Thunder its free and way funnier to play...			"

Takes some getting used to for new mechanics.. whoever said you can't take out targets without zooming in.. you can just not lead targets.. (mini targets can be taken out easily) little unrealistic as to how much armament you can carry but hey it's a fun arcade sim... excellent graphics, sound, and once you get used to the gameplay it is one hell of a ride.. like jumping between Fighters, Bombers, Choppers, AC130 gunships etc.. fans of flight sims will love this one.

												This game reminds me how much I don't like the Recommend\Don't Recommend system of Steam. This is one of the sad cases where I actually enjoyed a game, quiet a lot even, but am still aware that it isn't much good and is actually not a game to recommend to anyone.I'll start by stating that I didn't play any other installment of Ace Combat and therefore I don't look at this game as a fan of the series, but simply gave this specific installment a try. I'm also not too experienced with flight games in general.Horizon Assault is a very arcadic game in almost every sense of the word.The story is, as you'd expect from this type of games, very predictable, generic, unsurprising, and not that vital for the game.For a moment the game may seem like a flight simulator but it's definitely not, It's good at making you feel AS IF you're flying an aircraft, AS IF you're doing big stuff with the scripted explosions everywhere.And that's actually one of the strong points of the game, it's very good with BOOMING stuff, with making you feel that YOU are booming stuff, and it gives you an addicting sense of action and thrill, although with completely unrealistic mechanics at times (e.g. aircraft ""heals"" itself automatically while flying), but who cares, it's a video game.The game's soundtrack also adds a LOT to the game, and as one who really cares about music in video games and is giving it a lot of attention, this game has one of the best tracks in video game soundtracks, in my opinion, with a combination of symphonic music with some electronic\rock touches every once in a while. Splendid, really!Unfortunately there are also reasons for you to stay away from Horizon Assault. Controls aren't most comfortable ever… Binding different keys won't help much. It can get confusing at times and at the beginning of the game I felt like quitting because I simply couldn't get hold of this DAMN helicopter. As soon as I got the hang of it, it started to get fun, though, but fun it really different and is a matter of perspective. And many people won't find this game fun at all.The gameplay can get extremely repetitive and frustrating. The developers tried to keep it varied and in a way they succeeded in it, but it's still starting to feel generic and monotonous at times. Another thing which many people would hate is the Dog-Fight System, which is presented as an optional way to hunt your enemies but is actually your only way of getting through this game. And it can be horribly frustrating as well.So, are you going to enjoy this game? That's really a matter of one's taste and expectations.I enjoyed it, mostly, and if you can enjoy some intense action sequences with things getting blown away with dramatic music in the background and some clichéd ""saving America"" story, it's possible you'd enjoy this as well.It's possible you'd hate it, if that's not your kind …Another note, out of the three times I've tried playing this game in multiplayer mode, I've managed to find other players to play with only once. So, my guess is that the multiplayer scene of Horizon Assault isn't very active. There's also no way to play over LAN, so, I could be wrong but I believe Horizon Assault pretty much leaves you with solely the single player missions. You should keep that in mind.			"

												I went into this game expecting another great installment like Shattered Skies or The Unsung War, set in the universes they were in, with a great story and similiar flight mechanics. What I got was a game that felt like it had been ""CODified"" so to speak. The campaign in Ace Combat games has always had an anmazing story with great characters. This just felt like call of duty but with planes instead, using re-hashed cliches and ideas of having the russians be the bad guys and installing parts like the helicopter gunner which does not belong in this game. I hated it the more I played, very little that i did. The whole system of the close-range assualt system was just complete garbage. It adds no value to the game, just more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t they pile on to give it a ""cinematic"" feel. The ""dramatic realistic storyline"" was another insult as well. Something that has been done time and again, its just a lazy♥♥♥♥♥♥story they cobbled together to try and have some sort of setting made with no effort for the game. All the intense moments in Shattered Skies and Unsung War were amazing, like when Nagase was in danger as her plane was going down, but then she ends up rescuing fellow soldiers and taking some enemies hostage right after ejecting like a hardass; or you are protecting a rocket that needs to deliver a ♥♥♥♥ing laser to a low orbit plane to give you an edge in the war, or when you have to shoot down that same plane when the enemy takes it. All of the banter between the pilots and command was really funny, dramatic, and had actual emotion to it. Unique, colorful, and masterpieces of missions and storytelling. This entire game is a stain and shameful mark upon the legacy and awe left by those earlier games, not fit to share the title of Ace Combat. If I could I would wipe this game from my library just so I dont have to look at such a pile of excrement. Do not buy this game if you have played the previous masterpieces. If your a COD fanboy who likes campaigns that only take a few hours to complete, and the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t story cliches time and time again, this is right up your alley.			"

												AC:AH handles like the usual Ace Combat formula with the bombast and overzealous scripting of the latest Call of Duty games thrown in. Numerous times the game uses it's on-rails Dogfight Mode (DFM) or it's even more restrictive cousin Airstrike Mode to force the player to fly under -that- collapsing smokestack or -that- inexplicable jumbo jet, completely irrespective of the direction or location in which it was initiated. Allies/enemies vanish and materialise as the mission scripting decrees, or are completely invulnrable until they become a later mission objective. The DFM is also lacking in options for the player; you can just hold MG and accelerate and watch the pretty colours.The (apparently) mandatory AC-130 level, the door gunner sections and the helicopter gunship bits, I'm afraid I can't speak fairly on them. Generally I slogged through them until I got my jet back, and certainly wasn't taking notes, other than to say the ground /building textures weren't designed for hovering that close to them.The story is, well, the typical ""US saves the world from someone who wants specifically to attack the US"" fare we've seen everywhere since CoD 4. The comms chatter and recurring callsigns that has always made allies seem interesting is still there, but sparser and sandwiched in between asking for help and spontaneous bravado. The sense of edging along with a ground war is missing from the AC formula too - your team can hop between continent as if on an extended holiday, and the sense of bring under threat suffers. I didn't feel much attachment to the callsign either; Warwolf's leader is no Mobius One. As good as the real-world setting is, I feel Strangereal is a better setting for these games.I'm giving it a negative rating, but that's not to say a bad game. The combat is wonderfully involving in its freeform state, with an excellently majestic soundtrack (Kieki Kobayashi et al doing what they do best), a great selection of planes and enough variation in weapon loadouts / handling / mission objectives to keep it fresh. There's some character to all four members of your flight, as well as the allied squadrons and land-dwelling elements, and even the traditional objective-dispensing AWACS operator has some colour to him.In summary, what's good is most of the parts I liked from AC's 4 and 6 (you can even get the Estovakian fictional superplane from AC6, in original Strigon Squadron colours), and the parts i disliked were clearly taken wholesale from CoD and grafted around the Ace Combat experience. People looking to get the thrill arcade digfighters give would do well to look at JASF (interesting story idea there) or look to play Fires of Liberation.			"

If you've always wanted a Battlefield mode where everyone just flies a jet, then this is the game for you! It's a fun arcade fighter jet game where you just fly around giving the middle finger to the laws of physics (in an entertaining way). And with no infantry using Stinger missiles to shoot you down :P (even if there are, you have flares from the start). Buy this game on sale. Also, it has completely stripped out GFWL (good job Namco), which was the #1 thing holding me off a purchase at first.			"

												Pros:+DFM Mode+PC+Graphics+Multiplayer+Changeable Control (Original and Optimum)Cons:-DFM Mode-Poorly written Story-Scripted Enemy Ace? Get the hell out of my game-High Ping with a lot player = connection problem-Joystick support is partial, which is still a trouble.NO, NO, THIS IS NOT A FLIGHT SIMULATOR, SO DO NOT COMPLAIN ON HOW THERE'S DFM-ARCADE THINGYIT WASN'T EVEN A FLIGHT SIM AT THE FIRST TIME WITH 70 ♥♥♥♥IN MISSILES.Played Earlier Versions of Ace Combat (PS2), And yes this was nothing like what you played in Childhood, No Ace Drama (Which was used to be Ace Combat's expertise), but I still managed to enjoy it, DFM Mode may bring in the Garbage and Adrenaline at the same time.I suggest go for multiplayer, as this game tend to focus on MP rather than SP with Poorly written Stories, but be sure to give it a try. MP features are Skill Sets, where you can equip some Skills such as Enchanced Machine-gun, Enchanced Missile, Quick Turn, and much more, there's even a Call-sign settings which has a lot of reference (PS2 Ace Combat Players will like this), If you cleared a certain thing in the game, you can unlock call-signs such as Mobius, Wardog, Galm, even Garuda, and many more to be use in Multiplayer.tl;dr Flight Arcade, not Flight Simulator.Recommended 7.5/10			"

												Ace Combat with PC frames is RIDICULOUSLY GOOD.Since you can turn the dial up to pretty damn high levels on the framerate side, there's pretty smooth flying, Fox.Would still recommend playing with a gamepad, though it's easy enough played with keyboard and mouse. Planes are strictly keyboard based, helichoppers are mouse and keyboard combo, side gunner is strictly mouse and can be likened to a point and click adventure.IT SHOULD REALLY BE SAID however that Assault Horizon is not Ace Combat as those familiar with the series would remember it as. While the helicopters are neat (albeit limited) and planes are still the focus, it's a story mode with talking protags and a very arcadey DFM (DogFight Mode) system. Incredibly cinematic, and I enjoy it personally, but it's not the good ol' method of taking out the baddies.Still, if you've tried AC:AH already, the PC version is the one taking it to eleven.			"

												Good storyline to this game, a bit too arcadey for my liking but if you can look passed the unrealistic flight physics and the unordinate amount of missiles you can carry it can be very fun. I love the dogfight mode which feels really epic especially when dipping in between buildings and landmarks (albeit very ridiculous flight physics). A game like this, I prefer to put myself in cockpit view to get fully immersed into the role. Unfortunately this games cockpit mode doesnt feel quite immersive, it seems like ""the wrong way to play"" and as such I spent most of my time playing in Third person which to it's credit, looks amazing. The graphics on the explosions in my opinion are stunning. It's a great flight combat game, but not a simulator. For me, a better flight combat experience would put all characters in realistic serious handicapped state i.e. I'd rather fight 6 Ace Pilots with limited missiles and bullets than 60 idiot pilots armed with a million missiles. Overall however this game is great, a great step into the kind of flight game I like & want to see more of. Using cutscenes based on the ground and air to great effect to build up the empathy for the characters is a great touch (no longer is my wingman a faceless friend, now you get to see him interacting with my character on the ground.)Great game. If only it was less arcadey it'd be even better.			"

In every other title that I have played, you have the ability for barrel rolls, and other high-speed maneuvers that this title lacks.  That said, I really appreciate the high quality graphics, the way that aircraft fragment as they are being hit, etc.  Ace Combat continues to live up to their players' expectations, and are keeping me as an avid player.

												When I bought this I was expecting an arcade game with no realisitic qualities, but it really does take the unrealistic to another level. Enemies break the laws of physics with regards to being able to constantly turn on a dime and seemingly having the ability to get a lock on you without even being pointed in your direction. The game forces you to use the horrible 'dog fight mode' in order to shoot down enemies because without it, missiles just barely ever hit anything. I think  if they removed the dog fight mode and tweaked the manual dogfighting it would be a much more enjoyable experience. Also they need to tone down the whole super evil Russian bad guy with god like flying abilities thing -_- They really ruined it by pushing a whole bunch of cheesy gimicks and cliches.			"

												It's a little bit hard reccomending this game, since the game has many good and bad points. The game is not a flight simulator, and tends to be an arcade flight game, where most of the time all you need to do is press space bar while you crosshair is red. With beautiful graphics, some skippable CGs and an nice soundtrack during fights, it can be a very fun game.My first sensation while playing the game was that it was a lot flashy, and designed to be something easy for your free time, and it can be enjoyable, but with times get a little boring and repetitive. When you are too close from the ground, too close to the map end or in DFM (Dogfight Mode), almost all of the controls are taken from you to make the game easier to new players. But sometimes, it gets too easy, and during chopper flights you almost only have to hold the two mouse buttons and A/D to kill everything.If you are looking for a game where the first challenge starts in getting familiar with the controls to have complete control over the aircraft, this game is far from it. This game has a feel of being targeted to more casual players, not exactly excluding hadcore gamers, but the major part of the game is made to be fun, not challenging. "

												Awful, awful game. Not just is it unlike any of the previous Ace Combat games, the gameplay mechanics are annoying and tedious. Some enemies can only be killed in the cinematic DFM or Dogfight Mode, maneuvers rely on use of quick time events, and the autosaving isn't very reliable. The cinematics and models look nice, the soundtrack is fitting and there is a large smattering of aircraft, but don't pick up this game. Even for $5, it's not very good.P.S. As far as the game instructed me, there is no roll control, you just have to use the arrow keys and trust the autopilot to guide you in the right way.			"

												I have played a few of the previous Ace Combat games. This one is easily my favourite.I can see why others dislike it, gone is the crazy fantastical storylines, as a Metal Gear fan I can understand the disapointment. It does limit the game in terms of scope (no more giant flying fortresses) and can fly a bit close to modern warfare shooters in terms of story. However it's not a bad story and does give you reasons for the missions you are flying.The dogfight system is a nice addition. When you are close to an enemy you get into this mode. This recreates the kind of cool dogfights of Top Gun. It is a little on rails but with enough control that it is great fun. You get to see the enemy close up. If you aren't into it, you don't have to use it for many enemies.The variety of mission types are a great upgrade. You get to fly bombers and helicopters, they all have their own playstyle and it breaks up the plane combat.I come back to this game from time to time as it is so much fun and there isn't really an equivalent.Even at full current price of £9.99 I think it's worth it.

												I've never played the older AC games (I don't have a gaming console), and granted I got this game while it was on sale (I had my eyes on this game for a while, and was waiting for a sale), but I'll say this: Sometimes companies decide to take a different approach to their franchises for a lot of different reasons, and it's either you'll love them or hate them for doing it. From the reviews of the game by fans of the old AC games I've read, many are absolutely appalled by it. I don't think they're wrong - they're seeing a franchise they've been with for a very long time change into something they're not used to. (I had the same feeling when the Total War franchise decided to go into Warhammer, for example, and I felt the same disappointment, too.)But that's not to say those fans are right either. Project Aces was obviously trying to test out something new, and I think it's quite brave of them to have given it a try (after recovering from the initial disappointment, I feel the same of the Total War franchise now).Now, for those that are still deciding whether to buy the game or not, here's the best way I can put it:(1) DFM takes quite a bit of getting used to, but it'll feel rewarding when you tail another fighter and gun them down.(2) It's nothing like the old AC games (from what I can judge from the Let's Plays I've seen people play), but it's an interesting spin on the genre.(3) If you don't like the campaign, see the story as a massive tutorial that teaches you what you'll need to know to be effective in multiplayer.(4) Judging from the mechanics, the game was originally designed with multiplayer as more a core feature than single player.In the end, a game's a game - some of them we love, others not so much. The franchise titles represent something significant for some people, but not so much for others. I understand those grieving for what AC's become, but I'm personally happy that there's an AC game on PC, and agree with those that enjoy the game for what it is.			"

												-WARNING UNPLAYABLE WITHOUT CONTROLLER-Pros:Great soundtrackPretty if you speed past all the texturesCons:Almost zero video settings, direct port from console. Either it runs or it doesn't.Don't expect to be able to play without a controllerAll in all, this game is another terrible PC port. This game is no different from the console version, you need a controller and you must meet the minimum specs: no tweaking. The game itself is okay, it doesn't suffer from the long periods of inaction like the other Ace Combat games. It's more of a juiced-up version with less features. "

												Easily the weakest entry in the main Ace Combat series- primarily due to its over reliance on its oversimplified, yet cumbersome ""Dog Fight System"" mechanic, which somehow manages to turn ""open"" flying missions as linear and lifeless as the chopper gunner rail sequences that bookmark them.The writing is the same old extraordinarily bland, ""oh here's why we're sending you on worldwide operations"" modern military fare. SPOILER ALERT! The bad guys are Russians. On the bright side, I suppose that's a step above the usual ""middle schooler's DeviantArt fiction"" school of writing employed in the series.The music is still great, at least.			"

												Ace Combat Assault Horizon... where to begin.If youre interested in buying this game because you've played past Ace Combat games, please take the time to read this review.You will not find the Ace Combat experience you've come to know and love from this game. This is not Ace Combat; Its little more than an arcade shooter masquerading as a successor to Ace Combat 6, simple as that. If you've played the past games and have loved the sim style, then avoid this game, as its now focused more to an arcade style. That coupled with a lackluster story have me dissapointed in Assault Horizon. If you're new to the Ace Combat franchise and are looking for cheep and easy arcade sim, this game might be for you; but buyer beware, it might not be worth it even then.			"

												Let me state I've already played and completed this game when it initially came out on the xbox 360. I've always been an ace combat fan so I'll admit to some bias in that regard, along with a love of military aircraft in general. That said, this itiration of the Ace Combat series, while fun, full of adrenaline, and still top notch in visual quality as you'd expect, I still felt the new Dog Fighting mechanic took away from some of the imersion. In previous titles, dog fighting was as you'd imagine, difficult. Trying to follow your target while staying in range for your main gun and leading the target so you actually hit. While at the same time making sure you did not crash into anything. This, obviously takes some skill and practice, which I felt was a good challenge to the game.Assault Horizon however takes the burden of piloting and has you focus more on the target. Now it's a matter of making sure your crosshair is on target for your main gun or missles (whichever you prefer) and the plane is essentially on auto pilot after the target. You can change your pitch and angle, sure, but you are certainly only following the target aircraft.This was more a design decision to add cinematic fluff than anything else. That hollywood sequence of flying just underneath a crane while at Mach 2 is undeniably impressive and enjoyable for most. But after repeated intervals, it begins to feel cheapened. This is certainly a good game for those new to the flight combat sim, or new to Ace Combat in general to get a feel for series. While I wish they kept the old dog fighting mechanics in this, it does allow for a lot of 'wow' moments when you do pull them off.			"

												Don't buy this game. I know this is a recommendation, and I am recommending you to not buy this worthless pile. Previous Ace Combat games are far superior; the storyline is worthless and in-game voice acting is full of nonsensical military jargon, the graphics are outdated, the actual combat is entirely unrealistic and reduced to hand-holding quick time events (if you refuse, enemy planes ford off your missiles with unlimited flares). In short, don't buy this game; go buy HAWX or a previous Ace Combat game. They're more worth your time.			"

												If you are a fan of the Ace Combat games like AC04, don't buy this one. Special weapons have been nerfed, your ability to be a pilot is a lot less necessary. Almost to the point where if you can keep your plane from crashing into the ground, you can do whatever you want in this one. This makes your flying skill almost irrelevant. DFM is a joke, essentially is an autopilot that follows enemy planes in an on-the-rails path. As long as you keep your plane pointing vaguely in the same direction as your target, you won't lose it. On top of that, there are a few enemies that are invincible unless you enter DFM with them.In previous titles, if you got hit by AA weaponry whether it was flak, guns, SAMs, or air to air missiles, you kept the damage you recieved unless you returned to base for repairs. Not this one. So long as you don't take damage for about 10 seconds, any damage that has been done to your plane will be repaired immediately. Another aspect that removes piloting skill from the game.If you want an aerial combat game that feels like you are a fighter pilot, don't get Ace Combat: Assault Horizon. Dust off your old Playstation 2, and play Ace Combat 04: Shattered Skies.			"

												Great game, awesome with friends. Easily fixable glitches.The campaign has a nice story so far. The combat is a mixture of a flight sim and a rail shooter. You get in close using standard flying, and then press a lock-on button to move into a rail shooter. This makes the combat easy to approach as well as fast paced without just constantly spinning in circles.Paint jobs on your craft are customizeable, though you can't use them in the campaign.Co-op missions are unlocked by playing through the campaign, and are really fun with friends.Multiple voice-over options, including Japanese.My friends are using xbox controllers, and have no complaints.I'm using dual flight stick. **Glitch Fix: ( http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Ace_Combat:_Assault_Horizon_-_Enhanced_Edition#Control_and_graphics_settings_reset_between_sessions )I don't recommend keyboard, it's super awkward.P.S.I hope you like long missions, cause the enemies just don't stop coming.

												It is a different type of Ace Combat and most certainly a different type of flight sim (more of a flight game). That being said, it is still a good and fun game at its core. This is not the best Ace Combat by any means, but it is still Ace Combat. If you're a fan of the series and are debating purchasing Assault Horizon I can say that you'll be somewhat disappointed but satisfied. If you like flight-related games and want to purchase Assault Horizon I can tell you that you will enjoy the game. In the end, I'll always love Ace Combat and I had an enjoyable time with Assault Horizon.			"

												A lot of people like to say this is Call of Duty in the air. Well jokes on them, because now Call of Duty has made Assault Horizon in space.In all seriousness, not as good as the old Ace Combat games, but still not a bad game. A few notes to make the game more difficult, turn the control setting to original, it gives you more control over your plane, and if you don't like DFM, aside from a few boss type enemies it isn't ever manditory to shoot down a plane.

												Before you dive into the Steam reviews, please consider looking at IGN's review of it; it's short, to-the-point, and is UNBIASED.A lot of the hate comes from changes from previous games. Helicopters, a ""Dog fight mode"" (close range dog fight) and a different setting are all changes I can think of off the top of my head. To die-hards of old Ace Combat, these changes are probably going to drive you nuts (*cough cough* steam reviews *cough cough*) but if you have an open mind, understand that the developers are HUMAN BEINGS and not some perfect-game-making-robots, you'll enjoy yourself.I found the game really fun, beautiful, and rather thrilling in some parts. The dog fight mode (called DFM in the game) was really an adrenaline rush at parts. Particularly near the end, when things ramp up. The helicopter missions were very fun for me (though the gun controls were a small bit clunky). The story, while kind of cliche, is still worth paying attention to in my opinion. The graphics are beautiful (you can tell the developers put some work into properly porting it to PC :D )Some of the missions do seem to drag on, and I feel like the developers put more focus on their new mechanics (e.g., DFM) than they should have, but hey, why hold that against them? It's pretty hard to guess the perfect way to implement a brand new mechanic on the first try.It took me about 8 hours to beat the campaign on an easier difficulty.All-around a good game. :)TL;DRWorth the $20 if you plan on playing multiplayer (not sure if anyone plays it, I haven't looked), maybe closer to $15 or $10 if you plan on only playing campaign. Take the Steam reviews for this game with a grain of salt; a lot of them just really don't like the changes.P.S.Sorry if some of the review doesn't make sense; I'm writing this really late at night XD			"

												**Disclaimers**I have played this game in full on the Xbox 360 I have also played Ace Combats 4, 5, Zero, 6, and X (the PSP one) Now, the review.As a game, Ace Combat:Assault Horizon gets my reccomendation. As an Ace Combat game, It does not. Thats the short of it.  I'm reccomending this game, but in a way also not reccomending it. At a sale price of $5, a newcomer could very well get his or her monies worth out of the title. But a veteran of the series will likely be dissappointed with it. I really wish Steam had a third reccomendation option of ""Maybe"", because this game would fit right into that. As an arcade flight simulator, this game is good. It beats the hell out of HAWX, that much I'll support. If you're just looking for a quick action/war game, then this might be right up your alley. But if you're fan of the other games in the series, this game is a complete letdown. The staples of the other games, from the anti-war themes, epic boss battles with fictional super weapons and the fictional world of Strangereal are all put to the side. In its place are helicoper segments, both on and off rails, bomber missions, the typical ""Russians are the bad guys"" story with somewhat strong 'murica themes, and the new ""Dogfight Mode"" (DFM), which dumbs down fights to this hybrid on rails mini-game. None of these things are bad for other games, but for Ace Combat it is a real let down.  "

												I want whatever the Enemy is flying in this game, - 15 air to air missile hits, multiple cannon hits, enough bits falling off them to fill a skip and their planes are still dancing around the sky like nothings happened.I`m read in another review that the aircraft have whats called ""regenerating health"" and magically mend themselves in flight...Pfffffffft.I also disliked the constant screen freezes and prompting on first use, I`d imagine that stops after you`ve used all the key bindings a couple of times but it bugged the hell out of me.Don`t buy if you expect this to be realistic, also don`t buy unless you don`t mind repeatedly shouting at your PC screen and yelling ""What The ***k is this ***t???   !!!!! seriously???"".Do buy if you like arcade games, the graphics ARE ok and I didn`t experience any bugs or installation issues, - what the game does, it does do well enough. I`m on the fence about recommending this really because as a long time flight simmer, I prefer more depth and realism in a flying game, so although this didn`t float my boat it may well appeal to others,  it`s on sale at the moment at £2.49 and it`s worth that so I`ll lean towards a thumbs up.

												I don't often right reviews on games but this one warrants it. I played this game expecting a similar experience to other Ace Combat games I know and love. However, I was dissapointed in the fact that there is basically a ""press here to win"" function, which turns a dog-fighting simulation into a railshooting experience, where you follow the enemy plane automatically with little control over the plane, basically only there to fire the guns. Then comes rail-shotter part 2, where you're in a helicopter. The entire time this was happening I kept getting warnings about RPGS even though they seemed to pose no real danger to the chopper what so ever, as they would fly in, and miraculously dissapear. I quit after the second level because my controls would not stay bound, and kept doing things such as inverting left-right for ""turret control.""This game looked promising, as I said. like a proper Ace Combat, but with the added bonus of helicopters, and some fun new game mechanics. It turned out to be a disappointing, and barely functional Shoot'em up instead of a true air combat game.			"

												I haven't played most of the Ace Combat series but from what I can tell, it was a solid, albeit on rails, jet fighting game. You'd go from waypoint to waypoint picking your targets and fighting other jets in semi-realitic battles.Assault Horizon threw out all the good parts of the old games, the dogfighting and story lines (somewhat), so that they could make the game even less playable. Dogfighting, the entire reason most people buy jet fighter games, is now done through ASM/DSM modes where you have very little control over your plane (and the laws of physics cease to exist while your fighter does 10g turns through city buildings). The story was probably writen by the CEO's eight year old nephew after watching the original Red Dawn or The Hunt for the Red October.The jet fighter parts of this game are just plain bad and feels like something that crawled out of 1996. The helicopter portions of the campaign are somehow worse thanks to the terrible control scheme in place. The bombing run was literally just moving your stick left to right and pressing B. The door gunner (yes, you have to be a door gunner for two or three missions) is, again, just moving the stick back and forth and holding the trigger.I'm glad I bought this on sale because I would be seriously angry if I paid full price for this.

												I will share the same remarks as most people here.I used to play Ace Combat 3 hundreds of hours a long time ago.MissionsAC3 had various types of missions, like refuelling, night, escort missions, etc.Also there were special missions where you could go into space to blow satelites up, and then you had to make a renetry in the atmosphere a special way to not screw your UberSpaceShuttlePlane up.The missions in Assault Horizon lack diversity and they are dull.Except that sometimes there are side scrolling shooting missions, and I still wonder why.When I play AC, I want to FLY, not shoot shït up!GameplayIn AC3  there were crazy åss sci-fy planes that would fire plasma thingy, or would be extremely fast.There were secrets and hidden missions. And the Japanese version even had a story rich anime included in the game.But, comparing AC: Assault Horizon to AC3 is like comparing the original Rainbow Six to the New Vegas ones, or worst, CoD.AC3 was extremely rich in content.OversimplificationThe flying scheme is oversimplified, and I was wondering why I couldn't  stall much at first. My plane was levelling itself without me doing anything.Turns out there is somewhere in the controls, an 'optimum' option or whatnot.Switch that shït to 'original' and you got a popup telling you that you should better finish the game and be über pro first, warning, warning... wait wat?!Such warnings so I could just control my plane the way I want!? Like using the pedals and rolling at the same time without auto-leveling!? o.O;This very option pretty much sums up AC: Assault Horizon: it's an arcade 'flying' game for total n00bs.New dogfight featureSome tangos (with a 'leader' tag) are tough to splash if you don't lock on them and activate some kinda 'pursuit mode' where you do not control your plane no more and just shoot: your plane will follow the tango by itself.Of course the enemy will then have a scripted path so that you can take it down near pretty buildings and stuff.It's cool but... it's all fake.They really like rail shooter games, too bad I want to play a FLYING game.However, I gotta say, there are good idea beyond this new feature.Tango planes can also initiate a dog-fight with you, and then it's up to you to loose them, or do some crazy tricks, like slowing down so that you end up behind then and engage a counter-dogfight.Cool, but it'd rather do this MYSELF, without the need to 'activate' this feature.Hollywood styleBig budget game with big explosions and particles everywhere, and bling...We got many cutscenes, a story and a plot, voice acting, etc.But it's all... bad. The actors lines are cliche as fûck. When flying I seriously can't concentrate because the friendlies are chatting like an asian pack of women all the time. Of course it's not even funny ""you will owe me a beer, you'll see"" which in turn you, the leader, being all cool and serious and stuff reply ""Tone it down guise. We got a mission.""...COME ON!This is just lame, just stop it, just, just ... stop...Realism?I mean, the Ace Combat franchise is not a simulation, and is definitely an arcade style game. But still...I can crash my plane on the ground, and it will BOUNCE BACK (!) with a Critical Damage warning. WTF.Looks like we regain health / repair ourselves over time too... omg.I'm not asking for a simulation like X-Plane, but damn man. AC3 was crazy, and had a futuristic environment and planes and stuff, but there was no MAGIC!So AC: AH wants to be all realistic and stuff, and have a uh.. 'serious' story, but my planes bounce on da ground? And I regain health? I see there a contradiction your honor.MusicAC3 had seriously awesome tracks. I even tried to rip then when I was a kid, ending up with 22khz mp3 that sounded like crap.Do I need to say that AC: AH has got nothing? There is no emotions in the tracks.They are typical american hollywood war movies.ConclusionIf you are new to the genre, and flying games, then by all means, do buy the game and have fun.But if you are looking for an Ace Combat game, just don't do it!This game doesn't have the soul of our beloved AC3, that had such an awesome gameplay and musics.It's like playing CoD when you want a tactical shooter. It's just not working.			"

												Having never really played a game like this my review isn't likely one to hone in on for an expert perspective. However, I do enjoy the game in that it is an interesting story and it allows me to sit in a cockpit and see things I normally wouldn't in other games. My only complaint with the game is the fact I have to do all of the work. For the team-based assault of your sorties, you'd think they would help you get some Ace's, but no, if you fail, they fail. If they fail, you are left flying solo. Aside from this I have enjoyed the game. I am not an expert on how good or bad the gameplay is, but I enjoy it. And for the price, I can't complain. If you are a hardcore aerial assault buff, look for more details in other reviews, otherwise if you have the time and are looking for a fresh take on a different game engine, I'd recommend this. I served in the Air Force for 15 years and served with many pilots; this gives me some nostalgia when I think of some of their stories and can put a picture to their words. Good stuff [for me] for the price. Other than the lack of team support while battling in the sky... I enjoy this title and recommend it.			"

												While being very different in terms of story and setting compared to older Ace Combats, it still has that original feeling that all the past ones had. This one feels less ""anime"" and more americanized. The story feels a bit simplified but It still is awesome game. Even if the dogfight mode isn't really the best, you're only forced to use it on some (scripted) planes, which is good.  The AC130 mision was a great addition as well as the heli missions (gunner or pilot). The game remains very arcade. The soundtrack is great. I loved it back when it came out on 360, and I just bought it again for nostalgia.I wish there were more Ace Combat games on PC.			"

DO NOT buy if you thought it was like any other Ace Combat brilliance, this game is JUNK.

												Great game, awesome with friends. Easily fixable glitches.The campaign has a nice story so far. The combat is a mixture of a flight sim and a rail shooter. You get in close using standard flying, and then press a lock-on button to move into a rail shooter. This makes the combat easy to approach as well as fast paced without just constantly spinning in circles.Paint jobs on your craft are customizeable, though you can't use them in the campaign.Co-op missions are unlocked by playing through the campaign, and are really fun with friends.Multiple voice-over options, including Japanese.My friends are using xbox controllers, and have no complaints.I'm using dual flight stick. **Glitch Fix: ( http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Ace_Combat:_Assault_Horizon_-_Enhanced_Edition#Control_and_graphics_settings_reset_between_sessions )I don't recommend keyboard, it's super awkward.P.S.I hope you like long missions, cause the enemies just don't stop coming.

												Although this game is a great arcade flight shooter, it is too prone to freezing, has a terrible checkpoint system, an annoying tutorial system, and goofy default controls for optional flight stick (and any changes you make to your flight stick's controls just get reset upon quitting the application. A really fun game ruined by poor support from the developers. Disappointing...			"

												This isn't Ace Combat 5, but I've had a lot of fun anyway.The main problem with the game is that it has a huge over-reliance on the DFM thing, where you go into a focused camera mode and tail an enemy fighter. You can play without it, but it's much harder. This means that Assault Horizon is specced for a spectacle, cinematic dogfights and set-pieces. And boy does it deliver. ""Normal"" gameplay suffers from it, so if you're a hardcore Ace Combat/flight sim fan, feel free to avoid this game. If you're not very picky, though, and can enjoy a Hollywood-like romp, give it a shot.			"

												I have played a few of the previous Ace Combat games. This one is easily my favourite.I can see why others dislike it, gone is the crazy fantastical storylines, as a Metal Gear fan I can understand the disapointment. It does limit the game in terms of scope (no more giant flying fortresses) and can fly a bit close to modern warfare shooters in terms of story. However it's not a bad story and does give you reasons for the missions you are flying.The dogfight system is a nice addition. When you are close to an enemy you get into this mode. This recreates the kind of cool dogfights of Top Gun. It is a little on rails but with enough control that it is great fun. You get to see the enemy close up. If you aren't into it, you don't have to use it for many enemies.The variety of mission types are a great upgrade. You get to fly bombers and helicopters, they all have their own playstyle and it breaks up the plane combat.I come back to this game from time to time as it is so much fun and there isn't really an equivalent.Even at full current price of £9.99 I think it's worth it.

												First up I'll admit having not played an Ace Combat title since the PS1 days but I had a blast with this.It gave me strong Modern Warfare flavours with a subtle undertone of Metal Gear Solid.If you like pretty planes, acade style combat and a storyline you can get through in an afternoon while keeping an eye on your kids then it well worth a look.If you want a realistic flight sim or a weaboo in a candy pink super jet then you'd be better off looking elsewhere.

												I've never played the older AC games (I don't have a gaming console), and granted I got this game while it was on sale (I had my eyes on this game for a while, and was waiting for a sale), but I'll say this: Sometimes companies decide to take a different approach to their franchises for a lot of different reasons, and it's either you'll love them or hate them for doing it. From the reviews of the game by fans of the old AC games I've read, many are absolutely appalled by it. I don't think they're wrong - they're seeing a franchise they've been with for a very long time change into something they're not used to. (I had the same feeling when the Total War franchise decided to go into Warhammer, for example, and I felt the same disappointment, too.)But that's not to say those fans are right either. Project Aces was obviously trying to test out something new, and I think it's quite brave of them to have given it a try (after recovering from the initial disappointment, I feel the same of the Total War franchise now).Now, for those that are still deciding whether to buy the game or not, here's the best way I can put it:(1) DFM takes quite a bit of getting used to, but it'll feel rewarding when you tail another fighter and gun them down.(2) It's nothing like the old AC games (from what I can judge from the Let's Plays I've seen people play), but it's an interesting spin on the genre.(3) If you don't like the campaign, see the story as a massive tutorial that teaches you what you'll need to know to be effective in multiplayer.(4) Judging from the mechanics, the game was originally designed with multiplayer as more a core feature than single player.In the end, a game's a game - some of them we love, others not so much. The franchise titles represent something significant for some people, but not so much for others. I understand those grieving for what AC's become, but I'm personally happy that there's an AC game on PC, and agree with those that enjoy the game for what it is.			"

												The user reviews for this game are mixed when honestly they should be all negative. This game features zero realism, a railway shooter concept and it restricts the players to a tunnel of gameplay instead of allowing the player to experience the game's world. The most fun I had with this game was the chopper gunner mission, but even that felt ununique and unrealistic. This game is an insult the the Ace Combat series. Do now purchase no matter how much steam puts this game on sale, the data on your computer this game would take up is worth more than the game itself.			"

												I'm a long time Ace Combat fan, and while this game isn't as amazing as the previous games (like Ace Combat 6, or 2.) the game has its charm, and at its core it is still an Ace Combat game. For the most part, you can play without ever initiating DSM mode yourself. Though, enemies can do it to you, it isn't actually that bad, and you can even escape it just by stalling or speeding away. The DSM mode isn't terrible, and while it is a bit goofy, it's fun. The damage is interesting, especially when you see a pilot fall out of his plane because the cockpit seperates. The story, is not that interesting. But it's not terrible, again, nothing about this game is actually bad. It's just not what people expected from an Ace Combat game.You need to do the controls fix, this is a must. Playing with your mouse is incredible. The feature is broken upon install because of the Windows Live remover patch.			"

												It's an okay game. A bad Ace Combat game. Performance wise it runs fine, graphics are all right though use a down right horrible motion blur/heat haze system and audio is, well to think of it I never noticed it. So that's good and bad. I recall no standout moments audio wise nor any glarring WTF sound effects. The game is mediocre in every sense of the word. I feel like none of my allies ever kill a single enemy. Literally a dozen friendlies and I'll have to take out every single one of the 20 plus enemies. It takes literally 30-45 minutes sometimes to beat a mission of simple enemy waves. I'm also not too fond of the new ""zoom in up close to semi-scripted sequences"" which you can trigger when within like 1000 meters of the enemy. It's lame and almost the only reliable way to take out enemies otherwise. Especially when those sequences  appear to be the only time the enemy hits ground targets outside of scripted triggers. Otherwise it's a solid, decent arcady aerial combat game. Oh, and the Apache helicopter controls just plain, flat out suck. Having to aim wiht your mouse, yet push mouse all the way to the edge of the screen and hold to rotate the chopper. It's ludicrous. There are quite a number of better dogfighting games. A lot if you drift to realistic, simulator side of it. Hell, there are better Ace Combat games. They're older and only on PS2 (one was on 360 I think, it was better than average) but they're still better.			"

												Yet another console port to completely waste your money on. I've spent about 10 minutes in-game and over an hour trying to find a solution to it just crashing as soon as you gain control in the first mission. Tried disabling the steam overlay, running in a window, verifying cache, reinstalling, and any other fix that I could find out there. This is far from the first time I've been completely ripped off, I've got at least 4 or 5 games I really want to play in my steam inventory that are crippled by excessive DRM or constant crashes... So no thanks, I'll just replay one of the great Ace Combat games for PS2.			"
