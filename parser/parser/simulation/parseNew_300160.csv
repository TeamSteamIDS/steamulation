												This game is unexplanably HORRIFYING and TERRIBLE beyond words there are black and white strobe lights always when I open the game (and when I live in a house with someone that has epilepsy this is NOT OK) the default language is Dutch so you have to go therough a DAMN maze to find englisg because NONE of the options to select say anything and its MAJORLY PRONE to crashes every 30 seconds and then it tells you you do not have this game so you have to restart steam every tim you wanna play. I have nothing to say about the gameplay cause I was never able to get past the main menus since there wernt any labels. SO YEP THATS MY REVIEW in my opinion these devs just need to stop if this is what they created. I AM DEFINITLY GETTING A REFUND, For SO if there was an option to rate this game ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t roadkill on the side of the road with autism and respitory issues, i would			"

												Tempremental on loading up at all if high graphics settings are used. I finally settled on a medium quality setting which I think may have been 2090 x 1024 and the game loads. Previous review said very frustrated with game due to budget indicator not appearing to work at times and a no-brainer at the start of the Medium Levels. Here I now am entering the Advanced Levels saying ... For goodness sake DON'T GIVE UP like I nearly did!!! I would actually now recommend this but it's essential to take your time and observe those failures closely. The clue to what type of bridge is best built ... Is in the lie of the land around you.Playing this game with the help of one of the Design Engineers who worked on the Second Severn River Crossing into Wales and he says that it's fine physics-wise. But he also advises to take your time and do not get frustrated even if your bridge just fell for the twentieth time! In the industry Failure Modes and Effects Analysis handles all this - in this game you have to. BEST OF LUCK!!!			"

												Looks like it should be good fun but it's not. Gameplay is dated and clunky with frequent glitches, awkward anchor points and occasional invisible components. UI is also poor.			"

												Awful game with absolutely zero support from developers or publishers.  Never quite works which is the standard I am coming to expect from Aerosoft!Even if it's free, don't waste your time on this garbage.zero out of any number you like.			"
