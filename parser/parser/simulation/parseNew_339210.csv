												My first review! May contain inaccuracy. If there's anything I can do to improve it, please let me know!Rescue 2: Everyday Heroes is an Emergency firefighting strategy game in the city of Belvitsia in which you control a large variety of different vehicles and personnel. This is the sequel to Rescue - Everyday Heroes.Major new features- New fire types. You now have many different fire types posing different hazards and will definitely be more challenging.- Interactable map. You can view the whole city in 3D as well as your fire department, the location of the incident, and much more.- New art style. Changing from very realistic and highly detailed, while quite a risky move, actually changed to a slightly more cartoonish style, while in general still very realistic.- CARDS! Yep, the game now has Steam cards! This will definitely be helpful to make badges, trade with other people or get a bit of money on the market. However, with 15 cards to collect, this will be a difficult task. Are you up for it?- More vehicles. You can now take control of many more vehicles, including the ladder. Now you can access second or third floors quickly instead of taking the stairway.ControlsThe controls are a little more difficult and may take a bit to get used to. There is a lot less ""Click this, then click that"". You click a lot more buttons on the HUD, compared to how minimal it was in the first game. It should not really take long to get used to, which will not be an issue as you start with really simple missions and you are bound to get good control as you get into the harder missions later on. Controls are really no big issue as well, since after all, it is a Point & Click game.GraphicsThe graphics are definitely much better compared to the first. It is so different, they even gave it a little extra cartoonish style, which definitely gets my interest. Shading and reflections are incredible and definitely beats the first game. The only problem is that on average computers, VSync, Bloom and Water reflection are large creators of lag. This drops the framerate down a bit, but if you are fine with just small amounts of jittering, this should be no issue.OptionsThere are many options you can choose from.- There are many quality options and you have the choice to choose between Full Screen and Windowed. You can even have Fullscreen with or without a border. You can also go advanced and choose to disable or enable VSync, Anti-Aliasing, Bloom and more.- You also get options to turn on or off the music, the SFX or the voice, or set your own volume for them. You also have many speaker modes, ranging from Raw to Stereo, even 5.0 to Prologic.- In general, you can adjust scroll speed and even disable the HUD if you want to. The best part is that you can even switch between over Six differerent languages!Gameplay - ComparisonThe gameplay is of course the most important part. The gameplay differs completely to the first game, with a new way to dispatch, play missions and your station management. In the first game, you are able to customise your own fire station with props to make it look as you want it to be. In this game, thet feature was removed, but you are able to own 3 different fire departments. Dispatching units to missions is also different; In the first game, you can click a button to set yourself to alert phase and a mission will come up, whereas here, 2-3 random missions will appear on the map. Sending vehicles is quite the same, but sending personnel is different. In the first game, in the dispatch screen, you are able to choose which units go into which vehicles. In this sequel, you have to assign your units to a vehicle first inside a fire station before dispatching the vehicle itself. (More detail on dispatching units is explained further below)Fire StationThe Fire Station is a lot less interactable as the feature to add furniture to decorate your station has been removed. However, there is more to do. From here, you can manage your team and their ""Talents"", which give them extra abilities to do in a mission, such as longer survivability, faster use of of tools and equipment (like hoses), etc.You can also purchase equipment to use and to place in your vehicles. There are also many more vehicles to use, and the most noticeable feature is the addition of a ladder truck. Another great thing is that you can paint your vehicles from a large variety of colours with no need to buy them. The one bonus feature that stood out the most for me is the addition of Female firefighters and paramedics!DispatchDispatching a unit have changed completely. As the game is now more in a ""Freeplay"" mode, random fires will generate, maybe even two at a time. You have a full 3 minutes to send all your units to the fire and to begin the mission. Before dispatching your units, you can manage them in your stations, which will pause the time. You also cannot do two missions at a time, so while you do one, the time is also paused. While you can send FOUR units at a time, you cannot dispatch them while managing the crew at the same time. You will have to first go to your station to assign personnel to the vehicle. This will be problematic for lazy gamers who prefer to get everything over and done with.MissionsMissions will randomly generate all over Belvitsia, sometimes having to deal with two at a time. Over time, you may encounter ""Story"" missions which are important to be able to unlock more vehicles, equipment and more missions. For the first hour or two of the game, you may get bored of having to play the same missions repeatedly, which is unfortunately important if you wish to keep your reputation high. When you have no more reputation with the city, it will be GAME OVER. You will have to start the entire game all over again. As you complete these missions, you will gain higher reputation as well as quite a large sum of money. As you complete story missions, the repetitive side of things will eventually fade as you have a larger variety of missions to play. Though, there are only very few missions so as you start to progress towards the end, you will quickly get the feeling of repetition again. Story missions can only be completed once (Unconfirmed) and there are many interesting story missions, including a large fire on the top floor of an office and even a competition against a rival fire department against the clock.Conclusion (tl;dr)Overall, there are very few problems with this game. This is a huge improvement from the first game. There are so many great new features and even when you finish the game, you just want more. You might feel like you want to come back and play the game again some more. Yes, it gets highly repetitive, but there are many different ways you can complete some missions.I give this game a 7/10 as long as you get it on a sale. I find it very enjoyable and challenging, though quickly repetitive. Worth getting for a couple dozen hours of playing, though way overpriced for the amount of content you get. (I bought this game when it was $25, but I would recommend $10, maybe $15 at the most)If you feel there is something that has been overlooked or is missing from this review, please let me know!			"

												Hello thereThere are a lot of good things I like about this game. The graphics look realy nice and the map is very beautiful. The gameplay is also nice and the AI is not so stupid. There are some new, good things in comparison with the first game. The oxigen bottles and the unlimited fire extinguishers are nice. And you can have more than one HQ.Although I think they have missed a lot of greath things from the previous game (Rescue - Everyday Heroes (U.S. Edition) see: . For example the big ambulances (but that, indeed, is an American thing...) and the rescue vehicles for the road accidents. The customisation of the HQ has also dissapeared, which is a sad thing. The training classes and fitness also have dissapeared.In general it is a good game, but they have left out a couple of greath things from the first game.			"

												I think this is better then the first this is redemption for this series I like it but its still missing things such as Hazmat, Helicopters and command units but they can get that in the next one or in a North America expansion pack. needs more missions which could come in expansion. I love the fact you can draw water from other sources. but overall I am happy with it I think this could start to give Emergency line of games a run for there money.My Wish list to see-Hazmat-Command units such as EMS sup or Battalion Chief.-would love to see tower ladders and stick ladder's with pipes for attack's on fire with water-Add Quints-The irons AKA Axe and Halligans-Maybe an airport with crash tender -Rescue and USAR-Quick attack lines-MasCas and or Large Ambulances-Add Plasma torches-Water rescue and fire boats-the Jaws of life-add Saw's.What I can say I hope the Dev's take this and run with it you have nearly hit your stride. I would love to see a lot more of the tools of the trade			"

												So, I just recently got this game from a good friend. The game is fun, challenging and well made.Pros:- Emergencies never stop- You can own 3 stations, even tho I wish there were more- UI is great- Multiple vehicles to buy- You really need money (buying personnel, equipment, repairing vehicles)- You really have to dispatch units to every call, otherwise your rep will go down and your dept. will get shut down- It's made in Finland- There are almost no bugs, only encountered one, that you can find below- You can color your vehicles (red, yellow, green, purple etc.)Cons:- Only one city to play in (doesnt bother much, but I hope there would've been another one)- No multiplayer- When extinguishing a fire with water/powder/foam tender truck will bug out and may sometimes go somewhere else and not extinguish the fire (happens rarely, but has happened to me sometimes)- Only 1 type of an ambulance- You can't customize the station, as you could in Resuce 1I really recommend you buying this game, if you want a good fire fighting game that has challenge and has almost no bugs.

												I know this game is a god game with loads of hours of play, it is challenging at some points and boring at other. Good things about this game is that the game play is fun, graphics are good. Ita mostly challenging and it takes you a long time to get all the stations and fire trucks, the game is infinate. Bad things about this game is that it still has a few bugs that the community has already spoken of and the developers are handling good. Sound is not the best. And some times it gets boring for brief moments because some levels are very repetitve and you get tired of the same level. he story is fun but it doesnt have much to it. Overall I would recommend the game, Im sure the developers will fix those bugs and hopfully bring some more missions so that we dont get sick of the same missions. I give it a 8/10			"

												I have always been a fan of any Emergency Service game. I had purchased the last game in the Rescue Series but didnt think it stood up well to older titles such as EM4, etc.This one however surprised me, it was actually really thorough. The added bonus of purchasing your units and upgrades etc really added a new dimension. The animations are pretty smooth and enjoyable to watch, and the graphics are reasonable for this scale of game.My only negative was the rermoval of some of the features of the last title, such as upgrading the kit in your fire station, and sending crew to eat/rest etc. Other than that, thoroughly enjoyable.Pros:-good to look at-good problem solving-kit and equipment to buy-progressive campaignCons:-no Fire station upgrading-missions quite repetative-Fire crews contstantly wearing SCBA, perhaps an option to put it on?Well done guys.

												I have played 12 hours of this RESCUE 2 game that i got on release date. GOOD THINGS:Amazing graphics and lightingRealistic equipment and vehiclesRealistic incidentsWater levelsSeveral stationsOrganising vehiclesBAD THINGS:Incidents are repetitivly staged and repeats, which leaves the player bored after an hour of gameplayFire spread is way too intense, nowhere near a realistic level.The only vehicles that can contain firefighters are engines.Firefighters cannot be customized, in regards to uniform, helmets, colors, tags.Firefighters literally cannot put out fires without constant player supervision. The ai will almost every time stand inside the fire, having given up on attempting to put it out.Foam does not stay onto objects to isolate them from fire or oxidation. why even use it?Oxygen levels. Wow. This is just bad. first of all, NO firefighters use oxygen inside the SCBA. Using Oxygen for breathing creates an enormous fire and explosion hazard if pressurized oxygen were to burst near a fire. Now for the actual gameplay mechanics of oxygen:Your firefighters oxygen level drains as he is nearby smoke or fire. if you stand near a fire in the game you have 15 seconds of oxygen. WAT.Diffrent kinds of fires.Not worth 24,99 hueroes			"

												I want to start this as saying I am ABSOLUTLY a fan of this game, as well as the 1st one. This one has some really neat mechanics in it, and it was fun playing it. But after 10 hours, I am feeling completly unfulfilled.WHile there are a few mechanics I really like, such as the ladder truck, or the tender trucks, there is also a lot of depth missing, that was in the 1st one. There is little to know customization like in the 1st one. The firehouse is basically pointless, as you cannot do anything in it, like the origional. I feel like a mix of the 2 would be best, but this is what we have.Like I said, I had fun playing this game, but I'm done, after 10 hours. There is no reason to keep playing. I own all the trucks, all my slots are full, and I'm in the 60's for dispatched.			"

												Starts off strong, repeats certain missions frequently, this is broken up by advancing the 'story' and getting more equipment and vehicles. I got to a mission where my FF had to carry a guy down the turntable ladder, but instead kept appearing at the bottom of said ladder and climbing up. Buggy.			"

												Very fun game with a good attantion to detail on how fire fighting is handled. Rather than just run in and do something, strategic planning is needed to have the right assest available when needed. Some mission redundency but that is also exactly what happens in real life as well.			"

												Has about 10 hours of gameplay and story missions until it is all repetitive. It's the same missions with only slight differences in equipment until you have the specialized vehicles which makes the missions trivial, which is boring. I enjoy this game, however it needs more content and it could really use procedural generation for missions to make no two alike, even if they use the same small selection of maps.Difficulty level was not challenging. Once you understand how to do a mission quickly, it becomes dull. When I saw the train derailment mission, I thought ""wow this will be fun"". Then I go there with my foam tender and spray one small fire and complete the mission in less time than it took for the mission to load. That is disappointing.  The game is much more fun if you let everything catch on fire for a while, let the injured people almost die, then start fighting the fires.  I felt like I had cool equipment and vehicles, but really didn't feel like I was using them. Often, I could bust into a fire with 4 people using fire extinguishers and avoid all of the fun of setting up hoses.  However, I am still recommending this game because it is suitably polished. It's good for about a day's worth of play and good for kids to play with parents. This is an improvement over the previous Rescue. The game design and engine have enormous potential, but the content is currently (6/5/2015) mediocre.  "

												I'm a big fan of this style of game, and I really want to like it, but there are so many little annoyances and disappointments that keep it from being a really gratifying firefighting game.   Pros:  -It's good looking -- I think the graphical style is great.-Laying hoses is super-cool, I remember playing older games like Fire Captain and Emergency Fire Response and wishing they would show hoses laid down instead of just abstracting it.  In Rescue 2, you have hoses going everywhere, and stuff connected to other stuff, and it's really neat.-You can issue orders while paused!Cons:-You'll become annoyed with pathfinding at times, as well as the specific spots your firefighters sometimes insist on standing to extinguish a specific flame.-You'll become annoyed when you notice that connecting your fire engine to a water source does not refill its internal water tank, it just remains empty until the mission is over.-You'll grow tired of issuing the exact same orders to different firefighters when you want two dudes to move someplace together, because there does not seem to be a way to issue group orders, nor does there seem to be a way to even group-select units.-Speaking of issuing orders, you cannot enqueue orders at all, so you will sometimes be hyper-focused on a single unit as they go through the sometimes-lengthly animations triggered by following your commands.  -You will laugh at how hilariously disinterested in saving people Paramedics seem, because half the things they do are at walking speed.-The missions get repetitive pretty quickly.-Right Mouse Button drag-scrolling around the map gets old really fast.-It feels a little dorky when, at the end of a mission, after you've extinguished all the fire, there are still people standing around, panicking, until you have a firefighter walk over to them, pick them up, carry them like 20 feet out the door of the giant, empty, never-was-on-fire room, and set them down.   -You would think certain vehicles, like the Water Carrier, for example, would be equipped with all the valves and flanges and doodads necessary to allow more than one fire engine to connect to it at once, but no, you would be wrong.  Same with every water source, actually, only one thing can connect to it, and then only one thing can connect to that.			"

												This game is not too bad, certainly an improvement to the first version. Short Pro/Cons are the following, more in depth explaination follows in the list:++Exinguishing MechanigsAbility to put Y-Extension in hosesDifferent Water Sources--Short missionsShort StoryWhat i like about this game compared to the emergency series is the way the extinguishing mechanics work. You have to actually support your trucks with water for them to work over an extensive period of time. Also the way that there is different classes of fire with different extinguishing methods is nicely done, things you miss in the never versions of emergency.Now to the less favourable points of the game. The whole story line is very short, and the missions, apart from the story missions are quiet repetitive and short. Later in the story if you got Water Tender or even Foam/Pulver Tender the some of the missions are done in the matter of seconds once the truck arrives at the scene. Mission design is certainly done better in other similar games.However i'll give this game a recommendation, for people that want something not too difficult but still challenging at first to spend some time in a game world.

												I'll try to keep this short and on point. If you enjoy games like this and the ""Emergency""-series, you will probably like this game as well. The story is far from brilliant and it is also fairly short. The missions have a decent variety, but after a while you have played through all of them a few times, and it starts to feel like grinding. Good instructions through the tutorials, and the game makes new emergency vehicles available at a steady pace.Did not encounter many bugs, but the emergency vehicles some times struggled to find a free path on the mission site (usually they blocked the road for each other, and other times the ambulance ""collided"" with cars when it was trying to leave the mission area). Overall, I can say that I have enjoyed the game and I would give it a score of  65/100 . There is so much more they can do with the game, but for $20 I think it is an okay purchase. So if you are a fan of this type of games, consider buying it and also help support further development of the genre.			"

												A great game so far and a very interesting story line. Although there still are some bugs to fix, some graphic issues and missions repeating themselves, I find it to be very enjoyable. I do however reconmend adding another fire station, more fire apparatus, an explanation into Class A B and C fires, more missions to randomized from the bag and having any amount of units to respond to a call right away. This game exceeded my expectations and deserves high credit. A+ 4/5 stars  and a reconmendation.			"

												well, to beginn with this review i have to say that i am really dissappointed by the game! i know many people would just need one sentence to describe this game, but i don´t think that it is so bad.Yes, the game promisses more than it actually gives. there is a screenshot about a train derailment near a sawmill, but it´s not in this game! there has been one in the previous part. and this is the only part that really gives you missions you only can achieve with the Ladder Vehicle. i surely see that the game could be better, but knowing the companies that worked on it for a while i realized they never done something big and cool. those companies are known for makeing the worst simulator games on the market.Compared to the current version of Emergency 2016 (Emergency 5 with a Upgrade), even EM 2016 is better and it has gotten a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ path finding AI .Dear Developers of Rescue 2! , please patch this game! you know that you keep makeing people angry by promiseing more than you can give those people.i won´t ever by any part of the Rescue game Series. i better stick to the Emergency Series and other Rescue Simulators. To All people who think about buying, Don´t Buy This Game! Buy Emergency 2016 instead of this game! there is even better and changeing music!Thanks for reading "

												The game is pretty enjoyable, but it's not Emergency level yet. I like Emergency level more because it has a bigger open world and the missions come in more randomly.

												As a Firefighter I try all of the emergency type games. This one is on par with most and I would give it a 3.5 out 5. My only really dislike of the game is the repeating of the same random missions over and over. The devolopers should have a random scenario generator to make each incident unique. I recommend this game mainly for the fire fighters out there that will get a couple hours of enjoyment out of it. To the average gamer this might not be your cup of tea.			"

												It's a Emergency Services related games, naturally you see my name pop up here.Edit: The problem was solved by the Devs in a fast and efficient manner. Bravo !I haven't played the game nearly long enough for a full review. But from what I have seen so far I think this is a serious contender to give other Titles of the same genre a run for their money. I am still not sure what I think of the more comic style approach on the graphics, however I love the depth that develops as you progress through the missions. A depth that other titles are sadly lacking. If you have seen my first review of Rescue 1 I pointed out that one of the most frustrating parts is that the water managment shows promise but they bglew it by making the supply hose ridicoulusly short. Well they changed that completly around, not only is the supply line nice and long, but you have  Static Drybowl and Underground hydrants and even floating pumps to draft directly from lakes . That alone deserves an award in my book, now if we could only get direct drafting engine to engine.But not enough there, you also got dry risers that allow you to get water at pump pressure to your attack line inside a building. I have to say BRAVO to the developer for taking this to the next level.As I am progressing in the game I will further this review, but from what I have seen in almost ten hours playing it, I definite must for fans of the genre.Edit 7/7/2015My initial verdict still stands, for fans of the genre a must have, however for the casual player i would suggest to look into titles like 911 First Responders or Emergency 5 as those games give you more bang for the buck since they are supporting mods which keeps the games fresh and interesting, this game unfortunately loses is ""New Toy"" shine after the first 50 Callouts or so. As I said before, there is a ton of potential but it is unrealized for the most part.

												When you control the firefighter, when they try putting out the fire the tend to sit right on it so therefor they die, they need to stand where you tell them to spray, then tell them to move to the next fire, they shouldnt just run to the next one			"

												There is nothing inherently bad about this game, there just isn't anything particularly good either. Everything that is in the game works well, the units and equipment works intuitively, and I had no problems handling any of the missions. This is where the problems start though. At no point did the game feel challenging. A dispatch gets logged, I have more than enough time to wait for each of my units to arrive at the scene before starting the mission. I couldn't see any reason to start missions when the first vehicle arrived rather then waiting for everyone to be there, the fire always started at the exact same point regardless. Once at the scene, some small fire would start and my crew would have all the time in the world to setup, grab any civilians and casually extinguish the fires. This only gets worse once you unlock access to the water/foam/powder tenders as they can mop up any outdoor fire all by themselves in seconds.It may be harsh to judge the game based on this, as I supose it is a more accurate depiction of what actual firecrews face, more chip pan fires than multi-story infernos, however the story missions should have pushed the boat out brought in some terrifying scenarios but instead they all just felt a little limp.It is a shame, I did want to like this game to be amazing, and it's shortcomings could perhaps be forgiven if this was a first attempt, but from what I read about the previous game, it seems a large number of interesting features and mechanics have actually been removed. Which makes it hard not to see this as a rushed cash grab.			"

												What do I think about RESCUE 2?It is great. It is fun and challenging. There are no issues in terms of graphics or gameplay. Very few bugs/glitches were stumbled across while I played this game. Is it better than the last one? No. I only say this because there is not a great variety of fire engines unlike Rescue 1. However, this sequel does not dissapoint, unlike some other sequels. This is a great game for boosting tactical strategy skills. The only negative part of this game is the lack of missions. The amount of story missions (main missions) are too small. If you are reading this while deciding whether to get this game or not, there is only one thing I can say:BUY IT.			"

												Had expectations after first part. Greatly underperformed =/ This is not even enjoyable. Wellh, lets see:Cons:- Station is not customizable, just possible to get functional extras- Handling is worse. It is  a hard area even for Emergency series, but as competitor, Rescue had chance. Nope.I'm missing multiple selection for staff on mission to give out same command.- Staff XP/level is imbalanced, level up skills lacks bigger variety. Training aspects/paths would be a great breakthrough. Staff personal infos are very good - could have combined with skills!- There should be better mission information. (Spoiler coming!) Having a dive pump is mission critical on a mission with wood piles. Hardly any alternatives, with 3 light FE (avaiable so early as this mission coming) and very-very well instructed firemen maybe managable. But  budget-wise absolutely unacceptable.(Spoiler coming!) Art gallery fire incident with civilians. Start. Ah, on a high floor? You did not bring a ladder along? Fire has approx. 30 sec advantage now. Pros:- It is great to see dispatching variety. - Vehicle items changeable- Tutorial missions are good timed/set before making available those eqipments/vehicles			"

												I've played now 7h, finished the campaign and saw every single mission at least 10 times. Not only the scenarios are repetitive, e.g. a burning hot dog stand, it's every single time the same kind of fire, the same number of casualties and even the places of the bodies in the map are identical. In the end I've finished nearly every missions in about 30 sec by just sending the foam vehicle. The mission costs are identical for every vehicle so there was not even a penalty in doing so.  he paramedic mechanics are broken completely, I never needed to use the defibrillator or even the first aid kit. I had buggy pathfinding, glitches, at one point I had to restart, because I weren't able to send the paramedics to hospital. I'm very disappointed of this game and no, it's not getting better after the first hours!! Absolutely not recommended!			"

												Want to play a game where you are the firefighter or paramedic? Get one of the Emergency games! I've played +100 missions on this game, and gosh... this game is so repetative. You play missions over and over again while there are only a couple of missions which were special. (In their own way)This wouldn't be such a problem, if it were not for the effortless missions. Almost all of these mission are easily done by sending a Foam Tanker to them, because it can extinguish both regular as oil fire.Next to all fires in the game start as a single point fire when you enter the map, that it will be very easy for your tankers to extinguish after mere seconds when the map starts.The AI itself isn't special either, unless if 'special' for you means non-working. They won't put fire out on their own, which means you have to command them to do it, and when they do extinguish fires, and will do it automatically (for a while...), their pathfinding will prevent them from going further!In short, don't waste your money on this game! Want to put fires out as a firefighter, go and buy the Fire Department series. Want some medical and police action too, get the Emergency series!			"

												The first part was already not that good.And at first glance this could be good. But it is ridden with many game breaking bugs.I haven't played that long (half an hour maybe) and already encountered two.It started as I was setting up the sound ... and music and fx where gone for no reason ... and that was the foreboding shadow. (yeah, I know that is not game breaking ... but if you encounter bugs here you already get a bad feeling).A few missions in ...five or so and tutorials still running... I encountered a water source behind a locked door. I got close, let my firefighters exit the truck... and for no reason I got a no path error message... after that the door wasn't clickable anymore. I had to reload the thank god) existing autosave.The best thing ... after that I got the tutorial for locked doors...A few mission later my paramedic refused to bring in the patient ... I had to dismiss the car (with the patient still on the stretcher in middle of street) and call it back in again.And all this in the short time I played.I don't really want to talk about the sluggish controls ... especially moving the map with mouse seem way to slow.Key bindings are hard coded ... are we in the 80th? ... and ""wasd"" has a hole different purpose than moving.To play this game with mouse and keyboard you feel (as a right handed) one arm too short... since the map is scrolled with arrow keys...which wouldn't matter if you could zoom out enough....With a few fixes and it could be at least okish ... until then it leaves a bitter aftertaste. --------------------------------Update: I played a little longer and while it can be fun it also revealed even more bugs to me ... as in awkward path finding* or disappearing cars** ... *= sometimes it doesn't go where you want it to on some tries, but later it does ... makes you loose precious seconds ... the path finding is so bad that you feel glad that it doesn't care about collisions ... cars and humans are simply passing through each other.**= in one mission I did think I don't need the ladder and send it home only to see a little later that the fire exit was blocked. So I called it back ... it came, it reacted like it was in place, but invisible and couldn't be used /climbed. which meant to me I also had to load the autosave.Some mission also don't give you all information ... in some are firemen needed but not displayed ... since I ended up starting that one while had my firetruck send to a different location ... I could only end it without helping them ... (but if I had ended the fire mission first I could have redirected the firetruck on way home, though)That all would be acceptable if this game would be early access ... and still in development ... so we could get our hopes up that these issues will be fixed eventually.

												It starts a bit slow but picks up the pace as you advance. I liked that the tutorial missions are interspersed with the game missions so you can jump right into the game while learning new stuff in between.As you earn more money and purchase advanced equipment - the missions get much more complex and engaging, requiring coordination between several vehicles and personnel.The hose micromanagement gets a bit annoying after a while, I hope the developers improve this aspect and make it more streamlined.In addition you have the station manegment screen where you can buy new equipment, hire new personnel and rank-up your existing firefighters and medics as they gain experience points.I didn't like the ""reputation newsbits"" you get after missions, they are reptitive, don't make much sense and look like an afterthought.Would also love to see some DLC packs with additional equipment, cities & scenarios.

												I had doubts about this game and I understand part of the negative reviews, however at this sale price of €9,99 I think it is worth it.I really liked the tutorials, they are clear and to the point and that is unusual in many games. I didn't have major troubles with the missions nor the budget, my complaint was one time while using the ladder, I couldn't use it because it didn't recognize the command but it wasn't essential in this case. I just sent the fireman through the emergency doors. Commanding a fireman to open the doors one by one may be frustrating but I haven't seen it affecting the result. It is just another click.I am still relatively new at the moment of this review (2,6 h) but this is what I have seen so far and overall I enjoyed it.Edit: In the Art Gallery mission there is an error, when you park next to the dry hydrant in the left of the building, the firetruck gets stuck and does not connect to it, then the message of ""no path found"" appears incesantly.

												This game is awful. I won't lie, it isn't often I write reviews, but I believe this game required one. The concept of it is brilliant. It could really have some potential with the right framework, but it's just tedious, repetative and doesnt encompass what I was expecting. I purchased this game on a whim, after it being in my wishlist for a good 6 months, yet, even at the reduced price, I don't think it's worthy of £5.99, of my hard earnt money.Even on the very high settings, the graphics are nothing to rave about. I was hoping that it would compare to the Emergency games, which unforunately I don't play due to the fact I own a Mac.The gameplay is boring, with missions that repeat themselves, the AI is awful, and the amount of button pressing required to complete simple tasks is mind blowing.In all honesty, I really wanted to like this game, because this is a concept that really appeals to me. I just couldn't.			"
