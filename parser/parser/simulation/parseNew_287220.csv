Early Access Review
								While it was fun when I was first starting to learn how everything works, later it just becomes like every other ""physics""-based puzzle game with repetitive landscapes and the same old requirements to finish each puzzle, just modified slightly. Apart from the scenery, this game is no different than any of the other games of the same genre. But what disappointed me the most out this was that the game seems to be abandoned, with no new updates for nearly five months.In all, this game had potential in it's earlier stages, but nothing was done with it and it ended up bland and no different than any other game. If any new updates come out after this review, I will re-evaluate my review accordingly. "

YouTube™ Video: Play Wait or Avoid? Review of Autocraft Early Access 

			Views: 2,017		

			Video represents footage and features from Version 0.1181 and may not accurately represent the game and its features in future versions.		

 Autocraft has an extremely fun challenge system and a fluid, easy creation system that make the game fun to play. The only real problem with Autocraft is there is not enough to do, the challenges are fun but are not plentiful enough, and a lack of a multiplayer mode at least in sandbox makes the game lose your interest quickly. However with more challenges and gamemodes added, I’m sure that Autocraft will be something to pick up in the near future.			"

Early Access Review
								I only heard of this game a day after its release on Steam, I bought it that same day because the promotional videos already captured my love for sandbox physics.The Pros:~ Simplistic yet elegant art style~ Addicitive 'challenge' levels~ Once you've unlocked parts through doing challenge levels, sandbox mode is a hell of a lot of fun~ Easy to grasp building interfaceThe Cons:~ Its buggy (but this should be expected with early alpha), although not game-breaking~ Can be short lived if you rush through the challenge levels (again, its early access so hopefully more content is on its way)Overall, I found it a refreshing sandbox-simulation type game, its not as complex as similar titles such as Kerbal Space Program, but I like that about it really. If you enjoy getting creative in order to solve puzzles, or just like fooling around with different contraptions on sandbox then I'd recommend this title, especially at its reasonable price.			"

Early Access Review
								If you first hear the name Autocraft you might just think you’re dealing with some kind of Warcraft clone with cars here. Let me reassure you that it doesn’t come even close. In reality this is a fun game for all of those who have ever played with Lego or K’nex. That’s exactly right; Autocraft wants you to use your imagination again. First and foremost this is a puzzle game, but building stuff is also a very important part of the game. There aren’t any real objectives except to get to the goal. You start off in ‘building’ mode where you have the opportunity to build a vehicle. At first, this will be a car, but a few levels in you’ll be building an airplane and later on even boats and robots, among other things.Every couple of levels you’ll learn something new to do so it gradually teaches you all the things you can do. These ‘tutorials’ aren’t too deep. As a matter of fact you’ll be doing everything yourself. The game doesn’t limit you to the developers’ ideas, it allows you to experiment with things yourself and maybe you can even find a different way to do things. I do have to admit that this is pretty hard in the beginning, because you only have a limited amount of building blocks available and you’re probably going to need them all just to understand the game’s mechanics. Still, it’s possible.And I wouldn’t say it’s impossible but it’s damn hard to get to the end of the level without crashing at least once. Building things is a learning process and a fun experience in itself. It’s very satisfying to see a crafted vehicle do exactly what you want it to do.I haven’t mentioned the controls yet but they’re really easy to use. Just dragging objects onto other objects will attach them to each other. You can smoothly and quickly drag them to other places, too and by keeping Control pressed you can quickly add the same parts to other pieces and by pressing and holding Alt you’ll be able to quickly delete specific parts. Easy as pie.As I said there aren’t any real objectives but there are optional objectives you can complete like setting a speed record, collecting a star (‘hidden’ somewhere in the level) or by using a specific amount of blocks. Completing these objectives will earn you more (different) blocks that you can use in Sandbox mode where you can express your imagination and creativity more freely.Sandbox mode is exactly what it sounds like. You select a level and you start building things with the blocks you have acquired. You’ll also be able to load objects from other users into your levels and then just have fun with them. Fans of Lego and K’nex will have an excellent time here, even if interaction with objects is fairly limited.The game, at the moment of writing, has 37 levels to complete. The first couple of levels are easy and can be seen as an introduction to the game really, but around level 10 things start to get more difficult. You can play this until the end of time, but if you’re going to finish just the levels then you should be able to complete them between 10-20 hours I think. It depends on several factors so as you can understand it’s a very rough estimate.As far as the graphics are concerned Autocraft looks really beautiful. This is the first game, I think ever, that reminded me of Mario Galaxy. The graphics have the same style with lots of colors and specific shading. It looks beautiful in motion and the screenshots don’t do it justice. Not entirely, at least. One thing I would like to see though, are more animated objects in the background. It feels a little barebones sometimes, but you’re usually probably too busy building anyway.The music is kind of subtle but what’s there is calm and soothing, and maybe even a bit futuristic. It’s well done. As for the sounds; crashing, using your engines and blocks connecting with each other all sound realistic enough to keep you immersed.Autocraft is a fun game that’s all about completing puzzles by building vehicles. If you ever played Turbo Dismount but wanted more freedom and creativity then this is the game for you. I had a great time with it and I’m sure many share that sentiment. I know the game isn’t yet complete, but I’m positive the quality will only improve (it’s already very polished). I’m curious to see what the final product will be like. Recommended ![Rating: 79/100]			"

								Autocraft is a phyics based building game which is currently available in Early Access. In Autocraft's challenge mode you are given objectives to complete on different maps and you must build a vehicle with the parts you are given to complete these objectives. In Sandbox mode you should (I'll come to that later) be able to build any vehicle you could possibly imagine with any of the parts available in the game on one of three maps. As a huge fan of Bad Piggies on my Tablet (a similar game but in 2D) this game was an instant-buy when I saw it was on sale and I'm quite happy that I picked it up.+Nice simple art style which suits the game well+Simple and easy to use UI though it isn't the nicest looking UI around+Quite a lot of challenges each with it's own map+A large catalogue of parts each with different pros and cons+The character looks cool+You have a speed and time indicator which is useful for completing timed objectives+Workshop support and there are some really great creations out there-The game gets updated quite slowly-Soundtrack and sound effects aren't the best-Challenge mode gets pretty boring quite quicklyWorth a mention:-I've been having a lot of trouble downloading workshop items, in fact I can't download them at all but it could just be a problem my endVerdict:6Autocraft has a fun challenge mode and an enjoyable sandbox mode, a great little game that's great for anyone who enjoys building thingsEl K.

								I love the art style of this game! It still has a lot of room to grow but shows promise. Autocraft gives players a freedom to approach puzzles that most other games of its kind lack and the achievements for each problem, now a staple of the genre, add real depth to the Build Challenges. With Autocraft in Early Access, I'm curious to see how the developers might implement the weapons systems to mix up this deeply enjoyable logic game and its stellar physics engine.			"

								I am having fun with this game. It has a phone game level design with the first few level though. This means you will fly through the levels and then try and get challanges complete for the level. Such as get the star or do it in 5 seconds. Building a craft is pretty much all of the game and well done. You are not stopped from none standard part placement which is a key element that I enjoy but got turned away from in robocraft. By none stardard you can have wheels on the top of your car.			"

								UPDATE: The review below is obsolete. There are still challenges with limited amounts of parts, but the sandbox has been updated SO MUCH MORE. Now with steam workshop support, you can subscribe to people's creations to use them in the sandbox, like Garry's Mod. You can still make your own stuff, though! I am not sure, but I think there is a co-op now that can replace the fact that there wasn't a multiplayer. Now, I give this game a full 10/10!Feel free to friend me to ask me any questions on this game. You are more than welcome to do so!-OLD REVIEWThis game is great. There are challenges for you to solve with limited amounts of parts, and there is a sandbox where you have unlimited amounts of everything (some things you have to unlock). I'd give this game 9/10, because there is no multiplayer. A server where you can invite your friends to battle or race your creations would be awesome.			"

								Autocraft is a great game. It takes a decent amount of imagination and creativity to advance, which is probably the best part about this game. There are 2 game modes at the moment with possibly more to be added in the future. The challenge mode has been my favorite so far and kinda acts as like a Story mode giving you misions to do, although there is no story, the objectives are quite fun to complete. It can also be quite difficult, especially if you try to get all the obejectives done. You are given certain and limited amount of parts to build your craft and reach your objective, which may be way off in space, around a huge mountain, or across a deadly gap. It can be as frustrating as it is funny trying to complete the given objectives, I've definitely experienced a bit of both. Completing the objectives in Challenge mode unlock extra parts to be used while playing in Sandbox Mode. So far I've played mainly the Challenge mode, As it kind of interests me a little more than Sandbox at the moment, but I did dip into it a little and I will eventually make some ridiculous vehicle and find the secrets that the SB world has to offer. As of writing this review, I honestly haven't experienced any game breaking bugs. The game is in EA so if you buy in, please keep that in mind. The developers also look like they are keeping up with the forums quite well and communicating with the community, which is a great thing we all love to see. Definitley recommend checking this out, especially if you like building games and using your imagination. Would you like to see some gameplay? Check below :)

								Simple, yet really complex at the same time.I've played through all of the current challenges and some of the sandbox mode, and I've really enjoyed the game so far. The visuals are appealing, building is easy, and the challenges get pretty difficult. Best of all, since it is early access, the game is being constantly updated with new challenges and parts. Many of you may have heard of, or played a game called Crashtastic. While I thoroughly enjoyed that, it pales in comparison to Autocraft, which feels very well put together, even in its current state.Pros:- Appealing visuals- Good value- Highly customizable (Many parts can be fine-tuned and individually controlled, or even automated)- Endless crafting possibilities- Very easy to learn/start playingCons: - Some physics is unintuitive (Motorcycles fall over, planes don't use aerodynamics)- Without a level creator, gameplay might start to feel limitedOverall, I highly recommend you check out this game. If you're on the edge, I have a series on all the challenges and some of the sandbox that is ongoing, which you can check out here:http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu_Jc10gF_fDZWRqqHw-Srwm_csdgi6HE "

Early Access Review
								First impression: less addictive than RobocraftThere've been quite a few LEGO-type games recently. This one has ""Challenges"" which are small levels that you have to complete with limited parts, earning extra stars for beating a time limit, not breaking your craft, collecting stars (duh) and similar tasks - think small obstacle course. The whole game feels very sandboxey, from the cardboard tube sturdiness of your craft to the low-poly simplistic level design; and indeed the sandbox mode seems to be where it's at for most reviewers.As a game, Autocraft leaves a lot to be desired (the ability to fire your gun without activating the thrusters, for one thing). Mostly, I suspect that the devlopers use the Unity physics angine as-is and don't really understand that much about physics modeling, which kinda breaks the game and my constructions: getting stuck in the ground from the ""Play"" button in level 1 (tip: use 4 wheels to be safe) to the general brittleness of everything that makes matchsticks look like a superior building material to the general uncontrollabity of everything. (I haven't found the ""wiring"" touted on the store page.) Some things can be easily remedied before Autocraft goes out of Early Access: gamepad support, a better introduction than to drop players in the first level with help that still leaves you wondering why you can build something with wheels that you can't control (you have no energy source, and no steering wheels in level 1); but the fact that I'm fighting the physics engine more than the level challenges means that the game is likely to stay a sandbox with extras for the foreseeable future.So, yeah, if are bored of the physics sandboxes you have and want a new one, give this try; if you're looking for a game, it's probably too early to access this one.Update: I put some more time in this game, and found out that in later levels, when you have built something and go into ""edit parts"" mode, you can select parts on your vehicle and change some parameters, most importantly the activation key. This actually provides for a modicum of control, and now I am recommending this game to players who like to tinker and don't mind an ""unfinished"" feel about everything. "

								Ok so to everyone: THIS GAME IS AWESOME!Oh my, for an early access game, I so strongly recommand it, and I am sure the actual game will be a BLAST, even though I can hardly see how it can be made any better!Honestly, to anyone who likes calm music, beautiful environnment, and hours and hours of fun, action (because yes, a rocket does go fast), and A LOT of thinking (these damn stars are hard to get!), THIS GAME IS FOR YOU.Yet let's not forget the main idea: you also have to love creation: building your vehicule is well made, easy, accessible to all, and as always: fun!The ONLY reproch I could ever think of is that your vehicule does not affect the environnment: if you crash with a rocket against a wall, you will blow into a thousand beautiful pieces but the wall will not be alter. This opportunity would make the sandbox even funnier and give a lot more opportunities for the campaign to achieve victory!But don't get me wrong, I realise how hard this is to program, and it is just a suggestion if the developpers have A LOT of time on their hands!However to conclude on a positive note: should you buy this game? YES YES YES MULTIPLES TIME YES! I am in love! Keep it going!			"

								I know that the game is still very new, but there are some major bugs. For instance, when you save a creation and quit sandbox mode, the structure will be deleted. Also the framerate will prgressively get worse while you play and can only be remedied by exiting to the main menu. Finally, the menu does not show all the possible items you can use, several are hidden from sight by the scroll bar. hopefully these bugs will be fixed, and I know they will. overall though the game surpasses expectations, Good Work!

								I was expecting so much more, sadly it's highly repetitive, focuses on a few bells and whistles which aren't even fully useful [nevermind the fact that it's a early access game], tries to create a cartoon like appeal which only makes it look that much more underwhelming, and shows no potential. Especially compared to other simulators out there. This game does not, and I do not expect it to merit costing any money after it passes it's early access stages. If you're looking for something like this, but has so much more, I simply recommend sticking with a studio that has a better reputation and a better game under it's belt such as Space Engineers.			"

Early Access Review
								I really enjoy playing this game.  What I like about it is that the gameplay is fairly openand there are a certain number of challenges to keep things entertaining.  I enjoy the fact that the environment in the game changes as you go along, and that there is no perfect solution to getting your vehicle where it needs to go.  The results of a bad idea can also be pretty hilarious to watch.  It is a unique concept insofar as I can tell, and elements of it bring the player back to building cub cars as a child [except the track for cub cars was boring].  The physics are nice and satisfying, and the graphics are pretty.The only thing I can really say wrong about this game is that the sandbox in particular requires a little too much guts for my crappy old laptop, but it is 5 years old [and poorly maintained =(] so I can't really fault the game for that and I'm sure the average user won't have problems with it at all.  I've found that I can play in the smaller sandbox levels, so even my crappy computer can let me make whatever I want to.			"

								Best sandbox game i have ever played. Graphics might be simple but the fun is beyond epic. Also the riddles are really tough but not to tough. Full 10/10 totally recommend buying.The only thing i miss here is a multiplayer but since this is an Alpha still i am pretty sure it will be added in the future.			"

								Kind of feels abandoned. The developers don't seem to have been here since April, and reading in the discussion don't really seem to have been much help when they were.The game is way too broken. The controls don't seem to work well, some not at all.With the little bit I managed to be able to do my cars wheel got stuck inside a rock.To me it's not worth the $2.49 I paid.			"

								A very Fun 'Semi-Mind' twisting Game built similer to RoboCraft And KSP, Still In Alpha and still a little buggy but! it is already a great game while other games aren't this far after they were released (On Steam)!Very,Very Fun i hope to see Multiplayer aswell as different Sandbox maps!Campain: Is a Large Set of levels with goals, aswell as the challenge to get PAST the level, Also you're limited to what you're Set toSandbox: A FreeRange Mode on a map with inf- Blocks and a Large Flight space! You can even go into SPACE without being destroyed!			"

I do hope they fix these problems soon. These problems are only in certain parts of the game so in general i do love this game and hope the best of it in the future.			"

								The games building system is a little odd, as you have to hold control to add parts, and not all parts have they're own connection system with other blocks, though still being able to connect them. Wheels will always go fast, you CANNOT get them to go slow, even if you turn their power all the way down to 1%, they'll still go pretty fast, there also is no real breaking system, so your vehicle will always glide some. And finally, the game has some lag issues, I don't have a magnificent PC or anything, but if I can run Skyrim with mods and full graphics at 30 fps, than I feel this much simpler, smaller game shouldn't run at 10-15 fps.

								Been playing this game for about an hour, and honestly its pretty good, there is definetly room for improvement and there could be a lot more added, but yes I would recommend this game, also I thought it would be a lot buggier than it was but its not that buggy! Good job.I have done a gameplay on this game if you would like to view a few missions of the game.Link to video:

								This is a cool game, but still too many problems need to fix. I hope the author will fix these issues soon, and I will give this game another chance.Issues:1. Awful airplane control and simulation. It's hard to take off an airplane, and also hard to control the direction.2. Awful performance, after you fire some artillery, the particle effects will kill your brain.3. Awful camera control, I can not move the center of the camera, so it's hard to build a huge object.4. Still need more stable blocks, which won't cracked *easily*. "

								Great game! Played a few hours, not addicted but I have a feeling I will come back to this game every hour and then. It reminds me a lot of Rovio's Bad Piggies, essentially a 3D version. But of course it is much more complex and advanced.Because this is an early access.. very early in development, I can't wait to see what comes out in the next bunch of updates.Great art and music, reminds me of one of those mobile creative puzzle games which I enjoy.

								It's an early access game, and it very much feels like one. At present, there's nothing to justify spending $10 on this game, so don't do that unless you're very dedicated to supporting the developers. The last news update seems to have been in August 2015 as of now (I'm writing this in late November). I got the game on sale for less than $3, and sure, it's worth something around that price. You've almost certainly seen games like this before. It's a 'physics sandbox' in which you craft vehicles, and then pilot them through increasingly complex obstacle courses (there's also a sandbox mode with no goals except those you impose yourself). The graphics are minimalist; I like the style, but the game has not been optimized, and runs quite slowly for its appearance. It's... alright. I'm curious to see where it leads, but there's certainly tons of work left before it's a complete enjoyable game.			"

								This game is quite fun is some ways, but the challenge mode is god awful. 1. Some challenges are so easy it's wrong calling it a challenge. Other challenges are so hard that it is indeed, impossible to get all of the stars. 2. The physics is just incorrect and annoying. For example, i had my vehicle just scrolling along, it was perfectly balenced, but then randomly turned right. I retry and it does the same thing but goes left. I don't even need to press any buttons. This game is just not worth the ten bucks.			"

								See, I started playing this game quite a while ago. Off and on, I'd play it, and I saw it through its development stages. When I first got the game, I really enjoyed it, and it kept me entertained for a while. Eventually it got a tad bit repetative, but I still played it quite a bit. They added the aircraft parts, which interested me, but still didn't work as well as I expected. Eventually, I got completely tired of the game, and I feel nothing can bring back the enjoyment I had when I originally started playing this game.

YouTube™ Video: Swash! ❧ Autocraft Peek (Early Access Review) 

			Views: 281		

			An in-depth peek, towards Autocraft, a physics simulation game in which you build your vehicle to reach the end of a level by all means necessary, brought to you by SwashbucklingSir.		

Let’s talk about the aesthetics of Autocraft first, and I will be supremely direct here. It seems to me that the game tries to hinge on the simple graphical fidelity train that Minecraft started. Most models seem deliberately low in their polygon count, leading to this peculiar art style, which could be okay if it would not be as highly inconsistent as it currently is. For example when looking at the astronaut, the model is actually quite detailed, thus creating a harsh contrast. Moreover, the choice of colours and in general the shading of the objects (I don’t even want to say texturing, as there is no real texture to it) seems inspired by smooth pastels, which again contrasts the rest of the aesthetics in terms of providing futuristic, edgy models. The overall appearance suggests that the developer does not know which way the game is supposed to look, lacking a clear artistic vision. The missing anti-aliasing does the rest to inflict screen flickering on your eyes wherever possible. Suffice to say, Autocraft does not give a good impression in terms of graphical fidelity. The same can be said about the overall sound design. Generic, monotone background tracks trot along while you are playing, never peaking interest or requiring any attention.But technical facets do not necessarily make a good game bad and horrible gameplay is not rescued just by splendid graphics. Therefore, let’s talk about the core of Autocraft: the gameplay, consisting of building vehicles and afterwards steering them through the physics simulation to reach a certain point on the map. The building aspects of the game are actually decent. The camera can be rotated freely, parts mostly react like you would expect and all parts snap to the backbone of your vehicle making the building rather intuitive. Additionally you can remap the keys required to steer interactive parts, thus allowing fancy mechanisms if you are creative enough about it. Sadly, Autocraft wastes said potential as you are mostly required to limit yourself incredibly to reach the bonus star requirements. Additionally, even when you try fancy things, they usually end up not working as intended and often a simple solution of flying plane, rocket or standard car is the solution to every level I have encountered. What is the point of a wacky building game, if we can’t creatively use the level design to design vehicles of our weird twisted minds?Immediately when taking your firsts transport out for a ride, you will notice that the physics engine is so obviously terrible that you wonder which, if any, laws of physics have been applied to Autocraft. The worst part is again inconsistency. In a particular level, I was pressing W constantly and restarting in between to display how broken the simulation is. Even though the vehicle is spawned in the same spot over and over, and even though I just press W constantly, thus accelerating constantly, the bounces, breaks and side-ways reactions seem utterly random. If your game consists of essentially one gameplay element, you better make sure it is darn good, and currently the physics of Autocraft are anything but that.At least I got a mild chuckle out of Autocraft when taking roughly ten minutes to build a giraffe, which I then took for a leisurely stroll through the sandbox mode. Seriously, these are the things I would want to do in a crazy building game like this. Huge machines, completely unreasonably flying vehicles and rocket boosted drag racers. Well, you could build rocket boosted drag racers, but Autocraft fails to display any sense of momentum, thus the whole endeavour is actually quite boring.Overall, even in its early access state, I have to say I do not see a bright future for Autocraft. The inconsistencies throughout the game are frustrating and frankly there are too many other good competitors in this genre for Autocraft to take off. The ideas are interesting, but in terms of execution it seems as if the developers are crushed below the weight.			"

								As a STEM specialist, I am always looking for great build-it games. This is REALLY good fun. It's simplicity means there is no choking of the system and in simple terms, it just works!From the moment I started, I was able to build a quick car and drive, all before trying out their own models and then some Workshop ones. A BARGAIN FOR THE FUN, I will be doing a review of this game for my STEM group at school.Superb!!! (I giggled like a little boy again!)			"

								please update a normal mode where you forage materials and mine metals and advance like say 1 wood and 1 iron makes pickaxe on which then you can mine for a stronger material and, this is an idea what will amass a tonne of people metulergy and alloys, oxygen tanks and decompression shelters plants from planets that surport life; that have oxygen like you start on earth and earn resourcers get oxygen tanks and plants for oxygen inside ship, when you do this  it would be nice to make a space ship and fly to another planet. a factor of gravity should be added like on earth its times  1 but on another planet the gravity is weaker and stronger makeing it harder to thrust upwards or easyer(for people who have made a bad spaceship) ,maybe even add in aliens and tech.

								I'll go a bit easy on this game since it is early access. For those who have played Banjo & Kazooie Nuts & Bolts let me just say that this game is a  lot like that. You have to build vehicles in a certain way to complete certain challenges to get more parts for sandbox. The sandbox in this game is a lot like the Test-O-Track, in Nuts & Bolts, you can bring your creations in there, drive around, and cause chaos. Now there are a few problems that i hope the develpers do fix shortly. I just bought this game on February 27th, 2015, i went into sandbox mode and started to build. the only problem was that there was no inventory option, just preset blocks on my hotbar, After that i decided to walk around and i fell off the map and i did not die or respawn i just kept falling and i couldn't even exit the game. Now they just released a short patch and i noticed that they fixed it. there is now a inventory menu and i can now set my hot bar, and i can fall off the map and respawn (not that it really mattered anyway.), But now i can not build any vehicle. there is no grid that appears nor can i take the bolck and put it on the block that is floating in the air above me. Is there something i am doing wrong here? Is my game broken? Whatever the probelm is i would appreciate it if the developers fixed this problem as soon as they can. i also have one suggestion for this ghame and that is to make it a multiplayer game so others can invite friends to their sandbox game. I think that would be a nice addition to the game. Anyway dispite the minor problems this game has, it is a good game and it has a lot of potential and i do see this becoming a successful sandbox game.			"

								This game is totally worth ten bucks as-is, at least on Feb 1 2015! Great optional challenges which don't force you to solve them in order to move on to the next level. Yet for some reason, I've been trying to complete every optional 'star' objective before I do move on, because the puzzles are fair and make you feel smart afterward :) I like that most levels have multiple ways to complete them. A few bonus objectives might feel a bit forced into one solution, given the constraints. If that happens too often, I call it ""guess the dev's solution!!!"" gameplay - luckily this game largely avoids it. Great idea and well executed.			"

								This game has a lot of potential. It has a lot of glitches but if they fix that this game would be so much fun. What elts would be fun is if they added multiplayer to this and you could build viehcals that would fight against each other.			"

								I used to really enjoy this game, and while it is decent, I just can't recommend it.First of all, the game seems to be abandoned, no updates for several months, and the community seems to be quiet too. I really can't say I notice much of a difference between this version and the first version I played back in 2015. It's just another case of an Early Access title being abandoned before full release. It's a shame, I saw a lot of potential in this.Now that I have that out of the way, Let's talk about the pros of this game. First of all, the art style. It's one off the best I've seen in a while, it's very unique, and the simplistic textures are compensated by the good models. The levels are fun, the perfect balance of difficulty. The sandbox is fun for the first few minutes, but gets boring eventually when you run out of ideas. There aren't really enough levels to compensate for that time either.To sum it up:Pros:-Good Art style-Challenging levels-Unique but familiar game mechanics-Wide variety of partsCons:-It appears it's completely abandoned-Sandbox gets boring after a while-There aren't too many levels to compensate for the boring sandbox-The levels are a little repetitive-It doesn't bring anything new to the genreIf you want something like this, get Space Engineers or Kerbal Space Program. They're more expenive, but I'm sure you'll get more hours out of them.			"

								I`d like this game if it didn`t have such a god-awful camera control system, its currently near impossible to get the view to show exactly what you want it to without it either glitching to a screen filling view of the inside of your creation or some random view the game considers to be a default. It becomes so annoying that I end up rage quitting, every time.Just kills the fun for me so, not recommended.			"
