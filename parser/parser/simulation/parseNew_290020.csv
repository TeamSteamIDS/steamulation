								If you want to tinker with robots but don't have £800 to spend on robotics kits and a warehouse to try them out in, get this. No mess, no fuss, no rent-imperiling expense. Be warned: Apparently there are some people who don't enjoy spending two hours tinkering with complex arrangments of logic gates to make a wall-following obstacle-avoiding robot. These people are, of course, utterly mad. This is fun, satisfying, and the very best sort of difficult.			"

								This simulation good .   However you do need knowledge in computer logic.   Though you can learn the basics of NAND, OR and AND logics.   It is steep learning curve to combine so be prepared for frustration getting things right.   If you put the time effort in its rewarding to see your bot achieve the goals.   Its also tricky in the build as it can be little tricky to align the wheels I found even with the help.			"

Early Access Review
								First off I been on Steam for a really long time, and this is the first time I have written a review. Not because this game is better than every other game I have played, but because I feel like there needs to be more people playing this so that it can really go far.This game (if you can call it that, more on that later) might be in Early Access, but it is one of the most complete games I've played in early access. I have only ran into one bug that happened twice in my first 10 hours of game play. That bug being that it crashed when starting the simulation. Otherwise everything works as expected. The reason I would maybe not consider calling this a game is because it’s not designed to be some easy pickup and play. It’s a robot simulator, well maybe not even that. It’s a circuit simulator that happens to have robots.If you don’t understand Boolean operators, AND, OR, NOT, or XOR then this game might not be for you. This really did take me back to basic circuit building.There is only a sandbox piece to the circuit building. To use the robots you have to play through all the levels and unlock the components. Another downside is there is almost no community around this game as of this writing, so if you get stuck on a level your SOL. At least for now, I really hope that changes and we see a bigger community.Go play it! Have fun building and then re-building.			"

Product received for free
Basic InformationTitle:  LogicBotsStatus:  ReleasedDeveloper:  Incandescent Games Publisher:  Incandescent GamesGenre:  3D SimulationRelease Date:  8th of February, 2017Type:  Singleplayer IntroductionIncandescent Games made a hot game for engineering/robotics fans. Pun intended and as far as I’m concerned, LogicBots can be enjoyed even by a “neophyte” such as myself, who would sooner learn a few more foreign languages than pick up a college-grade maths textbook. Yes, I did volunteer to review a game who’s topic doesn’t really fall into my area of expertise, yet I am always eager to learn new things. Exact sciences may be more or less of a mystery for yours truly, yet curiosity could only be sated through a constant push towards bettering oneself. It goes without saying, that the dev team have started off very well with their Steam debut.Story LB cannot really be categorized as a video game with a storyline, since you don’t have a set location, cast of characters or action/intrigue. What you do get though, is an open-ended campaign of sorts, in an undisclosed area and time frame. Creativity plays a secondary role to more in-depth knowledge about electronics. The drones or robots you shall build from scratch, are to be tested around specially conceived tracks within warehouses and you must constrain yourself to a given budget. Success is measured in advancing to bigger facilities and  more equipment at your disposal. So stop looking for a story and enjoy the game regardless. Lots to learn so it might just as well be fun, right?GraphicsFully 3D simulators have been on Steam for many years already. Some look subpar indeed, but fortunately for LogicBots, its dev team skillfully used a handful of assets and they focused on them until you couldn’t complain about any low-res textures or performance issues. Apart from a few typos (such as “fucntional”), I could find no cons to this title's looks. The robot parts, the assembly & testing locations and even the circuit boards you shall wrap your head around, all feature the right amount of details and sufficient feedback, for even the most pretentious of gamers.AudioSounds are a hit & miss, sadly. LogicBots only has a few sound effects and a repetitive soundtrack that shall force you to listen to your own songs soon enough. Or mute the sounds altogether and focus on programming in a quiet environment. I can’t imagine real life engineers listening to elevator music while tinkering away on a contraption or another.GameplayThat’s where LB’s spark is displayed in all its glory. The gameplay is unique since I haven’t had the pleasure before, to step into the virtual shoes of robotics enthusiast outside of a Sci-Fi setting. LogicBots is as grounded into reality as you can expect and by the looks of it, you start out small with seemingly simple designs (consider them highschool projects), only to quickly advance towards drones of a complexity I couldn’t have imagined. And unfortunately, so far we don’t have any flying/hovering blueprints, so all projects shall be land-based and rolling around one wheels of different types.The well-explained tutorials should keep you busy for an hour or two, as you definitely can’t argue with their invaluable help. If you’ve never seen the insides of robot before, you probably can’t reach very far in this game without LB’s tutorials to hold your hand. Don’t even get me started on the circuit programming. If it feels like making/defusing a bomb, you’re on the right track. It’s both complex and as intuitive as it’ll ever get in a video game. I won’t bore you with the details pertaining specific parts, but rest assured that LogicBots is anything but arcade or flimsy. It’s a fleshed out simulator approaching its rarely touched subject, with a user-friendly demeanor and also sufficient complexity without alienating the folks which build such machinery as a real life hobby. Skilled robot assembly and testing, are the ticket to early recognition for many young students and enthusiasts. It is an expensive hobby to boot but as with most things in life, as long as you’re finding peace of mind and pleasure in it, no price is too high. VerdictI sincerely admire those who can create such gizmos in their spare time and out of their own pocket. It shows the kind of dedication to knowledge and constant improvement, that are not that foreign to me, despite my lack of applied technical proficiency. Ambition carries many masks and you cannot disrespect the labour of those which turn notebooks filled to the brim with diagrams and mathematical formulas into something very palpable and ultimately, enjoyable. The muscle has its well defined role, but it shall never hold a candle to the brain. The game is fully worth its price tag. Go buy it.Strong Points+ Pleasant graphics.+ Complex simulation.+ Comprehensive tutorials.+ Steam Achievements, Trading Cards and Workshop support.Weak Points- Limited sound selection.- Still an acquired taste.Rating 90/100  This review was submitted for ReviewExperts, through the generous contribution of Daniël - REX ♥ Gaming.

												I have been considering getting a raspberry pi computer and a robots kit to build a mobile weather station (my own 'Mars rover') just for fun. But I hesitate to spend a couple of hundred dollars on a project that I might not have the talent or persistence to complete. Then I saw logicbots on Steam. For a fraction of the cost of real parts I could practice building robots and circuits before laying down the serious money.   I am only three hours into the game, but I can already see it meets my expectations. The tutorial is a very good introduction to boolean logic and simple circuit board construction. There is an extensive campaign with increasingly challenging tests, and a sandbox mode to just mess around.   Building the robots, and designing the control circuit is very interesting.The robots look realistic, and the building on the circuit boards has a simple but realistic feel. The only thing missing is writing code. The puzzles can all be solved by logic; unlike many puzzle games the difficulty is not created by making you try random guesses. The interface could be a little better designed: it often takes multiple clicks to do what I feel should be acomplished in one. But I haven't encountered any game breaking bugs.I have read several negative reviews that fault the game because there is a small random factor in the tests: what this means is that if you repeat the same test with the same robot you might get different results. This situation is described in the tutorial under the reliability heading, and ways to engineer around it are discussed. The random factor is a deliberate part of the game, to simulate real world situations. In the real world it is almost impossible to control all the variables, so real devices must be over engineered to cope with the unexpected. Personnaly I  like this approach.  This randomness is not just luck, it is a design challenge that can be overcome by careful analysis. However, if you are looking for a strictly mathematical game with no random factors, then you might find this approach to be annoying.I think the game is well worth the price if you are interested in programming and robotics. And much cheaper than the real thing.			"

								Nice game, exactly what i wanted.After a first test I can say the game owns a lot of stuff, although it was released as early access lately.The building part reminds me a bit of Kerbal Space Program and is good. Especially the snap lines are nice to place things exactly.The wiring is fun. If you liked Redstone in Minecraft or know AND / OR Gates anyway, then you can do a lot of stuff. It's a game to think and it's nice to see, if your own solution works.			"

								A very complex robot making game, you will be working with various circuits that do various things. I myself found myself very confused throughout the hour I played and only managed to do the first mission in career mode but the tutorials are very well explained.I give the game an 8/10 for being challenging, confusing but well thought out, it doesn't have the best graphics but it's not meant to, it's meant to deliver a realistic (in a sense) robot building experience and I think it delivers so far.YouTube Video:

								First review I've written, cause I want this game to get more attention. In a way its a successor to the old gem ""Mind Rover"", where one built bots to do various tasks in a similar manner.Th basic premsie is, using boolean logic gates, sensors, motors and various widgets, to accomplish a series of puzzles with robots. The graphics are simple but serviceable, but the audience for the this game is probably not gonna be swayed by the graphics much anyway.Its a fantastic teaching game for those new to propositional logic, and great for all the tinkerers out there. My only complaint, and rumor has it its being worked on, is the interface is a bit clunky. But, for an early access game its remarkably polished, Ive only run into one minor bug so far where it got confused after I deleted a sensor.Anyways, its a great game and logic/teaching toy and I can't wait to see more come out of it.

								At first 20€ seemed too much for this game, because i know a lot of game that cost more and offer less..But when i played the demo, i was convinced 20€ was fine for this game.I would not recommend this game for everyone, but for people who like to build automated stuff and robots and know something about logic gates. But even if you don't know anything about gates, the game teaches you a bit and you will get into it. And one other great thing was, that the developer immediately responded in the steam forum after a bug report.I would recommend you play the demo, and if you like it, buy it. There are many more interesting challenges to come.			"

								What an incredibly fun and addictive game! If you're an engineer, this is a must have. I feel that the user interface is fluid and intuitive, the music is catchy, and the puzzles are damn challenging. Overall, this does not feel like an early access game. That being said, here would be the things I would like to see:-The circuit building is great, but I would like to have a single-click (or hotkey) way to change wire color and see the wire bend when it crosses over another wire. -Once I figured out the snapline feature, the construction building became a breeze. I would like to see a circular snapline so I could place sensors along the turning circle of the bot.-For the simulation, I would like to see both a slow-motion and an even faster ""fast-forward"" button.

												This is not only a great puzzle game but a great way to prototype bot designs.I have built robots powered by Raspberry Pi's, Arduino and Microbit so I have a fair bit of knowledge on how the robots and sensors operate.Playing about with sensor locations in this game gives me an idea of how changes would work on my real world robots without moving parts around / soldering extra sensors etc... I still find this game challenging and this mostly comes from working out how the circuit board components fit together. On some of the more tricky puzzles you get a real sense of achivement when your robot finally completes the challenge.All in all this is the best game I have brought in a while and very close to my personal hobbies.

								This game is enjoyable in its current state.It requires us to think (and not just click everywhere!) to solve the levels which is a good thing :) Design in construction impacts the robot behaviour (for instance: depending on where the wheels are put, the direction of the robot will be different).For people who are not familiar with logic gates, don't worry there is a nice tutorial at the beginning which will help you to understand how it works. ;)It is really a game as you need to take care of your budget in carrier mode, as well as trying to improve trip time for the robot (and total cost). Hope an improvement later will let us compare our data for each level with other players!And according to developer, there will be in a futur a level editor which should give an infinite duration to this game.

Early Access Review
								Now I realize this might have appeal only to a specific demographic, but it's a demographic that's rapidly growing. Do It Yourself hobbies are on the rise and climbing faster everyday. Leading the charge is the world of electronics. I myself am a relatively new inductie. About 8 months ago, while plugging in my phone charger at work, staring at the powerstrip under my desk it occurred to me that I don't know very much about electronics. I consider myself a learned guy, college grad with a degree in philosophy and a view that an education carries far more worth than it's potential monetary value down the line. And I LOVE all things science so to not know much about something so pervasive as electronics didn't sit well at all. Two weeks later, two dozen books later with 1000's of various components bought online and I was well on my way to learning everything I could. The end result, cutting a long story short is that I just finished my first semester back in college working towards a second degree, a B.S. in Nanoelectronics and all this stemming from my plugging in my charger. I mention all this because this game has been exactly the kind of game I've been dreaming/searching for ever since then. I just finished taking DC Circuits, C++ programming and well Chemistry tho that's less applicable here, but after 4 intensive months, I still managed to learn something new within the first two tutorials. But what's more is that it's really damn fun.  I, and I'm sure I'm not a lone, have my fair share of guilt whenever I spend more than a reasonable amount of time, (however we each define it), playing games when I should be learning something, anything. So to have a game that not only challenges/works out our critical thinking, problem solving, analytical reasoning skills, introduces concepts found in electronics, engineering, physics, and programming and is a really fun puzzle game to boot is a win win...win.I especially enjoy the set up to each challenge. ""Here's the course, the problem, challenge, puzzle or what have you, now go make a robot that can maneuver the challenge"". And you're off building, testing, rebuilding then putting together circuit boards utilizing  boolean based logic gates and the like,  having fun all the while. This is the kind of game we should support. Let's be honest, for many of us, gaming is an escape from the world beyond our monitors. And there's nothign wrong with that (in moderation). I admit that's why I game. But we all have to return to the larger world sooner or later so why not taking something away from our time spend in escape? That's my two cents anyhow			"

								What is LogicBots? This is a sandbox simulation where you get to build autonomous robots to multiply and do your bidding. The core gameplay is a huge set of 'levels', each with several potential goals. You review your objective(s), then with a set budget and assortment of bot-bits and coloured wires you set-out to custom-build a bot-to-order. The construction requires both the physical conformation as well as a circuitboard with the logic-gates that define how your bot's inputs manipulate it's outputs. Once you think you've got the right mix of form and function, you press a button and the simulation takes over: your assembled bot is thrown into the level and left to it's own devices.Each level's 'sub-quests' will futher challenge your imagination as you work to improve your bot and are forced to dream of more efficient and clever ways to achieve your goals. If you want to play socially, it's fairly easy to export/import your bots to share with friends - the game generates a PNG thumbnail and XML text file that makes it a snap.Although this game is still in 'beta' it has kept me challenged and engaged for hours on end. While there is a steep learning curve for a person like me, the challenge doesn't become stale. I've always been a fan of sandbox games, so I'm sure I'm a bit biased, but this game has huge potential. The developer is active in the Steam Community forums (Fall 2014) and very responsive to feedback.Undoubtedly worth the current $20 buy-in if you enjoy games that challenge your mind. Heck, you'll save that much in solder and wire after just a few bots!			"

												This is one of the best open-ended puzzle games I have ever played. I might enjoy it even more than the Zachtronics games (SpaceChem, etc.)Granted I already have a lot of experience with logic cirtcuits and can solve these puzzles by doing crazy overkill things like building state machines out of nothing but NAND gates... this experience might not be as enjoyable if you're just learning what a NAND gate is (or heck- maybe it's even more rewarding!). But I'm amazed by how much fun it is to use those skills in this game. It does a great job of removing (almost) all the annoying busywork involved in building something and leaves you with the core of engineering- designing something to solve a problem (including the fine-tuning of your design to handle real-world complexities). The various different goals for cost, speed, and component usage seem well defined and make it enticing to think through several different designs for the same puzzle. This is catnip for engineers. I am very excited for a day when I have kids old enough to understand how to play this. A generation of kids growing up playing games like this would be able to do some scary/amazing things when they're older. I didn't get to learn this stuff until my first year of college!			"

								I'd recommend this game for adults, or persistent teens.  I'm only about 10 levels in.  So far the game does an excellent job of letting you build and run robots through a variety of common obstacle course.  The robots are realistic, meaning you work with the kind of components you'd expect in a school's robotic lab or from an electronic retailer.  Chassis, wheels, various bits of metal beats, sensors, etc.  The logic part is pretty limited, which is part of the challenge: it's quite a bit harder to program collision avoidance with a few basic logic gates than an Arduino.  That's part of the challenge, and if you don't enjoy that, you might not find this as fun as, say, Matlab.  But I'm enjoying it.It isn't yet polished, and I find some of the construction process tricky due to UI limitations ... but I have yet to find an actual bug in the game, which is refreshing.			"

I just got this title a few days ago, but I'm already finding myself staying awake just to try out my latest idea to improve my design or to solve the puzzles with multiple designs. I have yet to try out the sandbox mode, but am really looking forward to it. Great job Incandescent Games for bringing this title to the masses! Thank you!			"

Chassis, wheels, various bits of metal beats, sensors, etc.  The logic part is pretty limited, which is part of the challenge: it's quite a bit harder to program collision avoidance with a few basic logic gates than an Arduino.  That's part of the challenge, and if you don't enjoy that, you might not find this as fun as, say, Matlab.  But I'm enjoying it.It isn't yet polished, and I find some of the construction process tricky due to UI limitations ... but I have yet to find an actual bug in the game, which is refreshing.			"

								This is a better program than I expected, worth every penny. Anyone that's interested in robotics and/or real world logic problems will probably love this. I haven't run across anything like this and just happened to stumble upon it, great surprise.			"

								I have to say that even in Early Access I've been able to enjoy this game, although it's a bit of a struggle for me as I'm not as clever as some of you! Building and wiring a robot can be surprisingly fun. The developer has been active adding new content and upgrading and tweaking (and yes, fixing) the game and at final release it's going to be quite interesting for a lot of folks, although as I said, very challenging. If you liked games like SpaceChem and Infinifactory, download the demo and give it a look.			"

								I really want to like this game but untill the same thing happens every time I hit run I cannot recommend it. Each time you press play the simulation does something different.			"

 It's still getting updates. I love that I can be an engineer.The Game: You can build any kind of robot for fun, for others to download and or to solve puzzle. You have to stay within budget and build a robot that can complete the task.I rate this game 8/10. "

								Warning: Do not get this game... If you have things to do. It will eat up your spare time, and you won't know where it went.If you, like me, find building and programming robots fun, this game is excellent. You are given parts, logic circuits and a budget and with that you need to build a robot for a specific task.Graphics are good, and the simulation of the bot is amazing (to my experience so far).I can not reccomend this game enough. :)			"

								Logic bots is a good game with interesting concept. Although I have to admit that this game is not for everyone, if you like logic puzzles based on some variation of logic gates you'll have a great fun with this game. Levels are original and gameplay is not bad too. The game advanced a huge bit since I first played it and it looks quite promissing.One thing I have to warn you about is that at least at this stage of development you need somewhat stronger PC to have fun without strugling with various defects caused by slow physics processing.

								I'd advise you to view the announcements page before purchasing this game. The recent update removed a bunch of content rather than adding more. It won't be returning for months either. Just like the last patch took so long. This is an early access game but progress is abnormally slow in compairison to other similiar games. It hasn't recieved a content update since I've owned it.

												######Update##############Leaving the original review because while it is outdated towards this game, it still is an issue that makes the difference between a good puzzle game and a bad one.With that said, when I first wrote my review, I did sat I enjoyed the game but could not recomend it due to the fact that you could run the same thing 20x in a row and get 20 different outcomes. Since that time this issue has been fixed and now the simulation is much more reliable thus my change of not recommended to recomended. I never had an issue with the game play itself, it was enjoyable, it was purely the unreliability of the simulation that made this game as good as Bad Ratz, now that that issue seems to be fixed I can give it a reccomendation.###############Original Review#############While the game is fun and interesting to play unfortinatly I can not currently reccomend buying this game. I enjoy these type of games, and this one has potential but with one major turnoff in its current state, the same turnoff that made Bad Rats a bad game... you can run the exact same robot with making zero changes what so ever and get three entirely different results. It seems the calculations are tied to the frame rate, but when VSync enabled still bounces the frame rate between 60-61 (200+ with Vsync disabled) that 1 FPS bouncing back and forth at different times ends up making the same robot without being modified at all do different things each time.If they can get the Bad Rats issue out of this game I would fully recommend it, but when a game about making minor tweaks to fix issues can not even keep the same results when running the same thing over and over it makes it more of a game of luck then of actually making the perfect tweaks.It has potential, it is fun even with that issue, but I just can not recommend it fully until that gets sorted out.
