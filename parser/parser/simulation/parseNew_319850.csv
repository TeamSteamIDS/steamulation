												Bridge Constructor... Yeah it is fun, but highly flawed. You are not really trying to get good at building bridges as much as you are trying to get good at understand the game mechanics. I don't know for sure, but I don't think an engineer would have all that much advantage when playing this. It is fun, but I just think the devs could make it so much better without really adding new content (just changing what is already there). They should:1. Change up the music. It is soooo monotonous after an hour or so. Just have intermittant music if you cannot add any more. 2. Change up the scenery. It is like the same 3 or 4 scenarios for the whole game.3. The roof mechanic is stupid. Just use it less. Why can we not have real elements like wind or weather or something.4. QUANTIFY prices and stress for individual parts. Give numbers to things. They never tell you how much money you have - it is simply a meter that you fill up. What is the exact difference between good wood, rope and logs? Is logs twice as good as lumber, or only 1/3? This stuff matters.The game is relatively short. If you really want this game, get it on sale or in a bundle IMHO.			"

												For the most part it's just a casual bridge builder game. You want to get build a bridge with the materials restrictions given. This requires you to think about the best way to build the bridge without wasting resources.What I liked about this game is that it adds a little bit more to a plain bridge building experience. For most levels you have to get your army across but there are also some variations.  One variation is that you're not only looking to make the bridge hold the load but also shelter your army from incoming boulders. Another variation is that you want the other army almost to get to the other side. This requires you to make a bridge which can almost hold the load.Would advise to buy this when it's at sale. For the regular price it's just a bit light on the gameplay to match the price. Otherwise I'd recommend this nice bridge building puzzle game.			"

												7.9/10 - A More Challenging Bridge Constructor!This game is pretty awesome, but the original is better by a hair! There are some cool innovations in this offering though; there is a story of sorts to follow, the chapters are arranged differently; no longer map style which is unfortunate.This follow-up to the original is also much harder; the difficulty goes from 0-60 quickly. I personally like a slow increase of difficulty; as opposed to jumping right into complex bridges with 50+ pieces. The medieval aspect and different materials indicative of the era were a definite plus!Worth $5; more challenging than the original.

												You wouldn’t trust me to build you a bridge. I just don’t “get” it. I don’t get why criss-crossing planks of wood positioned in a certain way makes a bridge sturdier rather than weighing the whole thing down. It’s a construction technique that I nevertheless had to pick up pretty quickly whilst playing Bridge Constructor Medieval. You play as the “Architect”, the Kingdom’s one and only civil engineer, whose duty it is to produce bridges when asked. It’s a puzzle game, as opposed to a simulation – which explains a lot, as you may be continually baffled by how things remain aloft.Originally a mobile game, Bridge Constructor Medieval, sequel to the somewhat tone-less modern day Bridge Constructor, is a simple affair. The game involves a set of insular, increasingly difficult challenges – physics-puzzles where you’re given a set amount of gold and materials in order to build a bridge safe enough for your Kingdom’s men to cross. Initially there’ll be a lot of horses and carriages meeting their demise, dashed and shattered against cliff faces and rocky gorges below, all due to your shoddy handiwork. Gradually you’ll pick up the techniques required to build the right bridge: one with solid stone foundations, networks of light wooden beams supported by thick, stronger ones, with ropes supporting the entire shoogly mess.For the uninitiated, games like Bridge Constructor Medieval are essentially video game versions of the perennial science class bridge building contest in which contestants seek to build the strongest bridge possible using a specific set of materials. In Bridge Constructor Medieval, this challenge is nested within a medieval theme, meaning players have to build these bridges to send letters to nearby allies, repair passages damaged by siege weapons, etc. Most of these challenges ask players to build bridges strong enough to at least transport a portion of the total goods safely across, though there are additional challenges that push players to spend as few resources as possible while maintaining perfect structural integrity.While playing Bridge Constructor Medieval, players alternate between two modes. In the build mode all action is paused, a grid overlay appears in the level, and it is here that players select materials and lay them out for bridge construction. Once this is done, players can switch to the real time mode in which troops and carriages attempt to cross the bridge. At any time players can pause the action or restart to make adjustments to their bridge, which is a nice touch for anyone looking to make the perfect bridge each and every time.If there was a thing to complain about with Bridge Constructor Medieval, it is the game's relative lack of polish. Despite having unexpected story hooks and a very handy way of highlighting areas of bridge weakness, the game unfortunately doesn't look as good as it could and its controls can definitely take some getting used to. These are relatively minor knocks in the grand scheme of things, but they are worth noting considering there are other games out there that have provided a similar experience without falling short in these departments.The neat thing about Bridge Constructor Medieval is that it offers feedback as you build. When the peasants perform their bridge-crossing, you get to see which parts of your bridge are stressed, and how severely. From there, you can strengthen your supports as necessary – provided you have the budget.Watching the little guys cross your handiwork can be kind of stressful, though. You wind up holding your breath as green supports turn yellow, then red. Sometimes they snap just as your last horse struggles to pull its weight up over the lip of a cliff. Indiana Jones ain’t got nothing on this.Though strengthening your defenses against the barbarians is definitely an interesting addition, Bridge Constructor Medieval is enough like Bridge Constructor that it’s safe to say you won’t find much here if you’re luke-warm about the series. Admittedly, it’s a bit of a bore if you have no interest in engineering. Having to pay for hints (in pieces, no less) with hard currency is also sure to turn off some beginners.It probably says a lot about my skills as a make-believe civil engineer when my favourite segments were the easy bits which rewarded building death traps. Overall though, Bridge Constructor Medieval is still a very solid experience. Fans of bridge building games should definitely check this one out.			"

												Last Thursday Steamified covered the original Bridge Constructor. If you’ll remember (or read the article again or for the first time) you’ll know that I really enjoyed the original. I was really looking forward to playing Bridge Constructor Medieval but I never really knew what to expect. What could the developers at ClockStone make differently enough to keep my attention span long enough? If truth is told there isn’t much different except that the challenge is more difficult. This is both a good thing and a bad thing. I’d recommend to newcomers to the franchise to begin with the original unless they were die hard medieval fantasy fans.One rather nice addition to Medieval is the introduction of a story. Yes, each bridge or puzzle as I like to refer to them as can be played as individual puzzles but there is a story throughout the entire game. It’s a fairly generic story as far as stories go but it fits the game and is a good touch. The story shapes the way in which the different levels are introduced and how they are themed. For example, the game opens with a series of supply missions that you need to complete. Once you’ve done that you then have a boss fight which is essentially an area quiz where you demonstrate a simple – if you’ve been paying attention – piece of bridge construction knowledge. Then the story moves on into the second ‘chapter’ and so on.The focus has clearly been on delivering a more polished experience. There is greater challenge involved. But overall it’s still the same old game that you’re either going to appreciate or decide that it isn’t for you. But I’d like to see as many people as possible give this game and franchise an opportunity if you have yet to do so. I’d ask that you don’t dismiss it out of hand until you’ve at least given it a chance. If it’s not for you then that’s fine but at least you’ve tried.There’s not much to write that I didn’t type out the other day for the original. Similar strengths with similar faults just strengthened and improved with a different setting and coat of paint. A good game that suckered me in more than I thought it was going to.For similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/For our Steam group please join us at http://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamifiedFor our Steam Curation please follow http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Steamified#curation "

It's short though: we beat it with full credit in a few hours (whatever my play time is). I bought it in a bundle on sale and would say grab it under the same conditions.Most of the achievements are gained just through playing, and I managed 100% completion without my difficulty. Doubt there is much replayability here.			"

												It was very joyful playing this wonderful game. It has funny dialogs, it is easy going bridge building and there are challenging budget limits.  Furthermore 3 different game modes involved: normal, protective and destructive. Especially the destructive mode lets you think reverse. You must build a bridge that collapses in that moment when all the enemies are standing on it. Great! They invented the DBMT (deadly bridge military tactics) ...Another best moment in game: I've built a low budget bridge and all my units could pass before it fell apart LOL. Unfortunatelly got stuck later on lvl 4-11. But that forced me instead to figure out a new elegant solution. YAY Feeling now like a real engineer ...

												Cute game, and I swear some of the music was ripped from one of the Anno games. Anyway, it's a simple-seeming enough game till you get in deeper. Then a limited budget requires you to be VERY creative in your bridge design. Not a game for grand designs or to show off artistic flair. It will keep you occupied for a short while, till either you get bored of it or just look at a guide for all the oddball designs on how to beat a stage.Only get this game if it is on sale however, and don't pay more than 5 bucks for it.

												First Impressions:Built a bridge.  It fell down and horse carts fell to their deaths.  10/10.In all seriousness though, it's not a bad puzzle game.  Those who have played bridge constructors before will be able to jump right into this.  For those who haven't, you'll simply be tasked with creating a bridge that can support the weight of medieval soldiers, carts, and etc.  Some extra game modes are available to help mix things up a bit.  Some may think that ten bucks is a bargain while others will opt to wait for a sale...I would have done the latter, but that's only because I don't play these types of games often.  Worth checking out at any rate.

												Easy little game about building bridges.Don't expect anything fancy like real physics, wind, materials and stress they can take. Or good, not repetitive music. Or nice graphics. In fact whole game looks like poor mobile port.Not worth full price (especially because of poor quality) but some game mechanics made it worth to try.I mean - finally somebody thought about giving you task to kill everybody on a bridge. Build it strong enought to convince enemy units that it's safe but in the same time weak enough to collapse when last one will be on your construction. Genius!There are two more game modes. You have to build decent bridges for limited amount of money (nothig new) and protect your units from enemy siege weapons by using roof mechanic (which is stupid but some maps were quite fun and challenging).I can recommend it only for people who like ""bridge building"" games.And chievement hunters (easy to 100%).

												Like the regular Bridge Contructor, you construct bridges. This time you have diffent materials, and wagons and armies instead of cars and trucks crossing the bridge. Puzzles tend to be less challenging than in the modern version, but there's a new type of mission: building bridges that collapse under the enemy armies. Feels more like DLC for the original Bridge constructor, but is fun to play nevertheless.			"

												This Spin-off of the orignal Bridge Constructor is quite a good game but has a compared to the 2 other bridge constructor games a lower difficulty and a far shorter content.Instead of cars and (tank) trucks - now knights and ox carts cross the bridges you've built.The most notable difference to the other games of the series is that, 2 new ""modes"" have been introduced. - There are levels were your bridge is bombarded by catapults- There are levels were the enemy crosses your bridge and it has ideally collapse in the last moment to get rid of them.The new game modes fit flawlessly into the good working mechanics and the replaced materials (wood plank, tree trunk, rope, stone) behave reasonable.Be aware that as a bridge constructor veteran you will only need 3-4 hours to beat all challenges.I would recommend the game to fans of the series and especially to younger ""engineers"", as the presentation of the though engineering background is not that obvious and dry as in the other games of this franchise.

												This may seem like a fun game with many ways to complete a level, but the truth is that creativity is very much limited. The placement of support joints is very restricted and many times, joints/lashings will refuse to connect to each other, forcing the player to abandon logic and basically build the bridge the way the game intended it to be built. Overall this game ends up frustrating because it takes away our freedom to build creatively, and forces us to use the same designs to succeed. Only buy this at 90% off.			"

												Bridge constructor medieval is a port of mobile games where you construct bridges using different materials, wood, bigger wood, rope, stone and wooden roofs.... to secure passage of the king's army, or in some levels lure the enemy troops into your unstable bridge and to their death.There's 4 chapters with 7 to 10 levels each worth 2-3 hours of gameplay tops, the game is quite easy to complete, unless you're going for the crowns, crowns are rewarded for completing the special quota, spend less than X , or kill Y amount of troops.Some of the levels require you constructing a bridge for your troops to cross, others like i explained before to lure the enemy into a trap, and finnaly a bridge with a roof to avoid catapults obliterating your army, those are the hardest.you control everything with the mouse or you can use the keyboard for hotkeys, but the only way to deselect the material you're using is to right click which causes to destroy the part of the bridge your mouse is touching, awful game design.The soundtrack is bad you end up listening the same ost for hours.Game is not worth the full price even for simulator lovers, wait for a bundle it has already been in one or a 50%+ discount sale.

""Bridge Constructor: Medieval"" is a great little ""bridge builder"" game, and a little more polished than the preceding ""Bridge Constructor"" game and also adds a few little twists.In addition to the traditional levels where you simply build a bridge across the gap, there are new challenges where you are to reinforce an existing bridge to make it withstand boulders slamming against it, and also to add a cover to the bridge to protect the crossers.  Other new challenges have you build a bridge that is designed to collapse under the weight of the advancing enemy army.  If your bridge collapses too soon, they turn around -- collapse too late, and some of the army still makes it across.  It was a nice challenge to get it collapse at ""just"" the write time!I also like how the ""Crown"" challenges were implemented in the game of reaching the advanced goal, such as building the bridge under even lower cost, or destroying the entire advancing army and not just a smaller number of them.I set out to achieve all the Crowns from the beginning and it took me close to 7 hours to achieve 100% of the achievements per Steam.All in all, a better bridge builder than its ""Bridge Constructor"" predecessor and certainly worthwhile if you like the genre.  8 out 10.

												Just not fun. You don't really get to build any crazy or wildly designed bridges, while at the same time, you are hamstrung by resources even when you are trying to build a simple and practical bridge. I get that it is a puzzle game but it would have been more fun if it was about finding a way to surpass an obstacle, rather than figure out how the developers want me to construct the bridge using the fewest and cheapest materials. Pros - RUNS GREAT!Cons -  No creative solutions to levels Verdict - I don't recommend it. It's probably no the game you think/hope it is.			"

												Not really sure if I would recommend this game as it is.. They really need to improve the physics on this game... Not once or twice, I've built bridges that should withstand the load of the current level. Kept running the levels and the bridges kept on tumbling down for no logical reason and after ~10 tries (without altering the bridge at all) the bridge did withstand the level as it should have.But I suppose if youre not like me and get annoyed in games like these by random occurances you just might enjoy this game.

												Why is this awesome? Because you have mission where you build the bridges as traps and your goal is to let the bridge collapse beneath the enemies' feet at the right moment.10/10 would build unstable bridges again.			"

												just another bridge builder?yes.and no!the medieval theme adds some new aspects and nice features to the game.  some bridges need a sturdy roof to protect your troops from enemy catapult fire while they cross the gap on your construction. some bridges are supposed to crash on purpose to take down they enemy troops.this one even has some kind of cute story and is not just plain clicking for hours and hours.speaking of hours, it took me 4 hours to 100% complete the game. even though i came up with all solutions myself. well, one time i had too peek at a guide but that bridge was really hideous. you will know it when you see it.all in all it was a nice game but felt kind of short.

												Its another bridge constructor this time with trebuchets (incoming only sadly). I think I might have liked the original better because it allowed for sloped bridges which was fun and added some extra challenge I thought. This one tries to make up for it with new modes and has a better (or really at all) story as you take on the role of the royal architect during an attack on the kingdom. You have to build 3 different kinds of bridges, regular bridges, roofed bridges that can withstand flying boulders, and booby trap bridges designed to collapse but not until all the enemies are on them.My biggest gripe though is the inconsistency in the physics. Some designs will work one time and fail another with the exact same design. Sometimes a unit will make it across a bridge thats startign to crumble, other times it wont. Sometimes a bridge will collapse and sometimes it wont. I noticed that if i scroll between my virtual desktops causing CPU load to climb it seems to make the physics run in a more shallow iteration, its possible this could be advantageous to someone stuck on a challenge I guess but it was just kind of annoying to have a design fail then spend 15 minutes messing around changing it only to find that the original was actually perfectly functional and I had an unlucky run the first time.

(Not Quite)Built for a KingReview written after recieving all achievementsFor a bridge building game, this one is overall underwhelming.  It doesnt look good, the building is slow and tedious if you are trying to complete the game, and it feels random on some levels whether or not your little construction stands.  It is not interesting or fun for me to play (though you may be different) and it takes far too long to actually complete some of the bridges (not due to it being hard, but being hard to build with the tools provided)There are interesting levels though. Later in the game there are a few that you have to build which you must design to break after a certain point, as to plung your enemies to their doom.But over all it's not worth the buy, or the play unless you are a big bridge builder fan or got it as part of a bundle. If you like numbers its a:   3/10 "

												This game is something you can get a better, free version of on almost any flash game website.My main problem with this game other than there being better, free games in this genre is there seems to be no rhyme or reason to what part of your bridge breaks. Parts will just randomly explode for seeming no reason, even when the nearest thing on the bridge is in an entirely different, unconnected in any way, section.Also it doesn't have audio settings which is a minor thing considering the nature and genre of the game, but I wanted to turn the music off and listen to a podcast while still having the sound effects of the bridge breaking and other things.I don't like writing reviews this short but there's really nothing else to go over.

												If you are looking at these reviews because the game is on sale, or in a bundle, and you are considering getting this game, I would just go ahead and do it. I would guess you could get a solid 5-15 hours of gameplay out of the game, depending on how quickly you catch on to the tricks. I clocked in right around 10 hours, which I am guessing is about average. You'll find yourself annoyed from time to time as you struggle to get the cost of the bridge under budget for the crown, but it's quite enjoyable to watch the support structure get deep, deep red, but still hold. I probably wouldn't pay full price, given the natural lack of replayability, but certainly worth it on sale. Very enjoyable game.			"

Music and graphics while not particularly important to this genre are pleasant enough and the cameo dialogues between scenarios are amusing enough even if irrelevant.Game features several different puzzle types and these vary in challange over the course of the campaign... missions are sequential and require unlocking by beating previous challange.Steam acheivements and graded success offers additional challange.Gameplay wise each scenario is a fixed puzzle but with more than one working solution. Design and simulation are seperated with no time limits or punishment for failure allowing one to watch and tweak their design and the visual stress mechanics allows one to easily see where the forces are being applied and which areas of the design are failing/strong.Each scenario remembers the last design used, has a limited number of design saves and an easy reset for clearing the screen quickly if starting again from scratch. The first few missions/scenarios serve as a tutorial but don't reveal all of the tips n tricks.			"

												Have you ever wanted to be an engineer in medieval times? But you are not old enough for it?Have you ever wanted to do something else than math in math lesson? But didnt know what to do?Then you came to the right place. This game is the most hardcore bridge sim you can get, where you have to make bridges for your king, so that you can get supplies up and running under the ongoing war! This game is good for boredom, and has a somewhat fine story. I would recommend it. Plus, you learn principles about building bridges (HINT: You need that if you want to be an engineer or stuff like that), although it may not be a good way to educate future engies :/ But anyway, if you can get this a bit cheaper than the 10 euro it costs, then go ahead! :D			"

												Sequel to the Bridge Constructor.This version introduced a mode where your bridges must break apart at a certain point of crossing. This mode began to expose the inconsistencies in the physics engine as you had to build precarious bridges that were under tight tension. This resulted in different results when running the simulations over and over again.This version also removed sloping ramps and much of the freedom to be creative... ie jumping cars and stunts. It also had the same building toolset from it's prequel. The combination of these two game decisions resulted in very rigid answers for the later puzzles causing fustration due to lack of ramping up in building experience. Some solutions near the end required meticulous understanding of the support structures which, in my opinion, were very hard for the casual player.7/10.			"

												A competent bridge building game with a twist.Besides the usual mechanics of bridge building, this game has two other variants, one with the bridge under bombardment  from catapults and an other where you have to make sure the bridge collapses when all the enemies are on it. Budget restrictions are also an added challenge.Some levels are quite difficult, but I believe there are many ways around the problems presented and even using different materials.Unfortunately the shortness of the game makes me only recommend it when at least at half-price.

												Loved this game. It seems to be fairly limited as far as replay value, But after finishing all the puzzles, I am still interested in going back and seeing what other types of crazy new bridge designs I can play around with. I would definitely recommend anyone looking for a causal game.			"

												Good bridge constructor.Although the story is not the best (but that is not the most important part of the game).The important thing about games like this is that the physics seem credible... and they do :)The only problem I had with this game was that on a few occasions it made the video driver crash and reboot. But I still enjoyed the game.			"

												I posted a review on the original Bridge Constructor but I wanted to say here that, while this version is superior and more varied with more work going into the campaign, the game really avoids giving you detailed info on load distribution, helpful suggestions, and strong ways to build structures when one side has extra support points to build from. It would be great if the designers gave users a little more credit and allowed a detailed/advanced mode which showed where the load was moving from to where and why some joints pop before others, better instruction to bridge-building noobs like me, and some better ways to think about building complex structures.

												The concept is simple and has been used over a hundred times even in browser games. However Bridge Constructor Medieval is still a fun game to play when you've got nothing better to do. There is something very satisfiying in watching your army cross a bridge you've just build, expecialy if it took a lot of times to do it. I do have to mention that the game does not only have one game objective, different levels can have different objectives (for example the bridge has to crash when all the enemies are on it or that the enemies are catapulting boulders at it). I've gotten the game in a bundle and it has brought to life the architect in me.7/10			"

												Would recommend for anyone who likes to work their way through a series of fixed challenge puzzles in a casual environment.Simplistic design but easy to use interface and varied challange. Music and graphics while not particularly important to this genre are pleasant enough and the cameo dialogues between scenarios are amusing enough even if irrelevant.Game features several different puzzle types and these vary in challange over the course of the campaign... missions are sequential and require unlocking by beating previous challange.Steam acheivements and graded success offers additional challange.Gameplay wise each scenario is a fixed puzzle but with more than one working solution. Design and simulation are seperated with no time limits or punishment for failure allowing one to watch and tweak their design and the visual stress mechanics allows one to easily see where the forces are being applied and which areas of the design are failing/strong.Each scenario remembers the last design used, has a limited number of design saves and an easy reset for clearing the screen quickly if starting again from scratch. The first few missions/scenarios serve as a tutorial but don't reveal all of the tips n tricks.			"

												This is the first bridge construction game I've ever played. At first I was really confused since the game dosen't give you that much tutorials to start with. But I played around with the game and tested several things (protip: look at actual bridges to get the idea). Now I'll quit my job and start making bridges instead! 11/9 would build another bridge.

												Surprisingly good!The physics implementation is great, weight distribution, solidity of each component, different kinds of bridge architectures, from wires to suspended structures... it's all there.The puzzles are easy to solve, BUT harder to master (doing it under a certein budget).Only thing missing? A ""burning bridges"" achievement. If you like games that make you think (problem solving), get this.			"
