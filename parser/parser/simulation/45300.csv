												Wings of Prey is comparable to that hot girl you had a crush on in high school. She was beautiful, the game is gorgeous. She had such elegance; WoP is very polished as a game. She has these abundance of little quirks (twirling hair, giggle, etc) that made you go wild, WoP has features to drool for (storyline, video replay, squadron control, etc). Then one day you just don’t get excited to spend time together anymore, the romance fades, you realize she has no personality and is becoming obnoxious with her emotional issues. The replay ability is lost, you get frustrated with the poor aerial match-ups, there is no customization or sand box mode, and your AI enemies always seem to defy the laws of physics. But no matter what, it was a fun ride while it lasted. 80%			"

												I am not marking this review as negative for the game itself.  I enjoy playing it.I am marking this review negative to warn the masses about the DLC.  It can't be used, Yuplay are no more and although Gaijin have taken the rights, the WOP launcher still wants to connect to a YUPLAY account.The DLC can not be used witout being looged in to a Yuplay account, which now is impossible.  Valve need to either remove the DLC from thier store post-haste, or strip WOP of the now defunct Yuplay DRM and add Steamworks so the DLC is playable.  Otherwise I have to go to Gaijin website and buy the game + DLC again just  to play the DLC I bought on Steam in the first place, and can't use.Let the Buyer Beware, the DLC is currently a scam!

												I had the game for 360 but decided to get it for PC so I can use my flightstick (Thrustmaster [that's what she said] HOTAS X) So far I have yet to notice a difference in gameplay. However, the graphics look really great, I have it on ultra-turbo-awesome and it's very noticeably different from 360.The best part is the immense configurability for joysticks. It's so good that I spent the first 45 minutes just making small changes to the layouts, including sensitivity of axes, deadzones, and non-linearity. With a little effort, you can get your dream control scheme on any joystick.All this for $10 is a solid deal in my opinion. Will update if anything changes (about halfway through campaign so far)			"

												If you're looking for a flight simulator game, but without all the fuss, and good keyboard/mouse controls, then I can highly recommend this game.Training mode is very open and pretty much lets you do whatever you want - be that combating other fighters, or flying under low bridges in a bomber.Unfortunaly there doesn't seem to be much of a mod scene, but overall I can highly recommend this game.

												I hadn't played this game for quite a while, but recently I did a major PC upgrade and reinstalled it.  I had forgotten what a fun little game this is.  It really sucks that the multiplayer is degraded, but it is still fun.If you are looking for a high fidelity sim then look elsewhere.  This is not a study sim like Falcon 4, DCS A-10C, or the IL-2 Series.  It is a bit arcadey but the physics are fairly responsive and realistic and the visuals are outstanding.  Campaign missions flow in their own way, and you get to experience several different sides to WW2 flying.  With the addition of the Luftaffe DLC it seems to provide a reasonable all round experience.Combat is a bit arcadey with fairly predictable AI and an overwhelming urge to be the lone saviour of every battle.  It is, however, easy to task wingmen to perform essential roles thus relieving you of the burden of the missio0n so you can go round shooting everything that flies :-).  As for controls, being a bit of a flight sim nutter, I used one of my simple joysticks with no issues. I cannot comment on any other control method as I have not tried them and don't really intend to.  Joystick was simple to set up and allowed me to use almost every function from the stick without having to resort ot the keyboard very often at all.All in all this is an enjoyable semi-sim.  I would recommend it if you want an easy to get into light sim.  For a flight sim nut...probably not unless you are looking for an entertaining session of blowing s**t up.			"

												A cool game at first, but ultimately it runs into a progression brick wall during a certain Stalingrad mission that was just impossible for me to beat no matter how hard I tried. I -really- liked this game until that point, but once that happened.... no. I later tried to get this game installed to give it another try, but the game outright didn't work anymore. So for that, this game is a solid ""no"" from me.But... these are the same devs behind War Thunder, and much of what was in this game has carried over into the single-player missions found in that game. So really this game is entirely uneccesary anyway since WT is free and isn't broken. So if you really want to play a WW2 plane game, play that instead. Or something else. Just not this.			"

												NOTE: This is coming from a joystick/throttle/trackir user who mainly flies in Sim mode, running Windows 10.I've owned this game for a few years but never really spent much time playing it after my first big marathon. Why is that, you may ask? Well, back when I was using a mouse and keyboard setup, the game was playable but ultimately boring. But more about that in the pros vs. cons of this game.Pros:-The game is rather pretty for when it was released, the plane models are seemingly pretty detailed and the ground clutter is realistic for the period.-The planes all handle quite differently, depending on their size and weight.-The scenarios presented are quite good overall from a design standpoint, and the map really helps out with finding objectives without HUD markers.-The videos between campaign section were a nice touch, too bad the voice acting was pretty mediocre at best.-Many of the sound effects got carried over to War Thunder, which says something about them I would think.Cons:-There were quite a few either frustratingly hard or mind-numbingly dull missions included in the mix (even on lower difficulty settings), which while realistic are not exactly what one looks for when using a joystick. Simple missions can be difficult enough as-is, adding a timer generally doesn't help make it more fun.-The damage model is extremely arcade-like in that getting just a few hits on planes snaps off a wingtip or sets it on fire in a Michael Bay-esque explosion.  Totally Realistic-I had an issue where the game would freeze except in menus whenever it was minimized with a mouse click on my secondary monitor, or if I Alt-Tabbed out of it to do something else. It would force me to restart the game, which leads into my next issue.-Having to use the game through YuPlay is annoying at best, as you aren't registered as quitting out of the game unless you find YuPlay in your toolbar and exit out of it AFTER exiting the game. Whenever it would crash or quit out, having this extra step is frustrating considering the GoG version is DRM-free. (And comes with the Luftwaffe DLC to boot.)-The game has a lot of issues with controllers outside of the range that it supports natively. My X-56 is not on the list and the controls will get switched around seemingly at random almost every time the game is started up. For example, one button on my joystick is meant for turning the gunsight on and off, but after a few days, it was suddenly a part of the radio comms. At this rate, keeping the controls set up is just too much effort to bother with anymore.-As well, TrackIR's field of view feels zoomed in when in use, and there is no way to reset the zoom axis for TrackIR in the game. This can make tracking targets a lot harder than necessary.-Lastly, the diluted color filter on everything is a bit ugly in my opinion. I understand that they are trying to get a ""noir"" look to the game with it, but it'd be nice to be able to disable it. Shades of brown and grey get old very quickly.So, would I recommend this game to the average gamer? In this day and age, no, not really. This game is essentially an older, single-player War Thunder, which isn't F2P and has worse compatibility with modern systems.For a relative simmer like myself? Again, no. The game has some odd quirks with using newer joysticks and TrackIR, which cause enough problems to be off-putting even when they do work.If this game were to recieve some updates to add in this content and fixes, then it would probably be recommended. But in its present form, sadly it's a negatory, ghost rider.			"

												If you are a WW II fan, you must owe this flying simulator. The graphic are stunning and gorgeous. You really feel like you are in a cocpit of a Spitfire or a Hurricane. There is no story or that kind of stuff, which is a pitty. Nevertheless, the battles are epic and playing this game even on realism is prety challenging. A JOYSTICK is a ""MUST-NEED"". I don't find it that entertaining without a joystick.Overall, a MUST BUY for a WW II flying fan :-)			"

												Brief summary of Wings of Prey:A ""Holywood"" flight combat sim. Looks and sounds great, exciting to play, but lacks in mission design, AI and flight model.+Lots of missions and planes.+Great visuals. Variety of day/night and weather conditions. Nice effects: glare, cockpit scratches, damage (bullet holes, damaged ailerons, broken gauges etc.). Cockpits look great.+Immersive 5.1 sound.-Some of the missions in the campaign are frustratingly difficult. Some are bugged (e.g. objectives not triggering correctly).-Stalls are a bit unrealistic.-Poor documentation: Some things are never explained, like how the I-16 engine will die if you pull negative Gs, or how to use propeller pitch and radiator.-Haven't played MP, but looks like online is basically dead.~TrackIR is a big advantage, both for watching your six in dogfights and for spotting ground targets.~Joystick (preferably HOTAS) is a must. Gamepad or keyboard+mouse won't cut it.			"

												By default Wings of Prey is lacking. Not only is the multiplayer now obsolete (thanks in part to Gaijin's recent F2P release in WarThunder) but Wings of Prey requires the use of an external client in Yuplay which doesn't like Steam all that much. Aside from this Wings of Prey itself is a fairly by the numbers flight sim, only surpassing its competitors for visual fidelity. While Wings of Prey supports many different controller inputs, including flightsticks, the feel of the controls themselves aren't as smooth as you might hope. The single-player modes offered in this release also underwhelm for having little consistency or flow between levels and the challenge delivered, regardless of adjustable simulation settings and respawn options. Voice acting likewise varies in that English dialogue is exceedingly poor, even though native dialects sound as they should (e.g. Russian radio chatter). Don't get this game, stick to Aces High or any of the older IL-2 titles.			"

												after giving the game some time to rest from my firehot hands, it'd thought, ""let's see if those wings have cooled down enough already"", so i started up the game .. nothingit said ""running"" in steam but nothing happenend, no window, nada .. only hat first popup came that gives the key; which i said to ""don't show me anymore""so next time i try no key popping up, and no other things happening either... so i did a filecheck on the game.After 12gb of integrity checking it seemed that it neded to redownload 726 bytes, very creepy 726 bytes because after that the game still looked like a zombie; it didn't react to anything..so now i'm at the point of just removing the game altogether; progress is saved in my savegames afaik But then at least things can be done over completely and the chance for error will be much smaller (if i ever get to reinstall the game, i still got a 'to play' backlog from over a thousand games).i would've recommend this game if it'd kept working after going from windows nt 6.1 (win7) to windows nt 6.3 (win10) but it just fails to do so...

												Wings of Prey is a graphical upgrade over Il-2 Sturmovik (albeit neither a sequel to that game nor not made by the same developer), but lacks the breadth of content, realism, and general appeal of that definitive flight simulator. It is, in sum, a very average title. This is a true shame, as bonafide---as opposed to the smattering of $10 titles out there---World War II flight simulators are rare. It's sad to see a major title fall by the wayside like this.Buy it on sale if you're a flight sim junkie, but don't expect to be wowed by it.(Note: I have not actually played 100+ hours of this. For some odd reason, Steam several times considered the game to still be open for a long while after I had exited it.)			"

												Wings of Prey is a lot more accessable than the IL-2 series and allows you to get into the game and action alot more quickly.WoP features a ton of highly detailed aircraft that include cockpits, plus missions / gameplay spanning many combat theatres to match. There is plenty to do here in single-player, plus standard online multiplayer modes are included as well. I've gotten 100+ gameplay hours out of WoP so far.However compared to its rivals, there are a few things lacking, notably no mission editor so you are limited beyond the missions offered and there have been some issues with multiplayer recently as support has been dropped in favour of its multiplayer-oriented sequal War Thunder. Despite this WoP is a really great title and frankly if your into WW2 flight games you shouldn't pass up on this (even for just the single-player), however hardcore simulation fans will fill more at home sticking with the IL-2 series.

												Wings of Prey is a hybrid between a flight sim and arcade turret game. The controls are a tad complicated and missions can be repetitive; But if you're willing stick with it, there are a few fun moments in the game. A warning though, you won't be able to finish the game as the last few missions are completely bugged and broken.PROS-The planes are very pretty, you can see the damage sustained on the plane when you are hit.-A lot of planes available, each feel slightly different from each other.CONS-many planes are only available in multiplayer-Missions are repetitive-The voice overs made me want to shoot myself.-Textures on the terrain can look very ugly.-There is a lot of waiting time during missions before any action happensRating: 6.9/10			"

It has a simulator part of the game for all those hardcore fighters. but it has a arcade style gameplay that is very fun and addicting. It can take some time to get used to the controls. This is a great game if you have a gamepad or a flight stick. I play this with a xbox controller and its really easy to fly with. The online portion of the game is still active and fun. The single player lets you take off each mission from the ground if you so choose. The graphics are pretty in this game. The sights and sounds make this game very enjoyable to play. I would totally suggest getting this game if you ever have the chance to see it on sale. I loved playing it and it is one of my favorite sim / arcade style flight fighting games!!			"

												Had a great fun playing this game!The plying thechinque is not to hard - this is not a simulator but also doesn't make you feel like you are playing an action game. It does take some time and skill to fly right.The battles are really breathtaking, the graphics are amazing.One issue I've encountered - In the demo version, the destruction engine was working really well - after every fight you could see a lot of damage on your aircraft. I don't know why, but in the full version it seems that the destruction engine doesn't work as well as in the demo. I've searched in the options menu but never found the soultion for that.It would be great if someone here could help me out with that :)Overall - 92/100.			"

												This game is really a lot of fun, especially when you crank the graphics up.  It allows you to enable/disable features that change the difficulty of the game, so you can pick it up a lot quicker.  I ended up playing it (and enjoying the heck out of it) with a keyboard, but I think a joystick would make it that much more immersive.

												I give this game a 1.5 thumbs up with an asterick.  Do not try to play above arcade difficulty unless you have a joystick with some sort of fight feedback.  Without that tactile response, it's far to easy to bank yourself into a flat spin without even realizing it.That said, arcade difficulty is a ton of fun.  Lots of missions, a substantial campaign that covers the three major allies, and - if you have the proper equipment, the ability to play it with simulation-level controls.			"

												Buggy pile of crap. You must log in every time to the yuplay services to play even campaign missions, which, even if you save your login information, must be done every time the game is launched. Then after you exit the game yuplay keeps running which makes steam think the game is still going so if you try to launch it again, it will fail. To get the game to relaunch you have to close yuplay in the task manager every time. Launch game in steam, click login in bottom left of launcher, type in login info, launch game, play, exit, if you don't log off or restart your computer, ctrl alt delete, end yuplay process, repeat.Now for the game itself, the voice acting is horrid, and the end of missions bug out every time. I try landing at the airfields the mission tells me to and nothing happens, so I usually end up having to fly the plane into the ground blowing it up before the cutscene takes over. For the first few missions it played out like some incompetent British Airmen that couldn't go a single flight without wrecking his plane, even if it was flying to the end of a runway, after successfully coming to a stop, and slamming into a row of trees.

												People comparing this as a single player version of war thunder need to realise that war thunder is actually a progression of wings of prey. It doesn't claim to be a full air combat simulator, and i'm glad it's not. i don't want to remember 107 keys to fly a plane, real pilots don't! They have buttons or displays that are placed around the pilot to be easily accessible. Real sim's are a boring, clumbsy, awkard experience to say the least. if you want a good balance between sim and arcade. this fills the gap.Considering it was released in 2009 the graphics engine still puts most modern attempts to shame.

												For a flight sim this one is quite alright. It looks and plays great, and, well, I don't actually know what else to tell you. You err... fly around, shooting enemies or objects. That's the general idea. The fun wears off after a few hours though, since that's all you do. There's little variation. Unless you're a die hard flight sim fan you might want to wait for it to drop in price.[Rating: 76/100]			"

												Finally a combat flight simulation that offers a realistic mode and also a casual mode for groundhogs like me. Playing on realistic is a challenge, as you can easily stall and crash, but it seems as close to the real thing as you can get in front of a screen. Can be used without a flight stick, but of course using one is heavily recommended.I thought I would never enjoy another WW2 game, as the topic has been abused ad nauseam. But this one is worth playing even if the mention of WW2 usually has you running in the other direction at escape velocity.			"

												What I believe sets ""Wings of Prey"" apart from other aerial combats is not only the historical significance of each battle and the planes used, but also their ability to design a scenario that suits almost every plane-gamer's ideal fighting style. The difficulty levels are not toggled by bullet-damage and AI intelligence, rather, it's toggled by turning on and off features that increase or decrease the difficulty of controlling a virtual plane. Although I wish that graphics were rendered to be slightly more realistic (ground isn't rendered at times, bad quality, clouds are static and non-immersive), Wings of Prey is still a well-designed game suitable for all levels of flight combat simulation.

												I would go as far as saying that Wings of Prey is not a simulator despite being advertised as such. Visuals in the game are great, but it plays more like an arcade shooter than a serious attempt at a combat simulator. It is not, however, all bad. Simulator styled cockpit view coupled with arcade-ish gameplay allows for greater ""ace pilot"" feel, since you'll be spending more time in the cockpit shooting at enemies, than floating slowly towards the ground with a parachute.I would recommend this game to anyone who has maybe felt dissappointed after having a shot at IL-2 or other more realistic sims, and ended up on the ground in flames one too many times.

												When I first played this I thought it was the best  fighter based flight game  going.  Much better than HawX, and   streets ahead of games like Sturmovik.  It's still a  great game, but it has been superceeded by   newer titles such as the Digital Combat Simulator A-10C Warthog.  Still, this game  is exhilarating to play , challenging to complete all the missions and ithe ground   looks superb from the air;   even  when flying quite close to the ground.  It's the first    game  I remember playing where you could actually  see  shadows cast by buildings and trees as opposed to the ground being a flat photo (or, in the case of   an old favorite of mine the F19  a flat  featurless plane with the odd  vertex shape denoting hills and valleys and  line diagrams for bridges and other targets), and from a suitable height  Wings of Prey looks almost real.

												I don't usually write reviews. This called for it though. There is a game called Birds of steel on xbox 360. It is basically the same game. Except in this game ( wings of prey ) the A.I. is ridiculous. I loved Birds of steel. It was such a good ww2 fighter sim. In this, you will be one of 50 allied forces flying around or floating below, and the A.I. will only aim at you. And your friendly A.I. do not do a good job of watching your back. While it takes 50 hits to kill an enemy plane, one shot will kill your weak bird. So if you can imagine being in a war except every enemy soldier only has the capability to aim at you and only you, then you can imagine this game. I played on realistic difficulty there is a degree higher called simulator which has more controls to pay attention to and enemy planes have no markers. It's not even worth it when on realistic it is IMPOSSIBLE to pass a lot of these mission without dying. Literally impossible. You will never stand a chance against 20 enemy forces who can only aim at you and no one else on the battlefield. It was fun for a minute but then it just got frustrating. Seriously frustrating. I wish it were more like Birds of steel.			"

												Do not buy! Wings of Prey has atrocious copy protection and account registration/multiplayer interface. It requires you to create multiple accounts and install multiple multiplayer 'services' before it'll even let you near the main menu. I gave up after spending over an hour trying to get 'set up' and I think I saw the main menu once. Tossing the game out as a total loss. Repeat, do not buy!			"

												This is an early version of the game WAR THUNDER by Gaijin. It wasn't bad but it isn't no diffrent than WAR THUNDER. If you try to play it by mouse and keyboard it is impossible as the keys are every where, then if you hook up a stick you have to spend forever adjusting the senitivity to who you want it. Which is what I dodn't want to do I want to be able to launch the game and play with out having to spend forever editing controls.Then you can't do Multiplayer any more which is miss leading as steam lists it as having multiplayer (Yucan'tPlay).Inother words don't buy this game just go and play WAR THUNDER if you want a gaijin game.

												Regretfully I will have to give this game a negative review. (Keeping in mind I used a keyboard and mouse, and flight games are not my usual genre..)Here are the reasons why: -Good usage of videos for campaign, but horrible voiceacting, and ultimately it is a bore.-Horrible bombing. Must switch views and look around constantly.-I appreciate the ""realism"" of the game, but 2 shot kills in realistic mode suck when you get poppped out of nowhere, and its hard to move and look around from cockpit, and endless stalling make the controls irritating. It is hard to turn even remotely sharply without stalling, which slows the game down to a bore.-I found it particularly difficult to shoot down aitcraft sometimes, and it appears that the enemy planes are not subjected to the same irritating stalls.-Sometimes enemies seemed to ""run away"" and it felt unnatural.-Massive progression wall on one level, approx 20 percent through game. (Then boring after it)-DRM is broken.I must admit, I really enjoyed flight simulator.. but didnt enjoy this game for very long. "

												STAY AWAY FROM THIS STEAMING PILE OF ♥♥♥♥.While the gameplay itself is actually pretty good, the multiplayer is utter garbage.  The activation process is a form of slow torture thanks to the required yu(can't)Play client that must be running for activation (which is coded by 8 year old monkies), but unfortunately, when you try to activate the game (and any DLCs), the game 'locks' as it waits for the client to pop up the activation window, which can't come to the foreground because the game is locked because it is waiting for the client.Don't bother trying to contact support, I'm pretty sure it doesn't exist except as a mailbox that no one actually looks at.Also, browsing the multiplayer server list brings up an empty page.  Which means either the game is not retrieving server information, or there are actually no games taking place (likely due to the client being utter feces).  Either way, there is effectively no multiplayer in this game due to garbage code.Save your money.			"

												The graphics for Wings of Prey are absolutely spectacular--very impressive. Unfortunately, I don't have a lot of experience with combat flight simulator type games so I'm not sure if they just inherently play slow--very few moments of intensity surrounded by hours of boredom.

												first ever steam game purchased. real dissapointment too. this game was nowhere near as good as its predecessor. it had great graphics, and thats about it. all planes feel like they have no power at all, which is stupid as these were lightweight fighter planes with immensely powerful engines. then you have the realism problem. in IL-2 1942 you could land literally anywhere without getting automatically blown up. in 1942, if you crash landed it showed you the full crash land and then allowed you to warp to a different still flying aircraft. in this game, if you crash land itas automatically a game over. 4/10 game that had the potential to be a 10/10 game.

												WoP has good enough graphics and physics to not distract you while playing.  You can play in arcade, realistic, or simulator mode of which it is only fun to play in arcade mode because the enemies in realistic and simulator modes are way better than you are without putting 600 hours into the game.  Also, setting up the controls takes a long time, probably took about 3 hours of pausing the game and tinkering to make them work with my joystick.  Also, it takes much too long to get into the action on this game.  Say I fly a 15 minute mission, 7 of those minutes will be flying between objectives without any fun bullet dodging at all, just gliding along level till you get there.

												A fun WWII Fighters clone (or, that's what it feels like) with spectacular graphics and gameplay as you'd expect from a decent flight sim. The selection of aircraft is quite good though, since most of them are designated by nothing more than a few letters and numbers, a thumbnail would be handy.The biggest letdown with this title is that you're essentially playing under two layers of DRM - after buying it through Steam, you're forced to use this strange YuPlay client which seems to hog a lot of memory, and if you're not logged in before you start the game, you'll get a popup window which you can't close while playing.

												Air combat game with attractive graphics and easy enough for average gamer not sim freak.Should be a lot of fun, but is let down by the mission design.  You're at the controls of an aircraft and looking forward to enjoying flying it, but the missions force you to dash through and complete objectives very fast, with little margin for error.  Who tested this?For example in one AI skirmish mission you're up against a ME190 but you'll have 1 pass at it before it races past and if you now need to turn you won't catch it before it leaves the map.  Game over.Another mission I repeated many many times without completing in the time space, and found many other players online stuck in the same mission.Overall a wasted opportunity.Avoid or try it out in a sale.

												An excellent take on WWII warplanes if you come from an Ace Combat background. Great, efficient graphics engine and varied missions. It plays perfect with a 360 pad and if you turn on every simulation notch, it's a decent simulator with a joystick. If you want pure, hardcore simulation, you're better off with IL2 Sturmovik 1946.

2/10While I do not recommend this game, I will address all aspects: the good, the bad and the ugly. Also, please note that this was just my particular experience and not representative of all users.(Also, not sure why it's showing 65 hours of gameplay. Definately lost my patience sooner than that.)Good: Decent graphics, well done voice overs, realistic and immersive gameplay; You really feel like you in the cockpit sometimes.Bad: Repetive and often cheesy missions plus very non-linear difficulties (i.e. On low difficulties, I could take down a fighter with what felt like a single bullet but on mid-level difficulties I'd get shot down in within seconds of starting even the earliest missions. And to all you trolls out there, I've been playing fighter sims for years so it's not a lack of skill.)Ugly (this is what killed the game for me): The controls were garbage. The keyboard controls made even basic maneuvers a nightmare and mapping keys to controllers wasn't much better. I tried everything from an XBox 360 controller to a joystick specially designed for WW2 fighter sims and still had trouble. One example is how each secondary weapon (bombs, rockets, etc.) had a different button assignment vice a single button and when you DO map them to the same key, you get an in-game error telling you that the secondary weapon is not available.Overall, Wings of Prey did a good job with display and realism. But, like many games of its kind, mission variety is rather lacking but it's the crappy control scheme that makes it hit rock bottom. As I said earlier, this is just my experience with it but I highly recommend looking elsewhere.			"

												Oh I love this game........Take a bit of mucking around to get it working now a days but once you do its fun..Flight model to suit all skills and moods is great as somtimes i cant be bothered with simulation mode so the arcade model backs it off enought to have fun to go shoot down z germans.GFX are great for its age, online is dead so if you want that get War Thunder buy same makers.Missions are good and for most part enjoyable.UPDATE: Ok so i got sick of the YuPlay pop up to register crap so re bought the game DRM free from Gaijin site.. then thought if i copied the files and exes into Steam version then i keep progessing my steam game. IT WORKED both versions use same game saves anyway and now no stupid pop up crap from YuPlay. Mulitiplayer is gone they push you towards WAR THUNDER for that but off line game is nice and solid and i do enjoy they ambiance of WoP			"

												I´m a hardcore flightsimmer and i found this game is fun.It is a nice arcade World War 2 dogflight sim, easy to learn, it is not unforgiving nor realistic as IL2, but the combats are fun, the graphics are awesome and it do a good job on recreate the places and atmosphere. You should have a joystick to play this game (or any flightsim. ) The downside is the game uses uPlay for MP, that is the worst  pile of crap ever.  I´m not sure if multiplayer is working now but probaly not because they take down all the support for this game.Buy this game if is very cheap and if you love ww2 aviation and dogfight, you will have many hour of fun but don´t buy it if you want realistic plane behavior or multiplayer gaming.

												Probably one of the best in the 'WWII arcade flight sim' genre, I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of aircraft and controls available. You can go for a full arcade type 'shoot-em-up' or if you turn on some of the more advanced controls and difficulty levels it can become more like a simulator. The game is also quite pretty! Only issue is that it seems to want to run some application called 'yuplay' in the background. I can't figure out what the point of it is, but if you don't turn it off after exiting WoP it still clocks up game hours on Steam so now I have apparently played 26 hours when I have only been in-game for about 3-4 of those!

												WoP has good enough graphics and physics to not distract you while playing.  You can play in arcade, realistic, or simulator mode of which it is only fun to play in arcade mode because the enemies in realistic and simulator modes are way better than you are without putting 600 hours into the game.  Also, setting up the controls takes a long time, probably took about 3 hours of pausing the game and tinkering to make them work with my joystick.  Also, it takes much too long to get into the action on this game.  Say I fly a 15 minute mission, 7 of those minutes will be flying between objectives without any fun bullet dodging at all, just gliding along level till you get there.  The combat is not all that fun either.  I would not recommend buying this game whether you are casual like me or a hardcore simulator fan.			"
