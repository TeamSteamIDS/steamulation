												Game Dev Tycoon has taught me a lot about how consumers and reviews influence which games succeed and which don't. I started off on my second full playthrough of the game having some knowledge of how to play it already. However, this time I was doing something different. I named my company ""Activision"" and set out to reinvent the First Person Shooter, starting with Call of Duty but not going overboard with it. Call of Duty was a great success with reviews and sold millions of copies! I made a few sequels and once I had enough cash and enough skilled employees, I decided Call of Duty had outlived its usefullnes and decided to stop making sequels. I was now ready to reinvent the shooter, it was going to be a cyberpunk adventure FPS with a focus on story and characters. The idea was great in my head and we even spent millions on a new engine for the game to really shine. I pressed the ""Finish Game"" button and was expecting 9's and 10's. What I got was nothing of the sort. My heart sunk when I saw the 3's and 4's saying that ""Cyberpunk"" and ""FPS"" don't mix well and was even more nervous when I saw the low sales numbers. We were nearly bankrupt damn it! That engine alone cost us  millions and the game took a huge amount of money to develop! I paused the game and sat there, thinking what we could do to save ""Activision"". I then looked at my game history. We had a few games that sold alright but nothing that sold as well as ""Call of Duty"" that's when I did the unspeakable. I clicked the ""Make Sequel"" button and made yet another ""Call of Duty"" game. I felt sick as the reviews came in with 8's and 9's, saving the company and making millions, but stomping on our morals and values. The entire reason I made the company was to avoid such a thing, when in the end I had become what I had set out to destroy! 10/10 for realism			"

												Game Dev Tycoon is a tycoon strategy game where you create your own game development company. You start as a guy/gal working out of a cramped garage in the 80's and as you create popular games you'll gradually grow until you have enough money for a new premises as well as the option to hire employees. As you continue to grow you'll be able to make bigger, better games, research new technology to gain an advantage, create your own MMOs and even create your own powerful game engines.+Nice simple graphics+A lot of depth to it, especially as you unlock more things to do later in the game+A huge variety of topics to choose from when creating your game+A wide variety of consoles that come and go as time goes by+The market responds to games in a realistic way+Some good random events though there aren't enough of them+The game lets you grow your company at a natural rate and only allows you to expand when you have enough money+You can take publishing contracts or other freelance work to earn some extra money inbetween making games+You have a lot of control over your game as you can decide how much time is spent working on certain aspects/elements of the game, when working on larger games you can choose who works on what aspect+You can train yourself and your employees to be better at different skills which improves your games and improves how quickly they are made+The game keeps track of what topics and genres work well on what console and what elements of the game are most important+Very relaxing to play+Lots of replayability+Nice sound effects+Workshop support+Very low requirements to run it-Once you've played it once nothing comes as a surprise such as when games consoles get taken of the market-The size your company can reach isn't overly big, it never gets any bigger than a medium indie team-Soundtrack is a bit repetitive at timesVerdict:9A fantastic game development strategy game with nice graphics, a lot of depth and a real feeling that you're in control. This is easily one of my favourite games on Steam and a game which you should definitely pick up if you're a fan of tycoon/strategy games.El K.			"

												I enjoyed this game greatly, Unfortunaly the mods do not work for me, but that is a personal problem (bad pc) so don't let that discourage you. I shall now make a list. The Good : The replay value is very good for a non-sandbox gameMany strategies (bumps up replay value even more)Steam Workshop (mods available)I just always wanted to make my games, but I am terrible at code (personal opinion to fill up the list)Many other small touches to the game (how they changed the console names a bit, but enough to be rocognized, historical events {nigerian scammers for example} or other small things) The Bad Too short of a history periodNot enough historical events, or even normal events that make big impact and The Ugly Not enough offices Need a news reporter that says when a big event occurs (ties in with nr.2 in The Bad) Wishlist DLCs!!!!!When new engine is available (lol) a sequelThat more people get to play this awesome game and feel the joy it brings..... oooow wait... that's my part as a reviewer right?Thank you for reading			"

												This game is basically the most addicting drug for anyone that loves and collects Games. When you start playing it, make sure you have nothing important planned in the next 8+ hours, because the next time you look at the clock your time will simply have vanished without you even realizing it =)I got the game way before it was on Steam directly from the developers website, they where fast and uncomplicated with providing steam keys, very nice!The game is not without flaws tough, the gameplay is fairly limited and not really complex, i am sure it could be expanded alot, but as this game was previously made and developed for pads and the mobile crowd, the devs most likeley kept it simple for those simple minds.Its also very fast paced, even when you set the gameplay lenght to the maximum, i didnt like that and felt a bit stressed because of it, neverthless you can play on endlessly after you have finished the ""storyline"" which reaches till the current next gen consoles.I encountered no bugs or other bad things, and generally its a pleasure to play. I can deffinatly reccomend this game to anyone who loves games and ever wanted to make ""Kitten Furball Apocalypse"" or similar funny games =)			"

Game development is where art and technology run headlong into one another; an arena where money, geekery, hubris and passion collide compressing under extreme heat to form gaming's diamonds, or going awry leaving behind Superman 64 style turds... While many gamers think they understand the tremendous amounts of skill, passion and balance required to make a great game, one trip to a message board usually exposes how little some of them understand about the process and challenges of game development. Greenheart Games has delivered a simulation that illustrates just how many compromises are made in the developmental process by emphasizing the budgets and time constraints that most titles are developed under and just how disastrous it can be to misappropriate time to features that are not central to the type of game that is being developed. Game Dev Tycoon comes together to form an accessible but insightful view of game development. Like any entrepreneurial endeavor, it all starts with giving your budding studio a name before setting up shop in your garage and plugging away at your keyboard. Aside from providing a facsimile of running a studio, Game Dev Tycoon is also a bit of a history lesson with the in game timeline chronicling the release of fictitious consoles that are based on the real life machines that many of us gamers grew up on. The demographics an traits of these platforms is represented as accurately as possible, meaning that a family friendly casual game might be best suited for a mobile platform while an intricate simulation will probably have the most success on the PC. Likewise, pairing an appropriate theme to your game's genre will yield the best sales and reviews. Developing a medically themed action game is a great way to go belly up. In this way, Game Dev Tycoon isn't interested in giving players the freedom to create eccentric titles that carve out their own niches, so developing your own Katamari Damacy or Mr. Mosquito is not a dream that this game is meant to help players fulfill. It's about business—moderating costs and selling as many copies as humanly possible. To do so, you can hire and fire staff, develop your own digital distribution platform, choose appropriate marketing campaigns and research new features and technologies that will earn new fans.  Developing a game in Game Dev Tycoon is somewhat reminiscent of playing Civilization, each member of your team has a Design rating and a technology rating. Each area of game development falls into these categories. Programming AI is all about technical experience while graphics are about design. As your game goes through each stage of development, your team will generate tech and design points and how many they generate depends on their rating in each category. The higher their rating, the faster they will produce these points. Balancing your point output to meet the needs of your game is imperative and team members can be trained to bolster their tech or design rating. The more experience a team member has the higher their level will be which also means that they earn a larger paycheck. Having six level ten developers working for you may sound like a recipe for success until your operating costs dig deeply into your profits. Fortunately you can hire and fire employees at any time. To manage costs.  Costs also mount when researching and developing new technology. Technologies can then be implemented into your studio's in house game engines. Keeping up with the tech curve and developing proprietary game engines keeps your studio on the cutting edge and can help generate sales. Bear in mind that the costs of new tech are not limited to implementing them into a game engine—each title you develop utilizing  special technology costs extra so spending the money to integrate surround sound into your latest text based adventure is ill advised.  Rounding out the fantasy of running your own development studio are PR and marketing opportunities. As your studio grows, the press will want to know about your latest products and your answers to their questions can earn additional fans and sales. Exercising unrestrained bravado and overhyping your games can earn your studio a Peter Molyneux sized ♥♥♥♥♥ slap, loosing fans and hampering your sales. Having a rabid fan base ensures a certain degree of success since loyal fans will line up to buy your newest project—even if it's titled Grass Growing Simulator or Guitar Hero: Nickleback. Also integral to the PR song and dance is having your own booth at industry trade shows. Having a booth requires a chunk of cash but with enough exposure, your studio can earn additional fans and prestige making it worth investing in. Investing in a marketing campaign will also boost sales potential but timing is key if you want to get the most out of your marketing dollar. While Game Dev Tycoon integrates almost every major element involved in bringing a game to market it does have a few faults. The largest of which is the lack of randomization. The proceedings are rather predictable, so don't expect any calamities to come along and shake things up. Your staff is always compliment and unlike real life they don't seem interested in seeking newer more lucrative opportunities, you never run into major development snags or delays that would force your studio to cancel a title. Combine this with the fact that running out of money simply means having to take a loan out from the bank and you have a sim experience that is far more forgiving than most. The genre and theme combinations never change nor do the demographics for genres and platforms so once you have discovered a few successful formulas in one playthrough, they will certainly work in an additional playthrough. All this comes together to make Game Dev Tycoon far less repayable than other titles in the genre.  Game Dev Tycoon is an enjoyable game that offers a bit of insight to the process of creating games and it even gives younger players a bit of history about gaming. It's clean and colorful visuals keep the mood light and it's mechanics make it far more accessible than other simulations games. The downside is it's predictability and lack of variation make it difficult to come back to after a dozen or two hours have gone into it. While it's price is set appropriately, fans of other simulators may be left wanting.			"

Don't touch me you filthy casual, she hissed at me as tears ruined her once flawless eye makeup. The efforts to console her were as pointless as our failing relationship. Let me start from the beginning. We grew up together, her and I. We learned so much from eachother, I can't even imagine being the person I am today without her. All the while, my cowardice refused to show how I'd felt deep down. The dread of knowing what we had wasn't going to last forever never showed its twisted skeletal frame during the time we spent together. In the interest of moving this review along I should say that the early days were coming to an abrupt end the night she caught me playing Game Dev Tycoon. It was a slow summer day at the office and I did some reading on the game. I was blown away by the brilliance of the developers who allegedly snuck in a bug in the leaked pirated version that made it impossible for your game company to succeed due to piracy. Irony deserves my money just as much as I do, so I made the purchase. That night I came home and sat down with her. She suggested I continue Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon. I told her I'm not in the mood. She then pleaded, what about Bioshock Infinite? You've only put 2 hours in to it! No thanks, kinda really want to try this new game, Game Dev Tycoon. I've heard good things about it. It took minutes to finish the download and needed no update; she gave me the that's it? look. Ignoring her slights against the game's file size and dismissing her huffs against it not even warming up the AMD Radeon 7850, I continued to enjoy managing my way to become the next Valve. Figuring out the best game combinations and platforms is surpisingly addictive. The changes in the hardware industry brought back so many fond memories of the everlasting GameBoy and the all-too-brief Dreamcast eras. Hours later, f.lux triggered, my screen shifts to softer colors and that's when I realized what had happened. I was enjoying a casual game. That's the moment I knew her beautiful core i7 powered brain would never look at me the same way again. I tried not to cry. I cried alot. Her 500GB SSD would never want this memory of me, so I formatted her shortly after in the hopes that at least one of us will forget what we had. Goodbye my sweet BitFenix Prodigy build 01, may you forever dream in code. Oh, that and I didn't want to activate Windows 8.1. That OS is complete sh!te and you should stay away from it.			"

I recommend custom PCs to be built by the hardware lab. Just more things in general. This game is virtually complete as it reaches the point of modern technology and can advance no further. people complain about the lack of content and while it may eed a little bit more it does have just about everything. I recommend you get mods for it once it gets boring on normal. The mods and more topics and allow you to build different stuff. Be careful though as you may break the game and have to restart from scratch. I highly recommend this game it is defintatly woth $10.00. If you have played this before then you will understand me when i give this game a 10.25 out of 10			"

												This game is probably the only casual game I've ever gotten ""really"" into. And I have a large amount of respect for its developers, Greenheart, when this game was first released many people simply pirated it, so Greenheart anonomously slipped out a pirated version of their own game, but they tampered with it so anyone who played it would never make a successful game due to pirating! Well, with all that being said, all you need to know is that this is a clever, and altogether fun game about developing games.			"

												I enjoy this game so much. Whenever I'm bored, I just play this game over and over again. When I first bought this in May, I was lost at why I wasn't doing good and kept going backrupt. I then had to go to the wiki to write down and memorize the algorisms to do well; at the beginning it was a b***h, but later I got used to it. Then once the 1.4 update came out it added so much more to the game like multi-platforms, new consoles in the timeline (mBox One and Playsystem 4), and so much more! When they changed the algorisms which kinda disappointing but made more sense when you logically think topics and development phases through such as world design being more important in RPGs and not as much in causal games. However there's something about this game that makes me wanna keep playing, it makes me want to challenge myself and use different approaches to developing games. I believe the best part of this game is trial and error, the use of editing almost everything, and the replay value. I love greenheart games for the approach and philsophy they took towards this game. No microtransactions, no charging extra for the essential items that complete a game, just a straight 10 dollar game from developers that give you what you paid for. I highly recommend this game to anybody to at least try it. I'd give this game a 9.5/10. The reason for that is although I could play this game for hours on end, there are some realistic functions that this game is missing that I'd love to see. Such as company functions, combonations of different topics and genres, and ect. This game still has some work to do like all games; however, I can guarantee that you will find enjoyment in this game. Good Luck to Greenheart Games!! :)Update!: I have used mods recently, I recommend you DO NOT use them. The mods are currently in beta however they seem to just add consoles and far too many sports topics (Eg; tennis, ice hockey, hockey, unnecesary pointless topic that go under the catorgy ""sports"" for a reason). Feel free to try them to enhance your experience of the game. I just didn't enjoy it myself.Update (9/25/14): I waited until the steam workshop was added onto this game and I must say, the mods have made the game 5x better! You have from new topics, to pie charts, to making your own prices, to new consoles, and so many more! I now highly recommend them THROUGH THE WORKSHOP! I cannot say downloading them from the developer's website is the best solution, mainly because the workshop is optimised for the game and best for those with little to no mod knowledge. But I will say the mods have made this game, easily, one of my most favorite games and my choice for best modern tycoon game to date.			"

												A fun little indie game with some nice easter eggs built in.The all allusive 100Million achievement will keep you going and going at this until you achieve it.A little bit repetitive, however it is still good.I would reccomend that once you complete it first time to play through using the hints you have obtained about the different genre's, gaming systems, etc. To improve your chances of getting the 100 Million Acheivement.One thing to note is that i still consider MMo's to be bugger as costs keep spirallying upwards never down.

It incoorporates facts and real events into the game like the release of the PS1, NES, etc. Game Dev's real gem is that it can be played over and over again. The thing about game-Dev is how well it was madeand functions realisticaly (although not everything is realistic in terms of a tychoon game). Game dev has an overall rating of 9/10 on my list, and I think it would be too on yours. Please buy this game, it will be a good descision.			"

TL:DR? See ConclusionNOTE:I'm reposting some of my old reviews because I adopted an easier to read format (and because for some reason I can't edit my old reviews)INTRODUCTION:The first game developed by Greenheart Games, Game Dev Tycoon is a Simulation game that, not just tries to mimic the events and hardships of game development studios, but also teaches the player a little bit of history on how our favorite pass time (or hobby) grew into this giant of an industry we see today.STORY (No Spoilers):Game Dev Tycoon places you in the shoes of a start up developer who will be making games for the different gaming platforms. Starting from the early days of the PC and Govodore G64 (Commodore 64), the game will send you through history up until the Console wars of the MBox One (Xbox One) and the Playsystem 4 (Playstation 4). Make games, hire staff members, research new technologies and build yourself to be the most popular and successful Game Developer in the world.PROS:+ Very nice 'Fash' type Art Style and animation+ Surprisingly fun game mechanic+ Relaxing and pleasing sound effects and music but...(See CON #1)+ Great Re-playability+ Fairly accurate historical progression on the video game industry's history+ Good Value / Play time ratio+ Minimal system requirements+ Steam Cloud and Workshop Support+ Devs trolled pirates of their game (They uploaded a cracked version of their game that, if played, would backrupt the player's company ironically due to piracy.)+ Relatively cheap (at $10 or your regional equivalent) for its highly replayable game timeCONS:- Could use more Soundtracks- Could use more randomized and recurring events- Limited Staff- Game Review is a bit lacking on information on why your game did well (or poorly)- A bit predictable if you followed the Game Industry's history since you can easily bet which platform would be most successful.CONCLUSION:GREAT GAME. Easy to understand and easy to learn but very difficult to master. It is a game that both Hardcore gamers and casual players can both enjoy.WORTH IT?For $10 (or your regional equivalent), the game is well worth its full price and should be a no-brainer if it goes on sale. Playing this game gives a great feeling of satisfaction as well as a bit of understanding why game developers make the decisions they do.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Like my Reviews?

												Game Dev Tycoon is game about making games. You start in the 80’s and make your way up to modern times with new and innovative technologies.As far as the story goes, Game Dev Tycoon kind of lacks one, but in this instance, thats a good thing. The gameplay is your custom character sitting in a desk making games and sometimes doing contract work. After you make a large sum of money from a large selling game, you move up to a more spacious office, instead of your garage. After time, you progress further, making new games, developing new game engine’s and making a name for your company. The sound in the game is good overall, the music fits well. The sound of the research bubbles is oddly satisfying, but may get annoying over time. The graphics of the game aren't the best, but aren't needed for this sort of game. The way the player makes a good game is based on complex math algorithms, but the player can check trends in the market, and experiment with different combos of game styles and genres in order to appeal to the masses Game Dev Tycoon does some things wrongThe lack of story after completion makes the game boringIt’s easy to go bankrupt from a few bad games in the first 3 areasSome employees early on are useless unless trained, costing a lotThe random events sometimes get in the way of game productionThe game isn't always as realistic as it could beIts slow to startSometimes you start with bad gamestylesThe games achievements aren't very easy to mostGame Dev Tycoon does a lot right tooThe feeling of going through the years is satisfyingThe ability to name your games and companyIt’s a satisfying feeling getting a high score on a gameThe game makes you want to keep playingThe researching is realisticThe game has playing cards and a steam workshopGame Dev Tycoon isn't the best tycoon game available, but i would argue that it is the best game dev game. Its an Indie casual game made to kill some hours, and that is just what it will do. Overall i think the game is worth the $10.99(CAD) price tag, if you blow some hours into it, and play it more than once. "

 Game Dev Tycoon  Review: Overview Game Dev Tycoon is a small game where you start up a game devlopment studio; starting from working in a basement into having a large workforce in a studio. The idea is quite innovative since you are literally taking on the role of making games inside of a game itself. Not such an attempted idea as the infamous 'Superheroes fighting against Villans in a large city' where the hereos always win. Anyway, back to the game. As a developer you choose the name of the game, the audience, genre, topic, which staff member focuses on what part of the game (such as Jeffery does most of the Graphical work, Stephanie focuses on the Sound and so on) and basically allows for mass customization. Heck, you can develop a racing game without any DLC's and that focuses on actual gameplay instead of pretty graphics that you will look at for 2.3 seconds before crashing due to high speeds. Keep in mind, the game tries to take itself seriously, so a game that focuses too much on one thing, too little on another, will recieve lower ratings (four gaming reviewers will rate your game x/10.) and therefore less sales. As you get more cash and more staff, a larger studio will become mandatory unless you want a smaller but more trained workforce (yes, you can train every worker to be good at a particular subject, such as Technological workers and Designers) so less workers will be stressed out enough to need a vacation (bad for business, games are meant to be made at a gaming company). You can plan out a strategy for your workers if you want, I remember I used to be a researcher due to a high speed rating (speed levels can make your worker to research/train themselves faster and become more efficient) and let them create the games. Gameplay Quite fun if you ever considered doing this as a job or a hobby. The game can be classed as educational in a way since now you know not to mix Racing with RPG or some other, terrible combination.  It's fun because it shows brings you on a journey of a once single developer living in his (parents') basement and how their hobby turned into a job, granting them a lot of cash, workforce and vice versa. You choose how it plays out, choose terrible combinations and take it as a joke; you will stay in the basement. Actually pick something innovative; you will succeed in game development. Other than having a moral, the game is still fun no matter if taken seriously or as a way of passing time by since you can accidentally create an AAA game by raising all the sliders to full priority and watching the crowd go crazy racing to the nearest Gamestop. Quite hilarious. Pros and Cons: Pros:Great funMoralCheapRealistic situationsDecide the story outcomeQuite useful for future devsCons:HuD is quite huge and not very attractive TL;DR Great game for a great price which is a great buy for a great deal of tips. Definitely worth considering on sale or buying the discusses sequel.  I have been gifted the key by the kind developers of the game. They make my review about games like this possible.

Line a 24cm square baking tin with greaseproof paper. In a large bowl over some simmering water, melt the butter and the chocolate and mix until smooth. Add the cherries and nuts, if you’re using them, and stir together. In a separate bowl, mix together the cocoa powder, flour, baking powder and sugar, then add this to the chocolate, cherry and nut mixture. Stir together well. Beat the eggs and mix in until you have a silky consistency.Pour your brownie mix into the baking tray, and place in the oven for around 25 minutes. You don’t want to overcook them so, unlike cakes, you don’t want a skewer to come out all clean. The brownies should be slightly springy on the outside but still gooey in the middle. Allow to cool in the tray, then carefully transfer to a large chopping board and cut into chunky squares. These make a fantastic dessert served with a dollop of crème fraîche mixed with some orange zest. "

												Absolutely amazing game  but disappointing at the same time.  Pros - ""Pick up 'n play"" - After a year of not playing, you'll still remember the controls and mechanics.- Very simple but yet effective UI.- You make this game as difficult as you want - do you stick with small and medium games and make decent income, or do you focus on AAA MMOs and dominate the market with your financial power?- There's actually a 'goal' to this game - to achieve as high of a score as possible before 36(?) in-game years.- The game has a amazing casual feel and good gameflow, time spent playing will slip through your fingers like sand.- You're not limited to just games and you will work your way up as you go along - you start off in a basement/garage building small text games and before you know it you're the CEO of a AAA company building your own engines and consoles. Cons - After moving in to your last office, having unlocked all the R&D stuff and after having built 1 or 2 consoles, the game gets boring really quickly. (Starting a new game might resolve this bug)- To me personally, the game feels lacking, don't get me wrong, it is amazing as it is, but I feel like it could have been  so much more.  What would be nice is maybe building your own OS, creating your own software and maybe have the game expand more on the consoles you get to make. I understand that this is a  game dev  tycoon but I see this game more as an amazing base for a computer industry tycoon and I really do hope that the devs do something and try to expand on this.- The Steam Workshop feels lacking, while there  is  a Steam Workshop, do not expect too much from it. Unless you want a more accurate translation to Chinese or Russian it might not be for you. TL;DR This is an amazing game and absolute worth however much money you happen to spend on it and will grant you many hours of enjoyable playtime and yet feels lacking in some areas. This is a game I would most definitely recommend			"

												Yes I like the game.But I really dislike some part of the mechanics.If possible, I would rate this neutral. As I can't do this, I decided for negative.The problem is: when I just mark this review as ""positive"", no one ever reads about negative remarks in this game. But currently there is barely any negative rating or posivite review with a ""contra"" that has more content than ""I don't like this"" (although there a quite a few funny ones ;) ).So I write this to show people like me, who read negative comments first, that this is a good game in general. But still not 100% recommandable.Also, after reading the wiki about the rating mechanic, I really thought about stopping to play. Unfortunately (?), I'm kind of a perfectionist, wanting to finish the game at least once...Simulator + PC = GreatEveryone/Mature + PC = GreatDesign: 100, Tech: 80That's basically the main flaw of the game:The Design/Tech Ratio. Design is great / Mechanics, for a sim, not!Design:* Love the artwork, the productive bubbles and sound.* Also love all those somewhat ironic texts, scam mail ( I am nubian princess with lots of money for you :D ).* And fu**** love all those hidden references to lots of games and even movies (seriously, back into the future!)* Nice touch with moving from garage to office to bigger office and lots of things you can do.*And, of course, the relation to real world PC and Console over the past 30 years.Awesome, guys!Tech:* Great Sound* Beautiful graphics.* Moving around feels a bit sluggish and menus not always responding, but that's still ok.Aaannd here comes the big fat but (one ""t"" only):The calculation of game scores.1) As you're the only company in this game, your scores are always calculated against your own.This effectively means 2 things:- You need to improve your score from game to game. Not too fast, only steady improvements. So if you make some awesome RPG with great Tech/Design ration and then an potentially great Simulation - the latter needs to have a bit better Tech and Design values (according to ratio) than the previous game.- That leads to times where it is better not to make a huge jump in quality, as it then is harder to improve further. But instead to leave bugs in the game for decreasing it's rating, and making it easier for the following game topping the score again.This is a really annoying part of the game in my opinion, as you cannot focus on good values and features, but might have to ""sabotage"" your efforts if you see the game might be ""too"" good.Maybe something regarding the engine features would've helped here (like a new game should not miss certain features games before from the same genre had )2) Tech/Design ratio mechanicNo matter how great your design or your tech is, you will get bad scores if the ratio is not perfect enough.In general this makes kind of sense, as a simulation needs more tech focus than a casual game.But let's see this: I make a 10/10/10 game with 100 tech and 160 design (like RPG). Then I make another RPG with 200 tech and 250 design afterwards. This will get worse ratings than the previous, as the ratio is not 1.6, but 1.2.So lots of improvements, yet the game sucks. Ah-hah.2.5) This is especially annoying if you take the sliders into account, as the granular settings mean nothing (which maybe could've eased up the previous problem).After you make a lot of post-release game research, the game tells you how important one thing is for what kind of genre. Like Action games have a ""+++"" (very important) in sound, whereas RPG only have a ""++"" (for example, don't remember exact values right now).But when developing a game which needs a ratio, let's say, 1.5 (more design than tech) and you have only a ratio of 1.0 in the end of the 2nd development phase...The sliders might tell you that you should put ""++"" in tech (e.g. sound) -> but when doing so, you will usually get an even worse ratio!In the first playthrough I failed in the 2nd office, because after having a couple of successful games, where I adjusted the sliders to my general game knowledge, I used the slider recommendations (e.g. --- for nothing, +++ for full, ++ for half) and now the ratios were complete wrong.In no tutorial or whatsoever I found the reason for my mediocre games.Only after reading a couple of wiki pages about the ratio thingy I started to ignore the game recommendations and only adjusted the sliders depending on ratio I needed. Which is usually 100% for 2 of them and 0% for another (even if that 0% is according to game ""+++"" !)That's it. Combine this with a couple of staff trainings after each great game and you're done.3) SequelsMaking a Sequel in nearly 1 Year after another brings BAD scores. (if it's around <1 year - did not measure exact amount of weeks).Like 1/1/1 BAD scores.Unless you use a major upgraded engine. Then you might get a 3-5.Not major upgrading the engine for a sequel in general is also bad, even if the previous game was made a couple of years ago.Really?Ever heard of Call of Duty? Or Fifa? Or... ;)Summarum:Great game!If you like sim games, definitely get it.But there is still room for improvement!Try a better tech/design ratio next time, Greenheart Games.And remember to upgrade the Engine and wait >1 Year or so ;)PPS:If you're bankrupt some text similar to this appears:""Fortunately, Electronic Mass Productions has bought your studio.Fans cry and bury their hopes.""- Guess the reference :D  UPDATE Dev Response 2016-01-26 First, thank you for your comment.Glad to see that you care even about an older game here on Steam :)I believe you when you say you changed that behavior.Which, however, confuses me somewhat: as I did play this game some time after the Steam release (and only installed it then), most of your tweaks should've been in there by then.When using said imbalances I found in the wiki, as outdated it might be, to my favor, I was:* able to consecutively get great game scores (>8 average) while not listening to (most of) the ingame +++/--- report evaluations* failing most of my games (<=5 avg), when listening to the evaluations -> common in the last dev phase, where the ratio gets fu.. mixed up.* feeling that, beside said sliders, most other things like engine features had diminishing influence* still having that first game after every 9,x hit which was 90% of the time way worse in game rating (esp. when not having a real perfect ratio). Best seen after a hit or having very high scores, for example, right after adding a good team member and/or lots of staff training in one go* seeing sequel mechanic somewhat lackingMaybe my wording in this review here was somewhat biased in the end after reading about everything. Too much time since then, can't really recall, sorry.Still the mechanics (and my ""what the heck am I doing wrong?"") at that time where the reason which lead me to even look into a wiki in the first place. So in the end my experience was still the described one:Where I found the core tech/design mechanic to be too indistinctive about the seemingly huge possibilities of not only slider adjustments, but also team, engine etc. Thus making my game scores a total mess or, after reading and comparing my own game scores, very predictable.That being said:Your are mostly right, that those problems are somewhat overstated for many players. Which is also the reason I still say that simulation fans should still try it. And I really hope your game (still) is a success.Just for some players like me, these issues are like an itch in the eye you just cannot ignore.			"

												really nice, it may look ridiculous but it is totally not! in fact, you are constantly aiming to get that infamous 11/10 score for your game, and probably willing to play until you get it.so you just start in your garage with a pc and some knowledge for developing games, you make your first game, get some money, make a new/better game, research some stuff and gain some fans until you get a bigger office, after that you search some workers to help develop bigger games, and so on....you have to look out for getting bankrupt and scammers, so it's not just adjusting sliders to make a game, create new stuff and become one of biggest game developers in the industry!good luck ;)i give the game a 8/10 a bit more stuff would be nice, but ofcourse it's from a small company so it's pretty damn nice!One of my favorite games really!

												There are a plethora of “Tycoon” games on the market.  The smartphone market is flooded with them, Steam has a ton, and there are new ones hitting the cheap deals stands at Walmart on a near constant basis.  Lemonade Stand Tycoon, Airline Tycoon I and II, Chocolate Tycoon, Zombie Tycoon, DinerTown Tycoon, Offshore Tycoon, Hotel Giant, four Prison Tycoon titles, and Zoo Tycoon doesn’t even begin to cover 1% of the Tycoon marketplace.  When Game Dev Tycoon hit the market, you can imagine that it didn’t even make it onto my radar because that genre is so saturated.  You can imagine my surprise when some of my friends simply couldn’t stop talking about it.  After more than a decade on this side of the fence, it was time to see how the other half lives – it was time to become a Game Developer.  Much to my surprise, it was time to review a Tycoon title.Starting off in a small garage all by yourself, Game Dev Tycoon casts you an aspiring game developer.  You’ll kick of your career like most indie devs – mere feet from boxes and your tarp-covered car.  Picking a name for your game, a topic, a genre, a platform, and an engine to power it are the building blocks for pushing a title out the door, at least in the beginning.  With humble beginnings you’ll only have a few topics to pick from – sports, medieval, military, and space, but a great many more are just waiting to be unlocked.  Similarly, genres are fairly limited in the beginning, giving you action, RPG, simulation, and strategy to start.  Much like the real thing, in the beginning there is only PC as a selectable platform because consoles and handhelds haven’t been ‘invented’ yet.  It’s nothing if not simple in the beginning.After nailing down the elements of your game you’ll work through the development process.  There are three phases to releasing a game.  In the first phase you’ll chose how to divide your time and resources between story, gameplay, and the engine. The sliders for all three can be drug all the way to the top, but this does extend the development time of your game dramatically.  When you are a one-man shop with very limited funds, this is a dangerous gamble.  The second stage of development asks you for the same decision on dialogues, level design, and AI, then stage three gives you the same thing for world design, graphics, and sound.  As your fingers dance away at the keyboard, your development bubbles up game points towards technology, research, and design.  It also bubbles up bugs – bugs that will cost additional time and money to fix…that is unless you turn a blind eye to them and hope your fans do the same.During development you can also add additional features.  The pool is pretty shallow to start, but like genres and topics, you can use research later to unlock many more.   These can be mono sound, 3D graphics, joystick or steering wheel support, and other bullets you might see on the back of a real-world game box.  When the game is finished and all the features are locked you can release it immediately, but you might want to think about fixing those bugs first.  The longer your game dev goes, the more points will bubble up towards all of the development areas.  When it’s said and done you’ll earn experience in all of the areas where you’ve focused, as well as personal experience for you as a developer.  Publishing the game brings the moment that all developers absolutely love, anticipate, and dread – reviews.  Shortly after completion you’ll get a stack of four reviews from a random slice of fake game reviewers.  They all come with a short blurb and a score from 1 to 10.  These scores have a direct impact on the sales that follow, so putting out a well-reviewed product becomes important quickly.  You’ll earn more fans with a great game, and build your fanbase with great releases.As you develop you’ll also earn research points that you can spend on learning new topics and genres as well as new features for your basic engine.  New topics, multiplayer, online support, and much more can be attached to the engine, eventually transitioning it to a fully-3D system.  The best dev houses out there build their own engines though, and you’ve got an opportunity to do exactly that.  Building an engine is a costly proposition, both in terms of development time as well as researching and building features.  Adding stereo sound to your custom engine instead of just mono might not be all that expensive, but moving to a full orchestral soundtrack is a colossal undertaking.  Your engine won’t take you forward year after year though, so you’ll end up making several over the course of the game.  You can’t switch engines mid-development (Prey, Duke Nukem Forever, Anachronox, Too Human, etc – pay attention) so selecting the right features and sticking with it is your only choice.Sitting around cashing the dwindling paychecks from your freshly-released game might be great, but when it dries up you’re gonna have a bad time.  Your game will only stay on the market a limited time, and audiences get awful upset when you release a sequel immediately (e.g. Left 4 Dead 2), so branching out gives you a slight bonus to your experience as well as a better reception with fans.  Spending research points means not spending time developing games, so you might find your cash beginning to dwindle. To help keep your shop afloat you can also take on contract work.   The contracts ask you to generate a certain amount of design and tech points in a specific timeframe.  Failure to hit your contract goals forces you to pay a penalty, so biting off only what you can chew is critical.  Given that new contracts only pop up every 6 months, you’ll have to use them wisely.People don’t want to work in your stinky, greasy garage.  To begin your development in earnest you’ll need to build a team – you can’t do everything yourself for long.  Once you move into a small office you can begin to hire staff and develop their skills as well.  At this stage you’ll have access to books and classes that help build up your design, speed, tech, or research skills, as will your staff.  Just like time developing an engine, it’s not being spent on building games, so balance is key.Hiring talent isn’t cheap or easy, so advertising the job will cost you somewhere between 20k to 2 million.  Getting a good mix of specialists and generalists will help you create a team of world-class game developers, but balancing budgets and payroll against income starts to affect the types of games you make as well as development time.  Strategy really begins to kick in here. When you get to the point where you can start making Engine specialists, Level Design specialists, and other disciplines you’ll have to carefully plan to not tip the scales too far in any one direction.The game industry is in a constant state of flux, and platform leaders have a chance of changing with the introduction of new devices.  Snarky plays on the real world give you things like the “Play System”, “Ninvento TES”, “G64”, and many more that I don’t want to spoil for you.  Developing on these platforms means paying a huge lump sum to the parent company before you can even start, so building a game on a new platform could be costly.  That said, if that’s where the market is, you’ll have to join the fight where it lies.When I finish some games I smile, nod, and then shelve them forever.  Once I completed Game Dev Tycoon I immediately fired it up for round 2. For the price of a cup of coffee you can pick this game up. Don’t be one of the 97% that pirated it.  Game Dev Tycoon is the one Tycoon title worth buying.Recommended "

												Pretty simple game, but loses its replayability after a while.It is fun to play through the game the first time, but after you have done it a couple of times there isn't really anything worth sticking around for as there isn't much of a difference between each of the games you make. It all starts to blend into a generic switch management game without much draw to replay.Still a good game worth checking out.			"

												Originally, I pirated this game. Totally, straight up, pirated. Played it for an hour, and felt absolutely awful. This game, is hands down one of the best Tycoon styled games in YEARS. Played it for days on end and finally got around to getting a steam account. First thing I did? Bought it.  While I haven't played much since purchasing (as free time seems to be harder to find these days...mainly to pay for my crippling addiction to buying games on steam) I loved every single moment of this game and hope to see more from the developers in the near Future. If you haven't played it yet, for the love of Odin; get on it.			"

												Game Dev Tycoon is a lot of fun, but ultimately pretty shallow.  The lack of a randomized console marketplace means that if you know anything about the game industry, you can just make X type of game on Y console at Z point in time and easily crush the marketplace, over and over and over.  And while that's fine for one playthrough, the whole thing plays out the same every single time you go again, meaning there's little to no replayability due to the predictable nature of the game.Visually it looks nice, audio-wise it works out well.  There are a few confusing gameplay elements, things like MMOs and how/when to release expansions aren't explained very well to the player (with some trial and error you can figure it out, but you might bankrupt yourself while you attempt to understand it), and sometimes it's hard to get a sense of what else is 'happening' in the industry as a whole, so you can't really respond to it.If the game added random marketplace behaviors and simulated other companies alongside you(instead of just releasing X game at Y timestamp every time), it would be fantastic and very replayable.  As it stands, I can't recommend it for more than a cheap steam sale purchase.Though there are some mods available for this game that could potentially alleviate some of these issues, it would be better if the developer dealt with them themselves.  Unfortunately, they seem to be done updating the game and there are still some core design decisions here that are unfriendly towards repeat playthroughs.			"

												Game Dev Tycoon is a business simulation game in which you have to replay the history of the gaming industry.The game begins in a garage with a commercial PC. The goal is simple you begin to develop games and try to become more and more successful. Once you move into a small office you can begin to hire staff.  At the start, income will come mostly from contract work. Research which you gain during gameplay can be invested in unlocking new game topics, technology and leveling up the abilities of your staff. Development itself is divided into several stages.Once you have decided a name, topic, genre, and console platform, the player is prompted with three screens of development factors. Each screen has a slider with three different elements, for example world design, sound and graphics. You can equalize all elements or focus on one. The player can later buy licenses to create games for ""Ninvento"" and ""Vega"" consoles, new challenges are introduced in the form of managing a staff, dedicating money to researching new technology and following current market trends. The game has a simple interface which makes it easy to jump in and play. Each run takes around 6-8 hours of gameplay. The game is very predictable, bet on history and you can not go wrong.The graphics of Game Dev Tycoon are very basic and it is fairly a quiet game in terms of sound effects.Game Dev Tycoon feels like a polished and very absorbing online flash game. But I have to admit, it is an addictive little game that eats away your time. So if you are looking for little game to spend your spare time you could try it with Game Dev Tycoon.Sounds 3/10Graphics 4/10Gameplay 7/10Atmosphere 8/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

It is so much fun to experiment and discover what combination of game genre, platform and target audience is appreciated by the gamers. Your own experiences and insight sometimes proove you right, but sometimes they can get your company almost bankrupt.It also gives a very optimistic sneak peek of how an indie game developer's life is.

												When I look at all of the other reviews, I realize I put a lot more time in than some of these other players. The reason being is that this game is VERY fun. It gives you the freedom to name and design the way you want a game to be (to an extent). In my opinion, it is very replayable and you can easily put in many hours on this game. Once you ""beat"" the game, you can continue, although no new consoles will come out other than your own. The UI is simple and not cluttered. I notice many other tycoons make their UIs complex and harder to get the hang of. So this is a definite plus for me.Tl;Dr: If you like tycoon games with a lot of replayability and a sleek UI, this game is for you.			"

												Score: 8.5/10Full Text Review:What Is Game Dev TycoonDid you ever want to start off your own video games company and create the games YOU always dreamed of? Game Dev Tycoon lets you replay the history of gaming by starting your own company in the 80's and start from nothing and become the most successful company in the video games industry.Like in any other business, you wanna reach the top in that industry, you wanna make a name for yourself that people will remember! But in order to achieve that, you have to start from scratch and from nothing. You start the game in the 80's, a time when the first PC's just came out and when the gaming industry was growing fast.The GameGame Dev Tycoon lets you start your adventure as a company in a small garage office as the only employee of your new company. With a small budget of only 70k, you finally start the action and start creating your first video game.The first step in developing your game is to pick a topic, a genre, a console to run in and of course, a catchy name that will attract the attention of gamers and game critics.When you are happy with what you picked, the 2nd part in developing your game is to choose a graphics engine for your future game. When you just start the game you can pick 1 out of 2 graphic engines. The simple text-based engine or the more complicated and advanced 2D engine. Later on you can research better versions of a 2D engine or a 3D engine.After being done with that, the more complex part comes. You are now creating the game itself, you will need to choose how much time to put in each part of the game. Let's say you are making a fantasy RPG game, in it you will want to spend more time on the dialogues and level design and less on the A.I. or if you are making an airplane simulation game then you will wanna spend more time on the engine and gameplay and less time on the story and quests. In order to create a good game, you need to know where to focus on the right elements. This can be mastered by trying and failing. or by basic knowledge (e.g. gameplay/engine on a military action game).While developing your game you will see design and technology points starting to generate. These points will determine how good the game is on design and on the technology. To get a good game you will want this to have a balance and not too much on design or too little on technology.During development, you also generate research points, as I said before, research points are used to get new engines, new game topics, new things that will help your company and its games grow such as marketing and a target audience.As you progresses in the game, new platforms will be released with their own target audience. Companies like Ninvento, Voony, and Mirconoft (A funny small spin-off for Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft) will start releasing their first gaming consoles with each focusing on different audience types.After a few successful games, you will leave your garage and move into a small office building or your own company headquarters that will let you start expanding your business and increasing your games potential even more.With this move, you will start making larger games, hiring employees and more opportunities to stand out in the crowd and finally start making that name of yours.Hiring new staff is an important thing that has to be done; each employee will be different, each with his own skills in design, technology or a balance between the two. Training your staff will improve the chances of releasing larger and more complex games that will require more money and better employees.If you don't have enough fans to create a large/AAA game (100k fans), you can use the help of a publisher who will grant you a small percentage of the total sales if you meet their requirements. If you fail to deliver the score for the game they asked for, you will have to pay a penalty.In your first few times you should aim to create games that are not that much different so that you would know what staff you would need so that you don't buy employees that have too much design and not enough technology skills will make your game fail cause as I said before, to get a good score you need a balance between design and technology.After your game is completed you will get a review from 4 critiques. The review system is not that good and will not provide any in-depth information on why your game got that score. When you get the score, they don't dont tell you why you got that score or tell you what had a major impact on the score.Even if your game is bad, you can create some hype around it using marketing campaigns. The more money you invest in that campaign, the more impact it will have on sales. You can also attend the G3 (like E3) convention to promote your games and boost sales and make lots of hype around your company and the game you are working on.If you need some extra cash or some research points you can accept a contract that you will need to complete within the time limit or you will need to pay the penalty like with a publisher contract.Later on in the game you can create your own research and development lab (R&D) that will grant you access to new projects like a digital distribution platform - Grid (like Steam), MMOs and even huge AAA titles.Creating your own hardware lab also has its advantages; you will be able to develop your own console and compete with other platforms and maybe even achieve the highest market share.The graphics of the game are decent for this kind of game, they are not meant to impress you but more to give you an idea of how successful you are, what are your works doing, etc...The sounds of the game are nice and are good for the background.The game also now offers people to use Steam Workshop to share thier mods and download them through steam.While playing the game I have found no bugs at all.The Good- Game ProgressionMoving on in the game, watching the video game inustry evolve is a lot of fun.- User FriendlyThe game is simple and easy to learn, features a tutrial at start, the rest is easy.- Sounds and Graphics Serve the Game WellThe basic sounds and graphics of the game are more then enough for it.- Simple GameplayNot really complicated and can be mastered by the average player.- Variety of Things to ResearchTopics, consoles, engine features, etc...- Easter EggsConsole names, posters, etc...- Steam WorkshopYep.The Bad- Repetitive (Steam Workshop helps with that to some, didnt help much to me)After a while, making a game is something you do by instincts and becomes too easy and simple.- Reviews for Your Games Are Not Detailed EnoughYou get a score, you at least wanna know what for.- Not Much Place for CreativityIf you try and do what is not what people are use to like a simulation RPG about pirates you will fail.The VerdictGame Dev Tycoon will take you back to the roots of the gaming industry and will let you start your company from scratch and get to the top. The game has a big selection of platforms and has a great game developing management and the ""story"" itself is good.The game has a few easter eggs that would take you back to the old days or remind you of some cool games you probably use to play, sounds and graphics that serves the game well and simple and fun gameplay.One thing that really bothered me was that a major thing in the game development is knowing how to improve your future games and yet the game fails to show you how to do so. It does offer you the option to write a game report but that wont tell you why you got that specific score.I highly recommend this game for any one who likes tycoon games or wants to just have a good time and open his mind to new games or be creative and make cool things such as engines, games and platforms.8.5/10 - Must Play			"

""N/A NOT WORTH A STATEMENT.""- Game HeroFirst of all, I want to thank you Greenheart Games, for the golden product of 2012. Second of all, I am truly impressed with this little indie gem. Telling about the history while going into history. Or at least memory of the players.I remember back in early 2012, developers released article about them, software piracy, and paying for games. I thought it was just a promo for the game that is about that at some point, but then again, it was truth. (If anybody know of wchich article I am speaking, send me a link to it because I cannot find it anywhere.)I am not entirly sure, why this game got me that much. I assume that it was during the time I was writing my seminar work and it was actually about history of gaming industry. Me myself, I am not even considering this game as a Game Dev Simulation. For me it is more about history and I want to say it is tribute to Gaming Fewer era back in the days, when it was hard to get a game, when it was hard to get a thing to play a game. And not even to the era, but also to the game itself. Companies and devs too.This is complex history, in absolutely awesome way provided to the gamers. For somebody it might be repetetive after while, but it all depends on how you do it and how you play it and if you enjoy going through the history and being inside the history. I have replayed that at least 4 times and still do not have enough. I am like the virgin after first sex now - I cannot get over it.However, this is first Greenheart Games project and I am not even going to lie - I WANT ANOTHER!Also I saw some requests of making DLC to the Game Dev Tycoon, and for me, I would support it definitely.Let us updated Greenheart!Bonus Point: Back To The FutureRating: 9.5/10 "

												This game is surprisingly addictive and fun as hell. It is a fun look at the history of real life game development through a fictional alternate world view. So, instead of an Xbox, for example, you have an Mbox. anywya, developing games and seeing how they pan out critically, watching their sales, etc...while also training your staff and learning more about developing games so you can create more powerful game engines that in turn allows you to make more powerful games, while trying to determine which console/computer type to release your games, what genre of game to develop, whether you should go multi plat (later on), whiole seeing what genres are trending, chatting with the press, fielding requests, teaching students, and so on and so forth are only a small part of what is actually a simple game, despite all that, lol.Plus, you can name your games whatever you want. I went with crass, vulgar, and offensive, lol. My company name in fact is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Disks for example (and that is relatively minor in my list of awful offenses in the game, lol).Anyway, this is a really, really, really, really fun game that I recommend trying out. You cant possibly conceive of how cool this game is without taking the leap and adding it to your library. Do this thing!9/10			"

												Although you probably won't find yourself wanting to go beyond a single 10 hour-ish playthrough, while it lasts it's a surprisingly fun, deceptively deep strategy game that allows you to work both halves of your brain, first pushing you to logically determine the right mix of genre, audience, platform, and developer skills to create that 10 out of 10 masterpiece, and then allowing you to give that masterpiece the most creatively ludicrous or obscene title your devious little mind can come up with.

												AAAAaaaa.... The bubbles pops up and the game I am developing gets better and better!!This is a very simple Tycoon game that's centered around our favorite industry. The game industry. You start out a your Garage around 1980 and eventually grow the company into a modem computer lab and make AAA titles! Probably take around 10 hours for 1 play though but takes quite a bit longer to master all the hints.(yes hints carries over each game even if you get game over).Not much story in it except we see all our favorite game consoles in a bit name change show up and then rise and fall during the electrical and digital age until now. Everything is number based with some randomized luck factor. Quite good music and sound effect is a bonus to this game. Last time I had this much fun seeing bubble adding states would be plague inc.The execution and planning is very well done and organized and interface is quite friendly too. Personally i think the game is a bit too fast paced that could use a bit slow down but difficulty will probably drop because it anyways.A solid 9/10 for this Tycoon game. I wish every Tycoon game is this well game.			"

												I can say without a doubt Game Dev Tycoon is one of the most unique games I have ever played. It is fulled with simple but fun and filling gameplay, that I find hard to describe. What it comes down to, gameplay wise is avoiding bankruptcy in your dev studio by releasign gmaes and doing contract work regularly, all while trying to release that hit game.  You hite staff, They each have four stats that increase with experiacne nad training, speed, research, design, and technology.      After you have you character and your staff good to go, you start making games, by choosing categorys, themes, genres, platforms and then deciding how to use your time developing graphics, gameplay, world design, etc.  Your research decides what you can make, so the more you research the broader and more complete games you can make. The default game runs your studio through 35 years of development, though the game has full mod support on the steam workshop, and has custom games.    I recommend Game Dev Tycoon to indie fans, or anyone who thinks it may be interesting, its really not that bad.			"

Game Dev Tycoon is a cute and witty take on the video game development process.  There is a certain level of addiction the game instills in the player, pushing you to continue to develop new titles or create new businesses to try and squeeze out the best review scores ensuring a steady stream of sales which equates to more cash for your little simulated development company. The pacing works well and gives you roughly 6-8 hours of play time for the 30 years you get to play. Once you reach the end the game does allow you to keep going, but no more story elements unfold (nothing beyond the PS4 and next Xbox).If you can find Game Dev Tycoon on sale on Steam it’s certainly worth picking up.THE GOOD- Addictive gameplay- Solid design- It is easy to understand- Fun real life gaming representations- You can interact with the communityTHE BAD- Can be very easy- Flat gameplayDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE			"

It's funny for few hours but after some time it's getting boring, so if you are looking a strategy game for whole winter, this is just not it.VERDICT:If you in the mood to play simple tycoon and you dreamed whole your life about creating your own video games, you've just found the solution.Like this review?

												I really wish we had a yellow ""neutral"" option for reviewing a game, because this game really has a lot of great things going for it. Unfortunately, it also has quite a few bad things going for it that limited my enjoyment. Overall I'm marking this negative because even though the game was enjoyable, I find that it isn't worth $10.Before I get into the negative aspects I'll say what I liked about it. The graphic and graphic style is very nice. The sounds are pleasant and satisfying. The UI is a little finicky, but overall quite nice. Gameplay is also quite calming, and I found this game fun to play while watching something on my second monitor. Micromanagement is obviously a part of the game but not so much that its overbearing.So here's the bad parts. First, how the game works (in brief). In this game, you develop a game. You then get a rating from 4 reviewing companies on a 1-10 scale. How high your game is on the scale directly affects sales.This is all fine and well, but there is some obvious tom foolery in how the rating system works. You can read more about the finer details on other reviews here, but in short, if you do well early on, you'll do worse later. That's right: you can develop an amazing game with a damn near perfect design/tech ratio, release time, console match, playerbase match, ALL the matches, and get an average rating of 6.75 because you released a blockbuster game a while ago.Effectively the game punishes you for doing well. Pretty lame, right?There's also some more drawbacks. Things like the fact that there's no competition. Nil. You feel like you're the only person developing anything because you ARE. You're always the developer of those smash hit games like ""Dance/Casual"" for the ""Wuu"" (AKA Dance Dance Revolution). There's no such thing as a topic being overdone by anyone except you. This is a HUGE drawback for a game that is essentially a business tycoon. Hell, you can set up booths at video game conventions to build hype for your game, and the game tells you that you were the 75th most popular booth at the convention.Who the hell are those other 75 companies ahead of you? You have no idea because they don't exist! I wanted to play as the gamer's-dream, consumer-friendly company that eventually rises above its competitors because of how committed it is to its playerbase. But you can't do that because there's nothing to rise against except game reviewers that critique you based on a game you released 8 years ago.Another problem I have is the lack of choices. You'd think that, being a game development company, you'd be able to be creative in how you run your company. But really, you don't do much. You make games of a certain genre and topic (which you'd think is room for creativity, but it really isn't because you're essentially just forced to methodically go through and exhaust every genre/topic combo you have). You give the game a name. That's about it. Sometimes you have choices, like some fans want you to release an old engine you made. You can choose to release it, sell it, or not release it at all. The problem is, there's virtually no drawback to NOT releasing it. You lose a bit of money by releasing it but the amount is so small that its virtually insignificant. The only reason you would choose not to release it is if you want to roleplay the ""evil moneygrubbing company"". Which while fun, is still roleplaying, rather than just playing the game.So overall I found the game okay. It's worth about $5.00 in my opinion. I think the developers of this game did an alright job, especially for a first release, and what is clearly a passion project. But they left out some key components of what makes a good business/management tycoon and that's what put this review in the negative section.			"

												A game about making games, and if you wanted you could make a game about making games in this game about making games. You might even call that game 'Xzibit's Exhibit'. Maybe.You start as a lone game developer in your garage during the 80s, you work away making basic games and hoping they'll be successful. For legal reasons real life consoles and PCs names aren't used (however this is easily changed with mods), but the game does a good job of hinting at which 'console era' you're working in.It even has loose story elements as it recreates historic console releases and events, so if you know your gaming history you might be able to plan around these accordingly. As you progress through the game, and with each game you make you gain experience, which you can use to learn new aspects for your games as you create the 'perfect game engine' for your crazy creations. You might want to have a one-use-for-all Engine, or you might even create Genre Specific engines. However, you'll soon realise that time and resource management will become an issue the bigger you aim with your gaming projects.You can choose a Topic and the sub genres within it - Sports RPG? Zombie Simulator? Then within that design process you choose where to allocate time and effort - gameplay? Sound? Level Design? What's more important to you?

I do wish it went a little deeper, but what it does offer was good enough to spend 6+ hours in the '35 Year' Storyline playthough. In short it's a fun game, and the fun comes from your imagination and sharing your creation with friends. What will your biggest game be?			"

												Developing your company from a garage developer to a well known indie developer is really fun, and enough for me to recommend this game, however:1. The replayability is not great, each game is pretty similar2. The modding community is a bit scarce3. The system for rating games is bad. Because you compete against youself, if you make a really good game, all your games after that will get bad ratings unless they are better than your really good game. This is the worst thing about the game because it discourages you from making good games and encourages you to make games that are just a little bit better than your last, whcih isn't fun.If the devs make a sequel and take the community's advice on board it could be a masterpiece because this is a great concept.7/10			"

												I can't really figure this one out. Ostensibly, this is a game along the lines of AeroBiz or Railroad Tycoon, where your job is to run a company and make lots of money, in this case by developing video games. It's got a cute, quirky aesthetic and some interesting pseudo-RPG elements, which is neat, but...Well, frankly, this game seems incredibly, frustratingly random.To wit; I spent about an hour bankrupting my company by making what seemed like completely rational, reasonable choices for a game developer to make. Making text adventures for the PC seemed like a good idea, for example. But it turns out text adventures are a dead-end because you can't level up other areas, which cripples you long-term. It also seems to penalize actual CREATIVITY; for example, I can think of a half-dozen awesome ways to do a Wild West-themed strategy game using SNES-level tech. However, Wild West and Strategy, as far as this game is concerned, Do Not Go Together, so no matter how WELL I make the game, it will tank in reviews and sell nothing.Frustrated, I decided to look up guides of game/genre combos, and discovered that you pretty much have to make certain TYPES of games to have any chance of success.  So, I tried again, this time slavishly obeying the standards of what genre/theme combos were optimal, setting development resources to the 'perfect' levels... and my games still tanked and sold like crap. The algorithm for how a game reviews seems to have NOTHING AT ALL to do with the actual Design and Tech points; I've had games in the 20s for Design and Tech earn millions and games where they were both high-60s get scores of 4s and 3s, during the SAME YEAR.I feel like there's a significant difference between how the game ACTUALLY works and how the game TELLS YOU it works. Like, design and tech score obviously mean SOMETHING, but WHAT? There's no context for what '1 point of design' actually SIGNIFIES. And when you introduce the Hype Factor and the Review Scores, both of which are different numbers that are factored in different ways -it doesn't explain to you-, the result is a game where you're basically comparing three different types of numbers measured on three different scales which all clearly interact, but how that interaction actually occurs is completely opaque and arcane. Then you stack the game engine add-ons, none of which seem to ACTUALLY contribute much to overall finished product as much as 'not having this thing by this in-game year will tank your scores.' It doesn't feel like a game so much as a random number generator with pseudo-meaningful choices.I can't make sense of this game. I tried playing it blind, and I tried playing it with a guide, and both options resulted in roughly the same end-result. As much as I like the concept and aesthetic, I just can't really recommend it.			"

												Short Version-Good Game, slow paced but fun. If you like Tycoon games you will probably like this.Long Version-15 hours in and it still has my attention. For a non-action game that is something impressive. For me this game is perfect during long lectures on my school laptop. kept in windowed mode you can switch to another window easily and it pauses on its own when you do this. The sound is somewaht unnecissary for this game so it is fine to play muted. Small download with minor system requirements means that this game can be installed and run on just about any computer. The gameplay itself is engaging, with multiple genres and topics and consoles to work with there is allways new combinations to experiment with. the achievements are a mix of introductory awards, easter eggs that are rather witty and some downright challenging achievements associated with game sales. Although the game is rather inexpensive i personally waited until it was on sale to purchase, and i would probably suggest doing the same if you are on the fence about this sort of game. In all honesty i was not expecting to get as much enjoyment out of this game as i have and i can understand the hesitation about buying a game set in a seies of rooms with your avatar sitting at a desk pushing buttons while small decissions are made about what game to make. While action fans are going to be turned off by that the fans of tycoon games might be dissapointed by the lack of visual stimulation that could be gained in games like zoo and roller coaster tycoon. In the end this game serves an niche audiance but i suggest that anyone on the fence gives this a chance because it is more ingaging and fuffiling than words or the trailer can describe.8/10			"

												I think almost every gamer once dreamed of developing games. With Game Dev Tycoon, everyone can imagine yourself with your own company, creating your own games, engines and technologies. GDT is a casual and light-hearted game about making games for people who love games! It's a great time killer with a lot of options to keep you occupied for a while and Steam Workshop support with nice mods from the community. GDT isn't great as Theme Hospital, for instance, but it's worth your time. You can have fun and discover some things about the gaming industry.			"

												There's nothing quite like seeing your latest game getting high reviews and your sales and profits start to soar, to build your own console and MMO. This is an awesome game to play, whether you're wanting to kill some time or wanting to play a game for a few hours. 10/10, would buy it any day.			"

												I admit it, I have 30+ hours of playing this game on record. Is it addictive? Maybe. Is it good? Not exactly.Game Dev Tycoon is one of less than a half-dozen in this very specific genre. That is its success. It's failure is that, in a world full of very solid sim games, it lacks balance and depth, delivering only moderately clever puns and a menial supply of easter eggs to keep you coming back. If there were a better Game Development simulator out there, I'd be playing that one, but there isn't. Game Dev Tycoon as a title represents what I want in a game, but not what exists.Final score...4/10 Not good, not bad... simulation games are great for pc... ;-)			"

												Game Dev Tycoon, or GDT, is a video game about developing games. Game Dev Tycoon was developed by Greenheart Games and released in 2012. GDT is a very simple yet beautiful game. The game is user-friendly and it reinforces this by a clean UI that packs many features in a simplistic tone. For example, the menu button would have a research tab, a developing games tab, among others. These features would be packed in a list of sorts where a click to each individual tab brings up another small window. It allows for the player to quickly understand the various features without feeling there is too much.Creating a game is very nice and rewarding. The development of games is easy in that you have a few sliders and you produce a game to how you feel it would be best. For example, making a music game? Choose the music genre and move the various sliders to how you feel is best in getting a 10/10 on a game. The idea behind the sliders is that the more importance you have on a particular slider, ie. gameplay the more your employees and yourself focus on that aspect. However, the bigger picture in determining whether your game will be great is the list at the top of the menu that are bubbles. These bubbles mean four different things. One is bugs, the amount of bugs in the game you are making. Another is technology, how much your employees incorporate into the technology side of things in developing your game. Another is design, how much your employees incorporate into the design of the game like story, and research. Research allows the player to research more features to place into a game and to unlock new things throughout the game. But to summarise these four bubbles, they affect your game. You want the least amount of bugs and the most amount of design and technology points to ensure a better chance of getting a higher rated game. The best way to produce more is to train your employees. If you have not noticed it is a cycle that is easy to understand once you get into the game. So the gameplay is simple. In a short summary, you make games. You imprve your skills making games. You hire employees to help on games and you train them to accumulate more design and technology points, which garners you higher ratings for games. The game is pretty limited. The features list is basic and has less depth than the newly-released Mad Games Tycoon. The You will get a good thirty years in game, which is a few hours, but there is essentially no late game. Just a full-on sandbox experience that has replayability, but not a ton. To use myself as a benchmark, I played about 40+ hours of GDT when it was released then purchased on Steam and stopped at eight hours. So for the price of $9.99, you will get value out of the game.Overall, the game is a really good game. The clean UI and simplicity of the game allows the user to enjoy playing the game instead of attempting to understand the game for several hours. The gameplay is a cycle and everything is rewarded from continously developing games to hiring employees and even making your own console. The gameplay is basic, which makes it fun and easy. At $9.99, I recommend the game. 8.5/10----Thanks for reading my review!

												I would have loved this game if the machanics were sensible, but they aren't. In Game Dev Tycoon you are a game developer starting out in your garage, who gradually builds thier studio until they are a AAA gaming juggernaut. You select games of different genres (action, adventure, RPG, ect), differnent topics (Sci-fi, fantasy, history ect) and then you empaphasize different elements of your game (graphics, gamplay, dialogue, ect).  Every game you make is given a review on a scale of 1 to 10. Depending on your choices your game can be a massive hit or a total failure. The object is to make good games by combining the right combination of genres, with good emphasis, and good timing. Right? Unfortuantely, no. The math is a bit complicated, but essentially the game is always comparing your to your highest score recieved for a previous game review. The game review score you get is based on a hidden score, and then compared to your highest previous hidden score. This make it possible to produce a very high quality game, get a great score, and then to produce a game that is very nearly as good for every game you make after and get poor score. The optimal way to play is NOT to maximize your score every time, but to start low, that is to intentionaly produce a bad or mediocre game, so you can easily and gradually impove on your scores as you go. If you figure the system of bonuses out early and nail a couple of games it actually hurts you in the long run, making for a very confusing and counter intuitive experience. You can end up in scenarios where you intentionally sabatoge your game by releasing it with more bugs or by skewing your ratio, so that you don't accidentially create something much better than anything you have previously done. This turns the game into a confusing and tedious set of spreadsheet functions, instead of what it really ought to be; a game simulator that rewrads you for making good games.  I really enjoyed Game Dev Tycoon in every other respect. Its clever, and well put together, and icrediably addicting. Unfortunately the underlying math of the game forces you to think along lines that are counter to what makes Game Dev fun in the first place. For that reason, instead of being an amazing buy, it is instead a bitter disapointment.			"

												Awesome game. You begin as a single dev. in your garage, and end up being one of the biggest team ever. But on your way, you will encounter conflicts with other bigger teams and companies, suffer from financial issues, you may have to ask your bank for more money.Will you release buggy games to make as much $$$ as possible? Or will you be the kind of person that tries to make nice little gems, and gain love from your fans?It's all up to you, but be careful, as your ambitions may be your worst enemies...			"

												This game is suspiciously close to being a complete rip-off of Game Dev Story, the famous iOS title of the same genre. It expands on Game Dev Story overall, but not by very much, and not particularly well. The visuals are prettier, sure, but only if you look past the terrible interface. Oh, and as for the game development part - the in-game review system is so insane that you'd have to randomly lace cereal boxes with narcotics to get the same type effect in the real world. I agree that Game Dev Story wasn't really realistic in that department, either, but at least it had some logic to it - you were always getting better, so your games, naturally, were always getting better. I suppose I should applaud this Tycoon game for at least attempting to be more realistic, audience-wise, but it takes it to the point where you can't really understand how to reproduce good results. Seeing as I generally try to be successful at the games that I play, I found myself reading a multi-page printout from the web just to know how to configure the sliders correctly for a (hopefully) positive outcome. Multiple pages of tables with numbers, combinations, probabilities, all that nonsense, and yet, I can't say it made much of a difference. And at the end of the day, I have to believe that life can be better than that. Over time, just like Game Dev Story, Tycoon remembers good combinations and makes it easier for you to produce good results... but even so, why is it so complicated to produce even semi-consistent results? Perhaps there's just something in the cereal.			"

												REVIEW FOR GAME DEV TYCOON:Game Dev Tycoon is a game I really wanted when I played it as a kid. So very recently, I've got myself my first Steam Acount and played only Level 1 of this game. So was the game good as I remembered it when I played the DEMO or a waste of time?Sounds:So the music sounds okay. I can hum a few tones from the game.  6/10Gameplay:So this is a business tycoon game. A really popular concept. Now I've heard that there is another Game Dev Game, but I think that this game is better. Plus I'd never played the other one people talk about. You are going around making games and getting fans and money. And if you make a hit game, you may get an office. Now I haven't played the office yet, but holy crap is this game fun. It also makes you think sometimes. If I had a few flaws, when you start the game you may get a white screen unless you clear the cache or something. Also it is pretty hard to come up with some ideas but that is a realsitc concept so maybe I am bashing it for what it is. The games really fun and I think you should play it! 8/10Story:The Story is just epic. While I don't think younger gamers would really understand it (unless they look in the history books), it well be faithful to some gamers. Due to copyright issues they changed the company's names but you can get an easter egg if you type one of the Offical Names. I hope it gets better! 9/10Graphics:They look pretty darn good. They look very smooth and maybe a little generic but I don't have a lot of complaints. 7/10Replay?:This game is something that you may play a few times after 43 years in the game. It could be very fun to create a ton of games. And maybe you would like story. Just to be fair I will give Replay: 7/10Is this game Good?:Yes it is! It is a game that I think every video gamer should play unless they hate tycoon business games. It is fun and faithful to gaming. I'll give this game 8/10 A must buy! "

The Inception of GamesBasically this is a game where you build games. This game can be played for hours on end as you start off with basically nothing and work your way up to be a big game development company. There are many great things about this game, one of these is that it has a huge amount of replay value as there are so many possible game combinations to choose from. This game is very easy to understand and to get into and lots of fun which is why its definitely worth trying!			"

												In one word Game Dev Tycoon can be reported as ""Acceptable"".Surely, this isn't a ""brilliant-you-shouldn't-miss"". It's a short game, and doesn't have grip of ""one-more-turn..."" strategies.But it's ok, since the topic is so rare and game process is enjoyable and polished up to flawless. Well worth for appox. 10-12 hours of your interest, and possibly can keep on for thousand(s) hours ""to catch them all"". No need to, really, it's better when you left something on plate.So, should you buy it?It's good pick for good game collection, good ""office tycoon"" experience, and, most of all, good example of what some decent programmer can make on his own today. Really, I remember some ""evolution-yourself-making-your-thing""-themed games with just texts and tables. Now, there are nice video, audio and all other supplemental things, like cloud-saving.Not recommended for ""only AAA gamers"" and complete casuals, 'cause it's a tribute to games development history, and those people most probably don't care for this.But... you're a hardcore, right?I mark it as 7,5/10, ""a good little tycoon"".

												I enjoyed playing this game more than 20 hours yet as the game says, it falls a bit short. After realizing that your past success has a negative effect on your later titles, I lost all my pleasure to play it. I enjoy investing a lot for a game and from that point I would like to be infront of the era in the game. I want to feel like I'm doing rocket science in the prehistoric era but the game does never allows it because I have to beat my own success after that.It certainly has a tasteful concept but I like replayability, different starts and real AI competitors in my tycoon. I would recommend this game to other game devs but not to strategy lovers.			"

Game Dev Tycoon is a casual business sim game. From the post-console crash of the 80s to modern gaming scene, you run an indie game studio from your garage, aiming to become a world-renowned developer team.Pros: You progress through different location, from your garage, to small office, to upgraded small office, to a larger office allowing expansions. Plenty of freedom in game type, select one (or later two) genre, a theme (from a huge amount), a target audience, a game engine (which you develop as you research new technologies and assemble new engines) and a platform (allowing multi-platform later in the game). You can hire additional staff members (while keeping a balance of design and technology), train them, and specialize them if the various fields you focus on through the various development stages. As you progress through the years, the game parodies events from actual gaming history, a nice wink to “old school” gamers.Cons: The game is very, very simplified. There is no clear competition, no way to determine how much you concentrate on tech use (besides selecting whether or not you use them at all), no way to grow to a larger company (the likes of which, say EA did, from a small indie studio to one of the largest publishers). Topic/genre/target audience combinations are fixed no manner how good your game’s specs are (and I’m sure you can think of actual games that broke those conventions and were great successes). The difficulty grows with your success: hit a 10/10 game and make your life hell for the next few games until you develop better techs and train your team more, until you eventually peak and can’t continue without restarting a new game.Verdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to youThis is a fun and addictive game! Sure, there are games that dig in deeper into realism (such as GamersGoMakers), but if you just want a casual game you’ll play an hour or two (or more) at the time, give this one a try!—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												What an addicting Game!Starting in a garage, you build your own gaming company. You develope through 35 years of gaming industry, devolping (hopefully) the milestone games, everybody loves. With increasing success you gather more fans, move into bigger buildings, hire employees and devolp biger games. Creating the games at first seems simple, but nuances can decide between a hit and a flop. With more research, come more options, and with more options come more decisions. Balancing the focus of the games, training employees, researching new topics and gaming aspects simply leave you sitting hours infront of this gem.Plus, marvellous easter eggs, which can be obtained via hints, leave you hunting for achievements, to become the gaming mogul, you always dreamed of becoming.Pros+ Great Story (travelling through 35 years of gaming industry)+ Although at first seeming limited, the options creating a game are just endless+ Just the right difficulty. At the start it seems so easy, but going on, it gets so hard.+ Superb Easter Eggs (For Gamers only)+ Just pure Fun, if you enjoy Simulations/Strategy and a bit of RPGCons- Sometimes frustrating when you invest millions in creating a game, and everything seems rght, but it turns out to be average or a flop- You will loose all your spare time, because it is a so addicting game :D			"

												Nostalgia and a fun concept can't overcome serious misteps in the game's mechanics.  Ambiguity in the feedback will have you scratching your head as you attempt to connect decisions you make in the development cycle to the resulting game reviews and scores.  At times you will struggle to understand what tradeoffs, if any, are tied to your choices.  If, out of frustration, you turn to online information in your attempt to better understand how the game calculates failure and success, you'll only increase your disappointment, since, for some inexplicable reason, the developers decided that success in Game Dev Tycoon should not be based on making the best game possible each development cycle, but rather on creating games that are only marginally better than your previous one.  That's right.  A surefire way to undermine your ability to get good reviews on future games is to make your current one too much fun.Apparently, the developers of Game Dev Tycoon took that strategy to heart.  Their chosen core mechanic will keep a game with plenty of potential from ever being too much fun.			"

												This game contains the distinctive history of Computer Gaming like the Commodore 64 and how Nintendo broke up with Sony in 1993. With your own choice of making games with the integral engine components and research, you can also create your own games console near the end.The only disappointment I find is the ZX Spectrum, Amiga and the Atari not featured in there as they were a big hit, especially in the UK during the aftermath of the US Video Games Crash 1983. But you can get 3rd party mods to enhance your game here, but be warned as those mods could corrupt your saves.			"

												This is a very addictive game. You start alone in your garage in the 80's. Your long term goal is to grow bigger as a company and eventually become a huge game company. In order to achieve that, you'll have to sell hit games and hire people to work with you. You can research new topics for your games as well as developping your own engines to give your games the right assets. Your sells are heavely influenced by the reviews game magazines gives to your games which make it crucial for you to keep on with the newest technologies out there.Anyway, BUY IT!

												Game Dev Tycoon... Well, I don't usually like or even play this kind of games, but I clap my hands twice for this one!!! This is seriously one of the best and most addicting games I've played in a while! It simply gives you the opportunity to feel what it is like to make your own games. It is beautifully made and has a lot of cool features, like easter eggs...You can pretend to be any company in the world, or you could create yours, as well as the games you'll make! When you finish the game by reaching year 35 (or any other you've chosen), you don't have to quit the game, you can keep playing it 'til the game gets boring! And the more you play, the better your games will be! I'm enjoying my break/vacation from game development playing a dev game... That's kind of funny! haha9.5/10			"

  Game Dev Tycoon.Developer: Greenheart GamesPublisher: Greenheart GamesReleased: April 28, 2013   Summary:  Game Dev Tycoon is a business simulation game in which you replay the history of the gaming industry by starting your own video game development company in the 80s. Create best selling games. Research new technologies and invent new game types. Become the leader of the market and gain worldwide fans. Game Dev Tycoon is a great casual game, and for the price I really can't complain. It's an indie endeavor, and while it doesn't achieve great technological marks it is very entertaining and will keep you occupied for hours (unless you pirated it! Shame!) as you progress through the different levels of the game. The mechanics can be a little obscure at first, but once you master managing your staff and achieving balance it becomes much easier to produce hits and dig into the deeper end-game level content. I could play this game for hours and days. Hard to master as it has a unique mathematical algorithm to rate the games you make based on a number of different variety of mixing. ~GildaTheGriffin.

												This game was really amusing.  I love how you begin the game in your garage, car covered, and it's just you doing what you love.  Next thing you know as you progress you are given options to move to a newer space, make various moral decisions, hire a team and of course create better games.  Though the game is short lived... 35 years; you are able to continue afterwards.  I am looking forward to seeing maybe some more content as far as customizations and such.  I must say the comic relief was quite funny.  While streaming this game, viewers did ask if there was an ability to customize your office.  Answer is not really.  You will be given some options to add improvements such as air conditioning, moving to a new office, hiring new staff etc.  But the focus of the game is to make it big in the gaming industry.Some Screenies

												I love most of this game... But there is one thing: All of your scores are based on your previous scores! This means that you HAVE to constantly improve. Staying at the same level of ability means you will have a lower score. It means a constant 10 streak is almost impossible, and if you make 'the perfect game' you can never do it again. This really ruined this game for me.			"

												Game Dev Tycoon is a fun and cute game, and I really enjoyed my two playthroughs. I will recommend it to anyone that likes simulation management games.  The game is summed up well in the descriptions, so this review will more be my experience with the game and nitpicks.I haven't fully figured out why some of my games fail, even though they were a great combination, and others just explode on the market. Which lead to me doing significantly worse during my second playthrough. The bank lending me money at least once during almost every stage of the game, but it was actually a bit funnier and more challenging when I constantly fluctuated between hits and failures. The last phase was way to easy on my first playthrough, because I had no specialists in my team, so I didn't go into the labs. But even though spending money on discovering things in the lab and building consoles made it more challenging, it made it way more fun, and on my last years of my second playthrough I had the second generation of my console out and a hit MMORPG.The reviewers in the game can be jerks. On my first playthrough I made a lot of hit games, and there were constantly two of them that switched between giving me 9, so I got 9.75 instead of perfect ten. Felt like they were just trying to keep me from getting the achievement. :( And like I said, I got worse at the game the second time, so I'm probably never gonna get that achievement.There is a lot in the game, but it never gets too complex to manage. The game that comes closest to the same experience of playing for me is probably the sims series. Where you just keep playing and there is so much to do, and a lot of minor variables, but it is all easily presented and managable. However... It suffers from the same problem that the main Sims games have for, which is that there are no natural ""exit points"" no real quests, so it can be hard to stop before you reach the end and can lead to game burnout eventurally. (I know sims doesn't have an end, but this game kinda has one where you get your end score) You could argue every time you finish a game within the game it is an exit, but then you get the reviews, then it goes on the market, and while it is on the market or before it gets reviewed you put your team on the task of developing, reaching, or training something else. So there is no place where the game feels like it is a natural place to take a break I would love if they make a sequel or spinoff game where they include some kind of quests or in game objectives beyond the achievements.But it is still a topranking simulation game, and I am glad I bought it. 9.75/10			"

												A game where you make games.  Basically you run a game developer company from the garage to the skyrise.  There are many things to blend together to get different results.  Special Events, Conventions, put an ad in a magazine.  Later your able to hire other people so it also becomes a management game, you'll have to send your employees on vacation when they get tired or they wont produce.  Also can train your employees.  Later in the game, you can make your own console, MMO's and even exspansions on those MMO's.  8/10			"

Later you will unlock more detailed options like Research development lab, technological lab to create own consoles, better quality games, different topics and genres, you have to watch over every detail to make a successful game. Hope there will be some update in near future adding new content that would go deeper. "

												Game Dev Tycoon is a game that can be challenging at first, but is extremely satisfying once you get farther. When I started out, I really hated how all my games that I thought would be really cool came out with crappy reviews and awful sales. I didn't like that to the point where I decided to use guides on the internet to try and improve my games. I don't regret doing it, because I really hated playing the game without it, and it helped a lot. One thing about this game is that it's really hard to get started. It takes a long time to get all the hints and then to know how to use them to the best, and I still haven't unlocked all of them after creating Game Reports after every game. I've still been continuing to use guides, and it's been improving the game for me.Another thing I don't like is how random the game reviewing system still feels. Sometimes I will follow the hints and guides exactly (and since I'm using the hints too, it's not just the guide being wrong) and the game will still come out with a 6-7 review.I think it can be challenging to determine what I should be using my research points on, and even more so as I'm getting farther in the game and I need to start having specialists in certain areas. I know this is something you have to learn on your own, but this is a situation similar to getting the topic-genre-gaming device right where it's not worth the effort to look into, and it's a nice thing to know in advance.The one thing in the game that has bothered me the most, however, is the lack of a reminder to name your game. My biggest issue for a really long time was forgetting to name my games, and I know you aren't reminded to do that because it affects the reviewing process, but I feel like if you got a little reminder to name a game it could go a long way. In my opinion, it doesn't even make sense to let a game called ""Game #38"" onto the market anyways, it doesn't sound like a game at all. The way I finally got myself to remember to name games is by being in a skype call with my friends and getting them to select from a bunch of options to develop my games, and then getting them to name it to make it more fun. Other than that, more than half my games have been unnamed.However, this game is still really fun. Where it does have it's downsides, there is still something that keeps me playing. One thing might simply be that I haven't completed the game yet, or that I want to get more achievements, but one of my favourite things is easily how satisfying it is to make a successful game. The income rate is amazing, I love seeing my money increase, and every time I see a ""10"" on the initial reviews I know I'm in for a treat.Overall, this game may not be worth a full $10, but if it's ever on sale at a price of less than $5 I easily recommend that you get it. It has some faults, but when you succeed it's easily worth the sadness of previous failures.			"

												Fun little management sim with some limitations. Although enjoyable for a while, there is not a lot of depth in the gameplay. You basically choose a combination of genres/topics/platforms for a game, researching and improving your skills along your journey to make more complex (and hopefully better rating) games. The better the ratings after release, the more money you get to grow your business. You will progress from your garage to corporate office and hire employees along the way. There are also a few other basic things you can do like training employees, research new tech, marketing & sign with publishers. Game Dev Tycoon uses some play-on-words to 'loosely' follow historical references to progress the game through release of new consoles and hardware to modern day.Gaming combinations that might be popular in real life don't necessarily correspond to a good game in Game Dev Tycoon and there are also some strange ones you can choose. Mastering the game really come down to memorising what combos works (through trial & error) which starts to detract from the experience after you have played a few games. What you have learned in previous games can be kept for future games to help out. I was really hoping there would be more strategic depth and more varied tactics you could use to change the game outcome and wanted to be able to go all the way to an EA or Valve type of game dev. Regrettably, you can only have 6 employees and is not designed to be open ended with a fixed end point finalising your game. A game on making games is a great concept. Fulfilling many gamers fantasies of developing their own unique games, but this needs more content, more detail, much more customisation & strategy to become something special. Game Dev Tycoon is still a decent bit of fun, despite it being simplistic and with limited replayability so gets the 'Thumbs Up' from me!If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!

												How it goes whenever i start this game.  ""Jeez I guess I'll play for an hour but only an hour cause I'm tired.""  5 hours later ""gosh I'm passing out I guess I'll just go for one more hour""... 3 hours later ""someone shoot me please""What a deceptively fun game.  Its the most casual game I have ever played outside of solitaire or minesweeper.  But its so addicting.  Basically all you're doing is deciding what kind of game you're company will make next.  And by make i mean watch as little colored balls fly up the screen and add numbers and move sliders on where development goes.  Is you're next game a hit? Or will it flop?  Depends.  Gotta find good mix of genres and platforms.... I learned the hard way horror doesn't do well on the Gameboy.  But on the flipside I basically made Mario Kart on the Dreamcast and made millions.  Its these little things scattered throughout that makes this game work.  Be warned it will suck you in if you let it.  That need to make another game that doesn't get all 3s becomes an obsession.

												After making many games based off of cats, I was a millionaire. I was rolling in money, I had great employees, a great office, great making skills, everything I could ever want. I was young and dumb, and decided to make some sequels. That is when things went down hill, I mad a sequel to my multi-million dollar game ""Who sued my Cat?"" and it was a flop. I made a sequal to my hit ""Prison Simulator"" and lost millions. I made a sequel to ""Aliens ate my Cat"" and failed big time. And then I went bankrupt... But I decided to play again, and again, and again. I will never stop playing this game. I will one day be a trillionaire. Epic Games will succeed!			"

												Just a fun and wonderful game. It will eat up hours of your time if you enjoy tycoon simulation type games. It is easy to pick up and easy to play for hours on end while losing track of time. Immersive enough to be replayable as well. I really don't have many critisisms of this game except maybe that it can get redundant after some time but that is why they added modding!			"

												I had orginally bought Game Dev Tycoon of their website when it first came out, I only just got round to putting the steam code in.Let me first say, if you can create a dancing simulator called Slappin Dancin Bit**es you will have good fun.First let me say, Game Dev Tycoon has a solid idea behind it, the use of the sliders to decide what you want to spend your time on can often be annoying.The reviews sometimes seem to be alittle harsh, maybe though its because I make bad games.Currently, on steam I havent played that much of Game Dev Tycoon, but trust me, I have played many hours of it from when I had it installed off the website. Eventually it does become quite repatative but I feel you will probably go back and play it again like I will.7.5/10			"

												Really amazing Management game where you have to build up a Gaming Company, hire people to work at your company, market your game and alot of other stuff, i bought this game only because i saw Jacksepticeye play it and loved his let's play so i decided to buy it for myself and play it :D, and im really glad i saw that lets play of jack and decided to buy it myself because this is a really amazing indie game, if you like games and really like to get the nostalgia back of how it al began back in the day i would highly recommend you to buy this game because this game is really accurate and is mostly based of of real life stuff that happend in the Golden Gaming Age :D, the music, gameplay and ''storyline'' of the game are really amazing and well done/well composed :)!Overall i just really like this game and would really recommend this game to anyone who likes the gaming industry and just wants to get the nostalgia back of the good ol' days. I must say tho i only have one con with this game and that is that the ''storyline'' is in my opinion tooooooooooo short i would have loved to have a longer story in the game but yeah atleast they allow you to continue with ur company after the main storyline is done which is a cool feature!! Also the workshop has lots of cool mods for the game too if ur interested in mods :)!!9.3/10 #PCMasterRace			"

												4/10This game is very shallow. You might not think so at first but as time goes on you begin to realize that the mechanics are extremely simple yet arbitrary in unnecessary ways. Accomplishments really seem to come all at the same time in each play through and failures are too common for unnecessary reasons. You will find yourself constantly building a company and then watching it come burning to the ground because you released what you thought would be a high ranking game. Game Dev Story on the mobile platforms is far superior to this copy-cat. I really wouldn’t recommend this game as it’s ultimately more frustrating than fun. "

												What is there to say that hasn't already been said? Of the ""Tycoon"" style simulation games, this one certainly isn't the best. However, if you have a deep love of video games, the gaming economy, and the business aspect of video games you'll find this game quite entertaining. Not to mention, those who love management to begin with. There is so much to micromanage in this game, I actually found it hard to find time for everything (although I'm not a huge fan of management games, so that may just be me.)Pros:- Lots of freedom- Great walkthrough of the ""history of gaming""- cute art- fun writing (for the few story aspects)- tons of researchable topics and technologies- great system allowing for combination of genress and game topics- diverse character modelsCons- music gets old, limited music options- reporters ask the the same questions over and over again- sometimes, critics' reviews feel very random- doesn't feel very competitive when you never get to see sales of rival companies			"

												Amazing game 10/10 perfect score. This game is the reason i started game development im not even going to lie when i got to the end game i felt like i wanted to create games and began learning basic code and design and since then ive done nothing but learn and i have this game to thank. Now for the game review i would say it is an addictive yet fun game to play as it pushes the player to try and get better scores with reviews and explains pretty well how games are developed and can even teach players of this generation to apreciate what developers can go through for a game to be published. I would also say for an older type of game that the pixel art looks nice and runs easily for any PC. I strongly recommend for users that are intrested in the games industry to play this as it could maybe give more insight to what happens behind the scenes.			"

												This game was fun for a few hours. It may have been luck, or maybe it was my long love of RPGs, but I hit one out of the park and moved out of the garage after a couple of games. After that the game went stagnant:* The history of gaming unfurls before you, in exactly the same way every time. It's cute to see the ""PlaySystem"" launch or to see the ""Gameling"" dominate mobile gaming for a long time, but putting a real-world analogue into the game is inviting meta analysis. I'd rather see random platforms and performance for an alternate universe feel.* Once you get into the groove, the game becomes exactly as much fun as Microsoft Excel.* The game tries to punish you for making the same game over and over, yet doesn't seem to encourage experimentation and risk-taking. I'm sure it's to do with my own playstyle and missteps, but my company was always one game away from bankruptcy, which made it tough to try that mBox Lawyer RPG instead of another iteration of Vampire RPG for the PC.

												Never before has a game made me want to blow my ♥♥♥♥ing brains out more so than this game.You think you are in control. You think you know what the market wants. You are for sure ready to release that hit game.Then when you are ready to publish your game, Bill ♥♥♥♥tard Bradly decides to throw in a bug at the last second, the market changes so the game you were making is no longer in demand, and the system you had been developing the game for takes a hit in userbase.What was for sure going to be the best possible game in the world, now turns into a mediocre, no one gives a ♥♥♥♥ game that causes you to lose profits out of your ♥♥♥.The bank then decides to be friendly since you are, having a hard time, and gives you $1.5 million cash to help you get back on your feet, but expects you to pay them well over $3 million within a year. And if you refuse you go backrupt.After laying off Bill and sending him to a slave ring for being an incompetent moron, you'll then hire a stunning blonde programmer named Amanda who drinks more coffee in 10 minutes than you should physically be able to consume in a month.You'll then develope a sequel to your greatest hit game ever, to save yourself and to be able to pay that mafia bank back, but then the reviewers will curse you for making a game to similar and you will go under.

												This is a great game if you're craving for the feeling of running a game dev company but don't have the time nor skills to do it.This game takes you through the 30 or so years of video game history, and you participate in everyone of these phrases.I keep coming back to this game to statisfy the itch I get from this, and if you have an interest like I do, you'll probably do the same.PROS:- Great mods- The slider formula allows you for fast and easy gameplay.- The advancement of technology branches out the possibilities later in your journey.- Clever references- Great mods [2].CONS:- This is just me, but after awhile, you start to realize the lack of content and lack of immersion in some phases. There are some times where you want more small features that can really help with the immersion. Unfortunately, it's not there, and  even the mods can't help much with it.- It can get repetitive after awhile, which is why I left it until the itch started coming back.Even with these cons, it's still a very good game. Great job, Greenheart.			"

												I was originally given this game as a gift by a good friend of mine.Usually, I don't tend to delve into Steam at all, I have been pro-console all of my life, until I played this game. After being a fan of simulation games on consoles (with the occasional PC port here and there) such as Football Manager, The Sims, Rollercoaster Tycoon to name but a few, I was skeptical going into playing this game, but boy was I wrong. The game starts you out in a lowly garage with a start-up cost of 70K. Now to some, that is a lot of money to start of with in any game, (well, from your Garage at least) but taking into consideration the fact that it takes 8K a month to run the costs of everything, we can say it is justifiable. You also have the start-up option of running your games from a G64 (a hat-tip to the Commodore 64, which was obviously name changed due to copyright reasons) or the PC. There are also five game topics you are given to start-up with such as, Fantasy, Dungeon, Sports, Surgery and Military, but these can vary when starting up a new game, you could even get topics like Alien or UFO! It all depends on what the computer decides it wants you to have at the beginning. You are able to unlock further topics by 'researching' them with the points you have accumulated for creating games, these points can also be spent on other things such as, improving the games engine, sound (or later on in the game) quests, among others. You are also given the option of choosing which marketable area you would like your game to go to once you have unlocked the 'Marketing' option once you have released enough titles to warrant these, or enough time has elapsed, there are split into three categories E (Everyone), M (Mature) or Y (Young), I only ever used the 'Everyone' option, but that worked well on every topic I did indeed choose. As time progresses, you and the consoles around you do too, shortly into the game, the 'Ninvendo TES' (a homage to the Nintendo NES) comes onto the market, (which in some respects is a good thing as the consoles evolve, just like they did in real life) the G64 comes off of the market and later on you are introduced to other consoles, such as the in-game SNES, Master System, Playstation and eventually, the PS5 (the in-game names now allude me, I apologise). Once you have reached the 1Million currency mark with creating games, you are offered to move into a bigger office, with much more space (I would personally advise this to be taken when you have about 10-20M in the bank, as you'll more than likely go bankrupt if you take this option too early on in the game). You accumulate the money by releasing good, titles (ratings with 7/8s are what I was getting until I released a Racing Simulator game which gave me 9s) which are rated by four gaming magazines. Now, if you're going for the achievements of 'Perfect Score' you are more than likely going to get it during the larger rooms, not necessarily in the Garage, I haven't personally seen it happen as of typing this.Now, you should have enough money to advance to the next room, where you can employ people, a maximum of four is allowed in this room and this is where the fun starts to really kick in. You have the option of training them once you have employed them, if this doesn't happen, you will be stuck producing the same scored games for a while, also, switch up the genres once in a while too, its amazing how much a well researched game topic can jump from 4s to about 8s from the last time a game was made and a word to the wise, DO NOT make two game genres the same one after another, your fans will not like that and would probably end up losing some as well as money. I could go further into the last room, but that is something that you need to find out for yourself to play, create your own consoles, release an AAA title and have up to 6 staff members, that is all I am going to let you in on there!All in all, I would recommend this game to anybody and everybody and I am ashamed I never bought this myself and waited until I mentioned it to a friend to buy it for me as a gift, otherwise I would have bought it day one. 11/10. Loved every minute of it and the achievements leave you wanting more.			"

To get money you have to develop good games but that's hard!Additionally, the developers made the game with much love. You start in the 80s and get to know the whole history of gaming consoles.

												Gave Dev Tycoon lets you start your own company as a game developer. At first you start small in your garage, but as you make more and more successful games you can change offices, hire staff, and upgrade your skills through training. While it is a simple concept, game dev tycoon is promising, in the sense that it keeps adding variety to your game making process and letting you make more complex choices as you progress through the game. The graphics and music are quite simple and not really an asset to be discussed for this game. Its gameplay largely consists of you adjusting sliders so as to decide which concepts you are going to give emphasis on while creating each game, such as sound, graphics etc. You also witness the emergence and disappearance of several types of consoles and decide where to release each game, while also keeping in mind the market trends. The most prominent problem with this game, would be that you get to decide based on trial and error more often than not, and the feedback you get about the choices you made is not entirely helpful for you to choose better next time around. The existance of a wiki for this game has made it so that tons of people end up following just that, since it is way less frustrating to progress in this way. Overall, I wouldnt call game dev tycoon a bad game, but a game that could use some polishing to shine.+ great genre/topic/platform variety+ easy to grasp, hard to master- game choice feedback is vague			"

It has number of flaws (unskippable animation, I hate you!) and in the late game it heavily lags, but I'm anyway happy about every spent Euro on this game.I do RECOMMEND this to all of you. For all young and ""indie"" developers I suggest try their ""great"" ideas on this simulation first, and only then going to spam Greenlight.P.S, failed to build Game Dev Tycoon inside the Game Dev Tycoon, however, John Carmack in XCom company made a Dark Engine based 3D Virtual Reality MMORPG about school for XRay console and PC.

												I put a great many hours into Kevin Toms' Software Star. I would invariably do extremely poorly, because using Hype was basically lying about how good your game was, wasn't it? That wouldn't be right. Tell the people the truth, they're only going to find out when someone hands them your game on a C90.But I digress. THIS game is the same basic idea (Sim Games Dev) with a really pleasant presentation. Hire and fire, develop game features and engines, churn out cash-in franchises as often as you dare and throw as much marketing money around as possible to push you over the top.It's essentially a toy for people who like games and gaming and the games industry and think about them a lot.

												Game Dev Tycoon is a simulation game where you become a video games developer.In Game Dev Tycoon, you start from your own garage in the 80s and then work around the become a major games developer company on the market. It's fun to play as you can create your own games in your imagination. You can create games on many platform. Decide yourself which aspect is more important for your game, the game engine, AIs, world design or graphics and sounds. Your decision is really affecting the review score for the game you create, the better the review, the more it will sell and the more fan you will get. The platforms and consoles that is available in this game has very funny name like the Playstation in this game is Playsystem. All console from the 80s to todays XBOX One and Playstation 4 are there in the game and you can create game for those consoles, or you can create your own consoles.This is yet the best tycoon game I ever play. I recommend this.Rating 9/10			"

												The game is easy and fun to play, but at the same it lacks the depth and complexity, which is number one requirement in most simulation games. Sadly, the developers said that they are not interested in adding new features or creating a DLC. However, the recent addition of Workshop is awesome, you can get a lot of interesting mods from there.  I'll recommend the game to anyone who wants to spend some time just experimenting with combinations.			"

												In all honesty there have been few 'Tycoon' games I like.  I bought this title because, I want to be a game developer.   The Premise of Game Dev Tycoon is, rather... well you are a game developer, and you play through the ages and generations of video games, starting from the NES era of gaming and work your way through today.The game progresses from you working alone in a garage, to a small team in a smaller office, to a massive corprate headquaters where you can pump out tripple A titles.So the question is thus, what about the game development part.  Well basicly there are three parts to game development, and three sliders per part.  Pending on Genre and type of game pends on how the sliders need to be set, where you need to spend your time and resources into making a good game.  Then you watch bubbles (With one of the most addictive sound effects) float up into a compleation bar.  That's about it.So in all honesty theres not much to gameplay at all, its simple, it's straight foward, and I quite like it, personally after hashing out a few sequals it makes you think on what you are creating, and has given me some neat ideas for games just because I kept pumping out sucessful sequals in this game.So All in All, I recomend this game, it is a handy timewaster, it is fun in it's own way, a little addictive, and is easy on the CPU.  So by all means give it a whirl.Note to the Developer: I think a demo of the first garage era would go a long way for this game to get more people to play it.			"

												I first opened the game and didn't think much of it, but then before you know it, six hours go by and I am selling hot titles such as ""Animal ♥♥♥♥♥♥"", ""Kiddy Caper"" and ""Sexatorium 3000"" to a demographic of young children to make my business successful! There are some minor bugs here and there, you only use one mouse button and it can be frustrating when it doesnt respond or click in the right area (character highlighting would be useful for this). Also, I triple AAA'd straight 10's for my ""Spouse Slap Simulator Deluxe"" (and successful sequels!)8.5/10			"

												Playing this game is like having a business. You fail the game when you get bankrupt, but you can become Bill Gates in the game if you succeed in managing the company.There are several reasons why you should buy this game. First, you get to experience being the manager. Managing is really hard imo, but this game can be a motivation for some because it requires skill and hardwork in order to succeed in the game. Second, it enhances one's creativity. You get to choose genre and categories to create the game you want. You can even name it. Third, You get to see the evolving technology of the consoles starting from G64 and such. Lastly, you get to have millions of fans lol.What I didn't like in the game is that the last of the achievements. I have 31/33 achievements and the rest are based on luck. It's quite frustrating but i'll get it for sure. Try this game first before you use a guide, you'll be needing it later on. Probably. 9 - Thumbs up.			"

												I had some fun with this game, the design is cool and it's kind of arcadish, I would reccomend it for play if you find it on a discount and looking to waste 8-10h. But in the current price it's not much of a bargain since it's kind of boring after the second playthrough. The only motivation would be to spent another 4 hours doing all of the same to improve a highscore. Not enough.Some players commended the game as deep however it's not all that deep after you learn what works and what doesn't. You can basically break it if you know 3 good recipes and cycle them.So my reccomendation for a Dev Tycoon actually went to another Dev Tycoon game at the same price range and more depth / options / etc			"

												I was very excited to see this game come on sale recently, as I'd had my eye on it for some time. It is a very good game at first, despite a lack of polish here and there (inexplicable error message on first launch, the odd spelling/grammatical error in the dialog boxes, etc.). Therefore, I think it is worth getting on sale.However, it quickly gets old; mostly, I think, due to its cyclical mechanics and unrealistic time scale. As a simulator, these factors take away from the experience. For example, a game may take as little as several months to produce, bug-free, and is ""on the market"" for only a short time, even if it is a smash hit. The result is that you must constantly churn out game after game, whereas I naturally tend towards producing 3 or 4 titles that I can release the next installments for periodically -- not unlike real life. By the fourth year, having produced several hits and sitting at a cool 4.4 million, with a new office, an employee, and lots to research/train, I said to myself, ""Just 31 years to go...ugh"".So that's basically it for me. Something tells me that I stopped right when the game was about to get its second wind. I've no doubt that I'll pick it up from time to time to tinker with. It is well made and fun as far as it goes, just not something I can really sink my teeth into and feel satisfied. I'm flagging this review with a ""Not recommended"" just so that people can see an alternate perspective amongst the sea of absolutely glowing reviews. I'm interested to see what Greenheart Games will come up with next. :)			"

												I'm a big fan of simulation/tycoon games and this is an exceptional case where an indie dev outmanuvers most named publishers.There's a trend nowadays where simulation games tend to be so niche that devs hardly give a thought on if the game is too complex and will end up putting off everyone but the most dedicated sim gamers.  This game strikes a decent balance between being accessible and having options, and with workshop support most people are able to mod in the complexity they desire.If you're into management sim games, I'd be hard pressed to think of a better one for your money.

												[Full review of Game Dev Tycoon]Graphics:The graphics are very basic but they're clean and go well with this type of indie game. However, I feel like the game would've benefitted from more customization options for characters and the actual businesses. The graphics are so simplistic that more customization probably would've been pretty easy to pull off, making it seem a little lazy. - 7/10Audio:I like the music but I'm pretty sure that there's only 2 or 3 tracks playing on a loop so it can get pretty repetitive if you play for hours at a time. The music that is there fits the game well though, I just wish there was more of it. - 7/10Gameplay:The gameplay is really unique and can get pretty complex, providing a great challenge for both new and veteran players. However, it can be a bit difficult to tell what was bad about certain games because specifics are not always offered and the review system has always seemed a little off to me.I think that there are enough unique aspects to keep the game engaging though, and you're able to hire on new team members to attempt larger games in the later stages, which are the most fun imo. - 8/10Story:There really isn't one. It's a typical tycoon game where the story is just ""one day you decided to start making video games and become successful"" - nothing too deep. The cool thing is that you start making games in the very early stages of the gaming industry so you actually get to see all the “now-legendary” consoles released and make games for them! It can be pretty funny too since the developers had to come up with some pretty creative names in order to avoid copyright. A story isn’t really necessary in these types of games but it would’ve been nice to see your company presented with various choices or something. - 7/10Replayability:Like any tycoon game, you can play as many times as you want and it can also be pretty easy to fail so you might even have to start over a couple of times anyway. The beauty of a simple concept like this is that it never really gets old and I, personally, keep the game installed on my PC just in case I'm ever in the mood to play it, which is pretty often honestly. I’ve completed the game a couple of times now and it’s always fun to play, just don’t expect a totally new experience each time you play it. - 8/10Overall:Overall I was very impressed with this tycoon game, especially considering the fact that it was made by a 2 man team and was released for the extremely low price of $10. There’s a lot of fun strategy to be had here, but only if you like the tycoon genre, and only if you actually have an interest in the gaming industry. If you’re bored by either of those two things, this game has nothing to offer you. Also, there are mods for it now. - 7.4/10			"

												Strangely really fun! Bought it because it was on sale and as a software developer myself, I wanted to see if I could live the dream in a virtual world :)The concept is really simple and it's repetitive BUT the repetitive actions occur fast and have consequences which you need to quickly adapt to in order to avoid going bankrupt, which keeps you on your toes.You start in your garage and you have to research concepts, teach yourself different skills to develop, decide which consoles (N64, Gameboy, Playstation, PC, etc) you are going to develop games on etc.It's really nice to just play in windowed mode and enjoy a few clicks every now and then. Definitely worth every penny based on the current Summer Sale price.The welcome message from the dev team was nice too :)			"

Instead of Xbox's it is all Ybox's and stuff like that.  In one way I enjoyed that because it takes you down memory lane.  Ah yes the fabled Dreamcast.  However it also left me knowing what to expect.  I didn't bother buying licenses to produce on certain platforms because I already knew those platforms were not a big sucess in the real world.The trailer says ""create games your way.""  You can do that, but they'll flop.  This game seems to have a fairly narrow view of what kinds of games will be successesful.  Although it's entirely possible I just have not figured out how to break out of the mold.  It's ironic because the devolpers of this game are thinking out of the box somewhat with their game about thinking within the box of of what maybe EA games would tell their staff to make.  Just like the historical technology in the game, the definition of what can be a success also appears to be tied to gaming history.They have opened this up to the workshop, so that's really cool.  I haven't used it yet, but am excited to see where it takes the game.Even with my reservations I really do like the game.  It is a fun simulation and it is challenging.  I'll make my company grow for a while only to run afoul with a couple flops and then be strapped for cash.  It keeps me wanting to try again.I think it is a fair price and would be a good addition for anyone who likes simulations or is interested in the history of gaming.  Also worth mentioning is that the game has a good bit of educational value as well.  It teaches bits of finance and company management.  Good game!			"

												Strangely really fun! Bought it because it was on sale and as a software developer myself, I wanted to see if I could live the dream in a virtual world :)The concept is really simple and it's repetitive BUT the repetitive actions occur fast and have consequences which you need to quickly adapt to in order to avoid going bankrupt, which keeps you on your toes.You start in your garage and you have to research concepts, teach yourself different skills to develop, decide which consoles (N64, Gameboy, Playstation, PC, etc) you are going to develop games on etc.It's really nice to just play in windowed mode and enjoy a few clicks every now and then. Definitely worth every penny based on the current Summer Sale price.The welcome message from the dev team was nice too :)			"

												Holy crap is this game addictive. Grabbed it during the Holiday sale and do not regret my decision. This game is pretty darn accurate as far as the video game industry works. Sure, it's just a simple simulator but you have to make decisions based off what gamers will like in the game that you are developing which cannot be taken lightly. It takes awhile to get used to the fast-patced mechanics and hectic lifestyle of a developer. You must pay attention to every detail when making a game and make sure that what you are developing is top-notch or otherwise the game will flop. If you fail a few times and go bankrupt in the game, learn from your mistakes and try again. This game is super addictive if you think you know what it takes to develop a AAA title game and please the critics :)			"

Starts off relatively small, building games in your garage and then the game just opens up like mad with so much to do, building your own engine and even later on in game, your own consoles!

												Strange, I feel like I have been here before?Says everyone because is this our childhood in a box, with mocking names yes but still. It is a very interective game that makes you think how to make the best game possible. Eventually you become EA where you make games that are sub-par and that now body likes.

												This game is pure crack! I had no idea such simple game mechanics (basicly using sliders) and micro managment could keep me so interested for such a long period of time.Game Dev Tycoon is solid proof 2 guys in a basement can make better games than some ""AAA"" titles out there.This game holds some very interesting gaming history (you progress through 35 years. once they're done you finish the game).Wonderful sense of personal growth - you start off as 1 guy in a basement and end up 7 people in a fancy office building.Game Dev Tycoon helps non game developers understand some basic game creation modules, such as game engine and what the hell are contracts, which I found very interesting and informative.Also, this game holds more depth and choice variety than first meets the eye, I'm impressed.Important notes: - The game ends after 35 years (eventhough you can keep playing the same run).- You get to keep your learned knowledge from previous runs in case you decide to start again - Two cons I can think of: 1. Slightly high price (considering the simple game mechanics). This feels more like a $5 title than a $10 title.However I bought it at nearly full price to support the developers and its well worth it.2. Repetetive music - If only they'd get more music variety instead of the same couple of 2 minute tracks on repeat. This is the only game in the world that guilt trips piracy! They get bonus points for that :)TL;DR - Great game, addictive as hell, BUY IT! 9/10.			"

												Game Dev Tycoon is a game about owning a game dev company. The game is very similar to Game Dev Story for mobil devicesI reall loved Game Dev Story, but I felt like Game Dev Tycoon really expands on Dev Story like more consoles longer game time tycoon 30 Y story is only 20 Y. Dev Story in my opinion  has less replay value do to less time and since new consoles have come out Dev Tyccon has more replay and more Dev options and more features all making it better, I suggest Both however Tycoon is definitly the stronger of the two.Game Dev Tycoon 9/10Game Dev Story 7.5/1o			"

												This game was an attempt to make a better version of the Kairosofts Mobile game: ""Game Dev Story"". So far they have not yet succeeded! The mobile game is very simple and easy, but still fun. Game Dev Tycoon has failed in making a complex design feel simple. The system made to creating a game, is very complex and they hide this complexity, not helping the player enough to simplify it. Online there is a wiki concerning the game, that shows how oddly complex this system is...The difficulty of the game does not feel high. It feels RANDOM, even if it isnt! The game is playable and can be fun, but it feels like they have failed in their own goal of making a better game. I hope they make a second game with a much better ""making-games-system"".			"

												After having completed the game three times previously with minor obstables, I recently started playing Game Dev Tycoon with pleasent memories in mind. Those memories were brutally shattered after two playthroughs. At a certain point, about seven hours in to the game, reviews change instantaniously from 8.5 and more to 4.5 or less. On two different save files this happened, so I went online and read up on what games to create and great consoll, genre and audience combinations. Regardless the effort, getting back the sales and reviewes that had been given consistently since ""the garage"" was impossible. The twoes and threes kept coming. Fantasy/RPG, you name it. Bankruptcy on all attempts. So I jumped back on both save files and tried following game creation guides from a point where it all seemed to be going great. The reviews where flying all over the place, 9.75, 9.5, 9, everything was going great again, I could finally get that fuzzy feeling again when Game Dev Tycoon came to mind. But on both occations, with everything researched, the reviews turned sour at the same point as previously. So I do not recommend the game as it now appears. There is no logic in the difficulty patched by the developers of this game. If you crave for a great game dev game, Game Dev Story is much better.			"

												This game is quite a little gem. For the first game that came out by the Greenheart Games developer, they did spot on. Going through the years and seeing the game industry change from a developer standpoint (all be it their off brand versions. i.e. Vonny = Sony) and even getting to develop your own console at some point is massive fun. It's can be very challenging trying to figure out their interpretation of various genres and play styles, and getting that 10/10 on a game feels very rewarding. They even go so far as to incorporate MMO's, sequels, and expansion packs, all with roughly accurate feelings of how their development and distribution is perceived.Very eager to see if they come out with a sequel, as there are a ton of features I would like to see implemented and current ones that I would love to see expanded. For instance, basic and advanced accounting statistics, expanded skills and point values, and a feedback system for your games, just to name a few.Awesome game, played the hell out of it and would recommend it to anyone who wants a game to just chillax a bit.

												I've been playing Game Dev Tycoon since way before it was on Steam, since practically the very beginning. Greenheart Games gained a boost of popularity after their little ""prank"" on game pirates. If you don't know what I'm talking about, I suggest you look it up. Anyways, Game Dev Tycoon is awesome. The replayability is unimaginable. You can constantly talk with your friends about your most recent bestselling game, or you could shut all the curtains, turn off the light, and play until your eyes bleed. The way Greenheart Games made it seem how the in-game world was reacting to your games, it just makes it feel so rewarding. Some people might not even believe that Game Dev Tycoon is their first game. As you can clearly tell, I was suprised too. Great game.10/10. Worth every cent.			"

												Yes, I know this has a metascore of 68, which denotes being ""okay"" to ""pretty good"". Yes, I know people have said that this game is a ripoff of a fairly similar mobile phone game. Yes, I know that it's not the perfect game, and that there should have been extra features which could have enhanced it. I too at first thought I'd give it a tentative try, and then suddenly I looked up and saw that it was already evening. If you even have the slightest inclination of liking to manage things, watching numbers, or experiencing success, this game will suck your soul dry and make your eyes bleed videogame fluids. Horrifically, horrifically addictive. It's games like these which justify the existence of rehab centers.			"

												One of those games where you don't expect much and then it surprises you. Yes, the core gameplay mechanics may be around sliders and yes, at late stages when you have R&D/hardware lab researching something it may lag here and there even on high-end PC-s but put a little imagination in it and it will entertain you more than 90% of today's AAA-s.To re-create some of the most memorable titles is really priceless, there are easter eggs and some amazing feelings of satisfaction as you get successful. Also, I would recommend some mods for expanding the game even further. At the price, it's not spending. It's investing into some nostalgic gaming moments. Just plain and simple fun.86/100			"

												Game Dev Tycoon, as the title says, is a Game Development Tycoon. Its a fun game in which you can develop your own company, produce games and consoles and make millions.Pro:-Good mechanics.-Streamlined menus for easy selection.-Its fun making games and consoles.-Its great seeing that your game got a 11/10 and made millions.-Lots of research and development options.-Mod support was recently added.-Translations to other languages. Multiple translation projects are going on and some are already finished.Cons:-You sadly can't make any boxart for games but thats not that bad.-The game slows down dramatically when alot of things are going on. Its really irritating.-Not everything is clearly explained. You need to work it out yourself or read a guide.This is a really good tycoon game and I recommend it if you like tycoon games.I give it a 8/10.			"

												This was one of the best indie games I've played in a long time, if not ever. If you're a fan of simulation games/tycoon style games, this one will be right up your alley. The game starts basically at the dawn of early gaming starting at the Commodore 64 (renamed G64) and PC, working all the way down history to the Xbox One, PS4 and even simulating new ""future"" consoles. Your goal is simple: make quality games and lots of money to move out of your garage and eventually start your own game studio. Trying out new genre combinations for games is interesting and deciding where to allocate your resources for best effect (for example, you generally want to go with Fantasy for making an RPG game, Military for Action games etc). Eventually the process gets more and more involved as you have to assign team members to work on games and train their individual strengths deeper. Eventually you can create MMORPGs and ""research"" projects like a Steam-based platform, and even develop your own console so the game depth only increases as you go along.My only gripes with the game is sometimes critics will be all over the place in regards to their scores. When creating what you thought was an AAA title, they may only end up rating a 7-8, whereas a title you didn't put as much money into, might score 9-10s. Critic score generally dictates how much your game is expected to sell. Also, you move through the eras a bit too quickly, as I completed the game before I was even able to start researching some advanced technologies (like Steam). Though, you could chalk that up to it being my first playthrough.Overall, you're likely to get 6-7 hours out of it your first playthrough assuming you make it to the end without bankruptcy. There isn't a whole lot of replay value but if you're an avid gamer, it's definitely worth it on sale alone for the tongue-in-cheek gaming humor and entertaining gameplay!			"

												Yes, I know this is a improved copy of the iOS game, Game Dev Story, I had it and probably spent 100s of hours on a tiny screen. But I'm not reviewing that, I'm reviewing Game Dev Tycoon, by Greenheart studios, not by Kairosoft. Although it's not Game Dev Story, it still is one of the more fun games I have played. You play as a guy/girl who starts their own buisness in their garage, with only 70k (I think :P) and a computed (And maybe a car that's half covered). You must create multiple games until you move up a stage and make a buisness with workers and so on and so forth. Since this game was released, you can now generate a game report, which tells you what you did right, what you did wrong and what you could do to make it better. I know I only have spent a couple of hours, but the game is still amazing and although I've started multiple times, I've never been annoyed with starting over, because I want to see where I went wrong to go bankrupt and how I should change that.The Good: -Addictive gameplay -Fun combinations -Never-ending gameplay-Funny company names (Like, Ninvento or Vonny) The Bad:-Lack of genres - Reviewers suck sometimes Overall score:8/10			"

												Pretty fantastic.  There aren't many games which keep me up til the next morning that day I get them, but this is on that list.It's especially amusing if you follow the games industry closely.

												Pick the perfect combination of concept, genre, and platform (while managing marketing, budget, and personnel), and you could have the next gaming sensation on your hands.Game Dev Tycoon is a fun business sim with plenty of inside jokes for anyone who follows the gaming industry. Graphics and sound are quirky (in a good way), the interface in unintrusive and functions rather smoothly, and gameplay is entertaining. My major criticism would be a lack of replay value; after you've successfully completed a 35-year ""career,"" I'm not sure there's much reason to return for a second pass at the game.Nevertheless, that first trip through the game consumes a solid five or six hours of gameplay -- during which I never found myself bored. Overall, Game Dev Tycoon is well worth the price of admission, especially if you can pick it up on sale.			"

												If you're a fan of tycoon games I would recommend picking this up.  It's obviously not like actually owning your own game company but it's pretty exciting to release a new triple A MMO title and get all 10s from the critics.  A few mods have been released that change the gameplay a bit so it has some replayability.  When you near the end and have everything unlocked it can start to lag but it's not too terrible.  Overall I would give this game a 7.5/10 and recommend it to anyone looking for a new tycoon game to sink a few hours into.			"

												This game is very addicting and can simulate what it is to be a Game Dev very well. You'll be able to name your company, make your own games (to wich you'll receive reviews that define your career), hire staff to work on your company as you progress from a small garage to big offices, be on an anual event called G3 (reference to E3) to show your current works in progress, as you become the greatest game dev of all time!

												Game Dev Tycoon is a very interesting game. You start alone in garage, and end as boss of big company. There's many reaserch option, and making the game isn't always easy. You have to take risk of letting someone overwork to end the game, and you cannot always have everything you want in the game - choose wisely. There is game reports mechanic that allows you to gain insights about released games (like the x topic is great with x genre or like ai is very important for x genre games).There are plenty interesting events that makes a game more interesting, but there isn't many of them. You can make your own consoles from scratch as like a engine. There are many options but i feel like some things aren't balanced good, but maybe only  I've got that feeling. The game is also short. Sometimes you don't know what some options are to. For example, why you can don't have/have online play in MMO? MMO is MMO O_O. The stupid thing is that expansion packs to MMO are made exactly like games. So you can have worse graphic in the same game in DLC. Beside that this game is really fun. If you've seen some videos on Youtube from it and you liked it you should get it. Maybe not for full price, but definitely on promotion. Also there are plenty mods that i haven't tried yet, that will probably make the game better.+: Many reaserch optionsGame development leads you to hard choicesMod supportNice amount of topicsReferences to reality like Govodore G64, Playsystem, Übersoft, Vony, Peter Polyneux :DAbility to make own engine and consoleMake your own game dev studio from scratch-:Small amount of eventsSome bugsNot everything is good balancedStupid expansion pack system to MMO'sNot everything is understandable ""All Games"" hate me and when everybody give me 10 they give me 9Occasional lagSlightly short7+/10Best of it's kindComand94 "

Recommended if you get it for free / dirt cheapSimilar to Game Dev Story (Android/iOS game) and all other KairoSofts games. The main difference is that Game Dev Tycoon has much less depth. There is not much of a side-mission other than to grind games.Fun for a few hours wtih little to no replay value. After one play-through it's not that much fun to do everything from scratch again. Even with the legacy research and the possibility of trying different genres.The same genres will reach success in each play-through, the same tech will be researched, etc.It is a cute (visually) little game with decent soundtrack and some fun dialogues written into it. But as a management/sim game it does not go far.			"

												Game Dev Tycoon is a fun, simplistic simulation of the interesting game industry and how making games called ""Booty Blasters 2: Return of Jaffar"" is perfectably acceptable for Young gamers. So is a Typing game with a steering wheel.Positives:-Charming, plain graphics that aren't too hard on the eyes.-Provoking, legitimate strategy when it comes to making a successful game. It isn't just about having correct focuses such as Gameplay or Artifical Intelligence, but also properly using your game's theme in conjunction with the Rating/game console, using specially trained employees to highlight game aspects, research, etc.-The game's difficulty and complexity growth isn't too sudden, most mechanics are pretty easy to understand when they're introduced.-Overall charm and dialogue of the game is fun, it's clear the developers were intentional with their easter-eggs and choices.-Mod support, though modest, is still available and can add to the experience like with many Steam games.Negatives-There are only a couple of soundtracks used, and though they're nice the first time around, it does get a bit tiresome as they loop often.-Replayability is a mixed bag; it's fun to try different strategies and game-styles you didn't try before, but if you know what you're doing, it can become an easy trip until the later years/consoles. Though going for certain achievements can help spice things up a fair bit.-This is a personal note, but I find that the only way to get some of the most interesting parts, such as making an online MMO or your very own console, is to play incredibly optimally or to have the year limit higher than default. More of a nitpick than anything.Overall, I really like Game Dev Tycoon! The price is near perfect for what the game gives you imo, and if you're a fan of tycoons or simple strategy games, this one should be right up your alley. Just make sure to get all the bugs out of your game and you'll be golden! "

												Game Dev Tycoon is a casual management sim around running your own game company.  The game has a simple but charming asthetic and follows the story of gaming from the early boom of the 80's to the modern day.  Making decisions on  the theme and design of your game and managing your staff are early challenges.  Later you will train staff, market your games and even develop your own console.The main drawback of the game is the weakness of the core development mechanics.  As you are required to use sliders to decide on the main areas to focus on for each game.  The preset combination that determines what reviewers deem ""a good game"" is often a mystery to you until you fail.  With a lack of detailed information of why your game failed its easy to become frustrated by this core mechanic.  This can be seen by the huge number of guides available on how to win the game, at this point you might as well be playing ""spreadsheet the game"". Overall, i'd say the games pro's outweigh its somewhat shallow mechanics.  If you can pick this one up on sale for under a fiver I'd give this one a somewhat half-hearted reccomendation.			"

												Game Dev tycoon is one of the only games in recent times that has had mee hooked for hours straight, causing me to go without brishing my teeth or getting changed in favour of playing this gem of an indie title rather than catch the bus to the job that I don't have.This game is addictive as f**k. Starting from a guy in a shed in the early 1980s and watching the company of your own name (in my case, NotEACorp) growing into a company releasing games about ninja princesses and getting punched in the balls by critics is wholly satisfying, except for when a critic pans your game, which only makes you want to make a better game to impress him/her/it, thus contributing to the addiction.My only complaint about this game is that, for a game made up of a load of 2D sprites, the randomly appearing framerate drops, while suprising, are more annoying than anything. I understand that indie games aren't the best optimised games on the market, but this is giving me horrifying nighmares about GTA 4 all over again.VERDICT: Go do everything you need to do in your life, gather a stash of food, then buy this game. You'll be glued to your PC until an inevitable powercut comes along to say Hi.10/10. It's not perfect. There's no such thing as a perfect game. But this is as close to perfect as games really come these days.			"

												An simple tycoon game where you own your own game development company. You start off in a garage and work your way up to an office and employees. It's obvious that the creators of this game has knowledge about the gaming industry, both when it comes to gaming history and game development. There is a steady storyline (although not the most intriguing) throughout the game, where you, your company and employees evolve aswell as the gaming industry. I have never come across a tycoon game with this theme before so I was glad to find that the tutorial was short and easy to understand. Also the tutorial is only mandatory upon your first game.When creating a game ""you"" have no knowledge about what subjects, theme and platform works together, but as you develop games, the game register the outcomes which helps you make better games. Personally I think this function isn't ultimate and would prefer a full register (for example a grid) where you clearly can see what works and what does not, instead of having to click everything and see if the game tells you it's a good combo.Overall this is a great game. Even though the story doesn't change, I keep playing! I would like to see the creators make a sequel or an upgraded version because despite my criticism, there isn't really anything wrong with the game, there's only a lot of room for improvement. Considering this is their first game, that's impressive! "

												A fantastic single player game... Took many hours away from my life... Many times trying different combinations and getting timing of releases correct. A truly difficult game to master. Very satisfying when you release a perfect game. Towards the end game, you may choose what your developers specialise in; Sound, Graphics, Gameplay etc. This adds a new dimension in to the releases and resource management of your staff for your game.Read the guides for assistance on easy money making combos.

												Started a company called Steam, released a console and got pelters until I was out of business !!!! hahahahahaOn a serious note this game is actually quite imersive. The graphics while somewhat simple are actually quite a nice touch. In many respects this is not too disimilar to many other Tycoon based games. There are some really nice touches like how the pcitures of the different cosnoles acrtually look like the ones we all knew and loved (original NES, SNES, Master System ect). Overall the game is quite addicitve, especially once you get into developing and releasing MMO's and expansions. For the price its well worth picking up. It does have its moments, but I think once you have played it thorugh a few times you are probably done. Certainly not a timeless classic, but none the less a decent tycoon / sim game which you should get a few weeks of enjoyment out of. There are some mods you can get from the steam workshop which would probably add a bit more longevity to the overall expereince so well worth going there and checking them out. Only had this a few days, but I do like it. In a nutshell its simply, quirky and fairly addicitive in the short term.			"

												This game is extremely fun.  You start out as a 1 man developer in the garage of your mother's house.  As you increase your ability as a developer you increase your stats of technology and design, which allows you to make better games.  As you make better games you make more money, which allows you to upgrade from your garage into offices.  Once you enter the realm of being a professional developer in offices you are able to hire employees and designate their responsibilities from design to technology to research.  All of it works together to allow you to keep upgrading your office, employees, and games.  This game has a way of keeping you hooked.  You get so focused on making sure your next game release is better then your last.  Before you know it, hours have passed and you have work in the morning.  I highly recommend this game.  The price makes this game a no-brainer purchase.			"

												Kinda one of my best simulation gamesSo the game is about a guy who started a new company on a garage (lol) and he make simple games at a very very long old years after you get like some money and other stuff you upgrade you office and hire some people with you to help you on games and make you games faster after that you can get another big office or lets say a tower and make rooms and other stuff so i do really like this thinking game and also be smart at making the games because if you dont know what type of game to do then you will be bad luck guy and also i found a really really helpful guide that shows you the perfect combos to get so here is my ratings.Gameplay 10/10A.I 9.5/10Graphics 8/10Soundtrack 7.5/10Multiplayer (No multiplayer at this game)But it's still one of my favourite games <3			"

												This game is more of a history lesson through the years, rather than an actual game development simulator. Many of the combinations in the game are obvious, and the only real excitement you get is when you create a game that gets ""10"" reviews across the board from every ""reviewer"". These reviewers tend to be little ♥♥♥♥♥es, and before you ever create a perfect game, one of these little ♥♥♥♥♥es will give you a 9. You'll probably cry for a couple of hours like I did, but then you'll feel a little better and MAYBE replay it if you're feeling like you should be beat in the face a little more.I mean, the game has good replayability value when it comes to perfecting your algorythm and getting that perfect game, but it's tough to enjoy the game at face value when everything tends to not only be the same, but also ridiculously predictable, whether it be console releases, or which console will be on top in the ""war"" (SNES>genesis, RIP dreamcast gone too soon, and N64>PS1). There isn't a whole lot to discover in this game after you get three or so good combinations. It was too easy for me to continuously switch between sequels for my RPG ""ELDERLY WRITTEN PASSAGES"" and my shooter ""Shut up mom, I'm in the middle of a match"" and consistently get high ratings and drown in it (the cash, that is).Overall, it's a fun experience the first time, especially if you don't remember the early console wars, but after that, the fun dwindles down. I give this one three little ♥♥♥♥♥ reviewers, and one midget ♥♥♥♥♥ reviewer out of five			"

												Without a doubt this has become one of my go to games when i feel like playing casually, it's simple and easy to understand and can be a little addicting. I often find myself playing it for several hours without realizing it, or sometimes for just half an hour, and that's what makes this game so good. It's just so easy to pick up and play,  and it can take a very long time to master or even simply complete the game. I often found my self ecstatic whenever i made a perfect 10/10 game, and  what makes it so special is the reward you get for creating a master piece, keeping you exited and happy. It just makes you want to keep on playing, keep on succeding, trying to hit that perfect mark again. In all honesty this is a well polished game that is incredibly fun to play, and i would recommend it to any one who is looking for something new or just something fun and rewarding. It is very fearly priced that deserves your attention, so try it out because i doubt you'll be disopointed.			"

												A very enjoyable game. The tutorial is short and simple and gets you right into the action. The menus are well designed and there is not much clutter on the screen.The social commentary and satire on the video game industry is great at times. The main problem this game faces is that after you have beaten it a few times nothing will really surprise you. Even then you will get hours of enjoyment from the game. I would purchase if you have looked at the screenshots and thought it looked like fun. Well worth the price... this game is a quality game at a bargain bin price.			"

												As an Indie game, this is not bad. I'm a fan of the original Tycoon games, so it's safe for me to say that this Indie game made it pretty far. If you think about it, it's not about the graphics or music - it's about the strategy and the satisfaction you get from that successful achievement of being, well, successful. This is one feeling we all have deep down inside and it can come from anywhere, real life scenarios, or video games. Rather you're fishing and finally got a hook, or moving to the next stage in this game it's the same feeling of accomplishment. The only thing the game lacks is maybe a higher time frame between console releases. It seems to be a little too fast-paced when you're actually sitting here playing it. This game could also use a meter on how fast you'd like time to pass rather it's real-time or 100x faster for example.Pros:-Addictive gameplay-Allows your creativity to fly-Good engine-Basic controls (Rather you're a gaming veteran or a newcomer, anyone can play with ease)Cons:-No control on the time flow -You'll mostly always feel rushed-Could use some more tweakingOverall, I'd give this a 8/10. I can tell this took some time to actually develop - as I said before it's not about the graphics or music that made this the game it is today, it's the gameplay. From what I can tell, it took awhile to actually make this game fully functional which needs to be credited. This could be a text-based game and I'd still enjoy it.Would I recommend it? Maybe, I wouldn't say $10 USD would be worth Game Dev Tycoon, however I'd say around the $4.99 or lower range (on sale) would be reasonable. Some have regrets about buying this game, you need to give it time or maybe start over. The point is, have fun.			"

												Game Dev Tycoon is exactly what you expect: a videogame developer tycoon. You are supposedly warped back in time to 1985 to a reference-filled (hint: flux capacitor) garage, where you begin your endeavour into the gaming history books. Like any developer who travels in time to 1985, you are absolute ♥♥♥♥ at programming because the technology is so different.  You have a computer that's literally worse than a modern graphing calculator, yet you decide to make games. If you are successful, you can grow your garage into an actual company, with actual people, and actual results. You have to strategically market your games for specific audiences (you know, like ""T for Teen"" or ""E for Everyone"") and try to match genres to different gaming platforms to different audiences.For example, kids. In the real world, devices like the Nintendo DS (which reminds me, tell you later) or the great old Gameboy are very popular. Add a role-playing/ adventure game like the Legend of Zelda, and you're all set. Target marketing at young people, and kaboom: ez skins, ez life. Although ""skins"" probably means nothing to the world of the 1980s and 90s.So, now, about the NDS. The developers, in an effort to give you a good laugh, and avoid copyright infringement, have sort of parodied every console on the market. If I'm correct, the Nintendo GameCube's counterpart is the GameSphere. It's actually kinda freaking amazing.I'll give GDT a solid 8, maybe an 8.5 because of the extensive workshop mod support.TL;DR: Time travel to 1985, make games, ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥es, get money. 8.5/10			"

												A forgettably bland spreadsheet simulator. While many games can be reduced to the math to some extent, the art of hiding this, or simply increasing the complexity to the point where optimization is no longer feasible due to multiple constraints and varying situations, is crucial.Game Dev Tycoon has nothing to do with making games. It is solely concerned with making the player drag around a set of sliders to find the optimal combinations, in the pursuit of ever larger numbers. The window-dressing of a game development studio is immaterial, as it impacts precisely nothing.This is not to say that it is a bad spreadsheet, in and of itself. The game is perfectly functional, and the puzzle of searching for ideal combinations might satisfy an evening, or more for the kind of person that enjoys the optimization challenge. However anyone who does not find such appealing would be well advised to find something else to do with their time.			"

												Not a fan of the genre, just a guy who was interested about the theme of the game. And, from the theme perspective, it's very flavorful. But when you figure out how to ""game"" the system, how to manipulate the numbers correctly, then it becomes a simple spreadsheet, that's nothing more than chosing the correct options every time. There isn't enough factors to challenge the player to think, to actually do the logical things that are true in normal game design. It's all way too set in stone, and it's way too easy to figure out the way to play the game, then it loses all the appeal for me.			"

												Yes, I very much so recommend this game... My only wish though was that I wanted a hard mode so that people that didn't know which consoles would flop or not would get lured in, lets say that they added an Atari Jaguar and mentioned its '64 bits' possibility, then when they start making a game, they cant finish it cuz developing for that piece of crap was so hard!

												The combination of the topic 'Game Industry' with the genre 'Simulation-Tycoon' is definitively great and addictive.After a few tutorials there is a ""thank you for your purchase"" message poping up early in the game, which make it more casual even :) In overall, the game offers an easy  Gameplay with comprehensive missions panel in which the focus will be set on finding the best combination of parameters to get the AAA game, the item that will bring you fame and money. Starting in your humble garage, you are given '35 equivalent-years' to become the Steve-Bill-Dave of the Virtual Game Development.So, get famous or go bankrupt while trying :)However, the game is - IMHO - not at its peak yet. Besides the few Story Events that help to break the monotony of the game, many progresses can be done in order to make it more challenging and even fancier.Among other stuffs that would benefits of an improvement: # Exp gained display after production is too slow and too long  # Specialized Press Reviews after game publishing is slow, fancy-less and repetitive # Training and Updgrade trees are difficult to read and exploit: a more comprehensive tree-chart would help to understand how the items benefit to what. # full tracking of game reports and specifiations is not in history, therefore difficult to develop the right 'sequel', alternative, or spin-off # Marketing and SEO elements not enough developped: effect of campaigns and events should be more visible # Lack of customization in the officeWhile I purchased the game during Mid-Week Madness, I think the bargain is fair. And I truly believe this game is setting a first stage of expectation that needs to be materialized in a sequel I surely be looking forward. !!Keep up the good work.___________ionah			"

												This is the first game of this type that I've played. If you are excited by the idea of owning your own game developing business, this game will hold intrinsic delight for you. That was the case with me, so natuarally I liked this game.Especially at first, it's fun creating the games. Basically, after you decide to make a video game, you allot portions of time to specific development aspects like graphics, sound, world design, etc. You do so by sliding a meter up or down depending on how much time you want to spend on that aspect of design. You must use wisdom, because certain game genres and topics will turn out better or worse depending on how much time you spend on a certain aspect of design. At first the gameplay was exciting for me. It's enjoyable to see the monetary effects of your good game design ;) . But for the most part, you as the player as repeating the same processes for designing each game.  It's not a thoughtless procedure (because you have to figure out what to spend time on in development, pick a topic, etc) but you're pretty much following the same game mechanic(s) over and over to make each game.As times goes on, you can market your game, research new topics, train  and hire employees, put up a booth at the National game convention, take publishing deals, etc. Though these are varying ideas, you pretty much get the same ""feel"" when you're playing. It's point and click stuff, which is normal for a tycoon like this I suppose. For me personally, the game began to bore me a couple of hours into the gameplay, but I allowed myself to enjoy it and had fun making profit. What will keep you coming back is the steady introduction of new consoles and features. Just when you think you've seen all the game features, a new one may come up, like being able to use a Research and Development team to undergo projects.The bottom line is that the feel of the game mechanics feels somewhat repititive and will likely bore you UNLESS you like the idea of being a big-time game dev. If that's you, then that idea which stands behind this game--and the desire to succeed--will be an incentive to play for some time. It wasn't an entirely enthralling experience, but I liked it.			"

My first impressions were that it was looking quite good and fun to play, i was having a laugh by naming the games i create funny spoofs of already existing games.Good Points:-It has really fun and realistic aspects to it.-Has a good upgrade progression which is not earned too easily.-It is a good game to pass time.(Small thing) You actually recieve a Thank you for supporting message in game.- The genres of games you start with unocked change everytime you start a new save.Bad Points:-i noticed after i started a new game again it basically repeats (The events in-Game happen in the exact same order everytime)-Although the game is good fun at the start it seems that it would get boring fast (Mainly because you would eventually have tried every combination of Game) < This would take a good while though.All in all it is a decent game for the price of it and it is good fun but i can see it being a game that will be played rarely by me.

												Bought this game on a whim. Absolutely glad I did. One of the most fun games I've played in a while and I haven't played a ""tycoon"" or ""theme <park, hospital>"" game in at least 12 years. Surprisingly addictive with feelings of immense satisfaction when you create a game that skyrockets you to success.  There were several times where I thought my company was going to go under but suddenly found myself on the top of the charts with a random, often extremely goofy, idea.Ended up with a company worth over 1 billion dollars with such hits as ""Dragons Everywhere"" the fantasy RPG adventure. ""Flying or Whatever"" the ground breaking Aircraft - RPG/Simulator and ""Pew Pew UR DEAD"" and its sequel ""Pew Pew I'M DEAD"" which were basically both my ideas for CoD / MoH ripoffs. And who can forget the classic History - Sim/Strategy game ""George Washington Simulator."" Get this game.			"

												The story of the game is that you go back to the year 1985 and start your own game company. You start off in a garage which you can upgrade to a technical suite and more! As time progresses there are news popups which describe events that are taking place in the gaming industry at the time. For example: Vonny has just released their second video game system. Some games you make may be a smash hit but others not so great, you must be wise with the topic, genre and console. You can earn millions or become bankrupt. To improve the chance of making a great game is to hire staff which becomes available in the upgraded garage (becomes the technical suite). The staff can be used to help make games, research topics and research different features of the engine. When you start off, the game may be a bit tricky but once you learn which topic matches with which genre it will seem easier. With the ability to make games there is a cost. At the start of each career you recieve a certain budget which you can use to develop your first game! It randomly selects the first topics you can use so don't excpect to get the one you want. During making games with the budget you can go bankrupt, although it seems bad you can get two chances before you finally go bankrupt and have to start over.Overall Rating: 9/10 (Highly Recommended)I rate this game a 9 out of 10 because of how addicting it is, the details of the game and the dream of any gamer to make their own game company. Green Heart Games need to make a few tweaks which are only little ones. For example when the reviews of the games you make pop up it takes 20 seconds to display all of them. I feel that this wastes time but you can download a mod off of the workshop to reduce it to 1 second but hopefully they will change it anyway :).Thanks for reading this review and good luck with your game company :)Daniel			"

												A great game developer studio game, a genre which suprisingly exists but is all the better for it. Game Dev Tycoon uses real life events like the Gameboy, PS1 etc. It has pretty much every main console that was released in the last 30 years including the Xbox One and PS4, it even has a go at future consoles. While the game does have many problems such as large unpredictability wheather your game will be reviewed well, which tells you how well your sales will be. While the game does take many elements from the iOS and Android game Game Dev Story it improves and modernises most aspects of it to a higher level. I'd give this game a 8/10Score: 8/10			"

												'Game Dev Tycoon' is certainly the best Tycoon game I've ever played. It's paced masterfully, starting off as exceedingly simple but then introducing you to the more complex areas rather than chucking you in the deep end like other titles in the eponymous genre. I've played for three hours(first playthrough) and have not had a dull moment. It's easy-to-grasp, extremely funny and almost scary as you wait for the reviews of 'Behind Enemy Lines 2: Behinder(Sequel to 'Behind Enemy Lines' and predecessor to 'Behind Enemy Lines 3: Behinderer(joke titles(another great thing in this game('Ninvento', 'GameSphere' and the 'G64')))). 'Greenheart Games' have done an excellent job with their first title, as I did mine and I look forward to some great entries from them in the future.			"

												The combination of the topic 'Game Industry' with the genre 'Simulation-Tycoon' is definitively great and addictive.After a few tutorials there is a ""thank you for your purchase"" message poping up early in the game, which make it more casual even :) In overall, the game offers an easy  Gameplay with comprehensive missions panel in which the focus will be set on finding the best combination of parameters to get the AAA game, the item that will bring you fame and money. Starting in your humble garage, you are given '35 equivalent-years' to become the Steve-Bill-Dave of the Virtual Game Development.So, get famous or go bankrupt while trying :)However, the game is - IMHO - not at its peak yet. Besides the few Story Events that help to break the monotony of the game, many progresses can be done in order to make it more challenging and even fancier.Among other stuffs that would benefits of an improvement: # Exp gained display after production is too slow and too long  # Specialized Press Reviews after game publishing is slow, fancy-less and repetitive # Training and Updgrade trees are difficult to read and exploit: a more comprehensive tree-chart would help to understand how the items benefit to what. # full tracking of game reports and specifiations is not in history, therefore difficult to develop the right 'sequel', alternative, or spin-off # Marketing and SEO elements not enough developped: effect of campaigns and events should be more visible # Lack of customization in the officeWhile I purchased the game during Mid-Week Madness, I think the bargain is fair. And I truly believe this game is setting a first stage of expectation that needs to be materialized in a sequel I surely be looking forward. !!Keep up the good work.___________ionah			"

												Some aspects of the game NEED to be developed such as; The reviews system (has to give the player reasons why he did good/bad), some more choices for game development (in engine, gameplay, story, etc...), some more game genres (Puzzle, dinosaur, zoo) and maybe the ability to decide what TYPE of game it is (whether its an overhead game, first person, third person). Other than that the game is AMAZING, I've played t over and over again and have amassed about 50 hours due to the games replayability, creating such titles as Beasts Must Die and When Penguins Strike(Hunting/Sim), Call Of Battle Company (Military/Action-Strategy) and Evil corporations(Business/Sim).

												Do I develop a text based adventure or try to make a sim game? Ok text based adventure just to get my foot in the ground.  Oh no, what system? Can I afford a licensing fee? Is there enough market share to make it worth my time? Did I even focus on the correct attributes!? Are adventures even popular at the moment? Ok ok let's release the game, if it fails I'll be bankrupt and that will be the end of me. 7, 6, 6, 8Ok not too bad! I'll live to make a new game! Well do I make a new game or upgrade my game engine!? Should I hire new staff or train existing staff? What to do what to do?These questions and more will be up to you and your new game company. If your itching for a tycoon experience this should be right up your ally. Make games, earn money, hire staff, fire staff, change offices, create game engines, even make your own console. All of these things and more are awaiting for you in this lovely gem of a game. You may even learn a thing or two of the history of consoles, even if they are using fake names. I picked this up during the 2013 Holliday sale and wasn't expecting much, but what I got was a ""just one more game I need good reviews!"" Kind of addiction. I didn't put it down till I got every achievement! If you were a fan of Zoo Tycoon or Roller Coaster Tycoon like I am you should give this game a shot. This game doesn't disappoint!

												Bought this game on a whim. Absolutely glad I did. One of the most fun games I've played in a while and I haven't played a ""tycoon"" or ""theme <park, hospital>"" game in at least 12 years. Surprisingly addictive with feelings of immense satisfaction when you create a game that skyrockets you to success.  There were several times where I thought my company was going to go under but suddenly found myself on the top of the charts with a random, often extremely goofy, idea.Ended up with a company worth over 1 billion dollars with such hits as ""Dragons Everywhere"" the fantasy RPG adventure. ""Flying or Whatever"" the ground breaking Aircraft - RPG/Simulator and ""Pew Pew UR DEAD"" and its sequel ""Pew Pew I'M DEAD"" which were basically both my ideas for CoD / MoH ripoffs. And who can forget the classic History - Sim/Strategy game ""George Washington Simulator."" Get this game.			"

												I was wondering if it would be my type of game before buying because i have a slim Game taste, so i thought i'd give it a try. My first impressions were that it was looking quite good and fun to play, i was having a laugh by naming the games i create funny spoofs of already existing games.Good Points:-It has really fun and realistic aspects to it.-Has a good upgrade progression which is not earned too easily.-It is a good game to pass time.(Small thing) You actually recieve a Thank you for supporting message in game.- The genres of games you start with unocked change everytime you start a new save.Bad Points:-i noticed after i started a new game again it basically repeats (The events in-Game happen in the exact same order everytime)-Although the game is good fun at the start it seems that it would get boring fast (Mainly because you would eventually have tried every combination of Game) < This would take a good while though.All in all it is a decent game for the price of it and it is good fun but i can see it being a game that will be played rarely by me.

												This is the first game of this type that I've played. If you are excited by the idea of owning your own game developing business, this game will hold intrinsic delight for you. That was the case with me, so natuarally I liked this game.Especially at first, it's fun creating the games. Basically, after you decide to make a video game, you allot portions of time to specific development aspects like graphics, sound, world design, etc. You do so by sliding a meter up or down depending on how much time you want to spend on that aspect of design. You must use wisdom, because certain game genres and topics will turn out better or worse depending on how much time you spend on a certain aspect of design. At first the gameplay was exciting for me. It's enjoyable to see the monetary effects of your good game design ;) . But for the most part, you as the player as repeating the same processes for designing each game.  It's not a thoughtless procedure (because you have to figure out what to spend time on in development, pick a topic, etc) but you're pretty much following the same game mechanic(s) over and over to make each game.As times goes on, you can market your game, research new topics, train  and hire employees, put up a booth at the National game convention, take publishing deals, etc. Though these are varying ideas, you pretty much get the same ""feel"" when you're playing. It's point and click stuff, which is normal for a tycoon like this I suppose. For me personally, the game began to bore me a couple of hours into the gameplay, but I allowed myself to enjoy it and had fun making profit. What will keep you coming back is the steady introduction of new consoles and features. Just when you think you've seen all the game features, a new one may come up, like being able to use a Research and Development team to undergo projects.The bottom line is that the feel of the game mechanics feels somewhat repititive and will likely bore you UNLESS you like the idea of being a big-time game dev. If that's you, then that idea which stands behind this game--and the desire to succeed--will be an incentive to play for some time. It wasn't an entirely enthralling experience, but I liked it.			"

												This game is ridiculously addictive. Almost in a scary way... I dropped everything I was doing to play it for three days straight... only sleeping once within that time. I showed it to my friends and got them hooked, too.The game is simple to play but requires a lot of time management and foresight to play well. Knowledge of gaming industry and trends throughout history is helpful, so it's especially a kick to players who have been in the hobby since the 80's. But it's not necessary -- as you play, you can research your published games' success (or failure) to learn what was good or bad about it, and it will add hints to your options next time you create a game, so you don't have to memorize the best audience for the dozens and dozens of topics.There is a really great variety of topics to make games on, from staples like Fantasy, Zombies, and Military, to more obscure things like Hospital and Virtual Pets, to things I don't even understand why they are in there, like Vocabulary and Evolution.There's plenty of replay value, as when you clear the game (make it through 35 years without going bankrupt), you can continue playing infinitely and launch a bunch of consoles or try to get a game to sell 100 million copies, or you can start a new save file (you can have three at once!) and keep all your unlocked research hints from your last game (so you don't have to memorize what combinations are good together, and which games need which focus). And since there's tons of topics, genre combinations, and matchups between those things, you can keep discovering new hints as you play, too. Not to mention there's the hunt for easter eggs (hint: look at the decorations!) and just the ability to expiriment and do weird stuff and see what happens. Maybe you can see if you can last 35 years in your garage, or see how fast you can get to a full staff of employees. The game creates a 'score' based on everything you did before you get to the 'end' mark so you can see which playthrough was the most successful, too, on your personal high-score table.After a while, you stop really thinking about what you're making, though, and just react to the proper categories to file things under... you stop thinking about the actual game you're making and just see it as a number. As long as you push the sliders right and put the right combinations together, it will sell, and that becomes way more important than making the games you want to make. And all the games just boil down to a critic score and sales figure. You can try to role-play, but you will probably fail. Releasing a long-lasting MMO is literally impossible. Want to just release identical sports games every year and rake in the cash like EA? Can't do that. And good luck figuring out what combination sounds most like Super Mario or Sonic the Hedgehog (Fantasy Action?!) ... You start to see the limitations pretty quickly. But it doesn't stop being fun. It just becomes more about the numbers and less about games. I kinda don't even think of it being about games anymore. Perhaps this is an intended criticism of the industry? My guess is it's just an unfortunate byproduct of the game's nature, heh.Anyway, it's very easy to blow away tons of time on this game. You won't want to put it down. If you like recognizing patterns and watching numbers go up, up, up -- this game is definitely for you.My only real complaint is the lack of extra for-fun customization. You can name your games, engines, and character, but other than that, everything is the same every time you play. Same office with the same decorations, and the employees are random and all look similar (can't name or design them). Your character customization options are very limited, ESPECIALLY if you want to play a female character (your clothing options are like... beige shirt... beige long sleeve shirt... etc.) And since the games are nothing but numbers in a log of your completed games, naming them really isn't all that fun after you've done it enough. I started using real game names, but subtituting in the word ""mustache"" for a word. Or just naming it stuff like ""i'm hungry but don't want to get up"" for a flight simulator. Sim games, especially ones named ""Tycoon,"" tend to boast a lot of creativity and customization options... but there is next to none here. This game is all about the strategy and the numbers.			"

												Do I develop a text based adventure or try to make a sim game? Ok text based adventure just to get my foot in the ground.  Oh no, what system? Can I afford a licensing fee? Is there enough market share to make it worth my time? Did I even focus on the correct attributes!? Are adventures even popular at the moment? Ok ok let's release the game, if it fails I'll be bankrupt and that will be the end of me. 7, 6, 6, 8Ok not too bad! I'll live to make a new game! Well do I make a new game or upgrade my game engine!? Should I hire new staff or train existing staff? What to do what to do?These questions and more will be up to you and your new game company. If your itching for a tycoon experience this should be right up your ally. Make games, earn money, hire staff, fire staff, change offices, create game engines, even make your own console. All of these things and more are awaiting for you in this lovely gem of a game. You may even learn a thing or two of the history of consoles, even if they are using fake names. I picked this up during the 2013 Holliday sale and wasn't expecting much, but what I got was a ""just one more game I need good reviews!"" Kind of addiction. I didn't put it down till I got every achievement! If you were a fan of Zoo Tycoon or Roller Coaster Tycoon like I am you should give this game a shot. This game doesn't disappoint! I highly recommend it.			"

												I'm ashamed to say this is my first game of the ""Tycoon"" categeory, and I fell victim to the addictiveness of it for a while.In this game, you play the role of a small, startup game developer, and as the game progresses, you begin to grow into something of a giant in the games industry.While there are some very obvious mechanics that are somewhat unrealistic and don't work as they're expected to sometimes, this game does really take hold of you after a short while. Easy to pick up and learn, this game will have to becoming the developer of your dreams instantly.			"

												Decent simulation of running a game development studio on a conceptual level. I mean, who didn't dream at some point about creating their own super-amazing game - Game Dev Tycoon somewhat delivers.On the mechanic side I believe it really shines with simple presentation and doesn't bog the player down with charts and statistics typical for the genre. Graphics are neat and do the job just fine.Personally couldn't see the replay value after ""completing"" the game but then considering the price of the game during any kind of sale, it's not really expected either. Would say 8/10.  "

												In Game Dev Tycoon, there are a wide range of games you could release on a variety of consoles throughout the years. You start right when gaming takes off or so, with two options to develop for, as time passes on you get more options. Those options are twists on the real names of consoles that have gone through over time, as well as the companies who developed them. A big part of the game is research. What is research exactly? You get research from doing various things such as completing contract work, which gives you money for completion, but takes your money if you don't complete it in time. You can also get it from other things like making games. What is research used for? Upgrades to your games to make them even better and bring in those big scores. Big scores means big money to make more big games. It turns into an endless cycle, until you're a billionaire. Your games can have different topics which you have to research, and can be in a variety of genres. It's up to you to decide what genre and topic works best, and where you should divert your resources during development. You can also hype up your game by putting out ads, or going to the game's equivalent of E3 and setting up a booth. Hyping up a bad game is bad for your company, but hyping up a really good game will reward you greatly. In the second stage of the game you can start to hire staff. They're really useful but aren't that great at first. Remember to train them up, but don't forget to work on your own character as well.Game Dev Tycoon also has a modding community, although some of the mods don't work very well. You can still find plenty of good mods that add content and expand the game though. I didn't get mods myself until after my first or second playthrough though.Some bugs and annoyances I've found are that late game, with too many bubbles your game can lag, although a mod can fix that on the workshop. Also I've recently run into some issues with tabbing out and changing the size of the screen. I haven't run into any game breaking bugs, but watch out if you plan on modding because some of them can conflict, and break the game.I'll give this game a 6.75/10. I enjoyed it a lot but I feel that it does have some issues. I still recommend it, though.			"

There isn't TOO much value end game or replay value I think out of 6 hours but it doesn't matter, its a rising indie and a cheap title. 10/5$ is too little to ask, and you will buy it! BUY IT. NOW.People who rate games with numbers are gay. With that being said, I give this a 9.75/10 it's sooo goooood. If there was more in depth game creation that would be even BETTER but it's still a 10$ indie game. This is a jewel. Pick it up and give it a chance. Also, prepare for the nostalgia trip.			"

												Bought this game on a whim. Absolutely glad I did. One of the most fun games I've played in a while and I haven't played a ""tycoon"" or ""theme <park, hospital>"" game in at least 12 years. Surprisingly addictive with feelings of immense satisfaction when you create a game that skyrockets you to success.  There were several times where I thought my company was going to go under but suddenly found myself on the top of the charts with a random, often extremely goofy, idea.Ended up with a company worth over 1 billion dollars with such hits as ""Dragons Everywhere"" the fantasy RPG adventure. ""Flying or Whatever"" the ground breaking Aircraft - RPG/Simulator and ""Pew Pew UR DEAD"" and its sequel ""Pew Pew I'M DEAD"" which were basically both my ideas for CoD / MoH ripoffs. And who can forget the classic History - Sim/Strategy game ""George Washington Simulator."" Get this game.			"

												This is the first game of this type that I've played. If you are excited by the idea of owning your own game developing business, this game will hold intrinsic delight for you. That was the case with me, so natuarally I liked this game.Especially at first, it's fun creating the games. Basically, after you decide to make a video game, you allot portions of time to specific development aspects like graphics, sound, world design, etc. You do so by sliding a meter up or down depending on how much time you want to spend on that aspect of design. You must use wisdom, because certain game genres and topics will turn out better or worse depending on how much time you spend on a certain aspect of design. At first the gameplay was exciting for me. It's enjoyable to see the monetary effects of your good game design ;) . But for the most part, you as the player as repeating the same processes for designing each game.  It's not a thoughtless procedure (because you have to figure out what to spend time on in development, pick a topic, etc) but you're pretty much following the same game mechanic(s) over and over to make each game.As times goes on, you can market your game, research new topics, train  and hire employees, put up a booth at the National game convention, take publishing deals, etc. Though these are varying ideas, you pretty much get the same ""feel"" when you're playing. It's point and click stuff, which is normal for a tycoon like this I suppose. For me personally, the game began to bore me a couple of hours into the gameplay, but I allowed myself to enjoy it and had fun making profit. What will keep you coming back is the steady introduction of new consoles and features. Just when you think you've seen all the game features, a new one may come up, like being able to use a Research and Development team to undergo projects.The bottom line is that the feel of the game mechanics feels somewhat repititive and will likely bore you UNLESS you like the idea of being a big-time game dev. If that's you, then that idea which stands behind this game--and the desire to succeed--will be an incentive to play for some time. It wasn't an entirely enthralling experience, but I liked it.			"

												I played this game on the phone and loved it! Playing it on the PC doesnt have the same feel to it. I expected more options and interfaces on the pc version and was a bit dissapointed on how much it was the same. There are minor differences in the PC version but none that are worth mentioning. Also another issue I have with this game is that, it is a time table game, so you only have X amount of time in the game to see how far your company can go and see how high you can raise your score within that time frame. They do allow you to play past that time frame but to me it just wasn't worth it and that factor just seemed to ruin the game for me. At least hose are my thoughts, others I know really enjoy the game. I simply suggest trying the phone version before jumping onto the PC  version. I got everything I needed out of the Phone app and the PC game just seemed a little overkill.			"

This might result in a longer gaming experience.-Add more events like ""a Nigerian girl offering sponseringship"". Stuff like ""A movie company offered a chance to make a game of their movie."" or ""A music company wants to buy the soundtrack of -certain game-"".-Add more office upgrades like ""the solar panels"" or ""the ventilation system""*It may possibly be that I haven't discovered all of this games features. These are just my thoughts on 1 playthrough.This being said, I will now start my second playthrough. Cause, yeah, games don't develop themselves, y'know.[UPDATE]Just discovered the 42 years campain. This will make the experience even longer and greater!Shame it's not very clear whether or where to choose that option the first time you play it.			"

												Very Fun Game! I had doubts about it but i still tryied it out. It was a little boring at first but the more stuff i unlocked the better. Also I love how it follwed the drama between game companies and how this affected sales. Creating the the games was probably my 2nd favorite thing in the game. 1st was seeing how they did after i realeased them. I have completed the game and I see how they made it so its ""never-ending"" but it kinda goes downhill from there. I wish when you get employees, they implemented more things to do with them. Instead just make the game creation process go faster and pick who does what in making the game. Overall, I give this game a 8/10.			"

												Ah, Game Dev Tycoon. I find this game fantastic, for one core reason. It's brilliant wishfulness which lets players build and grow a gaming company. You will hire employees, purchase buildings, develop games, build consoles and anything else you can imagine. This is where the game shines, it allows people to an extent express how they think a game company should be ran.However while most gamers will enjoy this game to some degree, if you don't find the idea of running your own company appealing, you'll likely find the game fairly boring since the gameplay is fairly basic. With it completely based upon moving sliders which represent how you and your employees focus effort on how you build your games.Pros:Thematic Endless Wishfulness for gamersSteam workshop helps the longevity of playCons:Gameplay is fairly simple and can get fairly boringGame is fairly unclear on how to make quality gamesWon't get much out if it, if you don't care for the consent of running your own game company.Linux port report: I found the Linux version of this game to be adequate, it still runs smoother on windows, but it's a good effort none the less. The only problems I found was a little bit of additional delay when selecting menus and an occasional font sizing problem. However, despite this, it is perfectly playable on Linux.Overall it's a Solid Recommendation			"

												The story of the game is that you go back to the year 1985 and start your own game company. You start off in a garage which you can upgrade to a technical suite and more! As time progresses there are news popups which describe events that are taking place in the gaming industry at the time. For example: Vonny has just released their second video game system. Some games you make may be a smash hit but others not so great, you must be wise with the topic, genre and console. You can earn millions or become bankrupt. To improve the chance of making a great game is to hire staff which becomes available in the upgraded garage (becomes the technical suite). The staff can be used to help make games, research topics and research different features of the engine. When you start off, the game may be a bit tricky but once you learn which topic matches with which genre it will seem easier. With the ability to make games there is a cost. At the start of each career you recieve a certain budget which you can use to develop your first game! It randomly selects the first topics you can use so don't excpect to get the one you want. During making games with the budget you can go bankrupt, although it seems bad you can get two chances before you finally go bankrupt and have to start over.Overall Rating: 9/10 (Highly Recommended)I rate this game a 9 out of 10 because of how addicting it is, the details of the game and the dream of any gamer to make their own game company. Green Heart Games need to make a few tweaks which are only little ones. For example when the reviews of the games you make pop up it takes 20 seconds to display all of them. I feel that this wastes time but you can download a mod off of the workshop to reduce it to 1 second but hopefully they will change it anyway :).Thanks for reading this review and good luck with your game company :)Daniel			"

												In Game Dev Tycoon, there are a wide range of games you could release on a variety of consoles throughout the years. You start right when gaming takes off or so, with two options to develop for, as time passes on you get more options. Those options are twists on the real names of consoles that have gone through over time, as well as the companies who developed them. A big part of the game is research. What is research exactly? You get research from doing various things such as completing contract work, which gives you money for completion, but takes your money if you don't complete it in time. You can also get it from other things like making games. What is research used for? Upgrades to your games to make them even better and bring in those big scores. Big scores means big money to make more big games. It turns into an endless cycle, until you're a billionaire. Your games can have different topics which you have to research, and can be in a variety of genres. It's up to you to decide what genre and topic works best, and where you should divert your resources during development. You can also hype up your game by putting out ads, or going to the game's equivalent of E3 and setting up a booth. Hyping up a bad game is bad for your company, but hyping up a really good game will reward you greatly. In the second stage of the game you can start to hire staff. They're really useful but aren't that great at first. Remember to train them up, but don't forget to work on your own character as well.Game Dev Tycoon also has a modding community, although some of the mods don't work very well. You can still find plenty of good mods that add content and expand the game though. I didn't get mods myself until after my first or second playthrough though.Some bugs and annoyances I've found are that late game, with too many bubbles your game can lag, although a mod can fix that on the workshop. Also I've recently run into some issues with tabbing out and changing the size of the screen. I haven't run into any game breaking bugs, but watch out if you plan on modding because some of them can conflict, and break the game.I'll give this game a 6.75/10. I enjoyed it a lot but I feel that it does have some issues. I still recommend it, though.			"

												Decent simulation of running a game development studio on a conceptual level. I mean, who didn't dream at some point about creating their own super-amazing game - Game Dev Tycoon somewhat delivers.On the mechanic side I believe it really shines with simple presentation and doesn't bog the player down with charts and statistics typical for the genre. Graphics are neat and do the job just fine.Personally couldn't see the replay value after ""completing"" the game but then considering the price of the game during any kind of sale, it's not really expected either. Would say 8/10.  "

												Game Dev Tycoon is a fun little casual game well worth picking up while on sale. You start as a single person in your garage and work your way up to the CEO of an AAA game studio. Anyone who has played a variety of games over the years will enjoy coming up with their favorite game combos and thinking from the end of an indie game developer. I think the style of the artwork may convey a generic-ville type feeling but it's a proper game. There is no in-game purchasing micro-transaction garbage. The game has a definite goal and is not a mindless grinding simulator. I am a slow gamer but it took me about thirty hours before I was able to complete all the achievements in the game. I will likely put another ten hours in just to see how fast I can beat the game now that I have proper experience in it.I think some of the negative reviews that are on here are frustrated with replay value and min/maxing their games. I'd like to address that. This game is most fun when experienced at the beginning without a guide. If you go in with a guide you're just going to want to hit all the hard points right off the bat and you'll completely lose the fun the game, even if you succeed. Don't be afraid to try things and learn, as the game is very good with rewarding you regardless of success or failure. For example if you decide to try a game combination/configuration that does not work, the game permanently records a reminder in your history when you write your game report. Should you decide to restart your game, it will give you the option to retain that knowledge in the new game. Game Dev Tycoon is also good about not giving you too much to handle up front, easing you into the development process, while at the same time not giving you any choices that are completely useless. So feel free to experiment with new opportunities! When it is beneficial for you to use a publisher the option will appear (never too soon.) and even the random 'events' that occur give you a bonus even if you make the 'wrong choice'.When it comes to replay again I believe it relies on not getting a game guide right off the bat. You'll go bankrupt a few times learning but it's okay, like I mentioned your 'progress' is still pretty much saved. Once you get the swing of things you'll quickly level your studio up quickly to where you were previously. With a guide you'll just be frustrated you are not hitting 10/10 games every single time and just quit at the beginning.			"

												It's a trial-and-error-based strategy game, and once you start to figure out each of the five genres, the game is pretty easy. Even with multi-genre mixups it's pretty self-explanatory on how to allocate your time during development. Past this thin surface level of gameplay, there really isn't enough depth to keep you going.A lot of seemingly obvious features are missing from the development process, probably to keep the game simpler and more accessible, but I feel like a lot of replayability is lost in their absence. For every step in the development process of a game, I found myself wanting more concise control, but this is by no means a game of micro-management. You market your game by pressing ""market"" and have little to no input on HOW your game is marketed, for example. The success of your game winds up relying on when you release your game, and how you allocated your time. It's so bare-bones and minimal that the sense of achievement wears off quickly and you begin to feel like you're not working for your success. That being said, I still played for about 10-12 hours before it was effortles and mundane, so I think I still got my moneys worth. If you're looking for a simple game to relax to where you don't have to do much aside from click through menu's, it's a great choice, and that's really all I wanted.			"

												Game Dev Tycoon is a fun and entertaining Simulator that allows players to take control of their own Game Company, starting off in the basement on their own, the Simulation tasks players with carefully creating a team of developers to aid them in their game making, while making game history!Pros:- Easy to use and read UI- Takes players through console history up to the present day.- Helpful tutorial- Addictive Start-Mid game content- Active and friendly community, as well as a decently explained wikia pageCons:- Less End game content (i.e research, office expansions, staff training)- Not much replayability, except to beat your previous score, unless you went bankrupt before the end of the game or for the achievements.Conclusion:Excellent game, the developers care for the game and community by actively increasing the content and fixing bugs.

												Grade 8.5/10Reasoning: It is a great game, It allows for large creativity and simulates a great simulator for company management and business. However after you beat it, it just gets repetitive. I know it is technically supossed to be infinite, but still. It took me around 7 hours to beat the game. That was just because I was lucky and had good managemnt, expect the game to last about 20 hours max before ""free play"" mode. However the experience itself is great and it one of the most well-designed games I have seen. If it is on sale this is amust-buy and even if it is, you should consider it.

Choose a genre, platform, and away you go.There's research trees, training, design choices, and even audiance choices. That's just in the first hour of playing.You'll see lots of homage to old and current game systems. These will make you either smile or cringe.If you snag it at 50% off, you'll be glad y ou did.

There are so many great mods in this game, but I have not invested in these too much yet.I recently played through the game in a 6/7-hour game and actually discovered several features which I had not previously discovered (such as the homage to this service which is dubbed 'Grid') and, not only was it fun to play, but the experience was different; and no two files will likely have the same development path for topics, as all of the topics appear in a random order.This game is one of my personal favourites, not only for the hilarious titles that can come up, but for the achievements which bay homage to classic games (such as Pong and Doom). I would recommend this to any casual gamer who is happy to spend countless hours playing this legendary game.10/10			"

												I've only played this game for about 10 hours and it's made an amazingly addictive game.  PREMIS: You a game developer (starting out in a garage) who starts their game dev career in the early 1980s. You go through to about 30 to 40 years. In that time you upgrade your HQ add other game devs to your team. GAMEPLAY: Click anywhere on the screen to go to a menu usually I either reserched or devoloped a new game. When you develop a game you pick a topic, pick a genre,( two later on) what console it will be on, the engine, and the name(which doesn't effect the game at all). When you start developing something it'll have these dots( either orange: design, dark orange: bugs, blue: technology, and dark blue: research) they will go to these tabs and these also depend on how good your game is. Also these menus pop up where say you can only have 99 jelly beans. Which Those are divided into 3 parts (3 times for a game) you can only have 99 jelly beans so, say if you want to focus more on graphic than sound then sound could be like 66 jelly beans and the other two are 33. Overall this game is very fun( also there are mods) the first time you beat it you feel acomplished. But the second time you can keep your hints about what goes and what doesn't. 9.5/10			"

												This game is AWESOME!Honestly, any game where you can create best-selling games which have names like 'Drop That Soap' and make advanced consoles called the 'Compubox Too' is one worth investing in. There are so many great mods in this game, but I have not invested in these too much yet.I recently played through the game in a 6/7-hour game and actually discovered several features which I had not previously discovered (such as the homage to this service which is dubbed 'Grid') and, not only was it fun to play, but the experience was different; and no two files will likely have the same development path for topics, as all of the topics appear in a random order.This game is one of my personal favourites, not only for the hilarious titles that can come up, but for the achievements which bay homage to classic games (such as Pong and Doom). I would recommend this to any casual gamer who is happy to spend countless hours playing this legendary game.10/10			"

												For $10.99 this game proves to be worth the money. Made only by 2 people Game Dev Tycoon proves to be a very positive start to Greenheart Games, providing smooth and addictive gameplay.Gameplay: Simple to grasp and very diverse it offers a good in depth look at the game industry and allows you to make repetitive COD games and watch them flop as they should. Gameplay is heavily addictive and makes you want to keep playing until you make that big block buster game and then keeps you striving to best that one. I have nearly 10 hours in just two days which is a rather high amount.Pros:-Game has workshop support and there's lots of mods on the shop I can't say if they're good because I'm too busy with the base game to get into the mods atm but I'll update this review later. *UPDATE* so ive broswed the steam workshop for this game and there is a fair amount of mods that add some nice content to the game. That being said the workshop support definetly adds to the games worth.-Very easy to get the hang of.- Has real life consoles (renamed to avoid copy right) and has some real game industry history behind them like the PS2 putting Sega out of business or the Sony VS Microsoft feud.- Allows you to make mobile and handheld/portable games (I.E. Apple Phone,Nintendo DS,PSP. ETC)- You can make your own console to compete with other developers and then make games exclusivly for your console.-Can take part in industrail sabatage.-Real life hazards. (I.E. Credit Card Fraud, Games not living up to hype resulting in poor sales, People pirating your games. ETC)- Played for 10 hours and havent incountered any bugs or glitches which is a big PRO.- Very diverse and has a lot of depth and really provides some cool insight into the game industry.Neutral:- Can feel like good ratings are luck based at times but in the real game industry thats sometimes the case so not a negative or positive.- It can feel like a bit of a grind to increase the stats of your employees (I.E. increasing Tech, Design, Speed)- You Can't set the price of your games. Games sell at fixed rates which doesnt ruin gameplay but takes away from the immersion a little.CONS:-Game can eventually feel repetitive.- Not a lot of generes (I.E. When making a game you can pick from only a few generes that are popular ones but none the less you have limited selection and no way of unlocking more (you can unlock the casual games but thats the only one to my knowledge) ***Will update if I find a way outside the workshop to get more***- *** No more cons that I can think of currently for game dev tycoon. If I find some I will post them here.Rating: 9.5/10Explanation for Rating: Game Dev Tycoon for its low price of $10.99 (CAD) offers solid gameplay and gives you your moneys worth. For a game made by two people it sure was well developed and thought out. The game has no major bugs or glitches that I have encountered yet. Greenheart games have given it Steam Workshop support which more game devs should follow suit in as its an easy way to allow fans of the game to continue to add to the game by making mods which double as free DLC. If the game had the things I mentioned in the neutral section and found a way to maybe fix the cons this would easily be a 10/10 but for their first game a 9.5 is solid better than what I did in Game Dev Tycoon I got a meazly 5.25.

												Have you ever dreamed of being a game developer and designing the perfect game? Well, now you can!Game Dev Tycoon is a charming business sim where your main aim is to make great games (and rake in cash by doing so). The system is fairly simple: pick a genre and platform, then adjust the sliders as needed to allocate different amounts of time to different aspects of the game, and assigning different people to handle said aspects. However, while the basic development process is simple and easy to grasp, there's a surprising amount of depth to the game. As you progress through the years, new platforms will appear on the market, and you'll be able to unlock new genres of games to make, and new features to put in your custom engines, so that you can customize your games to be just about anything you want them to be. Eventually you'll be able to do massive projects like AAA games, MMOs, and even original consoles. Mods for the game often add even more features, topics, and events, increasing the customizability. All of this makes a really simple but entertaining and addictive game, as you let your imagination run free.The game has very bare-bones graphics, but it doesn't really need much to work anyway. The main appeal of the game is letting your imagination form its own image of what kind of games you're making, and trying to make them as good and successful as possible. It doesn't have much music either, but what few music tracks it does have are nice enough, Still, it wouldn't have hurt to add a few more songs.It's not a perfect game, though. While the customization aspect is one of the main draws, it can actually end up a drawback as well, in a couple of ways. First, there are sometimes simply TOO MANY options, and not enough resources to obtain them for use (a problem that can be exacerbated by mods that add even more). See, the way you unlock new genres and engine features, is by researching them by spending research points. You get these by developing games and engines, and by completing contract work, but you don't have any control over how many you get, while new features keep costing more and more as the game goes on (each new genre costs 10 RP... early engine features like mono sound also cost 10-15, but more advanced ones will cost 20, 40, 80, or more, up to 200). You also have to spend research points to upgrade your team's skills, spreading them even more thin. This can often feel imbalanced, and like you never have enough points to upgrade what you want.There is also, unfortunately, a degree of railroading in the customization as well, because while you can make whatever kind of game you like, there are pre-set combinations listed as successful or otherwise on different platforms. You CAN go and make that Horror Simulation game for Young audiences, but you shouldn't expect it to score or sell as well as a Fantasy RPG, or indeed very well in any case. It would have been nice if the game had let you be a little more innovative and out-of-the-box with your games.Still, despite these drawbacks, the core of the game is still very solid. It's still loads of fun to make new games. It's fun to try and get new features to add to them. The business end of it, while a little on the light side, is also good. Altogether this makes for a good, if not amazing, simulator that you'll still find yourself sinking plenty of hours into.As a bonus, it does come with a lot of fun achievements of various levels of difficulty (a lot of which are hidden but can be looked up), and Steam cards, for those who like those kinds of things.Good luck, and remember: always aim for 11s.

One of the top reasons why I enjoy this is because it goes through the era of game-making which is truly fascinating, so you can experience how it was like in different eras and how technology advances day by day.

												here is my opinion, after finishing it.the game itself designs on simple concepts, and simple gameplays as you can find in tycoon games. it is nothing out of ordinary. however, there are several things that make it enjoyable.Trials and Errors gameplay is challenging while it lasts. however, despite the fancy amount of contents it can offer, it comes down to several style of play to finish the game. after several hours, your fancy-named games will be come Games #01, Games #02, and so on.the trial and error will become the rotation between 3-5 combinations.(assume that you go for vanilla playthough)Community Mods brings the game to its peak, more contents, more challenges, and .. cough .. cough .. mul..multiplayer mod. There are good amounts of them available, ranging from simple add-on to overhaul.bottomline, check this game out if you want, it worths your purchase. recommended for those who love tycoon-style gameplay, else steer away from it.

												I had this game sitting in my inventory for at a month.  I assumed it'd be mediocre at best........I was wrong.  This game is great! I grew up with video games so playing this was quite nostalgic.  I love how they cycle through all the systems that were released.  It's not a walk in the park, I'd say its fair to expect to lose quite a few times.   I just sat through a good 2-3 hour sitting and I will definately play more.  For the price this game is a must have, very happy I got it.Also very cool that the team started out with two brothers.

												My first thoughts about this game were contradictory - Creating games while playing game? But I've decided to give It a try especially since It showed up on sale. I was wrong, Game Dev Tycoon brings you decent fun for a few hours, depending on your end game goal. I've found this game quite challenging from start, since you can get easily bankrupted for making a series of bad decisions while learning game mechanics, but that's what It's about, right?I had a great time watching how my company grows, but after you reach top scores and end-game, It gets very repetitive.Maybe if there was more game mechanics (ingame ones are simple and game Itself limits you in styles how you create and sell your products).Overall I didn't regret buying this game on sale, but I would if I paid full price.

												Does this really teach you how games are made and how companies work? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA actually kinda. It's a good little indie game, especially with how incredibly ridiculous you can make the game. For a good record, how about naming a company organic butts and making every game you make have butts in the title? That's exactly what I did, and you can do that too. I'd recommend it as a game to play from beginning to end, as it really emphisizes creativity and flexability. So give this one a shot, I think you'd like it a lot.			"

I recommend this game for anyone who enjoys devoting there time to absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t for hours on end. I say that because, and I'm a huge lover of this game, I love it a lot, it's a very repetitive game yet I find myself wanting to play more. It's all I want to do. Need more money. Need more fans. Need to make it to slot number 1 at the booths. Must. Get. Unobtanium. Achievement. It's a never-ending cycle of wants and needs. I love it. 10/10 will continue to play forever.			"

												This game came to my attention through a story on Facebook, about how the devs released a pirated copy for download at the same time as releasing the game for general sale, it was such a novel approach to the problem that I immediately purchased the game.Well, the game is just as novel as that approach, what starts off as a simple sim, branches out into a complex management game that pulls you through the brief history of videogames in an off kilter way. The game is thoroughly enjoyable as you find yourself striving to make a better game than last time, or dipping your toe into a new genre of development on an entirely unknown platform and training your team of employees to be able to crank that AAA title idea you've been harbouring.Although somewhat short, the achievements available make the game good for several playthroughs and you can even continue on past the end of game mark should you wish. I've found Game Dev Tycoon to be devilishly addictive, losing an entire weekend to it!This deserves some of your attention, buy it!			"

												There is a good solid 4-6 hours in this game (just one play through), especially if you can make it to the end of the game, and make the correct decisions.  The Good: - You have to make the right decisions to make the most successful game.  There isn't a lot of randomness to your game ratings. You really do feel like you are in control.  - It is fun to see the history of the gaming industry over the last 20 years or so, and relive some of your childhood by actually developing for some of your favorite consoles!The Bad:- Each time you play through the game, the same consoles and events in history happen.  It would be nice to have alternate timelines where some consoles did bad that would normally do good.- After you figure out what combos work the best, and the mechanics, there really isn't much challenge to the game.Overall, I do recommend this game, but make sure you get it on sale!

												This ♥♥♥♥ is quite addicting. I'm a sucker for tycoon games and I usually only play for less than an hour but this.. damnnnn nigguhhh. It's basically just repeating the same thing over and over again, but it manages to keep you playing. You'll loose track of time, 4 hours will only seem like 20 minutes. At first it isn't that fun, but when you sell a hit game you'll feel really good and proud of yourself and you'll get all cocky that you have a surplus amount of money and make a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game or hire too much employees and then you ragequit, pretty much the only thing that'll stop you from playing, but after a five minute break or so, you'll be wanting more.

												I had this game sitting in my inventory for at a month.  I assumed it'd be mediocre at best........I was wrong.  This game is great! I grew up with video games so playing this was quite nostalgic.  I love how they cycle through all the systems that were released.  It's not a walk in the park, I'd say its fair to expect to lose quite a few times.   I just sat through a good 2-3 hour sitting and I will definately play more.  For the price this game is a must have, very happy I got it.Also very cool that the team started out with two brothers.  They dev'd the game themselves but had to hire on another person to help with PR.			"

You can make thousands of games with many combinations, that is one of the reasons I love this game. Also you can advance into different offices which give it more of a background. One of the top reasons why I enjoy this is because it goes through the era of game-making which is truly fascinating, so you can experience how it was like in different eras and how technology advances day by day.

												You start off as a single game dev operating out of your garage, and then slowly expand as you move to bigger office, hire more people and just grow.The game starts off in the distant past, and contains homages to major consoles & other gaming device, albeit with similar names, no doubt to avoid legal wrangles.Gameplay wise, this game will have you hooked. From researching new topics to new technologies for your custom game engine to training yourself & staff to generating reports on your past games to figuring out what game/topic/genre/system combo works well to delivering that blockbuster game - you'll be doing all these tasks at once, but with none of the micromanagement.Sounds are nice, but it is the gameplay which will have you on playing for a while - trying to squeeze that one game with hopes that it will get a perfect score.Highly recommended.

												A lot of people seem to think that developing games is as easy as doing what you did the last time, but only doing it better. The gaming industry can be very finicky, and usually successful games are successful if the market and timing is just right. But to anyone that thinks that they can make video games, here ya go. Starting you off at the beginning of the video game revolution, but just after the Video Game Crash of '83, this game puts you in the role of a software designer. I use that term over video game maker because you can develop game engines, pick up white hat hacking jobs from different companies for cash and develop games for a variety of consoles. I got as far as the Playstation/N64 era with my games, and saw the release of the Dreamcast, but I failed due to poor decisions, rehashes, and bad marketing. It's not that the game is tough, you should just know that you can't expect a great game just because of a name, which is true to real life. I highly recommend this game, not only because of how real it felt, but also because of how much fun it is. If you've ever wondered if you could make video games for a living, believe me, this game is for you.			"

												Game Dev Tycoon is one of those surprises that you find along your game year. I was waiting until Steam Sale to purchase this game, due to lack of reviews/people talking about it. You see, I'm a big fan of Tycoon games, and its easy to play one of this genre and see a lot of mistakes/bugs ruining the gameplay. This is not true to GDT. If I knew what I know now, I'd purchase this game right away.Combining a good mixture of good design and gameplay, Greenheart Games made me feel like the little guy in the garage building my first game. You see, with Tycoon games you usually see yourself as the manager or some kind of God Like creature. In this title I felt so compelled to strive that I couldn't wait to release my major game and everytime a so-so review came in, I felt dissapointed. The pacing is great. Along the years you see consoles rise and fall and new technologies appear. Eventually you move out of your little garage and a office takes place. Then a fellow co-worker or two...And when you realize, its been 20 years already and you're a multi-million game dev studio, with lots of employees and each one with a different skill.Although the interface is not winning Design award of the Year, it's still very user friendly, and will leave no room for doubt as to where things are and how they work.This game takes me back to the time where I found a sentiment of ""wonder"" in games. Greenheart Games, thanks for the experience.""I can't wait for the sequel!""                    - Tarik Ventura			"

												Genre: Casual/SimulationOverview: While the repetative nature of this game will limit the amount of fun you will have in subsequent replays, the initial playthrough was incredibly fun and addictive and took me somewhere between 6-8 hours to ""finish"" the game. Replay Value: After you are scored, you have the option to continue playing, but past this point no new technologies, systems, etc. will appear in the game and you are left with making games for whatever the last gen of consoles is (or for your own console). After playing around with various combinations of genres, you can import the effectiveness ratings for any new games that you make in a new playthrough.Gameplay: Many people who pick up this game have likely come across Game Dev Story from Kairosoft. Obvious influence aside, this game adds its own flavor to the game dev ""genre."" Without spoiling too much, eventually the game opens up to give the player many options through building a research team. The progression is streamlined and feels complete. The player starts in a garage and eventually finds himself the head of a major gaming corporation. With this progression, the complexity of the game changes drastically, but, for the most part, these changes are largely cosmetic in nature. The core gameplay is not particularly deep or even challenging. Any gaming vet will know which combinations work vs. which don't through common sense alone, without the need for a guide to hold your hand. Price/Value: Overall, expect to invest somewhere between 10-20 hours on this game. If this is something you deem fair for a $10 price tag, then by all means go for it. Those 10-20 hours will be a lot of fun. However, if longetivity is your concern, then perhaps wait for a steam sale. At the time of this writing, the game is on sale for $5. At this price I can wholeheartedly recommend you pick it up.Score: 7/10			"

												here is my opinion, after finishing it.the game itself designs on simple concepts, and simple gameplays as you can find in tycoon games. it is nothing out of ordinary. however, there are several things that make it enjoyable.Trials and Errors gameplay is challenging while it lasts. however, despite the fancy amount of contents it can offer, it comes down to several style of play to finish the game. after several hours, your fancy-named games will be come Games #01, Games #02, and so on.the trial and error will become the rotation between 3-5 combinations.(assume that you go for vanilla playthough)Community Mods brings the game to its peak, more contents, more challenges, and .. cough .. cough .. mul..multiplayer mod. There are good amounts of them available, ranging from simple add-on to overhaul.bottomline, check this game out if you want, it worths your purchase. recommended for those who love tycoon-style gameplay, else steer away from it.

												Ricks Review:Summary:Gameplay: 8/10 - Simple and Qurky at times which is enjoyable, childlike and frustrating.Game Making: 9/10 - Researching new topics, engine and engine bits allows for managable customization of your game and with many mods extending the lists of these for more replayability. Pushing sliders up and down to influence how you game looks, feels and plays is key to making your game a success. While matchin the right Topic, Genre and Console is the most frustrating, obvious and simplistic thing ever devised, it sometimes causes frustration in ""How do they not work!"" and ""OMG!!! I got a Super-Amazing game!""Console Making: 9/10 - Although not at all similar to creating a Game and only available in the late game, it is surprisingly enjoyable to create a 15 billion credit machine to compete against Vonnys and Mirconofts superboxes. Compared to game making, the choices are few to graphics, technology and optimization, and the console designs are limited to a select few (Xbox, Wii, PS2, and the Box) with upto 3 different variations depending on the console type.MMO Making: 8/10 - I listed this different from Game Making as its selling process is totally different compared to the generic game, as it can sell Forever! Unlike basic, generic games, MMOs can sell for intill the player decides to stop selling it (which can be for any reason the player decides on). The best way to keep selling the MMO is to keep advertising it and putting Addons onto it. I rated this lower because it felt limited and cannot be unlocked through standard researching but through a R&D lab (Research and Development Laboratory).Sequels Making: 7/10 - Again placed these types of games under a different review because they are similar to eachother and different to MMOs and Generic game making. Sequels in the base game are unlocked several years down the timeline but can be modded to be unlocked after you create your first game. Sequels allow for the player to create an entirely new version of a pre-made game, (Real Honour 1, 2 or 3 etc.) the ratings of your sequel will depend on the time since last game was released and if the game was made on a new engine (with other tech changing the ratings as well). However, creating a sequel replaces that game so if your sequel was rated bad and your wanted to start from the begining you cannot do this and you'll need to make a sequel of the sequel. Addon Making: 5/10 - Similar to sequels but only apply to MMOs, you can create an expansion pack for your MMO game which can encourage more people to buy the game and play it. That is really it. You can however apply Game choices like new graphics or additions, but this is it. Nothing more nothing less.Research: 10/10 - Nothing really to improve on. You can research Game Topics (Spy, Fantasy etc.), Engines, Engine Components (Animations, cutscenes etc.), Casual genre, new gameplay additions (marketing, target markets) and that is really it. After you reach late-game, you can get a Research and Development lab which is used to unlock Console Making, MMO/Addon making, Company Exhibitions and better hardware. UI: 5/10 - UI is well designed, it is simple but accessible. However is very quirky and annoying, sometime changing the game title can be awkward. Menu buttons fail to respond or work sometimes, and clicking on a button can make another thing happen. Technical ability of the UI is poor but the display is good.Audio: 10/10 - Best thing about this game is the relaxing, jazz-style music which plays.Moddability: 4/10 - I don't understand how to mod this game, so I rely on the community to judge half of the review for this part. Lots of mods available from similar topics and research to gameplay changes and addons. Workshop compatability helps as it installs mods to your files directly and hosts several pages of fun and awesome mods. However I do occasionally run into faults with modding and workshop, from mods not being installed properly and requiring to access the game, turning the mods on and restarting the game for them to work. Although  easy to live with, just frustrating and takes time away from playing the game.Main Points:Great gameplay, from heavily customizable games to creating amazing supermachines to compete against Vonny or Mirconoft.Great jazz audio which is relaxing and satisfying.Modding support greatly extends the shelf life and fun of the game, even with its qurks.Improvements: Improve the UI technicality, sometimes buttons fail to respond or work, button pressing may cause another button to be pressed and changing the game title is very awkward.

Well, bang-for-your-buck this one really scores HIGH.  The gameplay is pretty similar to that of the 'Democracy' series (all buttons and sliders) but still somehow manages to achieve the just-one-more-turn effect that makes the 'Civilization' series so notorious.  Despite being fairly repetative, you still find yourself replaying the game several times to unlock all the genres and find the perfect combos...and get that awkward-as-hell 11/10 review for your Cop/Puzzle Adventure game...Recommended price: anything under £6.99			"

												When purchasing this game, little did I know how addicting it would be. I've played a similar game on my iPhone, but this one is by far more challenging and has more to offer.You start off in your garage, on your own, making video games. As you progress you move up into your own office and can hire people to work for you. Each game you make you choose the amount of time and effort that is put into producing certain aspects of the game. You also can research more enhancements that can be used to create your own gaming engine to produce even better games. Once a game is made and released it gets rated by four gaming magazines (those jerks can be a bit harsh at times...And yes, giving your game a name does seem to matter because if you don't one of thse guys ussually calls you on it).This game has replay value to it, which is what I enjoy. You can go back, make a new company and try and outdo yourself, try different combinations, do what ever you want. Good game, and I would suggest giving it a try.			"

												A very fun and unqiue Tycoon game. While we get tycoon games that make us run railroads, prisions,hosptials, movie theaters, Zoo's, and amusement parks.This tycoon game has us being our very own video game developer. Every video gamer's dream. The only downside to this game is its ""rating"" system on games. You can't really seem to tell what's ""good"", ""bad"" and ugly"" sure it ranges from 1 to a perfect 10. But sometimes it may or may not sell well. Also working with ""medium"" and ""large"" games you can't really seem to tell that clearly what is necessarry. Also while the game gives you ""hints"" as to what's good for that game or not. It isn't really straight forwardly defined and it forces the player to make ""judgement"" calls i mean it IS a tycoon game after allWith modding including this game has limitless, endless fun. However it is sad because much like Skyrim. This game should've had a lot of these good mods in the game to begin with and not as something the modding community has to do. But then again it shows how much a community cares about the game so there is an upside.I seriously recommend this game for Tycoon fans and for all gamers who want to be that next inspiring video game developer			"

												This game, this game really brings me back. It reminds me of my dream to be a developer for video games. On the other hand, it reminds that will never happen. Whenever I see that I've wasted millions of dollars on an awful game, I FEEL the impact. Even if you only lose 100 fans and you have over 1200 of them, you feel dreadful. That's what I like about this game. It has feeling even if it's a game with no actual story. It's made something so brilliant I can't understand it. In conclusion, this game is one the THE BEST games on steam and you can really tell that the developers TIME, EFFORT, and MONEY into the game.

												One of the best tycoon/simulation games around. I can't recommend this game enough to anyone who's into such games. It's a relatively simple game, but it's pretty addicting once you get into it.You can not only make your own games (there's a variety of genres that you can mix and match to your heart's delight; even more with the Steam Workshop) but your own game consoles (even more of them too with Steam Workshop) as well. You can even make your own version of Steam in game.From a humble setting (a garage in the 1980s), this game offers you the chance to forge your own way through gaming history and I've had a blast doing exactly that.Whether full price or on sale, I wholly recommend getting this game.And Greenheart, I saw your thank you message in game.

I wish there were chances to give the games you develop more creative input, like designing the box of the game or the cover, or at least a brief description, you just can name the game and set the type though.Also you have the developing process to focuss on different parts of the game.I consider this a must-buy for fans of the genre!

												Reminded me of the mobile game ""Game Dev Story"" by Kairosoft. The developer certainly took inspiration from that, but also added something more. Sometimes a clone game can be terrible, but sometimes, like with this game, the clone is far better than the original. If you want to know how game development works and how much work goes into it, you will appreciate games, in general, more. You will write less angry reviews and won't be mean on the forums about it.

												     Game Dev Tycoon , bir oyun yapma simulasyonudur.Oyuna Eski bir bilgisayar ve kendi evimizin garajında başlıyoruz.Ama tabikide hep aynı yerde oyun yapmıyoruz.Oyuna başladığımızda belli bir miktar paramız oluyor, oyüzden hemen bir ofise geçemiyoruz.Bir ofise geçmemiz içinse 2M veya daha fazla para isteniyor.Bu miktarda bir para gözünüzü korkutmasın.Para nasıl mı kazanılıyor dersiniz ? :     Oyunda çeşitli konular ile çeşitli oyun türleri var.Bizim oyundaki amacımız ise bu ikisini güzel bir kombinasyon haline getirerek ortaya güzel bir oyun çıkarmak.Eğer doğru kombinasyonu tutturabilirseniz sıra geldi platform seçmeye , oyuna ilk başladığımızda platform olarak sadece G64 ve PC var.Hemen endişelenmeyin ! Oyunda İlerlediğinizde xBox, Playstation , Nintendo Wii ve benzeri markaların konsolları da açılıyor.Ama dediğim gibi ; İlerleyen zamanlarda... Bu platformlar yayınlandığında ise karşınıza büyük bir sorun çıkıyor,bu platformların lisansı her bir konsol için ayrı lisans satın almanız gerekiyor.(Bu arada lisans demişken bu oyun , bu oyunun yapımcısı olan GreenHearts'ın ilk oyunu olduğu için oyunda ne xBox'ın ne Nintendo'nun ne de Playstation'ın lisansı var.Ama GreenHearts telif yememek için xBox'u mBox , Nintendo'yu Ninvento , Playstation'ı ise Playsystem olarak isimlendirmişler.)şimdi gelelim oyumuzun ilk yapılış aşamasına :     1.Aşama : İlk aşamamızda motor,oynanış ve hikaye isimli 3 tane bar çıkıyor.Biz ise seçtiğimiz oyun türüne göre bu barları yukarı veya aşağı çekiyoruz.Örn :Bir simulasyon oyununda oynanış önemliyse onu yukarı doğru çekiyoruz.Tüm barları doğru koyduğunuza inanıyorsanız ''tamam'' a tıklayıp biraz beklemeniz gerekli.Çünkü tamam a tıkladıktan sonra adamınız seçtiğiniz barlara göre çalışmakta olacaktır(Merak etmeyin çok uzun sürmüyor.)     2.Aşama: Bu aşamada ise yine 3 tane bar karşımıza çıkıyor.Fakat bu barların isimleri farklı , diyaloglar , bölüm tasarımı ve yapay zeka. Yine bu barlarıda arttırıp azaltıyorsunuz.Örn: Bir aksiyon oyununda yapay zeka önemliyse onu yukarı çekin.Tüm barları ayarladığınızda yine ''tamam''a basıp bir süre adamınızın o barlara göre oyunu tasarlamasını bekliyoruz.     3.Aşama: Bu aşamadaki barlar ise , dünya tasarımı , grafik ve ses.Burada da barları yukarı veya aşşağı çekerek vericeğimiz zamanı değerlendiriyoruz.Örn :Bir aksiyon oyununda grafik önemli ise onu yukarı çekiceksiniz.Bunları ayarladıktan sonra yine ''tamam''a basıp devam ediyorsunuz.Ve oyununuz hazır ! 3.Aşamayıda yaptıktan sonra karşınıza bir ekran çıkıyor ve 2 seçenek beliriyor : Çöp kutusuna at veya oyunu yayınla.Siz oyuna yeni başladığınız için tabikide oyunu yayınla seçeneğini seçiceksiniz.Vee oyununuz yayınlandı ! Oyununuzu yayınladıktan bir ekran beliriyor sonra yaptığınız kombinasyona ve barlardaki yukarı aşağı seçimlerinize göre 4 adet oyun profesyoneli veya dergisi(artık ne diyorsanız) oyununuza 10 üzerinden bir puan veriyor.Aldığınız puanların ortalamasına göre oyununuzun satışlarıda değişiyor.Örneğin hepsinden 10 puan aldığınız bir oyunla , hepsinden 5 aldığınız oyunun satışları arasından bir hayli fark oluyor.     Oyun hakkında anlatılacak daha çok şey var fakat çok fazla şey yazdım.Oyüzden burada bitiriyorum.Eğer oyunla ilgili sorunlarınız veya bilmek istediğiniz şeyler varsa bana mesaj atarak ulaşabilirsiniz.Ve oyunu almak hakkında tereddüte düştüyseniz hiç tereddüt etmeden alın.Verdiğimiz paranın her kuruşunu hakeden bir oyun ! İncelemem hoşunuza gittiyse ve oyun hakkında ufakta olsa bir fikir edindiyseniz ne mutlu bana... İyi Oyunlar !			"

I get lost for hours upon hours and it stays fun and exciting the entire time, the visuals are cute and simple but the core of this game is what makes it one of best PC games I've ever played, it truely is the pinnacle of how fancy graphics are not needed to make a perfect game. I grew up with Atari, Apple II, Commedore 64, NES, SEGA, etc.etc. so this game just pours on the nostolgia with the sounds and style plus the hilarious alternative universe gaming console lineup for you to develop on, create your own world at your own pace and develop games you always wanted or you can play it like real history, pretend you were on the ground floor of Valve, Sega, Nintendo, Sony or Microsoft, create the top games of all time and see how filthy rich you can get while having a blast + training your brain all at the same time!I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this game, instant classic and one of my all time favorite games.11/10 - it's that good!

The game makes you care about your brave hero, who start his(her) carreer from basement and paves the road higher up, changing the game(and world) history in the end. But sometimes i've got really upset trying to browse through my game history or trying to click ""Finish"" in time, before last week of the month ends and i'll get bankrupt. Sliders are not the best friend of accuracy and clicking each staff member to give him his vacation could be a very tiring process at times.

												Game Dev Tycoon was fun... for the first hour or two. It then gets very repetitive. The only real mechanic is combining the right parameters when launching your game, whereas they could have made it a much deeper game by adding more mechanics (other than marketing, which feels gimmicky).Still worth a play... but not if you're looking for more than ten hours of gameplay.

												I struggled a lot with whether or not to recommend this game.  It is nothing that it doesn't claim to be, but that was exactly the problem for me.  Ultimately, I settled on ""no"" simply because there is absolutely no replay value, and the gameplay is a mindless grind-fest.Your decisions have minimal impact on the course you take through the game (short of making totally stupid decisions that bankrupt your company -- if you have half a brain, that won't ever happen).  The gameplay an hour or two into the game is exactly the same as it is in the first ten minutes.  None of the content you unlock as you progress was enough to hold my interest; they're more or less just reskins of existing content.  The endgame mechanics are nearly identical to the early game mechanics, just with more staff, more fans, and more revenue.If you like that kind of repetitive zen-ish gameplay then this game might be for you, but even at $10 I don't feel like this game is worth it.  I played it one time for a few hours, and there's nothing whatsoever that makes me want to play it again.  There are far better tycoon/simulation games more deserving of your time.			"

												This game is incredibly relaxed and casual. Though that is in no way a bad thing. As a person that loves to play a lot of really engaging RPGS I find it nice to relax with Game Dev Tycoon. It has the right mix of challenge and ease. The game itself is easy to learn. Though there are a lot of challenges such as how to spend your money, what combinations of genre and game style go well together and on which platform. You also need to know when to advance your technology and when to hold off. The game has good longevity but the mid workshop really extends the life of the game. Overall if you want a really casual but challenging experience I recommend this game. This game has a very specific target audience in the management style of game and it really hits it.			"

												Honestly i dont really enjoy the games where its limited to movement and creation but, I was completely wrong about this game. It's jsut a game where your likes knowlegde and hopefully creative mind comes into play + sponsers, charities and the occasinal fan-made game. Theres so many ways to play this with unqiue engines, genres and so much more i can be here for a while but ill keep it breif, this game offers more than i anticipated, sure the 35 years until retirement is silly even thou i have not met it yet but surely there'll be an option to continue or already is. I would highly reccomend getting this game			"

												So I set out my ambitious gamemaking career from my mom's garage. After making a bunch of more-or-less failed text adventures and 2D shooters with an 3-5 average score, I was about to fail miserably with my bank account hitting red after every pitiful attempt. But I wouldn't give up. I pushed all my energy and creativity into making just one more title in hopes that it would save me from bankrupcy.And I did it. I was completely out of money and would probably have to move out of the garage and into the streets, but the game was finished. Upon release I noticed, however, that in all my creative flush and flow, I had forgot to name the game.Nevertheless, Game #9 was an instant blockbuster! Reviews followed, praising the game (despite it's name) and calling it a masterpiece. Sales skyrocketed. With my newly accumulated capital of over 3 million, I decided to get a real office. Then I was prompted to hire new staff, so I started looking for a coding specialist to get some load off my shoulders.The first name to pop up was Ashley Williams. Apparently one of my favourite characters from the Mass Effect universe had had a change of career and I would surely welcome her military expertise into my team. So that was a no-brainer, didn't even look at the others. I made another game with a publisher and with some ~7 million I thought I'd hire a few more people. I then got an achievement for hiring someone famous because I hired some dude. I still have no idea who that was supposed to be.10/10 survival simulator9/10 some dude is more famous than A.Williams10/10 recommended10/10 ""It's better than the name"" "

												I have now put quite a bit of time into this game. I can honestly say I love it. It keeps you thinking and reworking how things are done.Pros: HUGE mod support. The mods make the the replayablility of this game great. The core game itself is great and you need to keep playing to get all the hints possible. Even after that you still have to tweak each game you make. Looking at market trends and money in the bank. Managing staff and marketing. It has it all. Whenever I want a solid Tycoon game I look to Game Dev Tycoon.Cons: At times it seems impossible to make anything but Action games. the sliders seem to not matter as much and you just set them to max on one or two and minimum on the other. Really can't say much else bad about the game.Overall I would give it an 8/10. Great to play for hours. Well worth the money.			"

												Game Dev Tycoon is simple.That is its biggest strength and its greatest weakness. The scope of the game is very limited, there's no competition, there's no production, there's no new platforms past year 35 and there's little room for specialization. You are a game development studio, starting alone as a guy in a garage, and progressing into an office with employees, an R&D department and a hardware lab.Starting with the gripes, Game Dev Tycoon is too opaque for my liking. My new fantasy RPG got 4s and 5s in the ratings, why? The game offers little other than advice on time management, even though most of the time the reason for a game's failure lies with the stats of your staff or an outdated engine, rather than with poor time management.Also on the note of opaqueness, staff stats are the subject of little explanation. Who should I train? Which stats do I need for each area of game development? Are my staff good or bad? What does the Speed stat do? There's a lot which could be explained by either a simple tutorial or some in-game hints. The specialization training options eventually become available and give some idea of what each area of development needs, but too late to train for them.I can't seem to work out how to get enough research points, which are used to train staff and to get more technologies to put in engines. I'm loathed to put this down as a game flaw because it could just be my lack of understanding the simulation, but it feels like some way to turn $ into RP before the R&D lab becomes available would be appreciated, even if it's just telling a staff member to 'Read Books' or something.Game development is a simple, sharp and intuitive process. There are three stages, each of which has three sliders which determine how you divide your time. Depending on the genre and topic you've chosen, you decide which priorities will make a good game of that genre. Get it right and you'll (usually) get decent reviews. Get it wrong and you'll get a flop.There are random events which are mostly predictable. One of these is a sabotage event, which seems pointless in a game that doesn't simulate your competitors. I do like the media interviews, although there could be more types. Right now, there are two types of interview: one asking your expectations for the game (essentially asking you to predict the score), and one asking which (of two) area you focused the most on in development, which offers you an opportunity to learn if you got it wrong.If you get to year 35, you're granted a final score to compare with friends, or to try to beat next time. This is a nice touch which adds a milestone to mark the end of the simulation. You can continue past here, but there will be no more platform releases or events, so it's basically pointless. I would like to see GHG add more content to the late game. They've already speculated on the next generation of consoles so it wouldn't hurt to do a few more generations, technologies etc.The game doesn't do a lot, but the things which it does, it does very well.

Overall vote: 6.5""Game Dev Tycoon"" is a simulator that knows how to be appreciated, although it lacks, in some parts, of quality and depth. You will impersonate the classic ""nerd"" of the early era of videogames, busy developing his first games in his garage (where you can see a ""DeLorean"" under a tarp). With the early successes, we are destined to grow up until we will be a world-renowned software house, with various employees and millions of fans.GAMEPLAY: 7 Quite simple and immediate; A lot of topics, researches and platforms; Some parts aren't so well developed, such as the management of your company (you can hire only six  employees, very few to develop AAA games IMHO); There are no competitors; The evaluation of the games is not exactly brilliantGRAPHIC: 5 Pleasant cartoony graphic; Little animations; Minimal and undeveloped game design;MUSIC, SOUNDS, EFFECTS: 6 Basic and monotonous soundtrack; Common sound effects;LONGEVITY: 6.5 It has a quite good replayability, depending on whether you want to pursue a career as developers of action games (console or PC), or GDR, or casual, etc. etc. It takes time to discover every possibile combo between Topics, Audience, Platforms, etc. "

												It's a really fun and simple game that does what a Tycoon game should do good.The graphics are simple, but pleasing to the eye, the mechanics are really easy to learn, but take a while to master, and it provides a lot of ways to rise your company to the top, wether be it releasing a good piece of entertainment rarely and just scrape by, or overflow the market with your endless shooter sequels. Finaly, the fact that it also provides a great Steam Workshop support is an icing on the cake.It might be a bit short, but it's an entertaining, relaxing game that's worth to spend your money on.

												This game is incredibly relaxed and casual. Though that is in no way a bad thing. As a person that loves to play a lot of really engaging RPGS I find it nice to relax with Game Dev Tycoon. It has the right mix of challenge and ease. The game itself is easy to learn. Though there are a lot of challenges such as how to spend your money, what combinations of genre and game style go well together and on which platform. You also need to know when to advance your technology and when to hold off. The game has good longevity but the mid workshop really extends the life of the game. Overall if you want a really casual but challenging experience I recommend this game. This game has a very specific target audience in the management style of game and it really hits it.			"

It's jsut a game where your likes knowlegde and hopefully creative mind comes into play + sponsers, charities and the occasinal fan-made game. Theres so many ways to play this with unqiue engines, genres and so much more i can be here for a while but ill keep it breif, this game offers more than i anticipated, sure the 35 years until retirement is silly even thou i have not met it yet but surely there'll be an option to continue or already is.

												This is a game where you manage you own game development company. This is a game which we don't see that often and the previous ones not being that good. This game is a breath of fresh air as this game does it right providing a realistic simulation of being a the owner of a game development company. This is accomplished by fighting legal incidents, attending to fans and managing projects. Even though this game does a lot of things right it also does quite a few things wrong aswell like not enough research and topics and some sort of online mode is missing here. These aside the game provides hours of time sunk into this game and is worth its price tag. Highly recommended unless you have a game like mad games tycoon. I rate this game a 7/10.			"

I was up till 3.30 am this morning playing it, that's how addictive it is.Played a full 30-year (I believe it is) game and enjoyed it immensely.Just a few additional comments that stop me giving it 100%:- No difficulty levels- Advertising/promotion options are limited (these are much better in Game Dev Story)- Impossible to research all knowledge/do all training in the game period (many would see this as a good thing though but I do feel this aspect of the game takes a little too much time)- You need all your research points for researching new genres and developing new engines, so little is left over for training your staff- It's generally not worth investing in other platforms apart from the PC (due to very similar market share) until you unlock multi-platform tech- It's not clear from the game or the in-game hints which game dev aspects require design or tech skills - this would make a big difference!Overall, though, a super experience and for the price an absolute steal!

												The focus of the game may sound crazy - running a game development company, but this is one highly addictive game.  So many factors involved that can make your new game turn out to be a dud despite how many features and money you spend in development.  Getting the right combination and seeing your game make millions is very satisfying. If you like games like Civilization or SimCity, you will love the depth of decision making in this game. Highly recommend picking up this game, especially at the current price.			"

												Fun and captivating gameplay. It's good to just sit back and think about what makes a good game. Some of it is luck, but a lot of it is just having a system and paying attention. It's rewarding to hit on a successful title, and demeaning after spending hundreds of thousands on a game that gets poor ratings and sets you back. But only encourages you to do better next time. The interface is simple and easy to understand. I wish it let you change your game name if you forgot to, before it gets released. But alas, it's only a minor hit to your score if you don't change it. Nice too that system requirements are light so it will run on a potato.			"

												Game Dev Tycoon is simple.That is its biggest strength and its greatest weakness. The scope of the game is very limited, there's no competition, there's no production, there's no new platforms past year 35 and there's little room for specialization. You are a game development studio, starting alone as a guy in a garage, and progressing into an office with employees, an R&D department and a hardware lab.Starting with the gripes, Game Dev Tycoon is too opaque for my liking. My new fantasy RPG got 4s and 5s in the ratings, why? The game offers little other than advice on time management, even though most of the time the reason for a game's failure lies with the stats of your staff or an outdated engine, rather than with poor time management.Also on the note of opaqueness, staff stats are the subject of little explanation. Who should I train? Which stats do I need for each area of game development? Are my staff good or bad? What does the Speed stat do? There's a lot which could be explained by either a simple tutorial or some in-game hints. The specialization training options eventually become available and give some idea of what each area of development needs, but too late to train for them.I can't seem to work out how to get enough research points, which are used to train staff and to get more technologies to put in engines. I'm loathed to put this down as a game flaw because it could just be my lack of understanding the simulation, but it feels like some way to turn $ into RP before the R&D lab becomes available would be appreciated, even if it's just telling a staff member to 'Read Books' or something.Game development is a simple, sharp and intuitive process. There are three stages, each of which has three sliders which determine how you divide your time. Depending on the genre and topic you've chosen, you decide which priorities will make a good game of that genre. Get it right and you'll (usually) get decent reviews. Get it wrong and you'll get a flop.There are random events which are mostly predictable. One of these is a sabotage event, which seems pointless in a game that doesn't simulate your competitors. I do like the media interviews, although there could be more types. Right now, there are two types of interview: one asking your expectations for the game (essentially asking you to predict the score), and one asking which (of two) area you focused the most on in development, which offers you an opportunity to learn if you got it wrong.If you get to year 35, you're granted a final score to compare with friends, or to try to beat next time. This is a nice touch which adds a milestone to mark the end of the simulation. You can continue past here, but there will be no more platform releases or events, so it's basically pointless. I would like to see GHG add more content to the late game. They've already speculated on the next generation of consoles so it wouldn't hurt to do a few more generations, technologies etc.The game doesn't do a lot, but the things which it does, it does very well.

												Look above or below, anyone could tell you ""You start as a guy who makes games out of his garage and make his way up to a decent sized office building"" but I'm here to tell you, that is true, but what is so fun about this game, is the fact that you could make whatever game you want, but what makes it better is, if you wanted to, make the Half-Life series, and then see how the critics respond to it. (If you look in my screenshots, you can see that the critics don't respond like they would in real life, ""Dialogues not important in Half-Life 2?"" XD) Sure, that game is a little hard to stay out of debt... but that is probably how some companies started, with a bit of money realizing it's gone by next week. Wait, no, that's not a real life company, that's just what happened to me when I tried to make zombie games.Anyway... When you first start the game, you get this cute message from Greenheart Games that thanks you for purchasing their game, when you finish the game for the first time, you get another nice message from Greenheart Games that says that they hope that you liked their game, and that if you like it, share it with your friends. I find this a neat touch that says ""Yes, I care about our consumers, and hope they like our first game that we put a lot of work in to."" Honestly, this is a good thing.So, I have got this far and haven't even typed about how to play. Meh, why tell you when you can find out yourself! The game is $10, and if you can get it on sale, great! This game is well worth $10, and I think that if you are thinking about getting this game, GO FOR IT!By the way... Mods make this game too easy. Like the valve mod, I sold Left4Dead, Almost got a perfect 10 and sold nearly 1 billion in the first week. Play the game legit, then try mods, that's what I reccomend.Why are you still reading this?

												The best Tycoon game I've ever playedI haven't played a lot of Tycoon games before, but this one takes the lead by miles. Choices matter heavily in this game, with consequences that could that could possibly make you bankrupt. Not only does the game put you in the position of how it is like to be a game maker, but also shows the timeline of gaming with little name differences for the consoles/computers. Starting from the Govodore 64 (G64) and ending with the Playsystem 5. The mods for this game make the experience even more fun and interesting. I personally recommend the cheat mod :P So, do I recommend the game? Heck yeah!			"

												This game is incredibly relaxed and casual. Though that is in no way a bad thing. As a person that loves to play a lot of really engaging RPGS I find it nice to relax with Game Dev Tycoon. It has the right mix of challenge and ease. The game itself is easy to learn. Though there are a lot of challenges such as how to spend your money, what combinations of genre and game style go well together and on which platform. You also need to know when to advance your technology and when to hold off. The game has good longevity but the mid workshop really extends the life of the game. Overall if you want a really casual but challenging experience I recommend this game. This game has a very specific target audience in the management style of game and it really hits it.			"

												So I set out my ambitious gamemaking career from my mom's garage. After making a bunch of more-or-less failed text adventures and 2D shooters with an 3-5 average score, I was about to fail miserably with my bank account hitting red after every pitiful attempt. But I wouldn't give up. I pushed all my energy and creativity into making just one more title in hopes that it would save me from bankrupcy.And I did it. I was completely out of money and would probably have to move out of the garage and into the streets, but the game was finished. Upon release I noticed, however, that in all my creative flush and flow, I had forgot to name the game.Nevertheless, Game #9 was an instant blockbuster! Reviews followed, praising the game (despite it's name) and calling it a masterpiece. Sales skyrocketed. With my newly accumulated capital of over 3 million, I decided to get a real office. Then I was prompted to hire new staff, so I started looking for a coding specialist to get some load off my shoulders.The first name to pop up was Ashley Williams. Apparently one of my favourite characters from the Mass Effect universe had had a change of career and I would surely welcome her military expertise into my team. So that was a no-brainer, didn't even look at the others. I made another game with a publisher and with some ~7 million I thought I'd hire a few more people. I then got an achievement for hiring someone famous because I hired some dude. I still have no idea who that was supposed to be.10/10 survival simulator9/10 some dude is more famous than A.Williams10/10 recommended10/10 ""It's better than the name"" "

												With a vivid imagination the player can have a lot of fun in this game. For example I named a game Starshit Poopers and whilst it was developing I created the game in my head.This game is also much more challenging than I first anticipated which, for me, makes it much more entertaining.

You control what kind of game you make and how you make it through the allocation of your resources in the form of your hired workers (later in the game). Later on, you can also create your own console. But I've never touched it. We all know that PC is the master race. You all know it. Why else would you be here. 9/10			"

It's still as entertaining as ever, so fans of the original game that would like a more modernized and slightly more complex gameplay will be happy.However, if the original game didn't appeal to you, there's little else here that might change your mind.

												I played for a 5 hour stint after wanting this game for a while and got up to the xbox next and ps5 era (isnt that a scary thought :)) had all my employies leveled high and had the best office with many millions at my disposile and after my 5 hour play i sat back wondering how i steam rolled through it so easily. i never really made any particually bad games or desisions (apart for my sexual games made for 1st gen P.C but they still sold fairly well...) i never got into negative dollers or anything. maybe i strangly have good judgement or the more likely case is the game was just to easy. it is extremely possiable to make a 10/10 game from the get go and run through with ease. ive played games that do progress much better (game dev story, i little IOS game) that did not allow you to make a perfect game from the start. you had to build up your skills and get better equipment before you can start making games, which makes sense. it spaces the experience out and makes it a challenging experience.That being said do i recomend the game???? well if you are vigilent you will notice the thumbs up i am giving it.Yes i do recomend game dev tycoon. it is fun, and if you like the idea of making a game within a game you will enjoy game dev tycoon. however if you want a longer, engaging and frankly cheaper experience, go for game dev story.

												Every dream of owning your own game company or even just making your own games?  Or maybe youve played the game ""Game Dev Story"" by kairosoft on you android or apple device (cause this is alot like that)?   Well, if you have then this is the game for you. You start out in your garage by yourself developing low budget games by yourself, but not only that, you also can develp your own gaming engines. After you build some money and get well known you can begin to expand to bigger offices and hire more people to work for you. design the name of the game, the system it will play on, and even the genre and platform for your game. Will you make amazing 3D games? or will everything you make be completely text base? Thats your decision and yours alone.

												I know that the time counter of this says 10.2 hours as of writting this review, but I have played countless more hours. I first played this game back before it was on steam, and played it several times through without ever getting bored of it. When I got my new computer after a hard drive crash, I lost the login information for the e-mail that had been used for the purchase, so I contacted their support and that support redirected me to the distributer and helped make it relatively painless to get my steam key and game back. I am happy to say that if I could buy any other game besides this one, I wouldn't take that chance, for this game gave me several hours of entertainment, and then mods were added that made the game even more of a challenge and newer experience. I can't wait to see what else Greenheart makes in the future, and I suggest that whoever reads this review follows them in their strides to come.			"

The game is easy to understand, gives you a bit of chance and exploration by letting you select what demographic, system, topic, genre, how much time will be spent on certain items, and what will be shirked a bit. Also, the slight changes in the game are almost hilarious. If you get this game, try to spot the Half-Life reference. Hint: it is in one of the offices you get.			"

												This game is extremely similar to Kairosoft's Game Dev Story for mobile. Not sure which one came out first so I'm not implying anything just that if you enjoy Kairosoft's GDS this is an absolute grab. If you've never played GDS read on.This is a game in which you start off as a programmer in your basement trying to put out a few games for the PC. Starting off you have a very limited selection of genres you can make and platforms you can put games out on. Over time you'll be able to expand your knowledge-base of genres and be able to put out games on multiple platforms. As you progress throughout the game you will also find yourself moving out of your basement and into proper offices and bring in NPCs to help you and feel like an actual company. You can research new genres, purchase contracts with new gaming systems, perform contract work on the side and even design your own console late in the game. You can train your employees and yourself to put a little more stats in those weak areas and pump out better games. This game has a lot of possibilities and the replayability is seemingly endless with your playthrough being dependent on the sales of your games which is not the same each time through. I love the fact that the game pays homage to all of the consoles that have been on the market with such names as TES, Gameling, Playsystem, Dreamvast, Mbox, and more. This game is still fun even when you put out failures that don't sell. Highly recommended "

Over the next 35 years my company was very secretive releasing ♥♥♥♥ sucking simulators every few years the public loved the games. Over time and many years I invested millions of dollars making the perfect engine for a ♥♥♥♥ sucking simulator. Once the final year came around I released my final ♥♥♥♥ sucking simulator it generated 1 billion+ in sales and sold over 120 million units. This game is game of the year every year...Game Dev Tycoon is one of the best games I have played in years. 11/10 Cause this is an exceptional game with amazing gameplay and wonderful mechanics although the game can get dull after the first few playthroughs the steam workshop has plenty of mods to keep the game going.

The formula for how a game you create is rated becomes more and more apparent and is even written out in some steam guides.
