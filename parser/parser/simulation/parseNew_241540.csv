												I finished State of Decay, I enjoyed it, and I would recommend it--but with some hesitations. The more I played the game, the more it felt sort of rote and a little tiring. It feels like the developers built a great core gameplay loop, but didn't do much to add to that.The way the game works is thus: You have a base stocked with survivors. As time passes, the base uses up resources. So you go around a few towns and surrounding countrysides, break into houses and warehouses and the like, and steal stuff. You'll find both items that your character can use, and resources that your base can use. You carry regular items in a backpack, which has both a slot and weight limit after which you get encumbered and tired more easily. Base resources are loaded into a large rucksack, which further encumbers you. If you can't carry everything at an area, you can send for someone from your base to run to where you are, pick up the remainder, and bring it back to the base. NPCs can get caught by zombies while they're making their way out to the looting point or while they're making their way back. You can designate certain buildings to be ""outputs"". The game doesn't explain at all why you would do this, but the internet explains: the most important reason to do it is that an area designated a outpost spawns no zombies and is booby-trapped so that if external zombies move through, they get killed. You'll want to put at least a few outposts near your base to sort of create a zombie-free buffer. The second reason, which is not made clear in the game at all, is that if you leave base resources in an outpost, you will have a permanent daily allowance of that resource, which lowers your need for scavenging. By the end of the game I had a daily surplus of food and medication and broke even on fuel, so I only needed ammo and construction materials.After a while your character will get tired. Fatigue lowers your maximum stamina. You can keep playing, but it'll keep getting worse. So you're advised to go back to home base and switch to another character. Likewise, serious injury lowers your maximum health. This is the game's way of forcing you to use multiple characters. This can be frustrating if you only have a few with good skills. Skills include cardio, wits (ability to search through things quietly), melee combat, shooting, and reflexes (appears to relate to combat) and they are leveled up by using them; someone who shoots all the time will quickly get a high level of shooting skill. At a certain point, once you've leveled skills, you can also select ""specializations"" for your characters. The game does not explain this, so it was about 2/3rds of the way through the game before I discovered this was a thing.While you're out and about, you'll be asked to do missions. Missions could involve helping out neighboring groups of survivors, going to save one of your runners who has been caught in a zombie-infested area, helping to board up a building, climbing tall buildings to locate new sources of resources. You can also find new areas to move to, as each base has different built-in facilities and different numbers of expansion slots. I only moved my base once, from the default church into a spacious and facility-rich warehouse. You can use materials to build different areas in your base; a guard tower, a garden, a medical tent, a research library, a cooking area, a gym/training area, etc. Some require particular survivors with particular skills to staff them, but most just give you a sort of passive boost. You can upgrade most building facilities. Ultimately other than areas that help survivors recover from fatigue or injury, I didn't really notice much of an impact from base facilities at all. It felt like another mechanic that was sort of neat but ultimately hollow.There is a plot, but not much of one. At random, you'll get radio missions to go deal with various groups of people. There are military personnel who are here for an unknown reason, local small criminals and drug/weapons dealers, a group of friendly survivors, a courthouse serving as some kind of post-collapse civilian government, and a few one-offs. The actual plot missions themselves differ very little from the random missions you get. For example, taking the sheriff on a ride-along to clear out zombie infestations and save a trapped civilian is exactly like clearing out zombie infestations and saving trapped civilians.Your player characters are basically randoms. You start as a camping dude named Marcus who has great default skillset. He's accompanied by a perpetual whiner who is useless named Ed. You meet up with an ex-military woman named Maya. Pretty much everyone else after these three are total blind randoms. There are five or six NPC voices that voice everyone; there's a wide wide wide variety of dialogue but little in the way of characterization. They do this because anyone can permanently die. During my first run-through, I lost both Marcus and Maya due to bad planning about 10 minutes apart 4 hours in. I was so gutted that I restarted the game. In my second and final playthrough, I was about 7 hours in when I lost Marcus on a routine errand. I considered restarting again. So they've done a good job of making the loss of a high level character pretty tragic. Marcus was my only loss that wasn't ordained by plot reasons on my second playthrough.I guess I would describe my experience as sort of hollow. I loved the melee combat, which is quite complex and very tense (although poorly explained). I loved driving around in my car and opening my door to whack a passing zombie, or doing a donut and whipping a zombie hanging off the back into a telephone pole. But... I guess I never really felt like anything matters. I'd just wander around and scavenge (unnecessarily, my resources were never low) until I'd get a mission, missions were basically no different than wandering around in general, I'd play side missions until I got a plot mission, which were no different really. Occasionally I'd have to go back to my base to check on construction or switch characters. I was never scarce on weapons or ammo or meds at my base. I always had more than enough influence, the game's currency.So in conclusion, I'd say that this is definitely a game that's worth trying, but that if you're like me, you might get tired of part-way through because there's not a lot of variation and much of the game seems a little like busy-work.

												Seeing i poured more hours into this game than the average review-writing player, i figured i should write my own review as well. There might be spoilers.So here goes:I'm not a fan of most zombie games, which seem to revolve around ""shoot millions of zombies to win"". There is no ""winning"" State of decay. The zombies are everywhere and the horde is endless. The base game ends when your survivors manage to leave Trumbull Valley and you are left wondering ""How long will they last without my help?""And this is exactly what i love about State of Decay.The game & DLC's in a nutshell:State of Decay:You and your buddy went on your annual fishing trip, while you were gone large swaths of the US have been overrun by zombies. You get attacked as soon as you tie off your boat. Fighting them off is easy enough but now need to figure out what happened and where you can find a safe place to stay. Jump in the nearest car and meet up with fellow survivors holed up at a church. Then the game begins for real and answers are gradually given.Breakdown:Same map, alternate storyline. Several weeks after the outbreak, you and Lily are the last 2 survivors of an enclave and you know you wont last much longer on your own. While you look for another enclave to join, Lily packs up and will meet you there with whatever supplies are left. Once settled it's back to basics: survive for as long as you can. You quickly realize resources are dwindling while zombie numbers increase. Eventually it's time to move on: you pack all equipment in the RV, load up your most important survivors and look for a new home. Your new home is on the exact same map, but with fresh resources and.. more zombies.Lifeline:New map. You are in command of the last military outpost in the overrun city of Danforth. You must secure your base, shore up your defenses and start the search for various survivors. The brass will direct you to high-value assets: scientists, doctors and their families whose expertise might be crucial to find an eventual cure. Along the way stranded survivors cry out for help and you're the only one with the means to respond. Your actions will decide the fate of not only Danforth, but possibly the whole world.I'll do a short pros and cons but there are a few things i should really point out first. State of Decay is not about killing lots of zombies. It is about people trying to survive the zombie apocalypse. There are endless zombies but finite resources. Sure, it is great fun to smash your truck into a few zombie hordes or grab a machine gun and go on a killing spree, but that's not the intention of the game. When you're done a good truck will be broken, perhaps beyond repair. Or a lot of bullets will have been wasted on ever respawning zombies. So when you clear an area of zombies, you damn better scavenge as much as you can.When you scavenge you may find resources you can use to improve your base or tools for zombie killing. Food and various painkillers/stimulants are also often found. There are a few possible home sites (bases) in the game for you to eventually choose from. Each of them has certain requisites and advantages/disadvantages, but larger is better :). Always you have to make tough choices: will i go for a workshop to repair weapons & cars, or rather a field hospital to aid the people who will inevitably fall sick? No one wants to go down with Black Fever.. trust me. Maybe i can have both IF i sacrifice room for the workout area, but then all survivors will have less stamina and fighting skills.. Choices.Over the course of the game missions will pop up: help scavenging, clear out an infestation, save a survivor, trade resources with your neighbours, kill a freak zombie.Unfortunately most of these missions can be boiled down to a simple fact: your fellow survivors have the mental capacity and survival skill of a baked potato. You are the only one who's good at it, and it's up to you to do ALL the work. I found this annoying when i first played the game and put it aside for a few weeks for that reason only. However, if you accept that's just how it is, embrace it, and you'll still have a most enjoyable game.A few other points of light irritation:- Graphics: good enough for a game of this price, but definately not top notch.- Controls: especially car controls feel sluggish.- Clipping: zombies occasionally clip trough solid objects. Not a problem if it's just a regular zombie, a bit more annoying when it's a Big Un or Feral in an enclosed space.- Useless survivors: Plenty of them and no ""clean"" way to get rid of them.The pros:Open world game: You go where you want, when you want.Permadeath: Your survivor got ambushed and killed? He's dead, no reloading an earlier save.Stamina & carry capacity: The game's way of saying you're just an average Joe, not Rambo.Traits and Skills: The game's way of taking the ""average"" out of ""average Joe""Soundtrack: Composed by Jesper Kyd. 'Nuff said.Mods: Don't like this or that? Maybe want to see more of that other stuff? Check out the modding community, or find out how to do it yourself. Besides tweaking Breakdown to make it more enjoyable, i also added myself as a playable character. Much fun was had.All in all i found this a very enjoyable game and the DLC's are definately worth it. Has been on sale several times @ -66% orso. Even grabbed back to it a few months after i finished it.			"

												""There are a lot of zombie games, but this one looks old, but feels fresh"" Game overall is very good and deep, and has nicely executed gameplay mechanics that make you occupied for long time, just because you come back to it for more. You need to gather supplies in order to survive, but also you need to keep people in top shape by wiping out infestations, killing hordes, gathering supplies and eventually take them outside of base and kill some zombies together with them to make them feel more clever. Base too small? Find another one, and order everybody to move to it. You've been long time outside of base exploring the area? Your character will get tired and eventually run out of stamina (or the stamina bar will be impossible to fill fully). When you'll get hurt too many times, your health lowers and you need to switch to other characters. Lost your character? It's gone. You cannot have it back. This is the main thing I love in this game. When you loose one of characters, it hurts, this character is gone. This is when I realised that dialogs and overall - story - of characters is very good and nicely written. At some point I felt so emotionally connected with Markus (main character you start as first time) that when I died while playing as him, I've started game again from the beggining, because I didn't want to loose him. Did I mention that game is open world? Yes it is, you can do whatever you want untill whole map will eventually run out of resources. That is another unique thing about this game. Nothing respawns. Crashed your car and it exploded? You loose it. Gathered supplies from nearby house? They're gone. They never respawn. This adds so much realism to the game, and fear that you need to take risks in order to survive. You can also get some new freeloaders to your base. Of course it will be possible to switch to them, after you fullfill tasks they give you (going to their base and dropping supplies), or just after bringing them to your base. Generally speaking, there is a lot to do, and this review will not cover all of this stuff, you just need to find out more by yourself.Technically speaking, this game is pretty outdated. Graphics are somewhat old looking, but they're not ugly. Just textures could use better resolution, and animations could use some more fixing. Well, we cannot expect much as Undead Labs ported this game from Xbox 360, where it was successfull as it is now on PC. It runs on CryEngine 3. First I thought it was Unity 3D, but after some readings I've discovered it uses Crytek's engine. I thought that it pretty much wasted it's potential. As mentioned above animations are sometimes jerky, and doesn't fit the situation. Some textures are ugly, low res, but overall, it's not ugly to the point to make you puke. Performance is pretty poor on Ultra Spec. It does run noticably better at High Spec (Graphic options are named like this) with 60FPS, but does have some drops to 40 in towns. My PC is not top notch, I have i3-3.2 GHz, 4GB RAM, Radeon HD7850 2GB, but still it could use some more 'love' to make it run smoothly. Game has very limited graphic options (one slider) but it does job well improving the performance.Controls. Game lacks some stuff that could come in handy for some group of players. I dislike forced Mouse Acceleration. Thank god Undead Labs added rebindable keyboard bindings, so it's easier to configure and play. Game does not have multiplayer and will never have. Developers stated a lot of times that this game won't have any possible coop or multiplayer. It's all reserved for upcoming Class4 (this game is Class3) and honestly? In single player it plays so well that I didn't even noticed lack of multiplayer. Overall, game is worth the money, so is upcoming 'Breakdown' DLC which will only add some more of gameplay. Game has enough content to make you occupied for looooong time. It's best zombie game to date, it looks old, but feels fresh despite it's obvious flaws. Undead Labs - Congratulations.8.5/10			"

												Definitely a decent game, it can be a little repetitive but it does offer some good fun. It really reminded me at times of playing a GTA game with zombies in it.Know this before buying!!!The worst part about this game hands down is the fact the game plays on its own when you are not there....What? Things progress/change when you are not playing! This should have been a Hardcore feature or something similar, seems like the devs were taking the ""simulation"" aspect a little too far. If you only have time to play an hour here and there, you might not want to play this.The other annoying part about this game, which I think ties back into the simulation aspect, is the save system. While some may like the system implemented for this game, I find it unbelievably stupid. It's basically only checkpoints, no save points you can create, ever. My ideal save system would be like Fallout 3's, essentially any time and anywhere. These issues might not bother you or might make you want to play the game more, but for me, these issues make playing the game less enjoyable. I still recommend it as there is some good fun, but just be warned about those features. I would have surely waited for a cheaper sale had I known about those features first.			"

												Game is a real shocker. Open world zombie game done pretty good! Combat for me, is fluid and very fun. You can easily trample 5-10 zombies with this system and never get angry at someone doing what they're not supposed to be doing it. The NPCS during combat are amazing, they do so much damage a full crew of 4 could likely take out 200 zombies. A smart move here, is that in this game killing zombies is mostly useless! They did not add any sort of item cultivation or gold drops from zombies which is great.The environments are pretty good as well. You always feeling like youre in a random farm or in a little suburb, largely because the zombie variety is so good as well!The ability to macro manage your ""crews' resources and deal with shortages and other random misfortunes is a great add.

												What a great game. Truly the best zombie game out there. It has all the stuff I always wanted to see in a Zombie Survival game.Yet I give it a thumb down, simply because:40 Hours into the game and I lost my savegame. Not a single survivor was lost, I was near the end. Unlocked most of the characters in Breakdown and suddenly it's gone.Apparently that's something that just happens. This is known among the users for quite awhile and yet it was never patched. PC Port of this game is a freaking joke. Instead of fixing this broken piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ they decided to spit on the paying customers and re-release it as some kind of GOTY edition, with better visuals and actual bugfixes. Of course the guys who bought the game with all the DLC would've to rebuy it again. Makes so much sense, right?""Thanks for your support, here, buy the game again, but this time with some fixes.""So in conclusion if you supported these greedy and lazy SOBs during their early access period, you're punished for it.Not buying from those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s again.Thanks for nothing, you disloyal, greedy, lazy♥♥♥♥♥developers.

												State of Decay is a game that fills a niche that many games tried to fill but none did yet. But it does it in its own unique way, and it does it very well.You are managing a group of survivors in a zombie-apocalypse. Its something you need to get used to, there are alot of random characters and some plot centric ones that you can get attached to, and mourn for when you loose them to the zeds. There is permadeath, and its cruel. The game can bring out emotions in alot of ways, which is a strong point for it.There is also base-building in the game on several predetermined locations. The game is a Sandbox, things happen if you are playing or not. As long as you keep morale high and your base secure, you shouldnt have too many suprises whenever you get back to it after you took a break. The story is told over different mission arcs that you have to follow, to eventually get out of the valley the game takes part in. Overall the story is well presented but it could have been longer and the end is unsatisfying in my opinion. The non-story missions are quite repetitive and can get to be a bit of a chore over time.Generaly the game felt too easy once you know how to deal with the zeds and have your survivors trained. Yes, you can level your survivors skills and there is nice progression in the skill system. And even tough you might feel like a zombie-slaying superhero at times, as soon as you pay not attention for a moment you can be in dire troubles. If you get reckless you will loose characters to hordes, and to special infected (which are very similar to those in Left4Dead). The graphics are pretty dissapointing resolutionwise, and the user interface is clumsy and ugly at best. That is because the game was ported from consoles for PC, but generally ist not a bad port. The Devs really tried their best to make the game work for PC. The controls with Keyboard & Mouse where fine (Controllers work too of course). The graphical variety still can overcome the bad texures, so that those only stay a minor annoyance.I didnt run into any plot-stopping bugs or crashes (seems those where fixed), the game gets still patched from the devs and there will be a second DLC coming out at one point. The first DLC adds an endless mode to the game which is a nice addition.Its a bit weird to sum up this game with its many small flaws and at the end still say its a great game, but it really is, even tough it could surely have been better in many aspects. Its the whole experience and atmosphere that makes it worth playing. Its a unique game in many ways, and a very welcome and creative suprise in the many zombie/survival games that all feel pretty similar overall.Everyone should play this, wholly reccommended.And dont lose Maya, like i did.

												I recently bought State of Decay from Steam’s summer sale for around 4€ and I don’t think I’ve ever been happier with a game purchase. I’ve heard/read people saying it’s a good game but didn’t realise it was SO addicting too.Let’s start by explaining what the whole game is about, without spoilers of course. It’s zombie apocalypse time and you are one of the survivors. You aid other survivors, build a community, search for supplies like food, gas, ammunition and weapons to survive.You have the freedom to move around the open world how you like, set up a base (home) in various locations, choose what kind of services your base has (medical room, library to study, mechanics to fix cars & gear etc.)You can build watch tower in your base, order men to practice shooting, extend the safe zone around your map by sniping everyone around your base, train other neighbouring survivors in your camp in exchange of goods.You can take over empty buildings like gas stations, cafeterias etc. and build outposts there. Outpost have a ‘safe zone’ around them, where zombies will not spawn so it’s a good place to have a breather. Outpost also grant you access to your base supplies, so you can quickly switch weapons and other gear there.Your base has a radio that helps you keeping in contact with other survivors and NPCs in the world. This is also how you will get most of your quests, distress calls etc. You can contact your base via radio and ask them to track specific supplies for you - or you can just scavenge around and search houses and buildings for everything usefull.You can load stuff you find in your backbag and in trunk of a car. When you can’t carry more, you can ask base to send runners who will make their way to your location and loot the place. You can wait for the runner and aid him in returning the goods back home, or go your merry way and let them do it without you. They are usually quite handy with their weapons, though it all depends on what gear you are giving to your community.Sometimes they chew more than they can handle and might end up surrounded by zombies, trapped in house etc. If you like your buddies, you go and help ‘em - or let them struggle alone. If you don’t offer any help, that has an impact in your own reputation within the group. So basically, don’t ♥♥♥♥ around and help your own men. Also helping neighbours and other communities has it’s benefits.The more people you have living in your base, the more rations they take up per day. The more people you have, the more security you have. The more people you have, the more inner problems you have. People will occasionally get mad at each other, have sleeping problems, fear the outside world. Quite often you can solve these issues - but there’s bound to happen something nasty eventually.You start the game by controlling one person. After a while you gain more friends and allies and you can then control them too. Once a person is too badly wounded or too tired, you can then switch to another person and keep doing the tasks required to survive, while others rest and keep up the base. (Guard the perimeter, cook food, hunt for supplies, fix broken equipment, manufacture traps, silencers, bullets etc.)The world inside State of Decay goes on, even when you are offline. The event gradually slow down, the more time you are away from game and in three (3) days the time will be almost at stand still. So, if you have a real life too and log in the game next day, be prepared. Something might have happened to your community while you were away.If you are into zombie/post apocalyptic game this game is a must buy. I highly recommend it. Oh and remember, if you ♥♥♥♥ up and someone dies, he/she is dead for good. I was saddened to see my favorite guy die just because I was too cheap with healing kits.			"

												Zombie survival at its finest. Great game play, awesome open world experience with zombies. The zombies are a threat in large number but easy to deal with in small numbers. Looting is enjoyable and rewarding at times other frustrating when zombies keep coming from the noise your making. Level up characters can make you think about who you take out on supply runs and how careful you plot your moves when dealing with large groups of zombies or special zombies. Shooting is good but you have to keep in mind that the zombies will start coming to you the longer you stay in one place shooting rounds off. Interactions with other characters is there but with other survior groups things can be improved upon trading mainly. over all I still stick by my first line and I do suggest this game to someone look for a good zombie survival game with a open world. And there is upcoming DLC for a endless how long can you survive that scales the zombies up the longer you live.			"

			Views: 365		



I enjoyed this game greatly and was looking forward to more of the bugs to be worked out. But it seems they have rereleased this game to us instead of patching or fixing it with the claim that they are using the new DX11 to justify it. So if they fixed it for their ""new release"" I would assume they have no intention on fixing it for the original game and dlc's. This was one of those companies that was heading in the right direction but have lost track of the value of a majority fanbase.			"

												I absolutely do not recommend anybody purchase this game.

												Found the game very enjoyable but became burnt out on it very quickly, its incredibly repetetive with a very short storyline surrounded by filler side missions (mostly involving useless AI's that cant do♥♥♥♥♥♥for themselves). Combat is fun, the feeling of survival is VERY strong and immersive and the range of weapons (both ranged and melee) are pretty darn impressive. Not to mention for all those people who love their eye candy.. fairly good graphicsThe main thing that gets me with this game however is that the survivors you work with overall are just... useless. Your base's radio operator is constantly spamming you with messages about how ""so and so has wandered into a horde of zombies like a dumbass and you need to save them!"", you go and save his/her♥♥♥♥♥and then another message comes in about another idiot who's achieved the same thing (sometimes even the same guy! xD) Ultimately you dont really connect with any of the characters in that most of the lines and voices (there is very little variety in this regard) are just copy and pastes from one person to another, all in all i would estimate about 5 voices for each gender. One thing i always like in my games especially open-world ones are the mods! there are quite a lot of different mods for this game involving things like little tweaks to zombies, combat, vehicles ect and big stuff like base overhauls and porting weapons and vehicles from the DLC into the main game. Probably put an extra 20 hours into the game thanks to this.The game is certainly worth buying for a zombie fan if you've got cash to spare or it's on sale but dont expect to be playing it for months to come, its a very short but sweet playthrough for most people i have spoken to despite the flawsI would rate this game a 7/10 and i hope that people find this review i made useful			"

												After about 17 hours I finished the campaign, and I enjoyed this game very much!Let me give you all some pros and cons from my perspective:Your mission is to survive and make your stand with others like you, gather supplies and look for shelter is the first thing that comes to mind, and also try to kill everything in a specific area to try and create a ""safe zone"", which is actually impossible since the zombies will eventually spawn there again. I saw a horde spawn right next to me right after I got out of the car once, I disliked this aspect of the game to say the truth, it killed the ""sneaking"" feeling of hunting down and intercepting enemies before they reach the area you just cleared.A car is your best friend in this game, they are just ridiculously over powered. Once you unlock the vehicle delivery radio assistance you are pretty much invincible, that makes the game really fun because you can go out playing bowling simulator with zombies in the streets... But it's a huge con in my opinion, the game gets too easy. A fuel system would be a good idea to implement, and also a specialization system to turn the cars on, it feels really weird that every car in the city is open, with infinite gas and the keys just sitting there in the ignition...When you die you die for real, and since there's not a manual save option in the game make sure to press f4 when you see you're not going to make it... When you die you switch to another survivor from your group which is friendly to you, or if you don't have any friends you just get a random guy. I died once and decided to restart the game, learned my lesson the hard way.Once you progress enough in the game you can relocate your base, the best option is the Snyder Trucking Warehouse. You need at least 12 people in your group to move there, and once it's up and running you are going to feel untouchable, since you can have up to 8 outposts, and the consequence of that is a very big safe zone for you to chill during the zombie apocalypse.Regarding the other survivor groups that appears during the game, the only thing that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off is the fact that you lose trust with them, if for example you approach them with a car, you get a penalty for ""reckless driving"" and they also can catch on fire if you throw a molotov near them, don't even think about using guns, unless you are alone, they will get in your way and get hit. But if you swing a machete or a sledgehammer in their head nothing will happen... It would also be really cool if other survivor groups could attack you, trying to steal your supplies or even your base.You lose stamina and even health as time goes on, the only option to get better is to switch characters and let the other one rest. But most people really don't want to go out playing with another survivor, there should be an option to rest and wake up rested the next day. It's also much more difficult to play in the night, you do have a flashlight, but other than that everything else is completely dark, all you can see are the red eyes of the zombies, and that's awesome! I remember one time when I went on a mission to retrieve a watch for one of the survivors, I had to go to the starting area of the game, and I went there after the sunset and managed to explode my car trying to jump a broken bridge, which attracted a lot of zombies, and there wasn't any other vehicle nearby. All I had with me was an axe and some firecrackers, I had to sneak all my way through the woods, and use the firecrackers to get the attention of the nearby hordes so I could get the damn watch and gtfo of there, I felt like I was in the game at that moment, and that's when I thought, this game is awesome! Totally recommended!			"

												NOTE: This review is months old so the game might be different (and $10 cheaper) now. To those who think you're being original asking how I can 'not recommend' it with 200 hours logged... it's been remarked upon, check the other comments. I'm not saying it's terrible, just that I didn't really recommend it- read the whole review, not just the red thumb, you might decide the positives outweigh the negatives for you. Also, I didn't actively play for 200 hours.State of Decay's a good game, and a mediocre 'simulation.' Unfortunately it insists on trying to be a simulator too much and the result is a flawed game that demands respect but does little to respect the player's time. SOD has an impressive open world with most buildings having multiple entry ports. These buildings are part of the world and require no loading as do some games. This is necessary because at any time you might need to escape into or out of a building as zombies attack. There are also multiple sites for 'home bases' which is nice but are not without problems: restrictions on facilities that don't make sense, barbed wire fences that block players but not zombies, etc.The zombies themself are well-done, and most can be outrun or fought without much difficulty... until the complications start. Like running from one pack of them right into another, or having one come around the corner just as you've used up your last bit of strength. There are also special zombies, some of which tend to be pretty annoying because of their quick lethality and insane hitpoints. I find the zombie hordes to be much more enjoyable, as they lead to more tense moments and thrilling fights\escapes\deaths. There are quite a few characters in the game that can be found or not found randomly in most cases. Sometimes you'll only know one was there when you find a corpse. Others can be recruited and, if you earn enough ""trust"" from them, become playable. This brings up a strange mechanic of the game: who are they trusting? The game does not have a 'main' player character (though you always start as the same guy) and affords no opportunity to create one. Instead the player switches between different survivors encountered. While many of the possible characters have interestings traits and appearances, it would be nice to be able to create one, and this would make more sense mechanically than having a pool of survivors share nebulous resources like 'trust' and 'influence'. It would seem such an idea runs afoul of the designers' narrow philosophical approach to the game; more on that later. Unfortunately many of the random characters end up feeling generic, even to the point of sharing the same voices. Because you can't see someone's traits before recruiting them, it's a crapshoot if you get a useless drunk or a warrior doctor. Since it's not easy to kick people out, one strategy\exploit is to constantly recruit survivors and then purposely kill the weak ones by guiding them into a group of zombies. That such a tactic need exist points to a need for improvement in the game.The quest missions are good, though there are not many of them; most of the time will be taken up by a series of ""SOS"" style requests for assistance that get annoying because of their frequency. It would seem that the survivors whom the player is not controlling exist solely to get in trouble and make the player divert from whatever task he or she was doing and rescue them. It gets very tiring to hear the radio operator keep calling out ""Aren't you going to help our friends"" again and again as you're trying to find the supplies to keep the base going. Also annoying is the fact that there are some quest missions you can let linger for as long as you'd like, and others that resolve (i.e. fail) on their own, but the game doesn't differentiate between the two types for you. This feeds into the idea that the devs wanted to force the player to choose between competing tasks, but ends up just overloading the game and stopping the players from doing what they want... unless you're okay with one of your survivors dying because you were across the map. Guns and other weapons are plentiful and varied, the latter perhaps unnecessarily (how many blunt objects do I really need?). Ammunition is so scarce that it makes some guns nearly useless but there are ways when you want to just open up with an M60. And yes, doing so will draw plenty of zombies, so a silenced .22 pistol is much more effective. Weapons are fun to use in general. Survivors can 'level up' with different weapons, making them seem like an investment, a nice feature that could have been used even more: how about experienced survivors stop needing their hands held? There is no save option (but on exit) and the game enforces permadeath. Moreoever there is a rudimentary 'simulation' (more of a calculation upon restarting the game) that bases itself on how long you've gone without playing and the state of decay (see what I did there?) at the time of quitting. It might just take away a bunch of your influence and resources, or it might cause all sorts of other problems if you had to quit while things weren't hunky-dorey (i.e. without clearing infestations, raising morale, etc). This is the biggest problem I have with the game, as it sits there on my steam shelf threatening me, saying ""if you don't play me now, you might as well never come back."" So I tend not to go back. Changing one's system clock can circumvent the process, but that seems like a ridiculous workaround. While the game slows down time progression after a couple days, it's a very poor choice to have such a mandatory 'feature' for people who may only have a couple hours every few days to play. You'll log in hoping to progress your game, but instead be forced to try and make up lost ground. It hurts what could be a great game to pick up and put down occasionally. The developers want the game played a certain way and stress that they are trying to simulate a zombie apocolypse, rather than make another game like ""Dead Rising."" Unfortunately, SOD doesn't do better as a simulation. The player is always having seemingly every task delegated to him or her, but is expected to play as just another NPC. It's clear that if the player weren't around, things would collapse (at least given what happens when the player logs off to attend to real life for a few days), yet you lose 'influence' (i.e. money) by putting a weapon in storage (the store) and taking it back out again. Again, there is an exploit to avoid this, but there shouldn't need to be one. I could get behind the theme of a zombie game that focuses less on individuality, but I'd want it to be done better; maybe an isometric like Jagged Alliance... except with zombies. It would be nice to see other survivors going about their tasks instead of only hearing from them when they need help, for example.Had the developers made the permadeath, save system and 'simulation' into a recommended or 'hardcore' feature, the game would be quite better off, as would players who could make that choice. The open world, while a little small, is quite good and does feel somewhat populated (particularly before various locales get overrun via the storyline). Walking or driving around feels 'right,' even when it is a little annoying to have to drive across the map. I'd recommend this game to someone who really wants to get addicted; it can make you want to do just one more thing before bed, taking up lots of time. It also does 'open world' quite well. But if you don't have that time available, I would be wary. I came down on the side of ""not recommending"" in general largely because the developers are so strident about their 'vision' that they not only don't include some basic gaming conventions (i.e. save slots), but actively disassociate from them. Just because something is popular doesn't always make it bad, and making something harder doesn't necessarily make it good.			"

												State of Decay has one of the best plots that Gamers have been craving. An open world zombie game, that you can explore, build shelter, scavenge food, and so forth. Altough it doesn't deliever on all their promised points.+ Great Concept+ Addictive+ Interesting (and altough somewhat annoying) Characters+ Scavenging and organizing stuff for your camp is rewarding+ I've personally encountered few bosses- Very repetetive gameplay- Very repetetive dialogue- Too easy, theres no difficulty option..- Not Very rewarding loot-AND WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ IS IT NO MULTIPLAYER?I've been waiting for this type of game for a while, ive always wanted to be the masterming of a zombie apocalypse, i like the fact that when you die as a character, he or she is gone forever. You shouldn't mess around in this world. This is serious business. But it's too easy! During my so far 13 hour gameplay ive died ONCE. It makes scavenging, and ""having a chat"" with your fellow survivors feel like a chore.Good Concept, Good Game, Could've been alot better.7/10 "

												Bought this game on release. One year later they bring out another version of this game called Year One Survival Edition (http://store.steampowered.com/app/329430/) and......stopped the supported for the previous version. But instead of giving the remastered version for free to owners of the previous, you are supposed to purchase it again. This is not acceptable and therefore I am voting the game down. Other publishers made this better. Gave you either the redux for free or for a cheaper price. I CANNOT RECOMMEND TO BUY A GAME FROM THOSE DEVELOPERS. To the substance of the game. It has interesting parts, but graphics are not that good and gameplay gets boring very fast. Overall I was disappointed that I purchased it. The menu are very confusing and could have been made more clear. The survival aspect is not worth the money.NOT RECOMMENDED (5/10)			"

Now, they have announced the Year One Survival Edition - which includes the original SoD + DLCs + added content + gfx update + some bug/control fixes. Sounds great!

												For all of you looking for a true zombie survival game, you've come to the right place.  You're going to spend a ridiculous amount of time having stories to share with your friends unfold before your eyes.The base game has an enjoyable story, though it's the sandboxy feel that goes along with it that makes this game an excellent one.  You are continually capable of working toward your next story goal at your own pace, though if you're like me you'll find the majority of the game is spent exploring, collecting supplies, building up your base, dealing with other survivor groups, gaining skills for you survivors, etc.  Every character has a unique backstory and there are -a lot- of survivors out there that you might run into and have join you.The base building is simple, yet very enjoyable as well.  Depending on what skills your survivors have, different options are available and you have plenty of options available to you.  Do you want to be able to support more survivors?  Build a bunkhouse and a garden so that they have a comfortable place to sleep and food to eat if your scavenged supplies run low.  Looking to cut back on the sneaking around and really take the fight to the zombies?  An infirmary will keep your survivors healthy and a munitions shop will keep them well armed.  Just remember, even healthy, well armed survivors might run into a challenge when facing off against the 'freaks' or special zombies.The Breakdown DLC removes the deep story aspect of the the vanilla campaign, though it adds a brand new achievement system that unlocks 'hero' survivors that, more often than not, are more capable than your average survivor.  This mode also has 'Breakdown Levels', each time you complete one you move on to the next, more challenging phase, with new survivor achievements to unlock.I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the zombie survival genre.  I'd been looking for a game like this for a very long time and was extremely happy when I installed it and truly learned what it was all about.  Enjoy and I'd love to hear your stories!			"

												NOTE: This review is for the original version of State of Decay (which sadly is no longer available for purchase), not the Year One Survival edition.State of Decay is a third-person open-world zombie apocalypse game where you build and fortify a base of operations, recruit survivors, and scavenge for useful items and vehicles. It's a highly addictive, frequently tense, and often action-packed game that exceeded all my expectations, and I strongly recommend it.  While you initially start by playing one survivor, as more people are saved and given shelter in your community you'll be able to switch back and forth between a dozen or more playable characters. This becomes a necessity, as survivors will get injured (or even permanently killed) or just flat-out exhausted when performing missions, and will need time to recuperate. Characters have a handful of skills such as melee combat, fitness, or shooting that will level up with use, and some survivors you recruit will even turn out to have special talents, such as an expert gardener who can increase the amount of food supplied by the greenhouse you built at your base, or a munitions expert who can use your workshop to create useful items such as pipe bombs or mines. Your community as a whole has a morale level that you need to keep reasonably high by completing missions and scavenging supplies, or risk adverse results such as a survivor abandoning the group, or even deciding to off themselves. Influence is also measured and plays a huge factor. Provide for and assist the community and you'll be able to equip yourself with better gear from the group's communal supply, convince another survivor to tag along and watch your back, or direct the group's radio operator to keep an ear out for the location of especially needed supplies. Slack by letting missions expire or by failing to scavenge enough useful items, and you'll end up poorly equipped and with minimal clout until you can turn things around.While there's a variety of activities and missions to take part in - rescuing newly discovered survivors and getting them back to base safely; hunting down relatively rare boss zombies (or ""weird ones"" as the characters sometimes refer to them); working your way through several threads of primary story missions; or simply trying to return home in one piece with that valuable case of medicine or that fragile high-end sports car you happened across - there's no doubt that Decay is primarily about fighting zombies. And seeing as how they're virtually everywhere, you can't outrun them beyond short distances (zombies don't get winded, but you definitely will, often at the most inopportune times), stealth is only practical on occasion, and vehicles are too fragile to be used as your main zombie-killing method, you'll be engaging zombies quite frequently whenever you're away from your base. There's a reasonable variety of nicely-done fighting animations. Special combat moves can be unlocked as your skills improve, and that weakling survivor who started out by barely being able to swing a pipe and had trouble defeating even a single zombie without getting gnawed on rather extensively can become a real powerhouse in time, rendering an encounter with a few zombies as nothing more than an annoyance, and even becoming capable of wading into the middle of an entire horde of half a dozen zombies or more and coming out alive (although almost certainly not unscathed). While guns are a relatively common find, making noise in Decay generally leads to bad things happening, so you'll likely be doing most of your killing hand to hand. The noise from bashing in a door or a zombie's skull, the engine of a vehicle, or even just searching through an abandoned house can be enough to alert a nearby zombie or two; firing off a few shots from a pistol, shotgun, or rifle, even one with a suppressor attached, seems to bring every zombie for blocks around running, and is best done only as a last resort, or when you're a few steps away from a nearby vehicle or the safety of your base, or in the handful of story missions where you actually have some significant backup. Fortunately, even though you may do it hundreds of times by game's end, sprinting up to a zombie so you can dropkick it to the ground and then finishing it off by driving your knee through its face never really gets old. It's a thoroughly addictive game, building and improving your base and leveling up your various survivors. It's also often a surprisingly tense one. The game has a day/night cycle, so half the time you're in the dark, and getting a request to clear out a nearby infested warehouse or hunt down a dangerous boss zombie when you can barely see ten feet in front of you is unlikely to be something you'll look forward to. Even during the day, some of the structures you'll enter will be shrouded in darkness, with a zombie unseen (but fortunately usually not unheard) ready to pounce from some dark corner. And of course there's the ever-present threat of permadeath. No matter how badass your survivor is, there's always the possibility that a fight will spiral out of control, that beating one zombie to re-death makes enough noise to alert another, and fighting that one draws in two more, and suddenly routine combat has turned dire and potentially deadly. That one time you keep your injured, exhausted, broken-weaponed, out-of-healing-items survivor out extra long because you're low on influence and you've decided to search one more house for supplies may also be the one time they manage to accidentally alert a nearby horde. Which quite possibly will lead to you becoming an unwilling witness to the rather brutal death animation. Decay is not without some issues. There are minor annoyances, such as the lack of variety in the vehicles, or the fact that despite gasoline being a salvageable resource nobody thought to bring a generator along and you're forced to stumble around your base bumping into walls in the dark with an under-powered flashlight. But there are a few more serious issues as well. At least one side mission failed to trigger. One of my survivors clipped into a piece of furniture and became stuck, forcing me to exit mid-mission and lose progress, while on another occasion a favorite survivor became inexplicably glued to a structure's outside wall, making her a nice easy target for a charging boss zombie and getting her killed (on the final story mission, no less). And the game essentially continues to play after you exit, with the continued, unseen scavenging and activities of the community members simulated the next time the game is launched, and while that lends it an interesting twist, it has a tendency to cause overtly negative events, such as illogical, precipitous morale drops, and some players even reporting returning after an absence to find significant items or survivors themselves having disappeared without even a journal entry of explanation.Ultimately though, those issues have little bearing on the overall experience, and the positives far outweigh any negatives. In short, not only is State of Decay the most enjoyable game I've played in recent memory, it's quite probably my favorite game of 2013.			"

												They are now releasing State of Decay with better graphics and we can just all hope we get upgraded since its we who bought the game that made this possible, but not likly since they have gotten a new name on it ""State Of Decay Year One Survival Edition"". and for all of us who bought the game and all its DLC's we have to buy a new game even thou its the same game and only get 33% off the full price, when ppl do this i stop supporting that company/ppl on every new release they have, since they cant upgrade the ppl who made them money to begin with, so this is a rip off, dont buy. Better to go and play farmville on facebook sadly, at least they dont ask you to take it in the brown eye and then ask you to lick it clean afterwards. But latly there have been alot of this crap going around with giving the game away for free after ppl allready have bought it, so the ppl who used money on it feel like they are treated badly since the guys who didnt support the game by buying it gets it for free.

												Yeah...Dont think I'm willing to burn away $30 for a game I already own. For those interested who have NOT originally bought and played this game, State of Decay is actually a really fun game. For me it did a pretty damn good job at making it seem like you were actually surviving. Going out to scavange, ammo is sparse, there's permadeath, you have to build your base and maintain it. It felt like zombie survival. Sure it was buggy...really buggy at times but it was still fun. So after however long it's been since I've played it I figured I'd give it another play....only to find out that the game I have is garbage and have to buy it again in order to play itThis is terrible, this is a scam. You cant update the game and delete the original. What was so hard to just fix the actual game? So no. I'm not gonna rebuy the game I already own. For people who havent played it, I'd recommend it...for those who own the game...dont bother. You already own this game			"

												Was a great zombie survival at one point, until the developers decided it would be a great idea to rerelease the same game in HD, and screw their fanbase over by leaving us with a buggy and poorly optimized game.At the timeof release, I really really wanted to like this one; but the ""state of decay"" the game is in now is an understatement.The developer pushed their customer's good faith too far and their new HD release (with bug fixes!) shoved Undead Labs back into obscurity. Literally forcing you to buy the same title, for a patch and some new paint.TLDR; Don't buy it, was worth it at one point; not anymore.			"

""IT'S GOOD RIGHT? I MEAN IT DOESN'T SUCK.""I still remember it. 3 years ago. 4th September. I was about to date one of the most bomb girl you ever saw. And guess what? What I was doing instead of doing what I was suppose to do? Well, I believe you got it right. Since this is review of State of Decay and I mentioned it just now for the first time, your answer is State of Decay. Alright, enough of sentiment, let's get into the game. Story starts out pretty weak, again with lot of questions and as usual you are just ordinary citizen of small US town and after a while zombie-killing machine. The whole story itself is really not that important, at least wasn't for me, it's about enjoying that zombie rampage, enjoying RPG elements and just trying to survive. Really good thing is, that you can die, your friends can die, people in your house can die but you will take the control of somebody else and you'll continue. That's really awesome. Way more better if it was just ""you die, game over"" cliche. AI is really really weak. No matter if it's zombies or survivors, it's both really low. Survivors are absolutely not independent. It's not like I do mind taking care of somebody else, but thing is that they can't take care of themselves and that's it.Getting supplies, scavenging town, building rooms in your house, upgrading your house,, building new spots and making area secure is one of my most favorite elements out of this game. Audio is not really strong side of State of Decay and visuals are not that good either, but there's no reason to turn away from it.  Game will last you estimated 12 +- hours and price point is fair. You can extend that time period by buying two DLCs which are basically worth buying. I will make more in-depth reviews on both on their respective Store Page. So now just few sentences.Breakdown - This DLC does not carry any story, it's just basically let you do infinite survival. You're unlocking different heroes and try to survive as long as possible. Hordes are spawning fast, and supplies going away fast too. When you run out of everything you'll use your RV to get out. And to be honest that's it. Get it for 2,49€ in sale.Lifeline - You are in control of Greyhound One unit on your way to rescue scientists. New map, new characters and new weaponry. It'll extend your gaming experience by 3-4 hours. Linear but still fun. Again, get it in sale and you're good.Get both for achievements.To sum it up, pretty nice zombie survival game for good money, pretty enjoyable and you can play it even second time and still enjoy it. Easy achievements and killing hordes is fun. Weak AI and audio but you can live with that. Most definitely worth the shot.Bonus Point: Wheat FieldsRating: 8/10 "

Not too many patches and the game is a poor port that struggles to push 45FPS on a good rig.Then the ""Year One"" edition came out so you can buy the exact same game with the exact same stuff again but with basic patching and ""better textures"".Trusted devs, got stabbed in the back.

												A very good game, i had a great time with it and would happily recommend it. Had all the ingredients to become the closest thing to ""The Walking Dead"" tv series. They just needed to add some more horror and ""your back against the wall"" circumstances to make something great. Instead, after the ""Breakdown"" DLC, it felt more like hack n slash. Oh, and let's not forget that is totally unplayable after the recent update. Not worth either your time or money as it is now.			"

												State of Decay, is a zombie game that focuses on survival. Population size is dwindling along with the resources you can find throughout the city you explore. Time is not on your side, the world will persist even when you are not playing. Finding a fortifiable location to barricade from zombie hordes is critical to winning the game.ProgressionAs you progress through the story you are given certain facilities to use as your headquarters, once you hit a certain point of the game you are allowed to re-allocate your base.SurvivalThe main game focuses on a balance between survival, difficulty and story. Any character you play can be killed off by zombies and stay dead. There is no way to bring them back other than starting over again or attempting to exit the game before it auto-saves. Some characters clearly have better traits than others especially the first guy you play as. If you let them die, you will be disadvantaged. Training multiple characters to be strong and capable of survival is critical. Breakout DLCThe DLC is survival oriented with the story stripped out, which results in a good experience, not interrupted by constantly redoing cinematics or certain missions over and over. Instead, it allows you to play at your own pace and repair the van to proceed to the next difficulty. Every trip reduces the total amount of resources within the city, scales the damage of the enemies up, and reduces the amount of cars available.Persistent WorldA major con to some people but also appealing to others is the persistent world. Alot of people dislike the fact that while you're away from the game the resources are depleting every day. The people who play more hours a day have a much greater benefit than those who play few hours or attempt to play it casually.			"

												I don't normally post reviews and before today I would have posted a positive review. Today I thought to myself, I haven't played State of Decay in a while, that would be a lot of fun. But wouldn't you know it, the damn thing doesn't work! Completely unplayable. The Undead Labs logo screen freezes and after a Ctrl-Alt-Del I get to the menu and the text is just black boxes which are located nowhere near where the text should be. I tried my luck, clicking around on the screen to try and just get into the game, but the game itself is just a black screen with some coloured boxes at the bottom. This game was great, but I cannot play it and I think it's absolutely♥♥♥♥♥♥that the developers/publishers won't migrate players to the newer version or at the very least release a patch so I can play the game that I PAID FOR.

												At first you may thought that...typical ""owh, it's another generic zombie game"" ... but don't... it's not, it's better... Have you watch/read/play the Walking Dead series? No? than you should...if yes, feel it's different than other zombie genre? cause that's how State of Decay will make you feel. Have you try DayZ? or Rust, or Borderlands or other apocalyptic games. which most of it focus on 'multiplayer' or 'coop'. If that what you digg, than good for you. What if you didn't? what if you want to play a single player experience and proceed at your own pace. Without having to deal with 'a**hat' in online game, that will ruins your game by killing you at the glimpse of your body. Than, this is your game. A single player experience of zombie game that you never play before.This game is not about all out killing zombies. It's more of a base management simulation. When it make you feel/think how to survive day and night, while managing a group of survivors. Like how Rick have to, in Walking Dead. Gathering resources is not because you want to, but only just because you need. Take only what you have to, and leave the rest for later. Resources are scatter.. and limited for the whole map. No respawn of resources. You may see the map kinda small, but after you travel, it is really big. Lot of places to scavange. Lot of story to unfold. Roleplay a bit on your journey. It will make the game better. Take the limitation in game as a challenges, on what you can do in order to overcome those obstacles, such as storage limits etc.  Feel the need to survive, in this State of Decay.			"

												Hello guys!For all of you (like me) who struggle(d) with the issue of game freezing after Undead Labs logo, dispair not! There is a simple fix : create a .cfg file named ""user.cfg"" with these simple parameters : r_Fullscreen=1r_Width=1920r_Height=1080or any of your liking, depending on your monitors native resolution, then place the file in the ""Game"" folder in the game`s install directory so : Steam/steamapps/common/State of Decay/Game. Now you`re set to go! Game engine will render scenes and text properly. But remember not to touch the resolution sliders as it will result in a crashdump. You can only alter the details slider (which will be set to min by default).Now, for setting up AA, this is what you will have to do if you have an Nvidia card : SGSSAAOpen State of Decay driver profile via NVIDIA Inspector.Change Antialiasing compatibility to 0x000012C1[4]Change Antialiasing - Mode to Override any application settingChange Antialiasing - Setting to 4x [4x Multisampling] or 8xQ [8x Multisampling]Change Antialiasing - Transparency Supersampling to 4x Sparse Grid Supersampling or 8x Sparse Grid SupersamplingApply changes. This method is very performance demanding and may decrease your general performance.FXAAIf you are a NVIDIA user enable FXAA from NVIDIA Control Panel or NVIDIA Inspector.Or use FXAA Tool.SMAAUse injectSMAA by mrhaandi.Or use SweetFX by CeeJay.dk.I will leave my source for all the information I`ve posted, but you can find more there, so check it out : http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/State_of_Decay.

												Do not buy this game, allow for me to explain.I played this game for hours on my 360, before I knew how great gaming on a PC was. I used to go to Undead Lab's website and look forward to everything they would post however now I see who they truly are. Once on PC, the game itself ran decently, however as I continued playing I noticed constant frame droppings for no reason. I also took note of the animations in the game, they seemed really awkward. The textures also seemed to look dull, I was expecting them to look a bit sharper considering this was running on CRYengine but never mind that. A remastered version was coming out to the new consoles, which means an update for us!!!! .... kind of.We too on PC got the Year One version however what it is, is simply an update to this version of SoD. Literally an update, you are literally being forced to pay a fee for an update. This version of the game seemed to be dropped and they will only continue updating the new version. Shame on you, Undead Labs. I don't think I will be purchasing another UL game for now.			"

												Game is extremely meh. It's repetitive, grindy, and feels incomplete/unfinished especially with its joke of an ending. Base building is super shallow and relationships between survivors are nonexistent. AI is atrocious for survivors and zombies. If you're in a siege mission, then all your AI companions do is stand still and board up windows while the only thing that zombies do is attack the boarded windows. Big ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s don't enter the house, they just ram into it which damages the boards. You literally have to exit the house and kill the zombies outside to progress things.Your survivors constantly go missing/get stuck/need to be rescued, hordes constantly spawn, infestations constantly spawn, special zombies constantly spawn, etc. The game simulates itself when you're not playing it so if you don't want to come back to a game where all your neighbors are dead, all your supplies are drained, and your group is missing, then enjoy babysitting constantly to quit the game on a good note. You can also just keep the game indefinitely paused to prevent this.There are few home sites, and only 2 of them are any good.Scavenging is pointless if you play for long periods of time. Despite having a day/night cycle, days only pass during simulation. Supplies only drain when you're not playing the game and you can easily overstock on everything in about 30-45 minutes.The game is also incredibly easy. After clocking in about 30 hours, I only died once and that's because I was trying to make my experience as hard as possible.Mechanics are easily abusable. Stuck alone with no health and a feral chasing you? Switch to a character in your home base and then switch back to your character. He/she will teleport immediately back to base.Game is very short too. You can easily beat it in 8-10 hours.I guess the best thing I can say is the port is very faithful to the 360 original. They even ported over all the bugs and glitches!Almost nothing has changed in this game from when it was an Early Access title to a full fledged release. There are no graphical customization options, limited resolution options, awful performance, and mouse acceleration.The DLC looks like it might be fun but I'll stay away from it until it's sub-$5.My full review:

												What starts off as an interesting and fun open world zombie survival game, quickly turns into a chore of repeating the same tasks over and over again. Not only this but the 'main' missions are very few and far between meaning you have to wait, without any notice of when the next mission will come, to continue the main plot of the game. The missions themselves are short, boring and ultimately lead to a very flat and disappointing ending.			"

The ability to choose safe houses and upgrade resource providing buildings while having to maintain and keep them safe is interesting in terms of providing an almost RTS-esque play style.That being said if any of this appeals to you, Buy the new version for like $35.  I will not be purchasing that because I bought it on sale years ago, played it and loved it.

												State of Decay is a third-person zombie apocalypse survival game developed by Undead Labs and published by Microsoft. State of Decay is a single player only game.State of Decay gameplay is quite deep, but somewhat repetitive at certain point. At the start of the game, you play as two main characters, Marcus Campbell and Ed Jones as they are ambushed by the living dead. Then you will have a home base where you and other survivors making a stand against the undead. From there, the sandbox play begins. Your home base is where you and your others survivors live, obviously, and it needs supplies to survive. You need to hunt and raid outside to get supplies like foods, medicines, building materials, ammunitions, weapons or fuels. Your home base can also be improved, you can build a workshop, garden, sleeping area and more as long as your home base has the space for them. You can move out from your current home base and find a new bigger or better one too. When you're out there hunting, you may find some neighboring survivors or survivors who may want to join you in your home base. You will also find some driveable civilian vehicles which can also be used as cargo for your scavenged supplies for you to bring home. Your home base will sometimes attacked by approaching zombie hordes. You will need to set up some outpost to defend against these living dead hordes. Outpost will also create a small safe zone outside your home for you to take shelter.In State of Decay, survivors can become tired, injured or sick. When that happen to survivors you currently play, better get home and switch to another survivors. Yes, you can switch characters when you have become friends with them. If a survivor gets tired, his/her max stamina will decrease, same goes when he/she is injured. Survivors will also gain some experience and skill as you play with them, such as cardio, wits (ability to search faster but quiet), fighting, shooting and more. But beware if your survivors is killed, their death is permanent. Survivors can be equipped with melee or firearms, whichever you prefer, but melee weapons will gets damaged over time and will be destroyed if not repaired. Firearms can also gets damaged and if not repaired, will become jammed but not destroyed.Graphics of State of Decay is great, looks good, but not one of those next generation thing. Using CryEngine 3, State of Decay does have good environment view, lightning, good textures, physics and effects. Characters animations are great, when dodging zombies, attacking with melee, it's good. Blood and gore effects are also present in this game, in fact, you can see your survivors getting torn in 2 pieces by the zombies.State of Decay performance is good, but can use more optimization. At maximum setting, the game sometimes but rarely stutters which can ruin your aim when using a gun. Aiming a gun also seems clumsy and quite hard. Otherwise the performance is good and fine.If you're looking for more friendly zombie apocalypse game, then State of Decay is for you, since the game is single player only, you won't find yourself get shot from the back by somebody when you just spawn in the game. With deep gameplay mechanics, State of Decay can entertain you for many hours. I recommend this.Rating 9/10			"

												You will never get over the beautiful nature and atmosphere in this game. You don't need the YOSE Day One DLC to improve the graphics. I thought they were going to release a normal update but instead they charge you $30 for some simple improvements that you don't need. As for the glitches they aren't bad at all and sometimes aren't even noticeable. It's still beautiful the way it is. If you're one of those people who are into super fast paced massive Rambo shooter garbage games, then this game is not for you. Because it's slow paced and ridiculously relaxing but can also be challenging at the same time. And VERY realistic, because even when you quit the game, it still carries on!This game is a shocker, it's wonderfully made and most probably the best zombie survival game out there. Open world. Excellent vehicle handling and controls. I love the gore. Smooth combats and the NPCs are amazing and not brain-dead. The soundtracks are lovely. And the atmosphere is one of the very best.A true feeling of surviving an apocalypse. Scavenging for resources, such as food, medicines, ammo, fuel and materials to improve your base. Building outposts. Setting up traps to prevent the zeds from nearing your home. Requiring skilled people to be able to do things such as repairing the vehicles, creating weapons and explosives, training the survivors, doing experiments and so much more. Meeting other survivors you can help and trade with. You always need to make sure you are well prepared every time you're out on a mission because you never know when you can encounter a horde or the freaks. Zombies can be hilarious with their not so bright brains but can be distracted with lights and noise such as gun shots, cars, sprinting. But what I like the most, is when someone dies, they're really gone. Which is frustrating, but makes you do your best to survive and be better at the game. It's really amazing! There is so much more things to do! I only wish it had Co-op or multi-player, so I can never stop playing it. But still, I can't get enough of it. I highly recommend it and both DLCs. You get to experience the zombie apocalypse as the army in Lifeline. And you get more of State of Decay in Breakdown. And both are very challenging as well and incredibly fun! Five stars!			"

												While undeniably a fun open world experience that is hands down more entertaining and rewarding than games like DayZ and H1Z1, this game has always been a buggy mess on the PC with graphics that are lackluster at best and a downright mess at worst. To be blunt, it needed a ton of mods to be even minutely enjoyable after an hour or so. It was in desperate need of major patching to fix graphics issues and repair many of the game breaking bugs it suffered from, and finally that improvement is here! All you have to do is repurchase the game and double your monetary investment!			"

												I've been playing Undead Labs's State of Decay for the past several weeks after nabbing it on sale. The game is a single-player third-person zombie apocalypse sandbox of sorts: while the main game has a storyline to follow, you certainly don't need to follow it and the story won't advance until you do, giving you a lot of time to just poke around.I have enjoyed the game very much.  It's certainly interesting enough to play and while it starts out reasonably tame, it can get quite difficult.The main game begins with your character and a buddy returning to the more civilization-adjacent parts of a national park after a two-week fishing trip only to find that, while you were gone, civilization kind of had a major meltdown.  From there, the game focuses on steath and survival by building up friendships with others and establishing a base from which to operate and outposts to reinforce that base and provide small ""safe zones"".CriticismsThe criticisms I have are somewhat picky.  To start, the story is very simple and somewhat shallow — it would be easy to play through it relatively quickly and then be just done with the game.  A lot more could have been done, but, as I understand it this was Undead Labs's first game, and it was made for XBox Arcade with all the limitations that requires -- so we will perhaps see more story development in their next full release.Second, there just isn't enough information in the tutorial; you feel bombarded with information (because a lot comes in through your Journal) that you can't make much sense of — and then lost because basic information (such as the benefits of establishing an Outpost, or whether it's wise to leave resources in Outposts or loot them thoroughly before setting one up in a location) can be a little difficult to find.Third, there are too few voice actors, meaning that you end up with the same voice actors' lines being used for several different characters who end up sounding exactly the same while they say (verbatim) the same things; get two of them with the same voice together on a mission and it can get kind of confusing.Finally: the driving physics and UI need some work.  The game was set up for XBox, so maybe this is where PC players like me start to have problems.  But while I can play Saints Row and Grand Theft Auto and drive just fine, I find the driving in State of Decay frustrating — especially because the smallest mistake can send a car sailing through the air as though it suddenly weighs nothing.  And cars that turn over always explode, so there's that.PraiseMeanwhile, though, State of Decay is nice to look at: the colors are just muted enough to evoke the proper autumn at the end-of-the-world feeling, and there has been a lot of attention to detail in filling out the large area (Trumbull Valley) in which your character gets to roam.  There are three small towns to explore, as well as a lot of countryside, with a lot of interesting things to look at if you appreciate the details.The game also makes you take a step back and figure out how to survive.  Your character can go stealth or maniac, or pretty much anything in between.  But don't count on the zombies to cooperate since that's sure to get your favorite character eaten nearly every time.  And since death is final, that really makes a difference.Strategy and sound are important, which I really enjoy, and on top of that there is also resource management to deal with: you've got a base full of survivors who need food, medicine, and ammunition to remain survivors, and construction materials to keep their base up.  Scavenging through the zombie-infested, burnt-out world is a constant necessity.In the end, the game is definitely worth a few bucks (especially if you can catch it on sale), and I look forward to other games from Undead Labs.Breakdown DLCI've played several hours of the Breakdown DLC (at level 5, currently), and it's been a lot of fun and a lot of frustration, but the frustration really seems to be the point of it.  It's primarily the sandbox version of the base game, with a couple simple tasks to do to ""move to the next level"".  Each level, the zombies get more numerous and more difficult to deal with and the scavenge-able resources get harder to find.If you don't mind that sort of challenge — the one where you are pretty sure you'll ultimately fail — it can end up being a lot of fun.

												wow...that game blew me away.i was never too much into those zombie and/or survival-games...but this title might have changed this :)The mix between scavaging ressources, fighting zombies, driving/walking around the open world and trying to keep your group of survivors alive and sane is pretty well done.The game will push you to do all the above, that you won't end up bored, but it's ""relaxed"" enough to not make it frustrating (imho).Basically all houses in the world can be entered and searched for goods you'll need for your outpost, which adds a lot to the atmosphere as you don't have any locked doors (at least not that i can remember).The world itself is pretty beautiful and detailed, although graphics isn't the big strength of the game, it still is very well done, but it would have been nice to have some tuning options (antialiasing etc pp).Gameplay will become repetitive, with few sidemissions to do, like rescuing other survivors, cleaning out zombie-infested areas and helping other survivor-groups out.But for me, the variety of options you have, makes it interesting all the time because you seemlessly switch between scavenging, doing a sidemission, driving around, sneaking around, looking for better outposts etc. so it never became boring for me (but i could understand if people find it too repetitive).All in all, it's a great zombie-survival open-world game and would recommend it to anyone who even slightly into those games.

												The stealth gameplay is decent if you have the patience for it, melee is more or less a button mash, shooting isn't anything spectacular, but it works good enough. Driving is fairly straightforward, though you can't drive through barriers, making you have to look for the long way around some areas. Honestly, it's a port of an arcade game, so what can you really expect in this regard.There's a permadeath feature in this game, which is an interesting feature, but it serves to highlight State of Decay's biggest problem. There's no reason to care about anyone apart from the intro characters because you'll quickly realize that, past some scripted events at the starting base, dialogue between survivors is generic, and the only real personality you get out of any of them is via their stats sheet.If the people we're supposed to care about in your game/show/movie/whatever don't have unique personalities,  we have ZERO reason to care about whether they live or die. If we can't care about the characters, we can't care about the story they're in. And that's what happened to me. I quit just after getting a new base,TL;DR - An open world zombie survival game where the humans have about as much showable personality as the zombies, possibly even less.  Skip it. "

												You know the feeling where you're playing a game that's kinda terrible but you really really want to level this♥♥♥♥♥♥so you can finally go to sleep and do it again tomorrow?Turn that entire an entire game and you get State of Decay. It's a flying kick zombie skull crushing base building persistent sandbox world morale mission dating sim with a bevy of uniqueish characters and firearms that is probably actually detrimental to your health. I mean... the game progresses in real time when you're not playing.DLCBreakdown is a survival version of SoD's main map, procedurally populated that allows you to play different characters from the story with unique abilities. Lifeline is an actiony soldiers-kill-zombies-and-rescue-civvies game that is more linear and has a smaller map. It also adds guns and a vehicle or two to the base game. It's probably a 6 hour game if you blew through the missions back-to-back.Worth?I'd say the base game and Breakdown are worth $10. Lifeline would also be worth $10 on it's own. This game is the type most people do one long binge session, then don't touch again. Despite the DLC there's not that much replay value.This game is often on bundle for $10 or less with all DLC.			"

												Unfortunately, while the game on its own is good, the developers decided that instead of patching the game for free, they would re-release it under the guise of a ""remastered"" edition. This means everyone who bought the original game not only are completely disregarded, but do NOT get the patches for bugs. It's a pretty horrendous model, and it's sad that it happened with this game.			"

												I tried to like SOD but unfortunately it didn't like me. The game starts well with you straight in the thick of it, which almost made up for the bad cut scenes where my character's feet are glued to the floor. Nothing is explained: the whole inventory, skills, crafting menus are left for you to faff about with until you get the hang of them. The only skill you really need however is inventory management in order to shuffle around all the semi-useless tat you find and carry: putting them in bags, putting them in backpacks, putting things in car boots, driving somewhere and unloading it all again. It's like a packing-for-holiday simulator without the holiday. Friends help out, but sometimes run back to base for no reason. Others won't let you be their friends but occasionally get sad, even though you're doing all the work. You scavenge the same building four times in one street. The same four lines of dialogue are heard again and again. Enemies spawn endlessly from quest locations. On and on and on. Finally comes the best surprise: the game plays itself when you turn it off. All your tiredness goes away (hurrah!), all your stockpiling runs out and all your barracades are taken down (not so hurrah). So that's SOD: it's like my day job. I work hard while others do nothing but get tired, sad or both, the work mounts up faster than I can deal with it, and if I take a day off, I'm twice as busy when I get back. 4/10.			"

												Being a big fan of the zombie culture that has been getting dramatically more popular over the past decade I couldn't tell you how ecstatic I was for the launch of this title. The world isn't in any shortage of zombie games, there being even a few survival style ones out there. I'd like to think I've tried most of them as possible even some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ones *coughfortzombiecough*. Typically I'd pass over console titles, but this was different. As a gamer who has played PC games exclusively for around ten years or so I was really biting the bullet when I purchased an XBox and accessories to play just this title alone.I was not dissappointed. Undead Labs delivered a title onto XBox live like no other when it came to this particular niche of the zambonie genre. Even with a broken XBox that I had bought cheap, and a knockoff microsoft controller that had it's share of problems I was having a blast. I watched the world around me change as I began ransacking the county, ventiliating craniums along the way. My survivors honed their skills, as they were being equipped better and stockpiling more, still surprising me to this day with how many weapons there are. The empty courtyards of the bases converted into stat boosting facilities. Hordes moved through town, infesting and congregating at buildings. Other survivor groups came and went. Joined us, or were made into lunch. It was quite pleasant. Unfortunately the general overlay of the map does not change, and even then the console hardware wasn't up to snuff to help matters much either.Then the PC version released. I most certainly was excited to see what was different and when I launched for the first time I was pleasantly surprised. After maxing out the settings it looked like an entirely new game. Through its developement I was a bit salty about the title going to XBox Live, and still think UL would've been better off focusing on it as a PC title to start with but this more than makes up for it. Breakout launches tomorrow, and I've been watching the updates for it. Its going to be good, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed good.If you don't have State of Decay already, you should be ashamed. Its only $20 and you will get your money's worth and then some. The only thing that could make this near perfect zombie game over the top is multiplayer.			"

												This is the first game that I wish had a ""maybe"" to answer the question, ""Would you recommend this game.""State of Decay has many of the things that I have long looked for in a Zombie Survival horror type game. But before I get ahead of myself lets break it down.Graphics are fairly good in my opinion. The specular maps aren't really anything to write home about and the texture resolution will not light the world on fire but for the price and from a small developer they did alright.The sound if pretty satisfying. Different guns and bomb have a variety of splody sounds and I'm not really one to care too much about bass or presence...my gaming rig doesn't even have a sound card O_oStoryline is fairly simple. In the campaign you are a survivor with a friend camping in the mountains when you realize the world has gone to♥♥♥♥♥♥ You meet up with other survivors, find shelter and have quest missions while you try and figure out how to get out of town for good...blah blah blah. To be honest I found the storyline campaign long, and annoying. Far too linear and the fetch quests became really annoying after a while. The rest of this review deals solely with Break Down.Breakdown is the sandbox version of the story campaign with ALL of the storyline elements and quests removed. It lets you set up a base, and ""outposts"" around the town that provide a ""safe area"" where zombies can't spawn into. These outposts can be set up around, food, medical, ammo, or building supplies which can give a bonus to your total supply cache.Scavenging is the major function of this game. Search houses, find anything helpful and take it back to the group. The player is rewarded with ""influence"" points that allow them to set up more outposts, relocate the base, or perform special actions from special characters within their group. A military character will have an ""artillery strike"" option. A priest has ""words of encouragement"" that can remove negative fatigue status from a character. Influence is also needed to remove any supplies a player might take on a scavenging run, guns, ammo, melee weapons, medical supplies or food.Break down's goal is to survive until the ""escape RV"" is located, fixed and supplied. The player then chooses a small group of characters to get on the RV and leave the town. You are then randomly spawned back into the same town and the difficulty increases. More zombies, fewer supplies, harder special zombies.There are a LOT of zombies as well as special zombies. Combat becomes a balance of choosing the right weapon for the right characters. (ie: matching the proper weapons with a characters stats.) Using the right moves in combat that will maximize damage output while minimizing the use of stamina. You will meet randomly generated NPC characters that can join your group. The player is capable of switching between characters and infact HAS to in order for previous characters to rest, or heal from wounds.This is where the tedium comes in. State of Decay is full of crap, awful characters. You will find drunks, slobs, jerks, sleazeballs and s luts. None of whom will aid you in your survival. You have a maximum number of characters that your base can support and the game quickly turns into a macabre ""culling"" of the ""dead weight"" from your group. You can and will take characters out on supply runs and make sure they your ally never returns. Or you may just take direct control of a character and throw them off a cliff to break a leg and be eaten by zombies. You won't do this once, or twice. You will do this as many time as it takes, until the game spawns good characters. The problem is that you don't know the stats of survivors you invite to join you...until they have joined you.This can become mind numbingly boring. The environments are HUGE and mostly empty. You will drive for miles into the country, past farms and fields. There are only two towns in the game. Missions and friendly ""enclaves"" spawn randomly so if you are in the southern most town you can receive a quest on the other end of the freaking map...hope you like driving.Another issue is that the game had ""Early Access"" and I believe it also had a beta and there are still tons of glitches and flaws in this game. There is an active game forum on their website. You can report glitches and the staff is usually quick to respond but I hate small developers turning paying customers into their own game testers. I've been a game tester before and if I'm reproducing a bug for a developer...I'm getting paid for it.State of Decay Vanilla had tons of bugs, many that crashed the game. Before those were fixed, Break Down DLC came out. The bugs still haven't been fixed and they are releasing their second DLC.Inconclusion, I guess I can't recommend State of Decay. If you can get it bundled 75% off or more on a steam sale or humble indie bundle, go for it. But full price...noooooo.			"

I bought it when it was very very early release because I wanted to support the developers vision and help great sounding games come to fruition. So now here I am thinking that the game has had enough time to develop and WOW, just WOW! What an incredibly sleazy move. $30 to buy a game ""fixing"" update? Well, lesson learned. No more early access for me. Thanks Undead Labs for ruining what should be a positive thing for the community. I hope you all feel really terrible for dumping on your fans; but I'm sure the money will help you forget. It sure will help me not forget. Great way to lose customers. Cheers!			"

												State of Decay takes straight away: once the loading screen disappears, you should become separated from the frock of live dead persons and to drag especially nimble zombie from a neck of the best friend. The shy hope to find rescue on a post of a coast guard quickly disappears — instead of the armed soldiers three ""civil"" frightened to death there huddle. 15 minutes later roaring crowd of walking corpses will break into the house and will relieve survived of need to be afraid. This game will be suitable for fans to kill the zombie. (This my opinion and it can not coincide with yours). "

												I can't run this version on Win10, no matter how much I kick and fight for it. I refuse to pay the SoBs at Undead Labs another $30 for the YOSE, just because they think it's okay to bully their customers. Shame on these devs, I hope their studio fails, and all other studios refuse to hire them1/10			"

												After so many hours of gameplay and updates, the game behaves worse than ever. It is still full of bugs, and its performance has become terrible. When I bought it, before any dlcs were out, I could run it on ultra settings or high and have no problem with the performance, now I cannot run it even on medium settings, it misses frames, there is lagging and several other issues graphic wise. The controls behave horrible especially when you are driving a car, any car. I have a gaming laptop, it's 4 years old and needs to retire and get some rest but it still runs Skyrim, Dragon Age origin, Dragon Age II, Fallout New Vegas, Dead Island, Dead Island Riptide Risen, all 3 of Mass Effect, to name but few, it runs them as it did when it was young without problem. So instead of improving the game they made it worse. Now I see they release it again, probably with every issue fixed but they ask again money for it from their customers, us who bought this crap from the beginning. No I do not recommend to spend your hard earned money for this game. They do not respect us and they try to squeeze more money out of us.			"

												So much potential, squandered. They released the entire game in stages selling it as DLC. The simple fact that normal things like basic replayability was sold to us as DLC was absurd enough, but the hostility of their community managers towards the earlier critics of the game is what caught my interest most of all as I take a keen interest in the use of suppression tactics against gaming media who aren't part of the sycophantic love-bomb crowd. You can tell a lot about developers and companies based on the way they handle criticism. Some people, like Squad, will cyber stalk their critics and try to 'expose' them for past misdeeds (in their eyes), others will wear it and even address it and repair their game improving it's standards. In the case of State of Decay it seemed they would actively delete any criticisms they encountered which left me far more cynical of their game overall. But even with a fanboy attitude when I first discovered the game it was another 'great potential, poor execution' zombie game, sadly. :(			"

												This game was quite fun and I still find myself playing it on occasion, the bad review isn't necessarily completely the game's fault, mainly the developers. If you could care less, go buy YOSE unless you already have this version.This game itself was quite buggy on many PC configurations, though I could have recommended this game to anyone despite the bugs because the gameplay was worth it.However, the bugs and issues were fixable with some tweaks. Now, they charge for an update to the game which is a very scummy move from Undead Labs and it's becoming much more common with other developers as well.If you already own this copy of State of Decay, save yourself the headache and spend your money elsewhere because the ""Update"" is not worth it. If you really want the game but don't own it, YOSE is the only (Legal) choice now.			"

												Edit: Forget this review, the devs are releasing a newer, improved version of the game, so get that instead.Yet another zombie survival game. Oh, don't we see them so often? The answer is: Yes, HOWEVER, this game takes a new and interesting approach to the apocolypse. Nevermind finding a cure or trying to leave town to some place nice and quiet; State of Decay forces you into a world where the main focus is to fortify a home/base and to live off the surrounding, sometimes desolate buildings. Find food, feed your community members. Find materials, upgrade your base. Find oil, power your generator. Find ammo, defend yourselves from the shambling remains of what used to be your average Joe. Find and rescue other survivors, convince them to join your community. Survive as long as you could as a community. This game makes it clear you need a hand in the end of the world. Now, let's not get too off-topic - this is a review. This brings the question: So why should I get this game?    Well, although this game had a so-so port from Xbox to PC, although it has semi-frequent glitches, and although it has rather repetetive dialogue, the game makes up for this in many other aspects. I can play this for hours on end, but for the sake of my mental health, I keep each session under 4 hours. This game is great fun, and it can seriously get nerve racking at certain points, whether from the plot or from you just scavenging a town alone. There hasn't been one point in this entire game that I didn't enjoy spending time in the destroyed world that remains. After all, you don't choose the world you live in, but you choose what role you will play in said world.All being said, I highly recommend you give this game a go, and if you like it, get the DLC (but we'll leave the DLC for another review or two).

												State of Decay is the kind of zombie game I'd been hoping for; equal parts exploration and combat, with sprinkles of RPG on top. Are there flaws? Certainly. Does the game feel complete? Not in all areas, but the core concepts and ideas are so good that in the end (heh), it doesn't leave you feeling as though you got half a product.    Despite some quirks and an abysmally abrupt ending, I think State of Decay is worth your time and money, and here's why.GAMEPLAYLet's be honest here: this game, like many other games, lives and dies based on its gameplay. There are other factors that are good, but if the gameplay was bad in a game like this, it'd be looked over, maybe rightfully so. Luckily, Undead Labs has nailed almost every single facet of gameplay, from melee and ranged battles all the way to their robust progression and homestead systems. I'll break these down into small sub-sections for readability's sake.          COMBAT - RANGED           State of Decay, like many other games, features both gun-based and melee-based combat, but unlike some, doesn't miss a step with either. The ranged combat is typical TPS fare, but with much more emphasis on ammo conservation and timing your reloads carefully. There are many guns on offer, from rifles and revolvers to shotguns and grenade launchers, and they each have unique handling amongst the many varieties in each type. There are also skills you can unlock to make yourself better at certain types of guns, as well as a handy late-game skill to slow time when aiming, and you can craft and find weapon suppressors that last a certain amount of shots for when you need to headshot some zeds, but not attract dozens of others.          COMBAT - MELEE           The melee combat is satisfingly meaty, and by the end of the game I felt like there was a lot to it that I hadn't begun to master. With a handful of melee categories, and quite a few weapons in each of those, every swing you take at a shuffling corpse is different, but all of them feel meaty and, dare I say, visceral. There's some limb dismemberment, leading to situations where an undead is still coming at you with both of its arms laying on the ground behind it, but it's all about either decapitating a zombie as it stands or knocking it to the ground to finish it off with a cool animation. There are some skills that tie into the melee as well, including ones that make you excel at a certain kind of weapon, or just sweet knockdown skills, my favorite of which was a low spin-kick that all-but-guaranteed a knockdown on multiple targets, setting up sick combos as I spun and crushed my way to victories. There are durabilities on each melee weapon, unlike guns, but they're pretty abundant so you never feel helpless for long. The only downside to using melee is that it's tied into your universal stamina meter, meaning if you don't make your hits count, you'll quickly be out of breath against zombies that just won't quit.            MOVEMENT AND VEHICLES            The on-foot movement is pretty basic, but the sprinting, climbing, and vaulting over objects is all hooked to your stamina, so not only can you not sprint for long, but sprinting into a fight is a bad idea. You can eventually level up your Cardio over time, but by and large you're going to want to use vehicles for anything that's more than a slight jaunt. The good news is, there are dozens of vehicles, all with different handling and appearances, and driving them is fun as hell, probably because it's never not satisfying to throw open your door into a zombie while you're doing 50MPH across a cornfield. There are some.. curious physics when you collide with something in your car, leading to some amusing crashes where I was thrown, rolling, into the air as my car hit something and did a forwards flip, but by and large the vehicles are well-done and can really get you out of a jam, despite the fact that zombies can climb onto and tear doors off of your vehicle. When this happens, you and your passengers can be pulled out of the car by an especially overzealous zed intent on your destruction.                PROGRESSION               Progress in State of Decay is level-based by skill, and each skill levels up by repetition. Kill a bunch of zombies with a gun, your Shooting levels up. Run for miles and you'll be rewarded with a boost to Cardio. It all feels very natural, and at certain levels you'll unlock new skills to help keep you on your feet and help you put the dead back in undead. Each character levels up differently, and some of them have different traits, meaning a few characters might level up shooting quickly, but be bad at Wits, or vice versa. It's a good system, and it means you'll want to swap between characters frequently.               CHARACTERS AND DEATH                To be able to switch to a character, you need to be in Friend status with them, meaning you haven't shot them too many times/nearly ran them over/made decisions they didn't like. It's a basic system, but one that ensures you'll want to keep on everyone's good side so you can use as many characters as possible, especially since death is permanent. When a character dies, they're gone for good, leading to morale losses, but you can pick up some of the stuff they were carrying and bring it to your home base for a slight morale boost, leading me to the next subject: home.               HOMES               The place you'll be spending a lot of time in, bringing supplies to, and upgrading is up to you; there are a variety of home spots after the first main one, and where you want to set up shop is up to you. Personally, after I made my first homebase switch, I felt vaguely annoyed. I'd lost a lot of progress and had to rebuild some facilities, and by the end of the game it didn't seem to have mattered much. A watchtower is all I really needed, so someone could keep zombies from breaking in, and by the time I got that at my second house, the game had very few missions left. Nonetheless, the amount of facilities you can build is pretty good; ranging from sleeping areas to infirmaries and workshops, each one grants bonuses or crafting options, and they can help turn the tide against the undead onslaught. You'll need to find the materials for each, though, and that's a big part of my annoyance with the game, as you'll see next.             LOOT/SCAVENGING/EXPLORATION             To scavenge a shiny, white glowing container, simply walk up to it and hold a button. A small ring pops up, showing how close you are to being done with scavenging that. Holding another button means it goes faster, but is louder and has the chance to make a loud noise, attracting zombies. When it's open, you figure out which stuff is worth taking in your very limited personal inventory, see if there's any Construction Materials/Ammo/Medicine/Food containers inside, which load onto your back and make your stamina drain very fast with sprinting, and back out. You can only carry one of this kind of container at a time, but later you can radio scavengers to come pick up more. It's a fine system and the first 100 times, it's fun to see what kind of things you'll find, but by the end of the game it becomes a chore, especially since materials get scarcer and scarcer, leading you to driving all over the map in hopes of finding a stash of materials to build another upgrade to your house. The constant fetching can be annoying, which I'm about to gripe on further.  --Continued in comments-- "

												I don't recommend you buy this game, which is good because you can't.I would leave a review on the Year One Survival Edition page but I don't own the double-dip version.Negatives:-People often float everywhere and the animations are busted.-Looks like the camera lens has been coated in vaseline to hide the console quality graphics.-Combat system is all about awkward animations and clicking.I get the feeling that the developers made the game so that they would enjoy it, and not so that we would enjoy it:-There are loads of systems at play which are mega-confusing to anyone except the people who made the game or have the time to read through lengthy guides online. It doesn't help that the game doesn't pause when you're in the menus, so you can't even take your time to study them or learn what's going on. Every couple of seconds there's someone shouting over the radio or a zombie approaching - I like that they were trying to emulate the experience of the zombie apocalypse, but I'm trying to learn the damn menus and read the damn numbers and remember what I was doing last time I played. And that leads onto the next problem:-You have to download a mod to turn off the 'feature' where medical supplies/food/etc are used up in real time when you're not playing the game (the worst design decision I have ever seen). If you stop playing for a while, loads of your supplies are used up. Not because anyone in the game world did anything, but because you yourself stopped playing the game for a week. Makes no sense whatsoever.Positives:-You can't buy this.			"

												It's actually a decent game.  However, there is a game-breaking bug that can occur very late in the story that stops progression.  Lots of people have reported having this bug for about a year now, yet it's still there.  Since the game constantly auto-saves as you go, you're just hosed and have to start over.  For that reason alone, I can't recommend it.			"

												While those interested in the burgeoning zombie survival sandbox genre have no shortage of titles to partake of, those seeking a solo experience have been left with few options, particularly on the PC. Multiplayer games inspired by the Arma 2 mod, Dayz, seem to be popping up everywhere but the appreciable potential for a singleplayer game that focuses on PvE rather than PvP has on the platform gone unfulfilled. State of Decay looks to cash in on this opening, offering up a sizable chunk of game world populated by zombies, AI survivors and lots of loot-filled buildings to scour. While there are more than a few rough edges in State of Decay and a lack of the heart-stopping tension found in Dayz, there is an engrossing and enjoyable game here with a lot of things to do given the low cost of entry.The start of the game sees you fighting zombies and completing simple fetch quests for a small group of survivors garrisoned in a ranger station. You are introduced to the combat and looting mechanics, but these only garnish the more engaging aspects of the experience. Soon you find yourself entwined with a larger group of survivors holed up in a church just outside a small town. This will serve as your base throughout most of the game as you earn the trust of fellow survivors, fortify your encampment and go out in search of supplies. Ensuring the well being of this group of survivors is ultimately what keeps State of Decay moving forward, as it provides good incentive for you to engage in the gameplay tasks which without context would be fairly banal.After the opening sequence of the game, the constant flood of missions that you are informed of via radio chatter take a back seat to exploration and looting. Ensuring that your group of survivors have enough food and medical supplies will be the most pressing issue, and can be remedied by searching through houses which may contain zombies, supplies or occasionally survivors who can be convinced to join your group. You can climb tall objects and 'survey' the surrounding area, revealing locations of interest. Once inside a building, objects which contain items must be searched, and this takes several seconds to complete. Whether you try and sneak around avoiding combat with the walking undead, quietly scavenging what you need, or go in swinging to clear a house of its decrepit occupants before searching for goodies remains entirely up to you. You can radio home to request an AI survivor come out and pick up the supplies for you, but this requires clearing a location of all zombies first.If you decide to clear a location of zombies before poking around for loot, the combat is functional but uninspired. With a melee weapon you swing away until either you run out of stamina, the zombies' heads explode or your weapon breaks. If you manage to knock a zombie down you can finish it off with a brutal swing of your chosen instrument of death, but most of the challenge lies in ensuring you don't get surrounded or backed into a corner. Firearms are straightforward and satisfying to use, although ammunition isn't readily available and firing a unsilenced weapon will attract nearby zombies, meaning they are best used only when the situation gets out of hand. Sneaking around zombies is a viable method, particularly when dealing with larger groups, and can be accomplished by takedowns from behind, distracting zombies with objects or using firearms with home-made silencers that only last for a set number of shots.The zombies themselves shamble around convincingly enough, at least until they get stuck in the terrain which happens all too frequently. The undead will hop through windows, climb fences and grab you from behind as they endeavor to end your life. Special zombie types eventually start showing up, which range from the bullet-proof SWAT zombies to ones that explode in a cloud of poisonous gas when killed to hulking beasts that charge like bulls and sponge up a lot of firepower before going down.If you do get killed, which happens very infrequently, rather than reverting to an old save you will start playing as another survivor in your group. It is in your best interest to keep survivors alive for as long as possible since you gradually gain passive improvements to a character over time, such as improved stamina, melee damage and increased health. If you are out and about with one character for too long, their maximum stamina will be decreased until they go back to the base and rest. When you do this, you will take control of a different survivor, meaning you will end up playing as many different characters throughout the game.While the explorable area in State of Decay isn't huge, you can enter and drive vehicles left lying around which are all conveniently unlocked with keys in the ignition. Driving a car feels responsive and light almost to a fault; if you crash into an object at speed your vehicle will go flying in some pretty crazy ways. Running over zombies is a very effective way of killing them, although cars will become damaged in the process. Zombie hordes roam the streets, and running into them at full speed will be as damaging to your vehicle as it will be to the shambling flesh-eaters.The amount of time you spend on State of Decay is linked directly to how invested you become in the well-being of your survivor group as well as your tolerance for repetition given there is no real end to the game but the random objectives start repeating. It takes a good amount of time and scavenging to fully upgrade your survivor camp with an infirmary, vehicle-repair station and watchtowers among other fortifications, but if you don't buy into the well being of your AI dependants you will struggle to care enough to go through the trouble of collecting all the required materials.If you have been looking for a zombie-themed survival sandbox but don't want to contend with bandits and hackers in online games, State of Decay will scratch that itch. The lack of tension in exploration is vindicated by fairly complex mechanics surrounding the well-being of a group of survivors you must watch over. State of Decay succeeds in its ambitions and despite some rough edges provides a compelling open world experience.Recommended "

												State of Decay is the open-world third person apocalyptic survival game that I have waited for this whole generation, Day Z and Dead Island were close for me but they both lacked a few things here and there. While DayZ had survival, Dead Island had the world and mechanics, State of Decay have both of these aspects, and pull them off very successfully.You quickly realize that the game push a lot of information at you the first few hours, like every home base can only have so many structures, do you want more sleeping areas to keep the characters in the camp rested? Or maybe you want a library to research some better medical aid for when someone get hurt? From this point on the game becomes very dark, it will test your moral. And rightfully so.Every now and then you stumble across new survivors, complete strangers in need of help. What are you going to do? Do you help them and risk running out of food? Or do you save them in hope of finding a few food supplies?This also takes us back to the base aspect, you could build a garden instead of a library or sleeping area, as this will give you food daily. Because food each day must be good right? Yes, it is, but if you don't have enough beds for everyone, each character will slow but sure get tired, fatigued. This goes for your playable characters as well as NPCs in the camp.If a player character don't rest after a while of exploring, the stamina will decrease, making you worse in combat and increase the chance of dying. Death is permanent, and there is no save/reload feature to abuse. The game autosaves after each finished mission, and that is it.The less playable characters you have available, the harder the game gets, because you have less to pick from when the others need a few hours in the bed to rest.Keeping a character alive and well will not only serve as a jump option, but they also gain skills and level up depending on what they do. Melee combat? Increase the fighting skill, making you more efficient with melee weapons. Same goes for guns, looting etc.However should you be unlucky and die, the items you got on you can be retrieved with another character, so don't panic!You will meet tough situations where people you know get infected, and we all know how to ""fix"" that problem. It can be a hard call, depending on the connection with each individual character, the NPC can get overrun while on a supply run you called in, and if you don't help them, may they RIP.The game consistently keeps throwing missions/tasks at you, you have to prioritize, which is more important? Save this guy? Or scout this area to call out locations of meds, zeds or maybe you want to find out what the Army is up to.The story is also pretty well put together, i keeps you interested, and makes you feel connected with the characters living in the world, making you feel the need to help (most) of them. Helping other survivor outposts will also benefit resources like ammunition, food, construction material etc. But how you play in the world also affect how everyone in the world watch you, reckless driving is negative and will make everyone look at you in a bad way, same goes for reckless shooting. But in the end, it's all about survival, keeping morale up, food on the table and killing the zeds!			"

												State of Decay is you playing as a member of the community and working together to survive.PROS- Tiredness if you play a character for too long- You have to scavage for supplies- Controller support works very well- Side missions will keep you busy- Vehicles don't last forever- Special infected are well made- DLC's are nice and breakdown has decent Replayability- It's a zombie survival game- Items have durability- Building up your safehouseCONS- They cancelled plans for co-op- Can't make your own character- The game is fairly easy but breakdown is your ""difficulty setting""- Alot of empty space in the world- Story is medicoreOverallState Of Decay is a game you can enjoy if you enjoy survival games, you will build up your community and keep stockpiling your supplies which will keep your community together and alive. I can't say that I was happy after hearing them saying that they weren't going to add co-op to this game which would of increased the replayability even more. But this is a great zombie survival and really well made. "

												Want to get ♥♥♥♥ed by your purchase? Buy State of Decay today! This game is seriously buggy as ♥♥♥♥ and people report them up the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥but what do the developers do? GG EVERYBODY WE TOOK YOUR MONEY! I attempted to get a steam refund because of a glitch where literally I couldn't advance story and all that happened was my camera panned around the sergeants head. I attempted to fix this by removing all files and doing a fresh install and it didn't fix. I was denied my refund because ""I played the game 4 hours"" When in actuality I played the game about 1 hour, and spent 3 hours trying to debug something because I WANTED A FUN GAME. Okay I lied it was probably about 1 hour 15. While the additional hour was spent waiting to see if maybe something would load around the sergeants game and the remaining time was spent doing a brand new save file seeing if maybe I had just a corrupted save. So in the end ♥♥♥♥ YOU STATE OF DECAY. They ♥♥♥♥ing push out a ""year one addition"" and advertise it on Steam I wouldn't buy it. If it fixed all the bugs then ♥♥♥♥ing let everybody who bought your first attempt get it for free? NO YOU WANT $20.. yeah you know what you can take the $20 I spent on your game, buy a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and shove it up your♥♥♥♥♥you piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥game developers.			"

												Like everyone else, Good game ruined by greedy shady devs, Asking full price for a ""remastered patched"" version of the game and leaving us with this... will never buy from this company or a sister company of theirs. Be careful folks look into developer history in the future to make sure they are not just renaming themselves. A great example would be WarZ ... we can never forget that nightmare. Just Torrent it as a F-U to the greedy devs... they want to be greedy so can we. I have not torrented a game in a LONG LONG time but i would gladly make an exception for these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.			"

												Liked the concept and followed this game from the beginning, but wanted to wait while most of the technical issues will be fixed. Now Undead labs no longer support the game and offer me to pay them a second time for patched version.A blatant money grab if there ever was one. No person with any self respect or sense of justice will buy anything touched buy Undead labs ever again.			"

												Small price tag for a game that will yield a far-above average amount of hours even without DLC.An all-original free-form survival game that focuses on the growth of a group rather than the goals of a single person.Where do I start - base building, a large open world map, character traits, firearms, epic combat, etc.State of decay is an open-world, 3rd person, survival, group-management game that will definitely leave a mark on your ability to enjoy any other game that resembles it.The player progresses through the game by managing their group and their base. Keeping your group up to date with supplies, keeping your survivors from going insane, and keeping things mellow, are some of the tasks the player upholds when they first start their game. The player does not play as a single character, or a 'god' that overwatches the community, but rather the community itself. The base concept is that you gain enough trust with a person to befriend them, at which point you can switch back and forth between the characters you have befriended to take advantage of everybody in your friendgroup. There is no single main character, although the player can choose to concentrate on a single person. The twist here is that when characters die, they are dead forever, and won't come back. When playing the game, the player upholds a third person perspective with whatever person they are playing as. You can loot and scavenge, clear areas, set up outposts, scout out areas to add icons to your map, and much, much more.This game is one of those games that will leave you in doubt considering how much content it actually has versus how much you would think it didn't from a distance. There is so much going on in this game it is easy to miss the minor features here and there. From a distance, one may think it is just a third person combat-based shooter. But if they put any more than an hour into the game, and actually saw what the game had to offer, you would rethink your entire perspective in a single matter of visiting the base management screen.What I'm trying to get at is that the game does not start strong with the story mode. The game gives you the illusion that you are playing a game where you just follow a line of missions where you just go from mission to mission until eventually beating the game. Until you reach the church (The base and group the story mode gives you to start), it will seem like that. The game does not provide convinient tutorial on the game's content, leaving it up to the player to realize that they aren't playing a linear game maybe 3 hours since they started.There is a 'random bank' of survivors to ensure that the player will not end up with the same people every time (unless they are counting the story characters from story mode), there is no set spots for certain items to spawn, and every game playthrough you go through will be noteably different. The game generates missions based on what is needed or if the player hasn't tended to a growing problem. If you leave a guy to wallow in his anger for a long time, he will be at risk of snapping, giving the player the option to try to talk them down from their bad mood, or ask them to leave, as an example of this. Other survivors you aren't playing as can ask you for help, or you can even ask them for help as well.The game does not use money currency or anything like that, you use your influence in the group to make descisions and take things. This also means that you definitely do not start in the decision-making ranks, meaning that you will have to play it for a little bit before you gain the trust needed to make the big move to the bigger compound, stop that zed hunt, etc. Influence can be gained for sticking around for a while and doing a lot of influence-gaining tasks. Be involved with your group, and your group will be involved with you. It's not a game where you can screw around and hope your bros will survive.That's the one bad thing - you can't really screw around when driving that car off a cliff will destroy it permanently or the fact that ammo is really rare. It depends on what your motives for playing are.While I recommend this game, I must warn you that it requires time and goes off of a real-time simulation. Survivors will gather little supplies daily, or you might get lucky, but there is daily rates of consumption of each material depending on what your setup is. Maintenance may be required, but usually your group will make it. It's nothing you can't handle.Get this game if you have the time. If you are looking for something combat-based that you can play in an hour and not have to worry about anything, go play something else.			"

												State of Decay is a GTA-esque zombie survival game.  You play as a group of survivors who must search for supplies and safe-houses while the main storyline unfolds.  Even though it’s another zombie game, this one does a whole lot of things right.  The story is almost generic but game play is quite enjoyable and after a while you really care for your crew.  It is devastating to lose a character after working so hard to level up his/her skills.  And dead means dead people.  No going back to reload saves here.There are several RPG elements, not only for your characters but for upgrading your base as well.  The game also added a touch of realism by having people get tired which temporarily gives them a greater and greater stamina penalty until they rest.The above being said, the game does have a large number of bugs still present, from clipping, to map glitches, to even crashing every now and then.  Also, this game BEGS to be co-op.  It would have been fantastic to go out and scavenge supplies and run over zombies with friends.  Sadly, the devs have stated that it would take too much to add co-op to the game at this point.  Huge missed opportunity there. Issues and all, there is no buyer’s remorse.  I still had (And currently am having) a ton of fun playing this game.  And that’s the important part! "

												So appearently, two years after the release of this buggy heaping mess, they decided to re-release the same game with an appearent ""Remastering"" to make it seem like a completely new and exciting game.The first game, this game, was buggy as hell, hard to run, unfun, and just generally a snooze-fest.The updated re-release, while seeming and/or promising to fix this, ends up having not fixed any of the bugs that made the first game such a train wreck.Not only that, but it appears they also did not fix anything.So, basically, this is a real-life simulation of if the WarZ dev team actually came up with something good, and did what they did what with the changing of the name and the lack of any other changes, before reuploading it. However in this case, the initial junk pile was never taken down, leading to two versions which, if you compare side-by-side, show that they hadn't changed anythingEven with the updates I never bothered to buy, I can't imagine that it would magically become a better game, or one that is good to play.

												Not the finest or the most polished game there is, but it managed to introduce a fresh spin to the open-world undead genre, with its permadeath elements and well-developed character/home base enhancements. Though side missions can be tedious, you're not obligated to them, and managing your base and the survivors in it can always be a blast.Combat's relatively well-made, keeping the tension up as you maneuver through the hordes hoping not to lose your best character - the undead never ceases, after all, so it's either that you focus on the job and get creative, or get efficient, or get killed.

Unfortunately the developers decided to drop support and instead release the exact same game with a minor patch and graphical update as a ""remastered edition"" that costs $30.State of Decay decayed way too soon.

												State of Decay certainly doesn't waste any time. Mere seconds past the Start screen, it throws you headlong into a zombie apocalypse in full bloom. Tree branch in hand, you clobber the shambling corpses attempting to munch on your screaming camping buddy, and then seek out the few remaining survivors while scrounging for supplies, weapons, and ever-safer home bases. That's just the first 20 minutes, but the core of State of Decay's gameplay never changes as you make your way through its open world and battle an endless cast of zombies. State of Decay finds its soul in the dreary repetition of apocalyptic survival.State of Decay's open world manages a substantial degree of immersion, complete with an expansive and occasionally intimidating map and the ability to drive cars freely across the landscape. The cars handle poorly, but the ability to use them to mow down roving zombie swarms offers a malicious satisfaction. You quickly learn to fight zombies only if you absolutely have to in State of Decay, and therein lies much of its appeal. This is not a game about Bruce Campbell badassing about in Evil Dead; it's a celebration of the normal person and all of his or her associated weaknesses. Some of the characters you come across have no combat experience at all.Death is permanent in State of Decay, which means that even characters with fully voiced storylines and unique dialogue die forever if you let them get overrun. From there, you can only continue through the eyes of another character you've befriended.Few things add more tension to State of Decay than the terrifying noise guns make, because a single foolish shot can bring an unmanageable horde upon you.Permanent death is a smart addition, though, since losing characters with high skills across the board carries with it a real sense of loss, particularly if their voice quests and customized responses in some quests led you to believe they were an essential character. Sometimes they don't even have to die in the field; if a character you've been controlling sustains enough injuries--a few undead chomps don't result in instant zombification in State of Decay--he'll lie bedridden and useless at your home base. The good news is that the need to rest and switch out characters results in you amassing a balanced group of playable characters anyway.It's a bit strange that a game that places such a heavy emphasis on interpersonal relationships should have no cooperative mode. You spend your time with State of Decay alone, joining up with other NPCs only for specialized quests and escort missions that bring other survivors back to your current base camp. It's especially odd since State of Decay starts out with a party of two, suggesting that you'll always have a buddy at your side if need be.State of Decay serves up a near constant barrage of suspense and immersion that leaves even the briefest jaunts away from your home base tinged with the threat of death. Its flaws are numerous and impossible to ignore, but in spite of them, State of Decay is a captivating survival adventure set in a bleak and harrowing world.			"

UPD: Added a paragraph about the Lifeline DLC below.Don't you just hate it when you return from a relaxing fishing trip at the lake and find out that both your wife and mother-in-law turned into vicious man-hating psychopaths? Oh wait.As you have probably already guessed, this is a cross-species relationship simulator where you spend roughly about twenty hours of game time bashing your former loved ones and neighbors in the teeth with a rusty pipe wrench. Over and over again. Oh, and don't forget to rob their house while you're at it! That's it. That's the entire game. Honest.In all seriousness, this is by far the best open-world zombie survival simulator around, on a par with Project Zomboid, but let me be (for real this time) honest there for a moment. It gets repetitive. It offers nothing new to the zombie apocalypse genre, story wise. It's full of (albeit, hilarious) geometry glitches. But then again, so is Skyrim! Yet it's a great game. So what's so special about SoD, anyways? Well, for one, how about tossing a creepy♥♥♥♥♥talking doll into the midst of a zombie horde to keep them entertained while you rummage through somebody's underwear in search for an aspirin? B*tches love talking dolls. Still not enough? Fine.SoD, much like The Walking Dead, has a great deal of realism added to it. Resources you scavenge, for once, play a huge role in the game and your characters aren't unstoppable killing machines - if they die, they die permanently. SoD has quite a heavy emphasis on strategic micromanagement, instead of being just another run-n-gun. Finding a suitable home base, upgrading its facilities, going on exhausting day-to-day scavenging runs, and keeping morale up is essential, and what makes the game incredibly fun. The story... Well, it's there. Alongside with everyone's favorite Plucky Comic Relief trope (Barry Wheeler? Joe Barbaro? Yeah.). But anyways.Looking for a highly immersive zombie apocalypse experience? Look no further. Just one word of caution, it's highly addictive. And if you're a true masochist, try out the Breakdown DLC, which ramps up the difficulty and removes the story altogether, focusing solely on the survival aspect. Just don't forget to tell your mommy you won't be coming for dinner.Too busy trying not to become one, amirite. She'll understand.P.S. For those still having doubts, Lifeline DLC is a super nice (and surprisingly cheap!) addition, since it FINALLY features a whole new map for you to explore: I'll go so far as to say that it's worth buying just for the map alone, and if you get it on sale then it's just a steal. My only complaint is that you don't have a lot of freedom during the story since you're on the clock pretty much 24/7. But I guess that comes with being in the military, eh?			"

												Fantastic game, by far my favorite zombe/sandbox/survival game. Takes some getting used to the menus and features, but is well worth taking the time and effort. A few features are annoying, like the frequency of random events and requests bogging down the ability to just explore and enjoy (it seems the developers are more used to creating quest-driven games and aren't too comfortable with open worlds), and there are some bugs that the dev team seems uninterested in addressing. But the game is otherwise so fine I'm willing to put up with these.So why not recommended? Because this is sadly a classic case of a company taking horrid, blatant advantage of their supporters. I bought the game in early access PC port mode, and what do us loyal fans get in return? Refusals to fix bugs, DLC that adds very little and refuses to fix bugs, and then a massive re-release that is just a slight visual upgrade that yet again refuses to address bugs and - big surprise - early access peeps don't get access to.Newsflash, video game developers: Giving someone early access is an implicit contract that (1) you will actually finish the game, and (2) your early supporters are supplied with upgraded versions as the game further develops.Undead Labs has clearly decided to abandon their project and just soak up whatever money they can from the suckers. It is painfully obvious they had no intention to actually finish the game once the money started rolling in. They - and especially founder Jeff Stray - are dead to me. I will henceforth blacklist any game they put out (assuming the unlikely outcome that they produce any more), as well as any Xbox port to PC, and anything Jeff Stray or other leaders of this offensive scam ever attemt to do in the future. Pathetic.			"

This review is based on playing the game with all DLC:Quite frankly one of the best zombie survival games I've played in an extremely long time. While it suffers from some bizzare design choices, it still as a whole presents a zombie survival simulator that isn't just about bashing zombie's brains in.The base game:The base game with no DLC is a solid experience. It starts you off in a tutorial area to teach you the basics of the game, killing zombies. When it comes to interaction with zombies you have three choices. Fight, run, or sneak by. Fighting is pretty good in the game but it kinda suffers from dependancy on weapons. The game does have abilities for the survivors to use their own physical skills like punching and kicking to take out zombies, but they don't do much damage. You're basically forced to use a weapon, whether it be a melee weapon or a gun. But since finding a weapon is extremely easy, that's not necessarily a bad thing. Using guns also is a great experience. Each weapon feels distinctive and while some are weak like low caliber pistols, others make you feel like Rick Grimes from The Walking Dead. Guns also adhear to a noise system. If you fire a gun, you attract zombies from far and wide. However guns are extremely powerful against the special zombies in the game so the balance of when to and when not to use a gun is a constant concern. As said before, there are special zombies in the game. If you've played Left 4 Dead you probably know what to expect. The tank, the attracter, the predator, and the stunner. There are other special types, but they're basically just regular zombies that can't be killed by guns. And while it's starting to get annoying for zombie games to always have special zombie types, at least in State of Decay they're more rarer than in other games.Next is my most favorite part of the game, base and resource management. In the game, just like in real life, there's a constant need for materials. Whether it be food or construction materials or ammo, your community needs supplies in order to stay alive. If you don't keep up with the demand, your base will fall. There's no work around, you have to scavenge houses and buisnesses to find supplies. When you do find supply crates you have two options, you can carry the crate in a pack on your back and take it back to base for upkeep in your base or you can break it open and put whatever's inside into storage at base. You don't get upkeep on your base but you get what's inside, be it ammo or food or whatever it may have.Finally there's the story. The game takes place at the near beginning of the zombie apocalypse. You and your friends have to work together to survive as long as you can while trying to figure out a way out of the valley you're trapped in. Along the way you meet other survivors. Some you can recruit into your community to help you while others have their own thing going that you can be friends with, or enemies. Doing most of the side missions involving the other communities are optional but if you help them, they'll help you with all sorts of abilites. One for example can drop motars on a group of zombies while another can deliever a car wherever you need. The main storyline is also very well made with an end game challenge that actually made me want to rage quit, something that rarely happens anymore with games getting easier. The ending also is extremely great considering what's on the horizon for the developer that made the game, Undead Labs. I won't spoil it for you but let's just say if you love the game and want more when the sequel comes out, it may be worth it to get an Xbox ONE, assuming of course Microsoft keeps it's word and makes the sequel Xbox exclusive.Now for those bizzare design choices I mentioned. As I said before, base management is my favorite part of the game. But unfortunately the tutorial is a little lack luster and sometimes confusing. It sometimes explains too much in some areas without explaining enough in others. What's the benefit of having construction A in the base over construction B? Also the choice of allowing the safe zone to become so big through the establishment of outposts is kinda weird to me. Don't get me wrong, not having to worry about my base while I'm across the map is great, but it kinda takes away the fear of being overrun in a setting that's absolutely perfect for that kind of fear.  All in all, it's still worth buying just for the base game alone. Especially when it's on sale and even more especially if you decide to use some mods for the game.Breakdown DLC:This DLC alone is worth buying the game. It's basically the base game except there's no time constrictons and you're free to do whatever you want. The challenge is unlocking all the playable characters through certain actions. In the first playthrough you have to say, kill 5 special zombies to unlock a character. Overtime you'll unlock all the characters you can in that playthough and be allowed to move up to the next. In level 2, zombies are harder to kill and there's more special infected. But there's more challenges, unlocking better survivors. The constant challenge of an increasingly harder game is alone worth playing while unlocking the better newer characters is just a great cherry on top. While some have criticize the DLC for not doing much in terms of changing the game, I say it's perfect for those that want a long term challenge.Lifeline DLC:This DLC quite frankly will test everything you learned from the other parts of the game. This time it's an entirely new campaign you'll be playing. No old characters are rehashed and you even play in a new map. Quite possibly the worst case scenario map to play in a game like this, an urban city. Zombies are EVERYWHERE! Sneaking is now not just an option, it's a necessity in this densily populated area. The campaign is also surperb in delivery based on what characters you play as and the base building and maintaining is still my most favorite part. But the biggest challenge is, again the population of the map. Firing weapons is just a big no no on this map as every zombie within a mile is gonna hear it, even though ironically you start off with all the guns and ammo you could ask for. If you're looking for the ultimate challenge in urban zombie survival, this is the DLC for you. Just don't be surprised if you find yourself yelling in terror about all the zombies running at you.

												This game is awesome for Zombie Survival fans, it has lots of characters, missions, and of course boarding windows.  For regular gamers this game will get real boring, real fast.  Its all a series of fetch quests, then again that is what survival is, get food, building supplies and other stuff to keep your survivors alive.  This game has permadeath where once a survivor dies their gone for good.  Also the game plays itself or something when its turned off or if the player stops playing the game keeps playing itself.  While the developer on their forums wrote up this long post about how its impossible to remove, ignore the dev, and just download a mod because there are tons that disable the game from playing itself.  The game is very unique, and its a HUGE world.  There is alot of dialog in this game, its pretty impressive really.  Finally a zombie game that is PVE, not that PVP crap like other games which is just any FPS deathmatch game with zombies.  This is a game based on survival.  There are some flaws in this game.  For example if you loot a house of stuff or search it, the house can never be searched again.  But if you kill the zombies those in that house, those will come back again and again.  So its kind of out of balance that way, even the cars wont respawn.Regular People:  1/10  Value:  $4.99Zombie Fans:  7/10   Value:  $9.99			"

												This game has finally everything I had hoped for in a zombie game - especially regarding the survival aspect of it.The thing most people tend to forget about zombies and zombie stories is that the zombies are not the main threat, not the main reason the outbreak is so hard to survive. This game gets it right: The main problem is gathering supplies and keeping a group together, you have to be able to rely on your teammates and hope you have enough space to carry the loot to your hub so you can upgrade it defend it against zombie hordes marching your way.I also love the aspect of finding new survivors and them helping you out - or abuse your medical stash.All in all, State of Decay just gets the Zombie Apocalypse right.

												State of Decay.Now with its two DLCs Breakdown and Lifeline (at the time of this review's writing. Idk if they intend to release more dlcs)The base game is a fun, gritty experience at a post apocalyptic world where zombies overrun the world and you control survivors and try to tough it out and survive. Your decisions have weight and consequences, whether you choose to handle a situation as soon as you get into it or delay your decision, there are consequences that will affect your game in ways that amaze me. Though i really dislike the fact that the zombies themselves can run, there are mods for that. Sure the unmodded experience is fun too but i feel like mods tend to enhance gameplay. I myself installed several, mostly ones that make the zombie population a lot more dense and force them to shamble and walk towards you.Adds a lot of tension as you try to mow down zombies with a table leg you just found in a house you were scavenging. Every hit exhausts you, you run and hope they don't catch up. You panic as you keep running to avoid your death at the hands of the zeds.You get back to your home base, you build more improvements and go over your plans to hit the next few houses for supplies and maybe even radio other survivors. And for a moment, you feel safe and sound. Until a siege comes along.What i think that this game does best is make the player emotionally invest in the characters.You grow attached to a certain survivor and you want to see him/her make it out. You grow attached to some survivors and you do everything you can so that they survive. When i had to put down a few survivors because they were infected, that really hit me hard in the feels.and i was pretty bummed when my chosen survivor got torn in half by a horde during a scavenging mission gone terribly wrong. Good job Undead Labs. Though after my main survivor died, i kinda didn't touch the game again.:<			"

This one gives you far more options and keeping your eyes peeled out to the end of every game sessionI don't write reviews a lot but for this one i took some time because State of decay earned my respect.If you like adventure games and like to discover open world with lots of features then this one is something for you.I bought this game on sale but its worth your monye when its even not on sale.Sorr for my bad English			"

Now they have rereleased the game with some fixes, but they have decided those of us who SUPPORTED THESE WORTHLESS♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥FROM THE START should pay them more money for the same game with those fixes mentioned previously. This game was OK when it first hit, but NOT a justification for them to rip us all off the way they are.*FUN FACT* Dying Light did a rerelease of their game and gave the game for FREE to all the people who had bought the previous version, as opposed to what undead labs did with this game.

												This game mixes part zombie horror/survival with some city building and people management. The game starts with you taking control of a couple guys coming back from a remote fishing trip to find out that the area they are in is now in the middle of a zombie outbreak. You meet up with other survivors and try to get enough supplies and weapons to survive long enough to..... well I'm not sure to what end cause I'm pretty sure I screwed up somehow and wasn't sure what happened but I got to the end game screen.I recommend this game because it was fun to play. I've played it on both Console and PC and both times the game was enjoyable. That being said there was some design decisions that made sense for the game I guess, but just didn't sit well with me. Slight SPOILERS ahead I guess.The game is constantly forcing you to do things, there is never seems to be a break. There is always someone in trouble getting supplies, or someone missing or someone who wants to take out a zombie infestation. While you are doing those misssions there are also story missions that are happening and this game doesn't care what else you are doing, if you don't show up for that story mission someone is gonna die and that part of the storyline is gone. The problem with all these side/main quests happening ALL the time is it doesn't just let you explore the game. The map is a pretty decent size with some neat areas to find and explore. The problem is that you don't want to be on the northwest corner of the map when a story mission suddenly pops up on the southeast corner. Maybe I just failed at seeing the options to tell the people in my little fortification to just sit there and don't leave but it was annoying to have these quests pop up all the time. Made the game probably a little more of a realistic zombie game but from a guy who likes exploring, the way these side quests worked just didn't work for me.I did really enjoy the way the inventory worked in this game, it was really well done. You can get different sizes of backpack, though you'll pretty well get the biggest size pretty quickly and that is usually enough to get the job done. You also get the trunk of the vehilce that you're driving (if you use a vehicle to get around). In addition you can carry one bag of supplies (again the trunk of the vehicle can store multiple bags). Anything that you find can be stored into the community inventory which gives you influence points (instead of using money), so you can trade things you find for other things in the community inventory(either things that were there originally or things that other survivors have made). Finishing various side quests or main quests will also give you points to get additional items out of the inventory. If you get the big bag and use the vehicles trunks/box efficiently you'll have enough points for pretty well anything you'll ever need.The Zombies were pretty standard zombies, they moved at about the same pace as your characters but could be out run with sprinting, however you can only sprint for a limited amount of time. There are also several different types of zombies in addition to the average ones ranging from super large/strong to super fast/aggresive and more. But none of them felt over powering or cheesy in some way. The fit the game really well. As well they reacted decently to your actions for the most part. Driving, sprinting or shooting would all draw in zombies from surrounding areas, pretty standard zombie logic.You can play as a variety of characters from your base and level each one of them up. Each character is not exactly unique, they have some individual traits but are pretty interchangable. The amount of playable characters is decent as each of your characters may become tired/hungry/sick if they've done a lot of exploring or fighting and adds a bit of realisim to the game. You can either choose to use items to recharge them or switch out characters to let them rest. Only problem again with this is relating back to the questing point. One of the characters you use might decide to go off questing while you are playing as another character and then they won't recharge as well.The one thing I found lacking is that the story is pretty forgetable. There are some choices in there that will affect your game and the story but for the most part it's pretty standard zombie game. Survive for a while and then get the heck out of there.Controls are decent enough, Camera can be a little stupid at times but for the most part never really bothered me.			"

												State of Decay is a sandbox zombie game done right. Managing your survivors, gathering supplies, avoiding death and infection, doing missions to get to the bottom of what is going on - all are handled very well. This is especially worth checking out if you are very into The Walking Dead. The port from consoles is not perfect by any means, but continues to be worked on.The only complaint I have is the degree to which the game 'plays itself' when you aren't playing - constantly draining your supplies, having survivors go out on their own and getting wounded or sick, etc. You need to be able to give a lot of time to the game and play it daily. It would be nice if this could be switched off as an option (even if it gets classed as 'easy' mode).I checked the game out as part of my first impressions series and you can see more of the game to help you decide if it is for you by watching it here:

You dig about Steam community for help, NONE. Go to the Undead Lab forum, the admin there act like they are trying to help, but nothing they ever do helps solve the problem. As you can see with a quick Google search, its been years since the problem occur and there's still not patch or proper forum post for a fix to the problem. Everything, ""We will PM you about it""The game is fun but the bugs and crashes is too much to deal with and honestly, it doesn't feel like the developers give a damn after you pay them for the game.

												State of Decay is a fairly fun game, based on a mix of third person action, micromanagement, gathering quests and a great amount of repetitions, both visual (there is just a small textures and buildings core, the rest is a copy of it) and situational (there are like 3 or 4 different types of side quests, popping up a dozen every hour).All in all, I appreciated the ride for the most part, got bored every now and then doing always the same couple of things over and over again, kinda hated the performance issues (60 to 15 framerate drops during loadings are a tad too annoying while driving) and got absurdly underwhelmed by the ending (likely the worst thing of the entire game, and not because it's bad, but it's just so useless and badly realized that they could just have cut it out and settled for an infinite survival sim).It's clear Undead Labs were aiming extremely high, and I think it's also clear it was too high for them to actually pull off.

												If anyone remembers the incomplete indie zombie survival game, Fort Zombie, State of Decay can be said to pretty much be its spiritual successor, and quite a successor it is. Its awesome! Like any game though, it has its ups and downs.- The game captures some incredible survival atmosphere. Scavenging to survive and keeping quiet while doing so is the key to gathering massive tons of precious loot. Such loot is not infinite, even if seemingly abundunt in the beginning, albiet difficult to get to sometimes with so many zombies on the prowl. The game tries to make it difficult but its quite easily beat once you learn the controls and how you manage your play. The minimap also makes it a little easier to spot zombies before they come for you.- Sound is your greatest enemy. The louder the sound, the more zombies you'll attract, and its almost impossible to come out of a running horde's charge unscathed (unless you're willing to waste precious ammo, or are smart enough to lure them into the radius of an outpost). This mechanic makes it that more fun and challenging to play around with, since almost everything you do will produce some kind of sound. That being said, its a good idea to be smart and patient. Sometimes, its better to walk than to drive a car, and better to melee than shooting a gun.- Guns are somehow easily obtainable from midgame onwards, although many dont account to anything unless you make headshots count. Missing or shooting without a silencer is almost a sure fire way of getting yourself swarmed. Two words that describe the ultimate in the late game finale: grenade launcher!- Every survivor is unique. Nobody looks the same as the other. Their initial skills and specialities also vary greatly, with some colourful extra skills to give that survivor their own unique flavour. You can switch to almost ANYBODY you pick up, as long as you take the time to earn their trust through missions and good deeds first. A number of the voiceovers for survivors are recycled, though, unless if its a major NPC with special dialogue. My other gripe is that its impossible to trade between characters. Stuff can only be traded through the stash and character switching.- Death is horrifyingly gruesome. When your health bar depletes, you go into a kind of button mashing recovery mode with all these zombies ripping at you. When you recover, your max health is reduced. Go down again and it will keep decreasing as they keep hitting you. When it reaches zero, your hapless survivor literally gets torn apart. Once you see it (for the achievement), you probably wont want to see it again. Its also a waste of a very precious resource. Your survivors are the ones that get things done, and losing them will make it a lot more difficult to play. Unlike loot, getting survivors to join you can also be quite difficult after a certain point. You'll also have to think about the amount of living space and food supply you have in your base. If you dont have enough, it will cause people to leave.- Missions can be repetitive, but its always fun to work out how to best tackle a situation without using too many meds or foods to boost health or stamina, or whether to stealth it or charge it. When you swing a melee weapon or perform executions on zombies, you use some stamina, which can quickly deplete if you're swarmed. No stamina almost always means a quick death if without food. Seriously. You wont even be able run away.- Although its already in a final build, there are still issues with clipping. Zombies and survivors get stuck in walls and in the ground. They wont be stuck for long, at least from what I have experianced. So far, its mostly tolerable.- After finishing the main storyline, you can purchase the DLC for a kind of endless sandbox game. The objective is to survive as long as possible. Moving bases will increase the difficulty, though Im not sure how. Im on the verge of completing the main campaign at this moment, and will be down for one of these soonish.Overall, I will give this game an 8/10. As far as single player zombie survival games go, I would think that this is what a proper one should look and play like. It would be interesting, however, to see how a game like this could fare as a multiplayer game. I would think that a number of player controlled communities, each competing for scavenged loot in an area, could make things even more interesting.			"

												In this game, you assume the role of an entire community where survivors of the apocalypse literally put their lives in your hands. This game gives you the choice between good and evil, and shows someone's true colors... when they play the game seriously.TL;DRI highly recommend this game. There's so many little details that you miss on you first dozen play through that when you see it you go ""Why didn't i notice that before?"". This game is aggravating. This game makes you feel like you are actually immersed into this world, and it's quite terrifying.Pros+Non Linear StorylineThis games storyline (For Base game and Lifeline- Breakdown does not have a storyline at all) is very unique, and you can fail missions to continue the story as well.+Every playthough is differentI have yet to find get the same playthough in my 40+ hours on steam.+You control a communityUnlike other zombie games, this one is more focused on the community aspect instead of a ""Lone Survivor"" type game.+Perma deathIf you lose a character, they are gone. (Until you start a new game)+You don't have to do every missionThere are consequences to not doing certain missions, but the choice is entirely yours.+Great communityI've been a member of Undead Labs' forums for a few years now, and it's one of my favorite places to be.Cons-Has it's slow pointsIf you don't know what you are doing, or have scavenged most of the map, there seems to be nothing to do.-Minor bugsThere's a few bugs that haven't been squashed due to the game's engine, like the erect truck glitch, where it literally stands your car straight up if you put it too close to specific objects.-Single player onlyWhile this game doesn't have multiplayer, it's still a great game, but later State of Decay titles will hopefully have multiplayer.Rating9.5/10This is by far one of the best single player zombie games you'll find out there.

												Of the 130+ games in my Steam library, many of which I will never play the whole way through, this is the only game I actually regret spending money on.  The game lured me in with its promising use of survival mechanics (which may even be well done), but I simply cannot play because the graphics give me a splitting headache after the first 10 minutes of play.  Over-saturated colors with ridiculously high contrast turn everything into a colorful blur, and the game has almost zero configuration options.Add this to the fact that they are re-releasing the game with major patches and bug-fixes, and charging full price for another game rather than fixing what people already paid for?

One dev even told me that in the future they would stomp out all the bugs, which got me excited and helped me gain a lot of respect for their communication and dedication.So, are the bugs in this fixed? Nope. Now you have to buy the game again in order to get the fixes. WTF? I already bought it and waited patiently for the game I have to be fixed but now it will never happen? This is a low blow.

												I'd heard good things about this, and it surpassed my expectations to become my favourite new game in months. It's very close to what I always imagined the ideal zombie apocalypse survival game to be. And it's not just combat, combat, combat, this game makes you feel hunted and the moments of dramatic tension that arise naturally as you're sneaking around are great.There's an excellent balance between realism and action, a rich setting packed full of references and amusing little details, and clever use of noise as a gameplay element (loud noises can attract zombies from all over, which is often a risk, but also gives rise to tactics like the use of noise to lure or distract enemies). I also liked the combination of multiple playable characters and permanent death, if you get your character killed, it's final - they're dead and gone, and you'll have to play someone else from their group. It really feels like a loss when a survivor you've been building up into a badass gets torn apart in a raid gone horribly wrong.Owing to its small budget, it's a bit rough around the edges, but it has a heart of gold and a lot of ambition. At first I thought ""another zombie game?"" but this was a breath of fresh air to me.			"

												With abominations like The War Z, Nether and 7 Days to Die coming out recently, I'd almost given up on this genre. State of Decay has been sitting in my library for months untouched because I expected the worse. However I decided to start it up and oh my god, I'm annoyed for not doing it sooner.From the very beginning you're thrown into the open world and get taught the basic mechanics, before being given free roam and being able to approach the zombie apocalypse however you want. Want to stay with a group of survivors in a church? Go ahead, help them and earn their trust. Want to kill them all, loot their resources and start your own base? Go ahead, have fun!The combat itself is nowhere near as bad as I thought, it reminds me a lot of a basic version of the Assassin's Creed combat, with an option of using guns of course. The RPG elements are really cool, and I like not being anchored down with a 'main character' - you can play as whoever you want once you befriend them and level up their own skills.I see myself playing this a lot more in the future. It's honestly amazing.			"

												I really liked the concept of this open world zombie survival game, but it was let down a bit by mediocre execution. It really lacks polish, well..  that's being generous, it's just really rough around the edges.The good stuff:- You can control multiple characters - change between the survivors at home base. They have their own loadout and XP based skillset.- Permadeath - it REALLY intensifies the experience when you're on a mission, and all of a sudden you are low on health, exhausted and struggling to reach your car parked outside while a horde is on your heels.  I lost a couple of experienced survivors that way - I simply underestimated the danger and paid the cost. But learned to park close by, facing the right direction :)- Place outposts, and customize/upgrade your home base- Lots of different interesting weapons and items- Fairly diverse assortment of missions- Great atmosphere - loved the area/map. Really invited you to go explore searching for great lootThe bad:- Melee combat system too simple- Poor A.I.- The survivors are literally chronically exhausted pansies with no adrenaline glands..  GRR!- Camera getting obstructed by bushes/trees- Anti-climatic ending.Bugs/annoyances:- Zombies waist deep in.. FLOOR! You can't even melee them.- Zombies doing the running man against thigh high crates trying to reach you- Too few ""one liners"" - e.g. returning home with multiple rucksacks will often trigger the exact same ping-pong ""dialouge"" 4 times in close succession. - Cars getting relocated during cutscenes- Conversating characters during cutscenes not even remotely looking at eachother - Cars burning in the streets for weeks - energy crisis averted!-  Scavenger hunt progress increases while the ""scavenger"" is fighting outside..I could go on and on.After completing the last mission, I felt there were still so many things to try out, and achivements to accomplish. But at the same time I felt like waiting for a sequel which will hopefully have the refinement this game lacked, while retaining all the truly great things it did have. 73%			"

												This game throws you in its world pretty much unprepared, explains only the most basic things. The graphic is mediocre (even for Xbox 360 standards), has sometimes odd graphic glitches, weird bugs (even after multiple patches), sometimes weird restrictions in gameplay (you cannot pass items to your companion) and a wonky AI.Yet it was one of the most enjoyable games I played in recent years. It balances wonderfully multiple activity's like base management, companion management, resources gathering, missions, exploring the map and the zombie killing without laying a heavy emphasis on any of it. Contains a rich atmosphere and fitting music/ambience. State of Decay - Main Game (9/10)It starts kinda slow, but after you leave the starting area heading to your first base it really gets interesting. Restarting the campaign multiple times trying something different.BreakDown - DLC (7/10)Basically the sandbox mode of main game without the story arc but with a few new playable characters and items. Has 10 levels which goes insanely hard with the last two levels, where you have pretty much no resources to work with, large strong zombie crowds and special infected everywhere.LifeLine - DLC (8/10)Plays near a infested city with a new story arc and characters. While it's not as big as it initially looks like (you cannot enter the city), it still has everything which made the main game fun, set in a new (even though smaller) environment. State of Decay is in my personal top 3 zombie games of all time with the very first Dead Rising and  Walking Dead Season 1.			"

												I would recommend State of Decay if Undead Labs didn't stop supporting this game after making lots of money with it and the DLCs, only to sell the exact same game with HD graphics as a separate one!I don't recommend it, because IMO nobody should give money to devs that cheat their fanbase!

												It could be great game, but its UI is badly designed, player interaction is just irritating, it says its sandbox, but its more story driven than popular RPGs/adventure games, frustrating car driving mechanics, zombies spawning in walls (cant kill that one), zombies spawning inside safe guardposts, looots of zombies everywhere, you kill 20, theres plenty of them just near you spawning endlessly. While the last one trait someone could like, but for me its just frustrating. And whats more important its buggy. You cant save when you wish to. Game chooses when it automatically save, wheter its authors choosen as necessary. You dont have control of it.As of the pros :- beatiful graphics,- nice sights,- some very good gameplay ideas,- some very good game design and iteresting ideas are herebut... overall - its frustrating.

												The price is RIGHT! got this game and the expansion for approx. $15 on sale and NO REGRETS. Think GTA series meets Dead Rising. Social dynamics are interesting and the action/tension of exploring and accomplishing what it takes to make your enclave survive is really great fun. Some aspects aren't exactly intuitive, but nothing in the interface sticks out enough to detract from the main thing: Trying to survive in, and hopefully lead, a group of survivors in a zombie apocalypse. Stealth and melee and shooting? yup. Barricading and scouting from secure locations? Yup. Currying favor, stemming infighting and trying to bring in increasing numbers of divergent people under one banner? oh yes. The game delivers the goods on an aspect of the zombie genre that most games wish they could have -- that of building and guiding an enclave. RECOMMENDED.			"

YouTube™ Video: State of Decay Review 

			Views: 1,111		

			Cosmic takes a look at the zombie survival game State of Decay developed by Undead labs and published by Microsoft studios.		

 State of decay's core strengths lay within it's actual game play, it's clear early on in the game that undead labs wanted to ensure the game had a solid framework rather than just focusing on the cosmetic appeal of the genre. At its core state of decay is a survival game. I'll talk more about the games story later in the video but needless to say, you start the game and find yourself in the middle of a most unpleasant of zombie apocalypses.Stealth is key to survival in state of decay, and the game provides a variety of mechanics for you to utilize to make sure you don't find yourself surrounded by the undead hordes. Your bog standard zombie in SOD isn't the sharpest tool in the shed, their eyesight is very poor, out of sight really is out of mind in the game. The enemies do have an acute sense of hearing however, the game visually feedbacks how much noise your making, whether your searching through cupboards or breaking down locked doors, best to be as quiet as possible or you will literally have the unwashed masses at your front door in no time. Throughout the game it is often easier to kill the standard zombie by stealth kills or building yourself so very fine traps. Though noise is your worst enemy it can be your greatest ally, creating distractions with a variety of tools, can be a great way of getting out of a particularly sticky situation.One of the great things about state of decay is that its not just you versus the world. There are a lot of survivors out there and you'll eventually get to become part of a survivor community. Your community has its own base and number of people and these too things require attention. Lets start with bases, there are a number of locations in the game world that can be used as a base. You can only have one base at a time. Each base location varies in size and that’s important because as your community grows so too will the need for beds and space. Bases can be upgraded in a variety of ways, from self sustaining food gardens to guard towers, choosing what you need is crucial as space is limited. Upgrading your defences and keeping your base well stocked and guarded is important too, bases will get attacked frequently, they can be overrun and people can and will die.The survivors at your base also will need attention too. They need food, medical supplies and ammunition. Each survivor in your community has needs and desires, you wont please everyone, but its somewhat beneficial to at least try. Each survivor has an affection rating towards you, once you become friends with a survivor, that character becomes a player character meaning you can switch between characters at any time, especially useful when one becomes too fatigued to be any good in the field. The survivors in your community can be used to go out on computer controlled scavenging runs as well as used as companions to take out with you. Survivors have their own stories and ongoing lives, occasionally they will ask you to do something for them, whether it be deal with a zombie or a more side quest esc personal mission. Doing these side quests for your survivors improves your relationship with them and this is the way you will eventually be able to control them yourself.Other survivor communities populate the landscape too, you can interact with these in a variety of ways from doing missions for them to trading. Trading in state of decay works off an influence system, every-time you do missions, kill zombies etc etc your earn influence points, these influence points can then be used to purchase ammo, weapons and supplies from the survivor communities. You also need influence points to upgrade your base structures as well as a variety of scavenged resources. Sometimes you may even have the option to add some survivor communities to your own, but beware things might get a bit cramped if you don’t have the space and NPC's can have fall outs with each other, the walking dead style.One thing I really like about the game is in its RPG elements, each player character has four base skills, Cardio, wits, fighting and shooting. On top of that each individual character has a set of personal skills and traits. Take the fighting skill, this skill covers melee fighting and overall hit points. By using melee weapons on a character a lot of the time this skill will start to increase and unlock more stat bonuses. By doing certain actions a lot with a certain character this may also unlock personal traits, that add traits to that individual too, for example if you have a character that you use to scavenge a lot, you may develop a personal trait that adds a reduction to the time it takes to scavenge.The game world itself is pretty extensive for a smaller title, you have around 8 square kilometres of playable area to go explore at your will. The world ranges from very American mid west countryside to more urbanised areas. The game also features dynamic progression, meaning even when your not playing, the world is still changing, after all just because your sleeping doesn't mean those zombies are. Its important to leave your bases well stocked before you leave the game or you may load up to an abandoned base with a lot of bodies.There's a good enemy variety in the game to boot, not all zombies are brain dead walkers. There are a number of special zombies which are more of a challenge to take down. In some cases when facing specials it can be better to run to live to fight another day, especially if your low an ammo, especially if your facing the hulk esc beasts known as juggernauts. An interesting mechanic for the enemies in the game is the horde mechanic, if several average zombies converge on one area, they will start to attract others and a horde will form. These hordes can be very dangerous and are not to be taken on directly, its best to ensure the zombies around your base are as scattered as possible, keep that population down.Graphically while a eye pleasing game in most respects, state of decay does suffer from FPS drops, terrain clipping but even with some cosmetic issues it never loses that immersive feel, and because the core gameplay is so good, you actually end up forgiving its short comings. The game does a great job in the sound department, cracking zombie heads with baseball bats sounds as grim as you would expect it too, its certainly not lacking in aesthetic.Now lets talk story. The game starts you off as Marcus and your friend Ed coming back from a fishing trip in the mountain lakes, once you get back you quickly realize that all those 1980's horror movies have come true and your set off on your journey to find out what exactly is going on and how to get the hell out of there. While I don't want to spoil the games story there are some interesting plot mechanics that I do want to mention, specifically that certain story events can be missed if you ignore them too long. Spend too long wandering the world looking for supplies and some events can be missed and things will change. Not only this but certain story events can change the world around making survival increasingly difficult for you and your new found family.Even more recently the new downloadable content Breakdown has been released. Breakdown is a true sandbox mode, stripping the game of its main story allowing you to embark on a seemingly never ending quest for survival.In all Undead labs have succeeded in creating of the most enjoyable zombie survival games of recent years. The mix of solid mechanics, engaging characters and open world survival is a breath of fresh air in a genre where we seem to get a boat ton of below par games thrown at us non stop. State of decay is a must for any zombie survival fan and while its by no means perfect, you will get value for money.			"

												This game is pretty bad. It doesn't run as well as it should for looking as murky as it does. It has choppy animations and bad voice acting. The game constantly pesters you with side missions and punishes you for trying to have any fun. I promise you this game will bring you more stress than enjoyment.

												State of Decay creates a potent mix of strategy, resource managament, open-world exploration, and zombie apolcalypse action in a brilliant concoction that is unlike any other single player game you've ever played. While the game is very rough around the edges and contains an assortment of glitches, State of Decay's excellent core mechanics remain interesting and incredibly enjoyable throughout the time you'll spend trying to surive in Trumball Valley. This is one of those games that will consume you once you get into the routine of survival, improving your community, and exploring the huge open world in search of survivors that may sometimes prove to be even more evil than the hordes of undead. A truly one-of-a-kind experience, and I can't wait to see what Undead Labs does next, especially if they decide to make a sequel. Highly recommended.			"

												I've finished campaign after 22 hours (I was doing every side-quest).If you like show The Walking Dead and playing games then this game is just for you!Game guides you through the simple story which is not bad as it is from this genre to be expected.Characters are lovely and combat system isn't bad.After campaign you have Breakdown and Lifetime DLC.Both are great and if you have full pack you will spend A LOT time at this game.I can recommend this game for 80% :)Edit:After chievements hunting, I can say that the game has some very bad pages in the form of bugs. So enjoy the story, but on a perfect game, find something else.			"

												So I wasn't really sure what I was getting myself into with this game when I got it. I had watched a couple of people play the first 20 minutes or so when it first turned up. I am really, completely and utterly pleasantly surprised. I loved every minute of playing it.I'm a scaredy cat & I normally coward out of things after a short while. Not so with this. It's not really scary at all even for me (though the noises a couple of the special mobs make gives me the creeps).It's certainly not a difficult game, and while I don't normally use that as a reason for critique it really could stand to be more difficult - though I know some people have said otherwise & I think that comes down to play-style. I lost one survivor but only because I was dumb and in a rush and switched survivors when I thought she was somewhere safe and she mysteriously died in that same spot. That's all. In amidst the pot luck of who will survive when you log back in it was my own lethargy that got her. You become strangely attached to a couple of the members of the group despite them being mostly ambiguous people - you really do feel that it's your responsibility to look after them.The thing with this game is it is a persistent world. Think animal crossing - if you leave for too long things happen. I played it every day over the holidays logging off each time only once everyone was safe & sound and morale was full. I never returned to any nasty surprises other than a couple of enclaves getting over-run but - that's their own fault ;P If you can dedicate the hours in a short enough time frame it's not a deal-breaker but if you want to put it down and pick it up where you left off a couple of weeks later you might just find it burning around your feet. If you still have feet.Using an X-box controller at least it was so smooth and satisfying to fight and running over zombies and hearing them pop when you run over them is just, satisfying. They don't really explain much to you but, I didn't find this off-putting but I did have to google what Fame & Influence really did.For me it really could have stood to be a longer game - to have had the next area open up and be able to move up into a larger home base. But then I was lucky enough to have the time to maintain morale & resources. The OCD in me loves searching buildings & seeing the little X's appear on buildings once you've cleared them.And finally the story - it's nothing ground breaking or complex but just enough to make me feel a little sick. And for a game that's just a little sick, that's not too bad to me.			"

												So i liked this game, it has zombies, some action and open world elements, but it had some bugs. Didn't really care about the bugs it was fun enough to play, but then i saw that they released the year one survival thing not long after i bought this game, i thought hmm lets see if it isnt just a free upgrade for this game. But they had to dissapoint me it was a copy of this game with improved graphics and double the bugs, worst of all this game is completely abandoned and its impossible to get a refund for it even if you're thinking of buying the YOSE. So do i recommend this game? NO. Do i recommend the YOSE? Maybe, if you're willing to look past the bugs and if the game is on -95% or something....			"

												The limit to how much you can have in your base supply is stupid, there's 4 pickup trucks sitting outside my base that I'm just using for storage since turning supply packs in just makes them vanish when the base is full. You can break them open to get goodies based on what kind of supply it is, but its a total waste for materials supplies. You can also call in someone to come collect them, but they might only get like +4, when taking the supply to turn it in yourself you get 15, so... The max vehicle storage area is only 6 (That I know of), and the smallest is 4, so I don't get how a pickup truck could have the same storage size of a police car, but have 2 more places than a muscle car. The most useful supply is materials, for base upgrades, and theres only a handful of them to find without having radio girl tell you were some is. Ammo, food, fuel and medicine are just sitting in the pickups outfront till I might need some. Mashing LMB at zombies seems to be the safest bet in most combat situations, most of your survivers wont have a high enough skill level for special moves. This makes the first guy you play as much more useful than anyone else since he gets a huge xp boost in the starting tutorial. If you go out with someone who sucks overall, taking a budy pal with you will make it infinately easier since they dont seem to have health. Letting them get swarmed and using the previously described fighting style solves all problems when getting swarmed. Driving is crazy finicky, holding w in some cars launches you at lightspeed and you can stop on a dime if you let go of it, but getting out at highspeeds makes the car fly down the road from you. Ammo takes a rediculous amount of backpack space, 30 rounds being the stack cap for each ammo type and reloading takes a decade for every gun. I cant stand the suppressor shot limit, some being 10, the most I've seen is 50 I think, the UI is strange like that.			"

												I'm torn about whether or not to recommend this game. On one hand, it's fun, and has some pretty cool ideas. On the other hand, there are lots of bugs that cause some pretty big issues. It irritates me when devs make DLC for a game before fixing the base game first.Overall, I enjoyed the game. At least one game breaking bug happened while I was playing, that I was only able to solve by researching the problem online. Because there are still such major flaws, I cannot recommend State of Decay, in good faith, in its current condition.			"

												Rating: 8 out of 10(I'm still playing breakdown right now, so the whole views are about the original game.)I would recommend you this game if you like games like DayZ but get tired of getting killed without any reasons.I've played for like 20 more hours in 3 days and I love this game. However, to be honest, there are lots of things which could be improved about this game.Pros:1, The graphic is good. 2, The bgms are appropriate for the atmosphere.3, Gameplay is fluent and comfortable, though I would recommend you to play this game with a controller.4, There are main quests and side quests which keep you having objects to achieve (They're fun at the beginning). For instance, you may choose to help neighbor to earn their trust in order to make progress of making them join you or you may choose to search for resources to build more facilities at home or you could kill zombies in order to get your skill level up.(I love the sound effect of blowing up zombie heads and slow motion of finishing them)5, There are different types of special zombies, which are obstacles for new players at night or during defense quests from neighbors.Cons:1, This game is still not gonna be an amazing game which wouldn't make you feel repetitive about its goals and quests. Also, the main quests are too weak to even be considered as main quests. However, it's contradictory that you will find main quests are so short after you finish them because you would expect a lot more from main quests while the game doesn't offer many different quests after you play for a while. Then, what's the purpose of main quests anyway? just to tell you you need to move somewhere with some reasons? Or just try to create a fake sanse of progress with repetitive quests? After beating the game, I could also say the ending isn't like an ending. It's like a shutting down right from your face when you just wonder what's gonna happen next and bang, the game ends...2, Though there are special zombies, they're not hard after you play for a while and figure out how to battle with them. To be honest, it's fair and it fits the realistic surviving atmosphere. But, it's really boring to fight against them. I would like to say that since this game doesn't bring many conflicts between people and communities (Like pvp in DayZ but with bots), I would like to see more and harder special zombies in this game to make this game more challenging. Not only several types of special zombies but a lot more should be put in. Also, I think it's gonna be great if some special zombies are gonna appear after you continue finishing main quests. Using them to represent an increasing difficulty and challenge of this game would make people who like to shoot feel more interested in making progress in this game. And yes, we need a big♥♥♥♥♥boss zombie to attack our base to make it more like a community and a raid. Imagine the difference between you walk on the street alone with badass guns and you sneak on the street to hunt down some big♥♥♥♥♥zombies with your people. I really would like to see the latter.3, Side quests could be much better. I would like to see more details about side quests of different people. I believe there are lots to develop about humanities and societies. It's not only big things between different communities but small details about each person. Their feelings, their memories, and their beliefs could all be developed more. A family picture in a house, dead body of couples with hands holding each other, or even a lonely, weak and hungry dog standing near its suicide owner , scenes like these could be put in this game a lot to make gamers feel more desperate when they do their searching in different houses. And then you shall put some inspiring side quests by contrast to make gamers into the game. Zombies and weapons are all about gameplay. People, communities and their stories are creating the atmosphere of this game. When Skyrim is favored by lots of people but more buggy than this game, the importance of side quests should be taken into account.After all, it's a good game and a good try. Thie game still has its potential and I really hope this game could be amazing in this genre.			"

												I really want to love this game, but I can't. I love the idea of an open world game where you don't just have to survive, but you also have to build a community and make choices that make a difference in the end. And the game does an OK job of that, but it throughs these tiny wrenches that mess everything up and ruin the game.Pros: +High stakes- it saves just about everytime you do anything, so if you ♥♥♥♥ up, then you ♥♥♥♥ed up.+It gives personality to some of the characters, making them more enjoyable to play as+ You can play as any survivor you save ( I don't know, I think this is a really cool game mechanic)Cons: + like i said before, when you mess up there's no going back, and that creates tenssio, which is awesome.... until you die as your favorite character. Some of the characters have dialog that is so much better than others and when they die, it's frustrating.+ The controls are often unresponsive, especially when you go from interacting with something to moving+The most fun I had in this game had to be when I was running over zombies with a car, zombies fling left and right is just so satisfying. But after you hit around 20 zombies ( which will take you around 30 seconds to do) your car engine starts to smoke and if you kit more zombies, the engine catches on fire and the car explodes+The graphics arn't that good and when you turn your camera in any direction, this wierd bluring affect happens and it just makes the game annoying to look atI get that some that they're trying to make this game intense, where when your survivors die, the die for good and you have to live with that, and some people might love that ( I this is you, then you might want to get this game). But it's just frustrating to me. If I die as a character, chances are that it's my favorite character since i like to play as that character. It's annoying how I might get so far through a playthrough and then some bs happens and I die. Like I said I love the idea of a game like this, but it does so many tiny annoying things where I'v just gotten tired of plying it. I would much rather have a fun game where I can ♥♥♥♥ around, than a game where 1 ♥♥♥♥ up means inevitable death.TL;DR: If you like games like h1z1 or the farcry series, then I would just wait till a sale.

												Almost 70 hours of single player game and still the game does not bore me. Though having pretty much big world, many ways of spending your time in the game and 2 dlcs, it's stll not enough, I want more. Can't help myself but think why there's no cooperative mode, considering that there are even way of expressing your attitude like TAUNT, CHEER and etc. It beats me. The game can have second wind if given the coop and a new story mode for multiplayer.State of decay is very addictive. Though the whole potential has not been developed. "

												This is a game with a few faults, bugs and glitches yet it's still one of the best zombie games. Survival is the main priority, find a home and upgrade it, build a storage or kitchen, medical center or workshop. Find other survivers to join you. Playing as different characters was fun, looking for supplies in buildings is a nice touch of realism. Melee combat is pretty good but i found the aiming with guns annoying and troublesome. The story was meh and could of been better but overall i'd say it's an awesome game, It focuses on survival and not just killing as many zombies you can which was a nice change.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, but after beating up 10000 zombies and I've used every car, bat, and gun I can get a hold of, it gets boring quick. I think the driving back and forth to and from the same location many, many, times get boring also the fact that the zombies respawn is silly.

												With so many Zombie Apocalypse Titles out there, the whole scene is getting boring rather fast, but I must honestly say that State of Decay is a great game. It's the same as most other zombie apocalypse game do everything you can to survive scavenge, fortify your base and so on and so forth but they did it a bit different.You start off with 2 friends Marcus and Ed at a campsite in the mountains where you meet up with a couple of other survivors who ask you to look around a bit to see if you can find any other survivors, the first person you meet is Maya, a soldier who was out by the lake with two of her friend, sadly her friends were overrun and killed by the zombies. Your little group of 3 then make your way back to the ranger station only to find everyone there has also been killed. You get hold of a two way radio and from there the actual fun begins when you head toward your first home base.Once at your new home base you need to make friends, you only have access to certain gear if you do your part and put in the leg work. Now you are going to do a lot of running in this game, a lot of button mashing fighting and you are going to get very upset at yourself for making stupid mistakes that get you killed, because if you die then you’re dead. That’s it that character that dies is gone forever, never to be seen again. SO DON'T DIE... Remember you are not super human.The game is not very hard but at the same time it's not very easy either at first you run up to every zombie you can find to beat up to see all the different cool moves your character has to take down zombies but as you progress you learn one very important thing, being overrun is dangerous, too many zombies in a small space could be fatal and so you find yourself avoiding contact later in the game.So what makes the game great? Well here's a list of why I think it's a great game.1. The story progresses if and when you want it to, though there are plenty missions available you don't have to do them all.2. If you scavenge supplies and you find more than you can carry you can call in for help. Leave the premises and a friend or two will go get the remainder of the supplies.3. Relocating your home base, as your circle grows you need more space, and different home bases give different ""Rewards""4. The Zombies are balanced out, it’s not like most other games where there are little or no zombies, or they are massively over populated and you have almost no chance of survival.5. The vehicle damage is very realistic, you hit a fence or a couple of zombies a few times and you are going to start getting radiator problems.But there are also a few bad things in the game.1. You find yourself doing the same thing over and over again a lot in the game. 2. The game has no manual save option, which makes it more realistic ( I actually like this ) but it's bad for when you make a stupid mistake and end up dead then you sit there afterwards and think why the hell did I do that.3. This is probably what bugs me the most, the whole time you are playing the game it feels like you are sitting behind a console, and I am a very big console Hater and I am not afraid to say it. The game feels like a cheap console port to PC and it's close to unplayable with a keyboard and mouse, if you want to enjoy the game you will need a controller.4. The gun mechanics doesn't work too well, due to the fact that the game is third person you often find yourself shooting at strange angles which in reality would be impossible to hit the target but in the game it works.This is by far one of my longest reviews ever, but a lot of words to describe a good game.My Rating - 8/10 - The Console port to PC is a big disappointment and makes the game difficult to play on a keyboard and mouse. Seriously a great game. Buy it..._+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_Breakdown DLC ReviewI played through State of Decay and really enjoyed the game but I did however find the game very short and was a little disappointed when I finished it was almost as if the game just got good and then it was finished. But a little while after I finished I saw that Breakdown was available and I must say If you love State of Decay as much as I do then this DLC is just for you. This DLC basically takes the game as we know and remove the whole story mode and turns it into a full on sandbox mode, your only goal is to survive and eventually when you want fix an old RV randomly located on the map and hop out of town with 5 of your best mates. Once you do that you start from scratch again, less loot, more zombies and stronger zombies. The map gets randomized but the idea stays the same SURVIVE! A lot of people complain saying this DLC wasn't added content but just removed content but I say good work, now the game can be enjoyed for much longer. I will definitely recommend this DLC. It also adds a few new achievements for achievement hunters as State of Decay is one of the very easy games to complete all the achievements but these however aren't as easy as the base game.Get it - Enjoy it - Rate itMy Rating 9/10Only bad thing in breakdown is that there are too many side missions going on at the same time, almost impossible to do them all and keep everyone happy and progress in the game. I find myself almost helping a stranger in trouble every 5 to 10 minutes.			"

												Too much hype for the intro video... Played this game for about 18 hours, which is not a lot of gameplay time for an open world that generates the same 4-6 types of side missions over and over again... I'm honestly 50-50 on this game, but what really caused me to choose to not recommend this game was the major cliff hanger at the end and being shocked at how short this game is and how much time I pretty much wasted on doing side missions not knowing which missions were progressive ones, so I spent probably 10 hours out of the 18 for doing almost pointless stuff.This game was fun, I enjoyed the side missions for the first 3 times they generated, and gathering supplies to progress in this game, but this game could have had more realism and more stuff to do. I don't suggest expecting lots out of this game and instead I suggest trying out DayZ (standalone&mod version). It's more realistic and you basically create your own adventure and story line if you are into making it seem like that. I'd give this game a 5/10. "

												This is exactly how I imagine a Open World Zombie Survival Simulation game would be, In fact I'm surprised how good the game actually is, anyway here are my thoughts;Pros- Large Open World, I've only just explore the first two areas, there’s still so much more areas I need to discover. - Different Types of Zombie Enemies- Nice and Fluid Combat System, and Running Over Zombies with your car or door attack always feels great :D- Like an actual Simulator, there are limited amount of cars & fuel resources and they can blow up/get damaged, your weapons can break, and your character can get injured and tired, and It can be difficult to fight back large zombie hoards if you are alone when all of the above happens to you :P- You Can Establish Outposts around the Town, Create medical bays, gardens to grow your own food, radio tower for communication, shooting lookouts to improve your community overall shooting skills and defensive range of your Outpost.Your community can also expand larger by finding more suvivors.- You will need to go out for supply runs every so often to make sure you have enough Food, Medicine, Building materials, Ammo etc.- Controller Enabled! :D (I think the game feels better playing with a controller - Might just be my personal preference)- Countless of Hours PlaytimeCons - I noticed there were a few negative reviews saying this game can get repetitive, due to the quests which are given like random shortages/goods or trades with your fellow neighbours, with that being said players can get bored and stop playing. - When it gets dark you should be given the option to sleep.- Single Player Only.Suggestions/FeedbackI think if this game is already very good for what it is. Very fun and Enjoyable. Personally, i'd give it a 8/10 but if it wanted a 10/10. What i'd suggest is.. - Since there are already a few main characters you meet at the start of the game you could tell an in-depth story for each character like in GTA 5 you can switch characters and play through different characters story and learn more about them, also some good cut scenes would be quite great, perhaps with some conflict between two or more characters or even other groups.- New Expansion in the near future with a map extention, new weapons, cars, homes that go up to like 50-100 people to manage, go out in groups of 5-10 to do super dangerous missions, everything in big scale too :P Last but not least If this game was Online, Multiplayer, Co-op would be super awesome, simply cause playing with friends makes games even more enjoyable.Anyway those are my Pros, Cons and Suggestions. I Love this game and I recommend giving state of decay a shot if you enjoy games in this genre, Thanks for reading.- Chrono			"

												State of Decay is a survival games that put you in a world full of zombies or zeds as the people in this game called them.The first thing i have to say about this game is this game isn't perfect, it got alot of bugs that sometimes can get you really angry at it. The most annoying bug that i encountered so far is when a zombie noclipping through the wall and when sometimes when you press up, your character when the opposite way, that is really frustrating when you try to help your follower from getting killed by a zombie. But, i still give it a thumbs up. Why ?? Because this game gave me some really unique experience that i can't get from any other games. It gave me absolute freedom in a world full of zombies, and many of the game mechanic really give me the impression that you are not a superhero, you are just a group of people that trying to survive this harsh world full with zombie, and you spend your day trying to find supplies in some of the abandoned building for your group so they can survive for another day. One of the game mechanic that i really like is the permadeath, When the character you controlled or other character in your community died, they died for good. No respawn, just death.Soo far, this game is really great. Buggy, but great. Do you ever wander what is like to surviving in the world full of zombie and still have fun ? Then, this is a truly awesome game for you ! It prove that what makes games good is not the graphic or how polished is the game, but how fun is the gameplay. Recommended !			"

												Welcome to Trumbull Valley. Enjoy the skull smashing and decapitation, and don't worry about those red smudges on your clothes, it's perfectly normal in here!State of Decay, an arcade-ish zombie ""sandbox"" game by Undead Labs. ""Sandbox"" because you have the possibility to do what you want (in game limitations of course), without any time limits.There is a story, but it's not what you should buy this game for. It's the fun from killing zombies, and building a community to survive.""Building a community""? Yes. You have it in here. You start out small, with some people barely tying up an end with the other end, and you are supposed to help them survive. Or you can just ignore them completely and go kill some zombies. Up to you.The combat is pretty enjoyable. The game doesn't have any tutorials on to how to kill that walking corpse, but you will figure it out fairly quickly. Or just check the wiki. There are few types of zombies, from the normal shambling ones, through sprinting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and ending with a juggernaut that requires some effort to take out.Gameplay itself is also done well. You can get into nearly every building you see, you can look around for supplies to help your group survive, you can swap between characters. And there's character progression.Many people recommend playing on a pad, but I actually have no difficulties to play on a keyboard & mouse.Graphics are nice, even for a X360 game, made on CryEngine 3. AI is good enough (as for a zombie).If you are looking for a game where you kill zombies, run around and do stuff, and where it ""tries"" to simulate an apocalypse, then this is it.I got this for full price, and I am not disappointed. There's a living modding community going, so the game has at least some years of life more. Although, if you do not care about a story mode, and you prefer just a survival sandbox, you should also get Breakdown DLC.			"

												To begin, this game has shocked me. I watched probably the first 1 min of the game and decided not to try it out. Later on , it was on sale and I tried it out.It is addicting. Seriously.I wanted a zombie game where you can move around and scavenge. Surviving with other people is excellent, too.I will state the problems I had until now:1. No online. Multiplayer, co-op, whatever. It would be better if I DIDNT HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING IN THIS GAME. Also, there aren't a lot of places to go after you explored everything. 2. Game can be frustrating when you have to babysit everyone. Like seriously, every day one person is sad, or angry and I have to take them for a walk like a child. Seriously. Take it out. Or make it rare. I'm getting sick and tired of that.3. More DLCs and maps would be great. Seriously, this game needs to be continued. It is incredibly immersive and it should have more content added.4. Let us manually save. I don't want to continue with dead survivors. 5. Two reasons why the survivors died:A) Ever paused a game and alt-tabbed to quickly chat with someone or look something up? Well, doing that about 65% of the time, the game CONTINUES BY ITSELF. I died 2-3 time because of that. It is so stupid. B) Saving a downed survivor.....is hard. I managed to save one....but she blew up....literarily....Why? No idea.Other than that, I love the game. Cars and special zombies are excellent. Anyone who is a fan of zombie games and open world gameplay will absolutely love this game. I wish the developers will release more content which I will buy instantly. I am currently playing this till i feel like not playing it until DLCs come out. Which is usually over 50 hours. :)I recommend this game to anyone who is considering to get it. Hope they update it more in the future.Thank you. :)Btw, Just read the topic in the forum addressing the multiplayer. I can see why there will not be a multiplayer. There will never be which is sad since this game had potential.			"

												If you like hitting the undead with an array of melee weapons, Shooting round after round into advancing hoards.Or simply scavenging for supplies and rescuing survivors. Then you should absolutely check out State Of Decay.I enjoyed this game a lot. Searching for supplies never gets old and I think that is because the loot varies, from basic food supplies (coffee, snacks, ect) to medicine or ammo, melee weapons of all sorts and guns. Who doesn't love finding a stash of ammo for that one favourite gun of yours? Searching for supplies feels natural in this game. And it really adds to the survival element.State Of Decay is slow paced compared to a lot of other zombie games and a lot of the time you'll have to take your time to really assess your group of survivors and the base as even when you're not playing, the game itself is still active. I left off with good morale within the group and came back the next day to find one of the survivors had fallen sick and another had died. So the game really keeps you on your toes and is constantly changing.In the game you'll be able to complete a lot of missions, you'll pretty much always have something to do however if you ignore missions for long enough or simply get occupied doing other things within the game certain missions will solve themselves, not always in a good way either. Fail to help a fellow survivor kill a certain zombie, or find a lost survivor and they might die doing the mission on their own. So the game really encourages you to constantly be active. However this doesn't happen for every mission so if you prefer just exploring and doing supply runs, then do your thing. The game is far from perfect and there is honestly a few things that could have been polished further, the driving mechanics feel clunky and occasionally the AI will do a few silly things. However playing the game I found myself looking past those things and instead simply enjoying the world and gameplay and of course fretting over my survivors. Stop getting sick ya'll!!! Would recommend!  "

												Easily one of the most enjoyable zombie-themed survival games I've played. There's nothing much more to say, everything about the game is fantastic. It's simple enough to get into without frustrating yourself, and deep enough to keep you coming back for quite a long time. The story is good enough that you'll want to continue playing through it, and the free play can keep you entertained for a long, long time.			"

												Great zombie apocalypse sandbox game, satisfying and gruesome combat, and enjoyeable relationship system with other survivors.State of Decay is an awesome little game that only makes me wish it was bigger, because it gets a lot of little things right.			"

												This is just for Lifeline DLC, since Steam won't let me add it right there.Do not buy Lifeline. It's utterly broken. Not only that, but some of the game mechanisms have been adjusted to be downright ridiculous. Original State of Decay was filled with bugs, but I've managed to get to it when most of that was apparently fixed. Unfortunately, as it seems, developers learned nothing and same thing happened here.- Game hands down cheats. Zombie respawn is ridiculous - you clean a room, then you turn your back and few seconds later they're back. I think they've wanted to make this DLC more difficult, but there are better ways to do it without making the player feel cheated.- Also, when you make your game harder, make sure you'll also adjust survavability of the friendly AI. They were equally dumb in original, but there weren't many situations where AI gets surrounded by 10 zombies. AI doesn't know the term running away, they're mindless drones. I've lost several NPCs just because all they understand is to attack and when they get overrun, there is nothing you can do.- In fact, NPCs have problems doing even the simpliest things, like running through doors or getting in cars.- Car physics, if you can even call it that, makes them very easy to flip over, because we're apparently on moon. Two times I've been launched in the air with my car without doing anything else than getting close to some object (pathway, building).- Due to map design, lots of it happens in quite close quarters and corridors, which makes it excellent for your character to get stuck in group of zombies without any chance to get out. You can just watch your character glitch through them as you desperately mash buttons to no awail.- Reloading weapons sometimes doesn't work and works only when you zoom in.- When I say this♥♥♥♥♥♥is utterly broken, I mean it. When siege happens, if you're in middle of saving someone, you magically can't talk to them, which forces you to leave them and come for them again, if they manage to survive. I don't know how long have they tested this DLC, but there are huge issues that anyone has to run into after few minutes of playing...- Last but not least, you would think that soldiers will be a little more competent with firearms than civilians, but no, your teamates can't shoot for their life, and they're more than happy to let their fellow soldiers to die and continue shooting like it's 4th July.The home defence system just doesn't outweight so many problems this DLC has, and it's not so fun as it might seem at first, because sieges usually happen when you least need it. Overall, this piece of rotten meat has brough me a lot of frustration.. Avoid it like a plague it is, play original game. I have lost a lot of hope that Undead Labs will release something playable in future, if this is supposed to be their standard now.			"

												While Undead Labs have not been the nicest publisher/developer out there when it comes to being friendly to the consumer, I still really enjoyed this game. It has its flaws and you should play it only if you can use your imagination when it comes to the story, because the game doesn't really offer much of it. The rest, though, is really well made and I had a lot of fun with this game.			"

												I loved this game... I shelved it after a full play through. I came back after some time to find it unsupported and a discussion thread from the developer asking us to buy the game again as a newly remastered one year edition. How about a free upgrade since I already gave you money? I could understand if the game was no longer supported because it was a decade old, but it was only 1 FRICKING YEAR OLD and now unsupported.The current state of the game is BROKEN and will not run properly with NVidia drivers. You literally have to disable your Nvidia card in your device manager and run the Intel card. There is not a patch or support.Just an FYI, Undead Labs has done a great job deflecting this whole debacle by blaming Microsoft Studios saying it was a contact obligation so the new Year One Survial Edition could be playable on XBox 1. However, a little research will show that aside from the DLC and YOSE, all of their games are unsupported and no longer sold, some less than a year old. PURE CASH GRAB!AVOID UNDEAD LABS. They are scam artists. They will never see another dollar of mine and I strongly suggest you keep your money as well.			"

WTF is up with that!One of the biggest D!CK MOVES a developer could pull on their supporting players.  This developer/publisher just went full re.tard on us people!Considering ""Microsoft Studios"" is the publisher it doesn't surprise me that such a SHADY move was thought up like this.  I for one will not invest another penny into this developer.  It's an alright game too but such a ♥♥♥♥ing d!ck move by developer has made me give such a bad review.So basically they stopped development on this and still is buggy...I feel whoever purchased this game got RIPPED OFF.Do I recommend this game...HELL NO and do I recommend any future titles from UNDEAD LABS...HELL NO "

												9/10 !!!Probabbly the most enjoyable zombie open world game around ( at least for me ;p ) . yes its repetitive mission sometimes can make you bored to death also its too damn hard for casual or weekend warrior game but ..... the feeling and thrill of exploring and looting in this game is perfect for open world zombie killing rpg lover. Anyone who paid $60 for Dead Island or Left 4 Dead should feel pretty well ripped off by now. This game is $20 (sometimes 5$ on sale ) , .if you have $20 to spend on a zombie survival game, do yourself a favor and spend it here. but still the biggest dissapointment is the fact it has no CO-OP or multiplayer mode :( if  only they add it...... then its a dream come true....

												My initial impressians? This is shaping up to become the most satisfying zombie survival experience. . .EVER.This is where you will find gameplay elements that not only define the undead appocalypse, but are absent from any competing zombie titles. Excellent sandbox gameplay allow fellow survivors to die permanently and resting is achieved through closing the game and coming back to it, genius. The base building is also a great addition to this genre, and it is great to see it so successfully implemented here. Characters are well rounded and unique, they feel like they could respresent an actual human being, lending all the more to the sense of loss when one succumbs to death. This is a monumental title in the genre of zombie games.			"

												I would reccomend to play this game, but I wouldn't buy the original if they are willing to charge for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t year-one copy. The game is somewhat fun but it gets boring after a few hours and has many bugs. The devs seem to never fix anything, instead of a free patch, the developers decide to resell the game as a new version. BAD MARKETING, This company will not do well in the future if this how they treat game owners.I think its unfair to charge someone who already owns the entire game and all its dlc's for the year one edition for better performance. Microsoft can go screw themselves with this cashcow methodology. I would rather play Dying Light then re-buy a game for better performance. I should get a free patch or something since I have already payed for the original game with all the DLC's.Update for 2017.I stand by my original review for this game.I will add that the game had great potential, and I did enjoy the game with hopes of getting free updates.For those considering to buy State of Decay 2, I would hold off for a year to see if they decidide to come out with another YOSE. Just avoid giving these developers any of your money until they can actually provide a finished product that reflects what they promise to the public.I love Zombie games and like to play them all at least once It just saddens me that this game never had multiplayer to begin with. To hear thats what they are doing for the second only makes me assume that they are using the same exact game engine, with just updated graphics and multiplayer added (like they said they would try for in the first installment).You need to purchase with extreme caution, or not purchase at all in my opinion.

												Update: Was able to finally finish the game, took a lot of restarts and manually going to areas that seemed to potentially trigger the conitnuation of the story. Never got any of the remaining side missions though, like for the Wilkersens...but honestly idc anymore. Still a thumbs down. Hope they actually make an effort with SoD 2.Sadly, I have to give this a thumbs down, because it's a buggy mess. The gameplay in itself is nice, the story is ok-ish, nothing crazy...the game is more about building up your home base and interacting with your neighbours. So it's a 3rd person zombie survival simulator with perma death for your poor people if they actually die. You go around scavenging stuff, helping people, upgrading or relocating your base, setting up outposts, exploring the world, killing zombies, etc.In between that stuff you have quite a few story missions (rather short usually) that advance the overall plot. The only ♥♥♥♥ing problem is: There is no telling whether any mission it seems will actually spawn or not. And it seems everyone has these issues, yet the devs never fixed that bs...maybe in the Year One edition, but that's not even any ♥♥♥♥ing excuse to not fix THIS version of the game. So, sometimes restarting the game works, sometimes not (at the moment). I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to finish it. Some missions won't spawn at all, while the final missions have after a restart, up until now. Extremely annoying and that's why it gets a thumbs down.   Apart from that the ""off-line continuing world"" is pretty annoying. It's a SP game, so when I'm not playing it, please don't advance the game...thanks. Just annoying to start up the game and have several rescue missions queued up, because your people are just too stupid to survive on their own.DLCs are rather boring. One has you playing an endless game on the same map as the original game without any story missions, the other puts you in the shoes of a soldier, but also almost exclusively spawns random search and rescue missions. You're kinda supposed to just hold out and survive Zombie sieges. Not that interesting. After every siege there is a new story development, but nothing ground breaking. My GOD this game gets SO ♥♥♥♥ing boring. The same missions over and over and over again, pitting you against tougher and tougher opposition. Can't be arsed to finish the DCL...			"

Combat was not bad at all, I just felt over burdened with people needing help and supplies half way across the map, then by the time I get there they're dead or the mission is gone. Exploring and foraging for food was really cool and added a survival aspect, but gathering for the survivors was a bit of a annoyance to me. Left me doing too much for the Stronghold and not enough for myself. Felt like I couldn't enjoy the game and was forced to gather way too much. Some may enjoy this game but I didn't enjoy it alot.

												Probably the most thrilling, suspensful, and eerie open world survivor game out! I've dreamed for a long time, about a game where you have to race against the clock and rely on your survival gaming skills, to hone the ability to progress in a game. Imagine how it would be for you in a zombie apocalypse. How you'd cope and contribute to the  community to ensure survival... how your actions influence whether the group lives another day, The feature of switching between different playable characters and how their varied personalities can affect the progress in the learning of skills, or emotional stability to see if they'll disrupt or benefit the morale of the group. Everything about this game is so realistic it really raises the question to the players-How would you survive in a State of Decay?			"

												   State of Decay you say?   First thing's first. Let's get the bad out of the way.   The biggest issues I had with this game were frame rate drops in certain areas at high speeds, some texture pop-in here and there, a few times zombies getting stuck on fences, doors and such.   And now, the story.   The Story is nothing to get worked up about. 2 guys get back from a fishing trip to find themselves in a completely different world and it just sort of goes on from there. Nothing too spectacular or surprising really. I sort of figured where things were going before they actually happened. Let me be clear. I'm not saying it's bad. It's just nothing to write a bestseller or make a blockbuster movie about.   The graphics were not created to compete with Crysis or Metro. They did their job. It's not Borderlands 2, The Walking Dead or, as stated above Metro.    The gameplay is where the game shines. You get tossed in a bunch of small towns in Turnbull County. Minutes after you get past the whole this is what's happening and how you're supposed to play it part you make your way to the first safehouse. After that, it's all on you. To make it past that you have to break into houses all over the county to get what you need. Guns, materials to improve your house, meds, gas, guns, food, weapons, guns, ammo, other items and of course MORE guns to add to your storage and keep yourself alive and well.   Speaking of storage, State of Decay uses an interesting mechanic. You don't use money. I mean it is the end of the world basically. Instead, by completing story or side missions that pop up here and there once in a while you get to increase your fame. Fame is what limits the amount of influence you can get. Influence is won by looting items from said houses and dropping them in the storage unit and also by completing the said missions. The same influence is used to take items out of your households' or other survivors' storage. I know it sounds strange but I found out it works quite well.   The most important aspect of the gameplay is probably permadeath. In State of Decay you're not the hero. You start off with 2 characters of which one you control and quite soon you get to meet a 3rd which then makes the game reveal an important part of the game. Every person in the game has stamina and health, traits, skills based on traits and then unlockable skills once you get to a certain level. Your health goes down and die, you're done. Instead, if you have a good enough relationship with a character you get to select for that person to take charge and you get to play with the said person instead, in case you get hurt or get tired. You can't swap your charater if the relationship is too low, the game doesn't allow that in case of story-important characters or if that person is too tired or too injured. As such, even if you get over your loved (or skilled) charater dying, you need to keep your household happy, recruit other survivors to join your household by helping them stay alive long enough for your relantionship with that group to be high enough for them to want to join.   All in all, if I were to give this game a mark based on what it tried to achieve and what it actually achieved I would say a solid 8.5 / 10.			"

												My favorite game in the zombie genre - 9/10It's got a lot going for it, I like the action combat and how ammo is scarce so you have to get good with the melee combat, but once you master it the melee is devestating and there are so many different weapons.  Plus there is RPG like advancement of your main character and the other 'party' members you recruit along the way as each has a variety of skills and each skill advances as it's used unlocking further skills and special attacks/abilities.  It also has a very nice open world which rewards exploration as pretty much any location you find out of the way will have some nice loot to scavenge (better weapons, backpacks, etc.).  You also build yourself a base/community and have to manage various resources and personalities.  Helping out strangers opens up trade options and if you help them enough they'll be friendly and ask to join your community, but it's still up to you whether you want to add them and support them through play or no.  There are also more things to do than you can possibly get done timewise so you have to choose who to help and what to put priority on; but I've found gives me that sense of just one more thing and then I'll quit... awww just one more...     If you like the game then the Breakdown DLC adds a new game type where instead of following the story of the main campaign you have a minor story just the framework of survival for the world but gives RPG like goals in accomplishing certain things like using certain weapon types, or other accomplishments which unlock hero characters you can recruit where they don't start with minimal skills but instead have special items and upgraded skills.The one complaint I have is that it's very hard to maintain a clear zombie free area.  Seems like more often than not you only get a few steps away from a building you've cleared and zombies are right back into since the zombies seem to mostly spawn right around where your current character is, and I wish I could just lock some of my party/community members in our home so they'd stop going off on their own and getting in trouble within minutes of my rescuing them from one thing they are back out looking for trouble again.  Also for some missions which have a limited time to respond it would be nice to know what those timeframes are or see some color scheme like green, yellow, red so that you'd better know which ones need to be prioritized without having to keep track of when they showed up relative to the other available missions.

												Probably the most thrilling, suspensful, and eerie open world survivor game out! I've dreamed for a long time, about a game where you have to race against the clock and rely on your survival gaming skills, to hone the ability to progress in a game. Imagine how it would be for you in a zombie apocalypse. How you'd cope and contribute to the  community to ensure survival... how your actions influence whether the group lives another day, The feature of switching between different playable characters and how their varied personalities can affect the progress in the learning of skills, or emotional stability to see if they'll disrupt or benefit the morale of the group. Everything about this game is so realistic it really raises the question to the players-How would you survive in a State of Decay?			"

												There is some residual beta-like wonkiness this game never truly escapes, but I have to say, it is the closest anyone has ever gotten to the perfect zombie game. It's open world, you can pick among a variety of safehouses and fortify/upgrade them, and go rescue/recruit other survivors. The map is nice, the combat is fun, and the expansion pack adds a TON of replay value. Assuming it's on sale, as it so often is, and you can get both the base game and the DLC for $20 or less, it's a great deal, and you probably won't end up furious about the minor glitches you encounter along the way. It's also gotten fantastic support from its devs, with frequent updates and fixes, so it gets a little better every few weeks. I also give them points for having a lot of strong, fun, female characters, which far too many games ignore, considering it's now 2014, not the mid-1800s.			"

												State of Decay is a fun game, you get to experience how a community ""survives"" the zombie apocalypse.  You aren't just one person, once you've befriended others who you help or save, you can play as them and improve their abilities to further enhance your chances of survival.  Once your community is big enough you can strike out and take over larger bases (there's three base sizes, small medium and large) or keep it small and stay somewhere outside of the towns.It's not without its flaws, some zombies manage to clip through walls & doors either visually or physically, also executing them on stairs has issues and the vehicles are very floaty, it's amazing how high a truck can spin and flip.The end of the world is a dangerous place, mutant zombies and roaming hordes can seriously make a supply run turn into a really bad day.  Running is the best option or a car if you can to get out of there when tables turn badly.There have been two DLCs so far, Breakdown & Lifeline.  Breakdown is without story and you play till you're ready and have fixed up an RV to escape the valley.  This causes the game map to randomise & reset and also makes the game harder, you can also unlock heroes who can help turn the tide.Lifeline is a side story told around the same time as the base game, you follow a group of soldiers who have to hold onto their base camp while evacuating high value targets, usually those who have information/expertise with the ""virus"" and some civilians if you can.All in all for a console port of an xbox live arcade game, it's pretty good and fun, the melee combat can be quite fluid and ranged head shots are an instant kill for most zombies.  The game also has a permadeath system where if you die you're gone and have to move on without that person.  I'd give it a solid 8/10, you can play it many ways and the dlcs add a lot of different options.			"

												It is hard for me to recommend or not recommend a game because I get the vast majority of my games on sale, and thus I weigh the recommendation on the price. Would I recommend State of Decay for full-price? No, but I would for a more reasonable one. Initially I had a great time with this game, but after a few hours hours its repetative nature is painfully obvious. You have everything down, the side-quests go in a circle, while you wait for the main-quest to advance. The looping AI voices become an annoyance. Unlike what the description said, you cannot decide what way the story goes. I still managed to sink quite a bit more hours into this because I enjoyed driving around and being in the world but the game kept trying to pull me back into the framework, and I tried a second time to see if I could change anything, but it was the same deal. If you have more money to spend than me and can't wait - buy it. Otherwise, I recommend waiting for another sale.			"

												This is a good zombie survival game.  You have to manage a community of survivors, scavenge for food, guns, ammo, fuel or materials to upgrade your main base or explore the map to find new places to establish. There are also storyline missions and secondary missions, like helping other survivors or one of your homies. But I can't recommend this version of the game.  The developers are making a new remastered version called ""State of Decay: Year-One Survival Edition"" that contains new missions, weapons and characters, graphics enhancements and includes both DLC.  So if you are looking for this game, just wait and check the new version, which is cheaper than buying this old version + the DLC.			"

YouTube™ Video: Steam Review E20 State of Decay 

			Views: 376		

			A really great single player zombie survival game. With plenty to do and only $20, can't think of many reasons to not own this great title. Aside from the obvious.		

State of Decay: State of Decay is a very decent zombie survival game, you'll manage a base, take care of survivors, find supplies, fight zombies both regular and special and most importantly, survive and that's about it. The game never breaks out of the routine of surviving; you'll experience all the game has to offer within the first few hours of the game. The overall style of the game feels very ""realistic"" if you're smart about surviving you'll do just fine, maybe losing the occasional survivor to extreme circumstances. The game isn't some impressive graphical powerhouse but, honestly they are well above average and decent; lighting during the day and night cycles are great and the special zombies easily stand out from the regular ones and overall the details here and there are great, especially for a $20.00 title. Music is the game is subdued but really great; it’s fun to have a successful outing and have some music set the mood. Voice acting is... ok, it’s not laughably horrible but, not some of the greatest and you'll also end up hearing the same actor for multiple characters fairly quickly. The game is an open-world sandbox, once you're past the initial tutorial area you're free to roam about as you wish for the most part, with main story missions pushing you to new areas with a wealth of land to explore and plenty of side activities and main story missions. Beating the main story took me roughly about 15 or more hours not counting the side missions I did. You’re mileage will vary with State of Decay, but there is plenty of content here for a $20.00 purchase. TL/DR; State of Decay is a fun survival game and nails down that aspects really well, but it will soon get repetitive and if you don’t love the game within the first few hours, chances are you won’t change your mind after 15 but, for $20.00 it’s a pretty darn good video game. -Thumbs Up from RoyialVideo Reviews can be found at: www.youtube.com/user/RoyialNetwork "

												Couple of key things then a few thoughts.Its a cosole port to the PC, but its really good.It actually is pretty memory intensive, so if you may have a crash if your on an AMD card, exiting and returning often clears this up, also if you run in Big Picture mode it runs smoother.A really good Zombie game, with a need to balance resources and people. Bad thing is zombies spawn way to quick, you can clear a street and walk in a house and a zombie is looking in the window back at you. The real kicker is the missions come fast. You have to figure out what is important to you. They time out after a while to, and whatever happens happens, and you have to deal with it.  You can take a little while to decide, but again, they do expire.Overall a good fun to play Zombie setting, with some good replay ability, you will always start at the same place, but you can choose differnt things after the starting round and find differnt people and things to get into.EDIT: Also recommend Breakdown, the DLC. It adds long time playability to the game. Gives you the chance to unlock and play heroes and changing difficulties. As far as Lifeline, its OK. A good time to play once, but it didnt hold my interest beyond that.			"

												I absolutely love this game as you can see from my hours played. I have the original and Breakdown. Breakdown really added a lot of replayability. There is a continuous amount of questing that can be done with consequences of ignoring them. There are several very nice mods available on their forums as well. If the game is too easy for you then you can make it more difficult, if it is too hard you can make it easier. I personally didn't like how you could just mow down everything with vehicles so I got a mod that makes vehicles more fagile. You are able to switch characters and get them higher in their skills of fighting, running, searching, etc. If you want to play the more sneaking around and avoiding zombies then you can very easily do that. It just really allows you to play the game the way you want to play it without locking you into one way of doing this. Highly recommend this game.			"

												I saw high reviews for this game for how deep the situations you find yourself in can get and got suckered in.  The ideas are good but the execution is abysmal.  Potentially heavy moments are ruined by clunky programming that suck you right out of the moment.  When one of the survivors who have been with you from the beginning start to get sick and you have to take them to an isolated area to euthanize them, the stage is set for a gaming moment you'll remember for years.However, when you shoot that person, loot their corpse, and radio back home that you're bringing loot (really, that's the part you want to announce to your group?) and the reponse is, ""Get anything good?""  the moment is so ruined it's hard to forgive the game, particularly when this is how every moment in the game goes.  Nothing has any weight.  Do a Google search for a Would You Rather game because it's essentially the same thing.Tell someone in your current group that you looted her father's corpse, led her to believe her father might still be alive, and used the group's resources in the meantime.  Uh oh, she found out?  Time for a big conversation....or she'll just say she thought something might be wrong with her father, thank you calmly, and walk away.It's baffling to me that the creators of the game went through the trouble of setting up some interesting moments in the game and decided on zero follow through.  The combat is very much a stiff and awkward button-basher and the RPG elements play a minor role.   Every mission and every action feels weightless.  I'm leaving the game unfinished because there's just no substance here and I am truly disappointed in that.			"

												In the genre of Zombies/Zombie survival, there are a lot of duds. Games that don't really live up to the genre's hype. Infestation: Survivor Stories, Dead Island, several others. This indie title does what no game has really done, made a great game out of the genre. Made an amazing game out of the genre, in my opinion.In this game, you start out as some random guy in the beginnings of a zombie apocolypse. You find a group of people, then it turns into more of a survival management game. You have to deal with problems in your group, such as anger issues and fear, you have to befriend and keep the morale of your fellow comrades up. And, of course fight zombies. Now while the combat in this game isn't amazing, its actually really fun. Its simplistic, it doesn't try to over complicate things. You wanna smash a zombies head in, right? Of course you do, and you can do that easily. With a gun or with a blunt weapon. I enjoy the combat, but it is still in my opinion the weak point of the game. Managing your community, building new training facilities, sleeping areas and medical stations, and recruiting other survivors are a large part of the fun in this game. Its so satisfying to run through a zombie hoard and save a group of people, then have them befriend you so you can switch to them.I really enjoy that you can't just use the same character forever. They will get injured, sick, and tired. Eventually you'll need to switch to other characters. That's why it is important to do things like anger management missions and afraid missions, to befriend people in your group so you may switch to them.The visuals are fairly impressive, but nothing amazing. It runs perfectly fine on my GTX 660 with everything turned up. it definitely looks better than the xbox version, but it will not visually wow you in any way. Although the zombie design is quite impressive. My one bugbear with this game is the ammount of stuff it throws at you at once, then puts it on a time limit. I can understand why you need to do things quickly, but when i still need to gather food and medicine for my group, and then I recieve 5 other messages about missions I need to complete quickly, it can get frustraiting. Really frustrating, especially when it makes me lose influence with my tribe. I think they should either cut back on the ammount of missions you get at once, or eliminate the timer. The former sounds better in my opinion. Reguardless, this game is amazing. And even when it isn't discounted, its only 20 bucks. So incredibly cheep for a game this fun. This game has raised the bar in the Zombie genre.			"

												It's actually differed from the ""other"" zombie games. That is , because there's a character progression. You character evolves, will level his fighting if you fight alot of zombies or other traits... Also, there's a community which is actually where the whole game is based.For example, when you're searching for supplies in a house , you can choose to radio home for them back at camp to come there and take the items you selected IF you don't have room for more into your inventory. Also, When you find survivors and save them , they join your camp and grow stronger as a defense to the zombie apocalypse. In the beggining of the game , you're given a piece of wood and your kicking as your sole defense. Although it's enough for you to not die. You can choose to go out with 1 other person to help you.The noise mechanics are adequate. I would not expect anything less-more since it's good. Using cars is not safe because if you rev high, the zombies ( Zeds as they are called in SoD ) will hear it and come after you.Cars have a storage. You can store up to 5 or 6 items into it's trunk which is really useful.Also, you can hit zeds with your door.There can be different types of zeds except your normal-like zombies. Bleeehhh . ( zombie growl? )There are 2 dlc's for this game. HAve NOT bought them yet. The only major error i find is the color of the game. What i mean , is that the saturation is wrong. I dont know if its me , but... it either looks bright and strange or dark and shadow-y . It can be overlooked . "

												See my full review with screenshots at http://misstoxia.com/review-state-of-decay/State of Decay brings a new style of gameplay to the zombie game scene, incorporating third person action, RPG and community/resource management into a nice open-world zombie survival game.In the game, you control a single character at a time and can switch to others when you become friends with them. Each character has their own inventory and stats and traits that may help your community. For example, some survivors might of been a vet or doctor before the outbreak and can use the communities medical supplies more efficiently.Your community is a collection of survivors who have banded together and found a defendable home to live in, you can upgrade your home base using resources you scavenge in the world and find new survivors to recruit into your community as well as help other established communities and organize resource trades with them.The game is entirely single player but the developers have tried to give the game a more dynamic feel by making events happen in your game while you’re not playing it. I’m not too sure how I feel about this, it does make things more interesting but I don’t like having that lack of control in a single player game.Lily, your communities’ radio girl, will advise you about current events and distress signals that are happening in the world. These may include; nearby hordes that need to be wiped out, a survivor in trouble, a community member that needs help with a task, a sighting of an infestation that needs to be dealt with or even a friend at home base that needs help with their depression or anger issues.While not completing tasks and story missions you will usually find yourself exploring and looking for resources to take back home. Food tends to disappear the quickest, especially when you have a large home population, so building a garden at home or finding a reliable source of food and building an outpost there is a must.Characters can also specialize in certain fields such as blunt weapons, edged weapons or rifles, etc. Some characters will naturally be better at certain weapons or abilities depending on their traits… the main character I used was an alcoholic and she could not increase her ‘Wits’ stats at all because of that.Cars are also a big part of the game, after a while of gameplay you will notice that you eventually run out of cars if you don’t start returning them to your home base after you use them. Vehicles can be an amazing zombie killing tool but can get damaged easily after running down a few hordes, so it’s always good to build a proper workshop at home and have a mechanic to repair the good cars you find.When your community gets too large you will tend to have more problems with survivors not getting along with each other and various mental problems some survivors are having, offenders can be evicted if you don’t feel like having to deal with them and sick or dying people can even be mercy killed before they turn. Finding a bigger and better home is always something that should be on the smart survivalist’s mind when exploring.The currency of the game is influence and can be spent at community homes to buy items out of their supply locker as well as support while outside of home such as artillery strikes and car delivery. A community with well built facilities will tend to produce more items in their supply locker each day.When your character dies, you will have to play another character back at home whom you have made friends with – if you have no other player characters you respawn as a new recruit to the community with a few starting items.My biggest issue with the game would have to be the graphics. It’s not the overall quality that annoys me, but in certain locations with certain lightning I find it very hard to see which was really off-putting for me. I also had quite a few bugs that made my game’s story behave very weird, luckily I was still able to finish it.The game also has a DLC called ‘Breakdown’ which adds a never-ending gamemode that allows the player a bit more freedom than in the original game, however it should be played after you have finished the main story.I enjoyed the originality of State of Decay, I felt like I really got attached to the characters I found in the game as well as my own which is rare for a sandbox-type game and I enjoyed being able to play with a community/home management system while also getting to play in an immersive third person action RPG. Unfortunately the graphics were bad enough to make me feel ill at times.			"

The map is too small to play long time.     cannot but play for too long time with only one map.     eventhough the world is huge, there are lots of ♥♥♥♥ing useless empty spaces.- No Steam Workshop.   ㄴ this is just my hope, this doesn't really needs. but,   i think that this game' developers have never thought about :   ""more communities gather more people.""   you know, upload thier own maps, player models, weapons etc.- needs House Extension.  ㄴ this is my another opinion too,  normal map contains only 8 houses to live in,   so might be feel ""my house is freaken small to live in.""  just, i hope there is option that :  use ~~ of meterials to add more construction spacese.  i dont need more houses to live in.except theses things, everything is fine.... wait WTF ""remastered Year One Survival Edition""???do developers even have mind to develope the god damn game?

												This game is a mix between many good things and many bad things. I like this game and the thing that it tries to achieve but so many bugs and unpolished things has mad me rage quit the game 2 times. I forget about how I feel and reinstall it. Pro:Solid zombie survival with ""Realistic"" needs bars.Cons:Flipped over cars despawn if you move 50-60 yards away from itAfter interacting with a container and exiting a menu you have to repress a movement button, so if you see a zombie out of the corner of your eye, you'll most likely be grabbed.

												Certainly a game wprth buying, especially if you see it for a reduced price. ""State of Decay"" is one of the rare gems out there which seems to be made by intelligent, thinking gaming enthusiasts for gamers. It's not one of those highly polished productions you play but quickly forget afterwards, but one of the games which will keep you smiling because you just found another great detail you've been longing to see because it simply made sense to put it into such a game.Sate of Decay doesn't bore you with dumb ""game mechanics"", applied because some marketing director wanted it so. No, it delivers you an open world designed with sticking to common sense. Furthermore, the designers weren't shy to incorporate features known from gaming classics like Jagged Alliance i.e.: Every survivor you find will have some unique character traits, which will make her or him someone worth liking - or loathing. You'll quickly single out your favorite protagonists, screaming in dismay when you are ambushed by a juggernaut zombie while you are trying to run the heavy backpack home. Another detail which reminded me of Jagged Alliance is the myriad of different weapons and ammunitions you'll find. From a trusty .375 revolver to a AKMS submachine gun - you'll enjoy outfitting your favorite guy with the best gun available.The story focuses on the way people are trying to deal with the situation - including a powermongering, aims-justify-the-needs judge going slowly rogue. With people somewhere between despertion and hope the story makes the whole setting way more believable than you'd expect. It allows you to blend in, to feel the immersion a good game has to create to make it on my list of games...worth playing! The few cons I experienced are mainly of cosmetic value:The controls are a bit difficult to get into and the lack of a real manual is leaving you to guesswork. Especially moving your home confused me: Yes, you need to do a few story missions before you are allowed to move it. Good to know, better if the game would have explained it further on.At some point of the game you are spammed by a multitude of very, very similar missions: Rescue a survivor, kill a special zombie, clean out an infestation, etc. It can be annoying, but only because you are feverish about accomplishing the next ""home improvement"" and thus having no time to rescue the next jaywalking zombie apocalypse survivor.A few minor bugs are still in the game: Zombie getting stuck in porches, zombies banging their head against thin air, instead of the wall behind them, survivors running against an obstacle instead of going around. Luckily all these are not frequent and  / or easily solvable by giving  a gentle push.			"

												Apparently there's a $30 DLC for the game where all it does is increase the internal resolution of the game to 1080p?  You know, Dark Souls 2 did this and I guess these devs thought they could, too, except without putting any additional effort into remixing content, giving any discounts to owners of the original, or really any technical changes whatsoever.At least that's how it started.  By this point there have been some significant updates and patches to the new YOSE version.  Users that supported the original title and its continued development by purchasing DLC were apparently shafted, when the devs not only DIDN'T use that money for anything to fix the game, but they dumped it all into some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Free-to-Play puzzle game that has, by now, been completely shut down and failed as well as a graphical overhaul for an older game without any justification for purchase to those that have already completed the original.So now what?  What's next for Undead Labs, with their last two releases performing so miserably?  Their dev blog has been completely unrelated to game development for the past 9 months.  Probably nothing worth caring about, much like this game, which you can no longer buy and the DLC costs as much as the new game when it's on sale and doesn't support the game at all.  Who, in their right mind, could recommend a title you can even purchase?But let's extend this review to the company itself.  It has a track record of one really successful title that isn't sold anymore, an incredibly unsuccessful re-release of that same game, and a dead game.  What this only leads players to expect is either a game that isn't fun that they can't even play after some number of months or an actually good game that gets completely re-sold like a new product some time later with actual dev support behind it only the second time around.  Undead Labs is unreliable, skeevy, and unethical at best.  Watch from afar but don't touch.			"

												State Of Decay is a superb, but sometimes buggy, game. You have to rescue survivors and provide them with food, gas, ammo and other stuff while finding new resources and completing (side)quests like killing hordes and special zombie enemies, and helping (fellow) survivors out, all in a big open world that allows you to go anywhere you'd like.The graphics are pretty, but it's all a bit dark so I think most of you will have to crank up the contrast in order to be able to see anything. A minor complaint that also conveniently hides some of the uglier graphics. The sounds get the job done, it's all bit minimal if you ask me, and the voice acting has plenty of variety and is all told in a convincing manner.Unfortunately I wasn't able to progress through the story because of a game breaking bug that stopped me from getting new story missions later on. I'm still waiting for a patch for this, because I desperately want to complete this game.And even with this bug still in the game I would still highly recommend it.[Rating: 86/100]			"

												State of Decay is an odd little game.Stnading alone in the wilderness, walking through the wheat fields towards your objective, moving towards a goal.And then you smack a horde of zombies with a shovel for five minutes because shovel noises are funny.This game has a lot going for it, a large diverse map, varied objectives, and fun ways to get around, from hiding on buildings and sniping, to ramming a sports car through a horde while playing La Cucaracha.But, it throws a few too many things at you, asking you to consistantly help your allies, who you keep in base, because every time they go out, their dumb♥♥♥♥♥gets stuck in a closet by a group of zombies because they walk around with tin cans strapped to their ankles. And the repeitive nature of the combat, with is mostly runny over and smashy the zimbie zambies, doesn't have much flow to it. You come, you smack, you get retard A, you walk away.In all honesty, this game could be great, but its dragged down by a combat engine thats just not that fun after 2 hours, and a grouping of AI who lick windows on a professional level.If you like to manage dumb ants, I recommend, if you prefer to enjoy your time running over zombies in peace without HEY FRANK GO GET THAT LADY OUT OF THE PHONE BOOTH every 10 minutes, you should look elsewhere.

												Great atmosphere but akward controls for me.  Getting better with floating camera while driving.The lack of save game points adds to the realism and gravity of the game, but makes it painful to play when survivors do stupid things.   If you only have a few hours a week to play, and make one mistake (always carry 3 melee weapons) I find the lack of save game points really ruins the game for me. Having to restart and go grind through the quests again is not fun.			"

												It's a gem. Still a bit rough, covered in (some) dirt and might need some extra cutting and polishing but it is a gem nevertheless. It's not awesomely perfect on the technical side (could have used a little more effort on the controls/interface for the PC version, for instance) but Undead Labs delivered the almost-nearly-perfect Zombie Apocalypse experience you can have within a game world today. This is the zombie game I always wanted to play and to enjoy for countless hours. They tried to add everything the ""zombie genre"" has, cramming it all inside a gaming experience and they succeeded in that. In this game you have everything you want your zombie survival game to have: a persistent and open world (that keeps on going even when your computer is turned off!), facilities to build and manage, resources to gather, trust to gain, pep talks, scavenging, gossip, pills, vehicles to drive (and to break down to pieces), people to care for (or to abandon to their fate if you don't trust/like them or if you are that kind of survivor), a lot of zombie head-bashing, a wide array of melee and ranged weapons, skills to improve (including useless and funny ones!), tons (and I mean TONS) of inside jokes, easter eggs and homages to the genre (The Kirkman Residence? McDermott's Tavern?), and a (virtually) never ending experience if you play with the Breakdown DLC (in that case, you skip the main storyline but you go on as long as you have at least one character alive). Co-op is missing. Co-op would have been great but, even as a solo game, State of Decay is a lot of fun, which is reason enough to play it, but you also start to enjoy it a bit more and more as you discover all the little details that are revealed only with an extensive playthrough. You need food, sleep, meds, gas, ammo (and not just generic ammo, but the right ammo type for your gun) and you need to find a good place to call home. A defendable one. To be on the (relative) safe side you will also need at least a doctor or someone trained in medicine, tool experts, carpenters and someone who can cook a good meal once in a while! A workshop where to build homemade sound suppressors for your guns or molotov cocktails is a must! Keep an eye on the morale of your community too. Don't let them fall to their fears and always resolve their anger issues (shouting matches lower community's happyness!). You start with one character only (well, two, in the main storyline) but you can swap to other survivors as you bring them to your community and only if you earn their trust. Bear in mind: dead is dead. If your character dies, it's gone, no matter how much time you invested in him/her. No matter if he/she was the ""hero"". And they can die in a lot of ways, even when you are not controlling them. They can go missing on a supply run (but you are given a chance to go look for them), get sick or be eaten alive while you ask them to watch your back. And when you run out of characters... well... new game, I guess! If you love zombies and everything about zombie survival and that it's the end of the world feeling, this is the game for you.			"

Other than that, the game did  awesome job creating a fantastic atmosphere of the post-apocalypse-walking-dead world. The combat is kinda challenging, but this is not L4D2 or other zombie-slashing game, the survival of the community is the main goal. The game mechanics could be more sophisticated, and also more maps/quests, but considering this is a indie game, I am still pretty content.			"

												This game is good but I dislike the model they used to pay for it. It really feels like they broke the end of the game and the missions off the game and are selling it as ""DLC."" The end is extremly abrupt, and the DLC came out a couple weeks after the game did. Seems like a cheesy way to get an extra 7 bucks. That said, its a good zombie game. I like the home base mechanic, it makes it feel like you have somewhat of a safe zone without ever being truly safe. I agree with some of the other posters that the cars make things far to easy. It would be nice if the cars or other loud noises put the zombies into a sort of 'frezy' mode, where they did more damage or something. Despite the warning not to use cars, I usually drove everywhere in one, because it was not only the fastest way but also the eaisiest way. The story is decent but nothing really new, but then you wouldn't be looking at a zombie game if you really wanted 'new"" now would you?			"

												This game is tons of fun but a bit hard to figure out at first.  The first month of play was filled with new discoveries of how characters could level up and how clearing out zombies in some areas and building outposts would really help your runners claim ground.  This game is a good mix of action/simulation and will be enjoyable to any fan of the zombie genre.Pros- Lots of replayability- Huge Areas to Explore- Challenging Gameplay, especially with Expansion- Lots of different weapons, items, and resources for creative and interesting ways to survive the zombie hordes- Lots of different ways to build your survivors- Fairly Cheap- Customizable home base location and build, minor strategy elementsCons- No multiplayer =/  (Seriously, if this game was multiplay it would be amazing)- Story is meh- UI is non-intuitive and not well explained by the tutorial- Can sometimes be annoying to get other survivors to join you, early game is especially annoying- Game has a steep learning curve, especially in the beginning- Not enough map control/strategy elementsOverall, the game is a lot of fun and I'd recommend getting it if you're bored and looking for a fun zombie simulation experience with some RPG, Strategy, and action elements thrown in.

												I don't know how to describe the AMAZING quality of this game. This is ALL i have EVER wanted in a zombie game. It kinda reminds me of fallout. Anyway, the reasons i love it is:1. Free roam.2. Huge map.3. Has missions which you can do but are not obligatory.4. I love the fact that alongside the missions, you also need to find and recruit survivors, go scavenging to survive and also just generally look after your community and main base.5. I love the fact that you can set up outposts as well as a main base,6. The NPC survivors that you play alongside with are not stupid. they will go out on missions and scavenge on their own without you doing ANYTHING. Some will fall sick and die. And a lot usually get injured or merely tired. I also like that you can switch survivors to give the other ones a rest. All the survivors also have different abilities.7. It has cars. So it's basically just GTA with zombies in it.8. It's not JUST zombies you are fighting. The army also comes in, sets up outposts, and kills anything that gets in their way, wether it is a survivor or a zombie, they kill it.9. I love the building feature. You can select empty spots in your home base and build different facilities ike guard towers, medical facilities, fighting arenas and even farms. Of course to do this you need to find building resources so again, you need to scavenge a lot.10. The NPCs are really stong. If you're are going out on a missions, you can ask a couple of people to come and help you out. A group of 4 survivors could easily take around 200-300 zombies.11. And there is SO many more features taht are awesome that it would take ages to write them down.Anyway, if you have 20$ and like zombie games, this is the absolute BEST place to spend those 20$ and I guarrantee you will not regret it.

												This is not a bad game. It is a pretty fun game. But nor is it a good game. It starts out in a camping resort of some sort. The starting area is of course very easy and helps you out to get the hand on the controls and mechanics. It is much more of a survival zombie game than for example Left 4 Dead or all those other FPS zombie games. It is not as hardcore as DayZ although. But I still liked it and I just finished it after restarting. From my understanding it is a smaller studio backed by Microsoft behind it and I say they made a good job. I did not notice many bugs or glitches. Graphics are decent and controls not bad -IF- you have a controller. It is also nice that you can avoid zombies and try sneaking (Which I didn't do much). As said the focus is more on survival and gathering resources and survivors for your home base instead of wildly shooting cause that will have you dead if you are ill prepared. And a dead character stays dead. The characters you gather all have diffrent traits and ""personalities"". Which is interesting at  first but later on proves to be shallow. Non the less the more you gather the more room you need, the more food you need and so on.  Sadly the game do become a bit of a rince and repeat after a while when every mission is ""Oh no we seen a special zombie out here"" ""Create noise to make the zombies do this while I plunder"" or ""Oh no scavengers in need of help"". Also we got the ""Sadness, anger, fear"" traits where you just tell your friends that you and him/her are going to smack some zombies the old fashion way. This is one of the more annoying missions since they just about killing zombies and put you at risk just to appease some of the idiots in your crew. There is also missions to save or help other survivor groups. These could be so much more if they deepended the social mechanics and maybe added in more of an RPG mindset to the game. The map is pretty damn big too and I did not scavenge much outside of any of the  three settlements. The country side is not that appealing since it is mostly wastes of land you drive through to g et to your next objective. But this adds to the atmosphere since it is supposed to be a small county with a large farming community. This is a clusterf*** of a review but I still think the strong parts is the survival part, the less focus on action. The tiny bit of social interaction and dialogue (even if the voice actors where like 3-4? Least it beats the 2  guys making the voices for Skyrim! Hue hue) The atmosphere can be great at times and some vistas are nice.BUT. The game is bit to much of a repeat, there could been more interaction with your group and the others. The Wilkerson have some interesting missions but not much more than them being a bit of the Merle of State of Decay and then nothing happens. The game also would be much much much better with co-op or multiplayer where each player runs their own group. The special zombies are also kinda a pain the♥♥♥♥♥ This must be some kind of thing from L4D. To end it, yes I do recommend it if you want a open world zombie survivor game and zombie movie lovers will see many references. Also! ♥♥♥♥ you Ed for being such a cry baby. God damnit.			"

												Fans of the Zombie Apocalypse genre should not pass this one up.  It is a good game despite its flaws.To me, this game feels like what Dead Island should have been.  Things like having actual resource needs for your group and the ability to build and upgrade structures in your home base really help the game stand out from your generic zombie slaying fair.  Also the fact that events can happen while you are not playing, while it can be annoying, makes for a fairly unique game.I also really like the fact that you can be overwhelmed by zombies if you are by yourself and you aren't careful.  You can't just run out in the street and start mowing down zombies with an unsurpressed assault rifle.  For one, you'll quickly deplete your ammo supply.  And the other reason is because all the noise will draw out all the zombies in the surrounding area and you'll likely be overrun.  It really helps to add some tension when you are a long ways from home on a supply run and you're low on health and don't have a ride nearby.Unfortunately, the game is not perfect, and there are a few particular areas I feel the game is lacking.  The first of which to me is the camera.  The views for when you are executing zombies can sometimes make it impossible to see whats happening.  Also, the fact that you are encouraged to use foliage to hide from zombies, but the bushes/trees don't dim and go transparent when close to the screen makes for more times when you can't see anything.Another feature I think this game could sorely use is some sort of weapon modding feature.  Coming off of playing Payday 2 with its amazing amount of weapon mods available, this game has none other than applying one of a few types of suppressor to guns.  It would be awesome if you found a weapon expert survivor and you could then mod your stocks, optics, foregrips and such but, alas, its not possible.And finally, perhaps the biggest ommission that could have really made this game a gem is its lack of a multiplayer mode.  While you can ask other survivors to accompany you and help out, you can't get them to pick up supplies or give them any orders when they are with you.  They also have a tendancy to follow you right up your butt and then block doorways behind you.  The AI just isn't a good substitute for a few good buddies.Still, despite lacking in some areas, this game is a fun single-player experience.  To me, it did a decent job of capturing the spirit of zombie apocalypse survival.  I'm hoping the game has a sequel with a bit more polish to put it into GOTY territory.			"

												This game has its moments. It can be buggy, windowed mode only accessible via alt+enter and the lighting at night is horrendous. Other than that it feels like your surviving and you can lose characters if your careless. This game isn't about smashing in zombies with giant pink ♥♥♥♥♥♥ but surviving.Plus you get neat kill animations.			"

												Fantastic game for those looking for that certain zombie game style most other studios seem to just not quite get.  Obviously, it has its issues.  Between the many graphical glitches, zombies attacking through walls, and vehicle...usage in any capacity...it still manages to produce an overall fun experience.  Perma-death is not really a major concern and the difficulty seems to be a bit random at times (especially in the last few missions).  Also, the open world seems waaayyy too vast and empty.  But all that aside, at the end of the day, it was quite enjoyable and forced me to continue playing till the end (thanks to continuing resource consumption while not playing).			"

												The very first zombie free roam survival game. Every car you take and break wont ever spawn again. Food and items you loot from places wont ever spawn in the same building again. This is how you make a true survival game. Zombies can whoop your butt depending if you know how to handle a group. Get to control your base and say yes or no to people that want to join your group. Only thing you have to watchout for is if you dont talk to the your group members they will dislike you or become depressedTHIS IS A MUST HAVE GAME!!			"

												State of Decay is one of the most realistic zombie games I've played, the game itself is a Sand box, role, third person. It is that you are a survivor and you have to find a ""community"" where fit, difficulty itself is already hard but that's what makes it so desirable, seeking supplies (materials, food, medicine, gasoline), but lacks this cooperative touch. In my opinion if you want to know how serious a zombie apocalypse (as it is also considered as a simulator) and want a game that will charge you many hours (which are well worth) I would buy this game.State of Decay es uno de los juegos de zombies más realistas que he visto, en si el juego es un Sand box, rol, tercera persona. Se trata de que eres un sobreviviente y tienes que encontrar una ""comunidad"" donde encajar, la dificultad en si ya es difícil pero es lo que lo hace tan deseable, el encontrar suministros (materiales, comida, medicinas, gasolina), pero le falta ese toque cooperativo. en mi opinión si quieren saber como seria un apocalipsis zombie (ya que también se consideraría como simulador) y quieren un juego que les cobrara varias horas (que valen la pena) yo compraría este juego.

												This is probably the best game I have ever played. It's a mix of GTA, action rpg and house building/management. Feels like your in 'The walking Dead'. Micro management, Permanent character deaths (important because you can switch to these people) permanent vehicle loss. You have to maintain everything. Little missions constantly pop up to distract you from the main incentive (pursuing these can save playable characters lives)Setting up a camp- deciding what buildings to develop (med, ammo, sniper nests etc)Talking to people that are depressed/have issues helps more than you realiseIf you send someone on a mission to collect resources they will physically go across the map and attempt to collect and return. You must kit them out well if you dont want them to die. If they die, any resources they collected will drop at the place of death.Few details like this make this game special.LOADS of weapons/ammo types/items. Shooting is perfect, the lighting is beautiful. Its a reminder of why we play games and where the medium is going.There's still a few bugs with the zeds. sometimes it can go through the walls and able to dmg the characters throught itThe start of this game does not do it justice.

												This game preface, idea, and game play is all cool. What can be uncool though is when you lose a character and you've invested so much time in them, you begin wondering how to turn off the auto save. Just a heads up before I start I couldn't believe when I was playing that this game isn't multiplayer - and that the idea of working with other people (or friends) would be awesome. I repeat : THIS GAME IS NOT MULTIPLAYER. Does that mean don't play it? Depends...The story goes you are a man who stumbled into town and upon exploring you find a church full of survivors. A bit later into the story, you hear the military has also set up an outpost in the town but on the other side. You go see them, and you find out that they really couldn't care less, and that they recommend you leave immediately. The gameplay itself is pretty good - consisting of a 3rd person view and being capable to control more than 1 character... but you can only control one at a time. You can tell other characters to follow you and assist you or you can tell them to come search a location that you've cleared. There are times though where you are faced against this giant zombie boss and all you have is two bullets and a broken machete hoping to take this guy out (so FYI if you hate a bit of grinding in games you may dislike this). The repairing can become a nuisance, but building repair shops or first aid centers (of a few things that you can do) add a bit of depth to the game and really make it feel like it's yours. Another cool feature is when you clear out zombies you are able to set up another ""home-base"". Cars, weapons, items and so forth are found while you free-roam the map. Look-out points can be discovered and climbed which makes identifying what's in the surrounding environment a little easier.I like this game, I would like it even more if it had multiplayer. I enjoy playing it but some would put it as a time killer. Either way though if your looking for an open world zombie game this may be for you. RATING : 7.25/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign B+ Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music B Replay-ability C Overall  B-EDIT : Just beat the game... once it's beat it's sort of bland. Yes there's DLC but if your like me and do not like DLC this game is a good 14-15 hour run. There's also those who like to run around in an open world and just shoot zombies. If you like that then go nuts. I found the game to be worth the purchase on sale, sort of found it short.			"

												This is possibly the best zombie game I have ever played!I know I know... Walking Dead from Telltale studios has great story, Killing Floor is fun zombie smashing, survival, co-op game, Left 4 Dead gives you the opportunity to challange your strategies against other players in versus games. Dead Island is fun co-op storyline game with skill tree and weapons crafting. etc... But this one ... It's such a shame it is not a co-op game. It's everything you ever wanted in a game that puts you inside of zombie apocalypse (maybe not everything, didn't find out yet if you also fight other survivors, but I wouldn't miss that anyway). Things you gonna do in this game:Gather supplies, fortify (upgrade) your safehouse, help other survivors, kill special zombies, train your survivors community, make the areas safe (by killing zombies), drive cars (kill zombie hordes with cars), play more than one character (get eaten by zombies)...Despite the lil bit oldish graphics and the absence of co-op mode I recommend State Of Decay for every zombie games fan out there. ps. the absence of co-op is the main thing that upsets me about this game, 2 or 4 players co-op would put this game on the TOP of zombie games charts.  score: 8/10edit: if you have any questions about this game, feel free to ask in the comments below			"

												I was a little put off that this game is 3rd person and the screen shots but I quickly found it to be an absolute joy.  Between scouting for resources, building your home (base) and helping / recruiting other survivors it is a zombie genre fans dream.   My only issue with it is that the main story is short but it can be replayed numerous times as it changes each game.  Breakdown isn't worth the price tag, although it is a good add-on to just have a pure sandbox mode.			"

												TL;DR: Crashes, bad performance & glitchy controls - but good gameplay and nice feeling, worth discounted price!WALL OF TEXT:NOTE: Review of the base game only, didn't play the DLCs, which are basically separate games, you pick which game to play when you start it, which is also something I like, good proper DLC.But first, what I liked: gameplay! It's a nice game, it got me addicted and I finished it in a few days.It probably was too easy because I was overstocked on food and medicine most of the time, but that's probably because I didn't have many breaks in between plays (the game simulates time passing when you're not playing).And at certain locations it gets suddenly very difficult for some reason... that is, if you're packing light, but I suggest you get alot of ammo on you and two melee weapons just in case one decides to go all broken on you.Story-wise was ... ok I guess, it's a generic zombie outbreak.A.I. is good enough, sometimes they take some time to decide if they should get in the friggin' car.Cars are arcade and have nice effects on them, I like how the zombies cling on to your car =) ... but physics aren't really on their side, I had one incident where a guy was standing really close to a car, when I got in that car, the car got thrown into space, that was nice.Additionally, worst example of car physics on that bridge... when you have to cross it back, you'll know which one I mean, I strongly suggest you don't try to jump it with a car when going back and just grab an NPC backup and go down the river, with ALOT of ammo.Animations are kinda funny, not really realistic, kinda arcade, they're acceptable.Sound and music are ok, didn't pay much attention which means they didn't bother me.Now, performance, it runs really poorly, I had to add some tweaks to make it more playable but even then I have slowmotion issues and some stuttering, low FPS and all that... but that's not the biggest concern.The biggest issue with this game is the control:- Delay when you're able to move after exiting a menu/car/etc, never experienced this in any other game, it's very annoying;- Sometimes it makes you go backwards when you press W after exiting a car;- Really bad mouse control, can barely aim for some reason in this game, where as in other TPS games I have no problem;- One character of mine died because she wouldn't aim the friggin gun so I could shoot the swarm of zombies that was following me... I don't know what happened, didn't happened before or after that, she was stuck on attacking melee for some reason, even though I was only holding mouse 2 and clicking mouse 1... gotta be the ignore-controls-whenever-I-feel-like-it-glitch that I encounter in some other games as well, which is directly linked to performance :/Then there's the crashes, sometimes just crashes mid-mission when I scavaged alot of houses and have a trunk full of stuff (and the fact that I'm in a mission doesn't allow the game to save), so, gotta do all that stuff again.And it also always crashes when I quit the game for some reason, and it's the hidden message behind black screen kind of crash which makes you stand and watch a black screen with the game cursor moving around without knowing the game is actually frozen like that because there's a message behind it.... yey for focus priority.EDIT:Oh, and fire bombs are friggin' useless, use grenades or distractions instead.

												State of Decay is a open world survival game that will please fans of the genre with its own unique ideas and a focus on character permadeath.   --------Final Thoughts at the bottom--------GameplayThe gameplay is all about survival, it really makes you feel like you want to live. This is mainly due to the fact that if the character you are playing at the time is somehow killed, then they are dead for the rest of the game. Their is no way to bring them back to life, this makes you think twice about just trying to hack your way through hordes of zombies. Throughout the game their are moments, such as events or story missions that will pop up, about other survivors in trouble, completing these missions brings more survivors to your base. The higher your populations the more well defended you are and the more characters you have to switch out with to play. Each survivor has its owns traits and sets of skills. These skill levels can be raised by performing the activity related to the skill. For example your shooting goes up the more you use weapons, or stamina will increase the more you use the character to run around and loot with that character. However the more survivors you have at your base, the more supplies you will need to take care of them all. This means you need to go out and collect more loot.You collect resources such as medical, building and weapon supplies, by entering abondoned buildings and searching for cuboards, draws, boxes etc.. that are highlighted white. When a supply stash is found you put it into a dufflebag and take it back to base. This however limits how much you can take at a time, if you have a vehicle you can store duffle bags in the back but if you are without a vehicle you may also radio back to base and have another runner come out to get the rest. However doing this will put that runner at risk of attack by zombies and if they run into trouble you may need to go out to save them. You may also loot various other things in buildings such as weapons, medical supplies, and food. Different weapons have different strengths and weaknesses. The weight of some weapons will also effect how some characters can swing them depending on thier strength. The controls feel very well done and accurate, whether its swinging a weapon, shooting a gun or driving a vehicle, it all feels smooth. GraphicsThe graphics are nice, I wouldn't say they are amazing or anything, although their are some breathtaking areas within the game world. The zombies look well done and their are a decent amount of models that are used so it doesnt feel like your killing the same thing over and over, however their is only one model for each special infected. The animation is good and feels lively. Although sometimes I did feel like, for how fast my character was running I wasnt going very far distance wise. The swinging and shooting looks good and my framerate never dropped even while fighting multipul zombies and Im only on a medium spec PC.AudioThe sound in the game is good. When out in the woods you can hear the birds and crickets around you. When in town the lumbering steps of zombies can be heard all around you. The foot steps sound realistic for the type of platform your character is on at the time. Guns sound good and hitting zombies with melee weapons sounds satisfying.The voice over work is good, nothing fabulous or game changing, but its good. Their are multipul different characters taht are all voiced however some of them sound like they were voiced by the same person and didnt even try to sound different.StoryThier is not much to say story wise. There is a story that will eventually lead you out of the city and end the game. However the story plot is basic and it seems like it was just shoved in their to appease some people who want to complete it, but it is not neccesary. Final thoughtsOverall, State of Decay is a great game that is definetly worth the time for anyone whos a fan of survival or zombie games. It is a large world to explore and loot with many different survivors to save and add to your community. The game has some fresh ideas from other zombie survival games, and these ideas are portrayed very well. The visuals are nice and the animation is good. The permadeath may set some people off from this game, also if you are looking for a story, this may not be the game for you.In my opinion this is one of my favourite PC games and is fully worth the full price, however be aware that their is a remastered HD version coming out soon so you may want to hold onto your money for that one. (EDIT: After the release of the remastered version I would still recommend this version over the newer one. The new one just spruced the visuals up a bit but change very little in terms of gameplay. If you want to save some money, just get this version.)			"

												state of decay is an amazing game and a fresh addition to the zombie genre. this game is comparable to GTA but with zombies in it. the gameplay is very fun and the game can be unforgiving at times since your main characters can die and end up losing all their stats. the story is good however most of the time i just found myself roaming and trying to get supplies for my crew. another unique thing about this game is that it still keeps going afte yous top playing it. so you can stop anytime you want and come back and see youre population has increased or see you're almost running out of supplies.The DLC for this game is pretty good as well however not for everyone. while the main state of decay can be enough if youre looking for a more challenging experience Breakdown DLC is a must have since it takes place in the same map however each playtrhough makes the zombies tougher and the game becomes harder with scarce resources and more frequent zombie encounters.LIfeline DLC is another storyline and it takes place in a different location offering new characters, weapons, and map. again i would recommend this one since its very fun as well as Trumbull Valley was.overall i would definitely recommend this game. 8.5/10			"

												Gotta be one of the funnest zombie survival games! The only thing missing is coop play.Give a feeling of really surviving and making decisions that can cost lives of people in the group. Can kick people from the group as well as allow people to join. Most people I had was 28 but could have easily went higher. managing food and other resources works well without being too much like a chore. if you build outposts around/near homebase and space them out right then you can make a safezone that keeps the home area pretty clear. if you want more of a challenge then move to a urban environment and leave unprotected areas near homebase. Ive had infestations right across the street from home and it made for a lot of activity to always clean or have it spill into he homebase. there are small issues with ai blocking doors sometimes and getting in the way of firebombs and traps but its not a huge deal.when you have looted an area items do not respawn so after a while you have to keep going farther and farther from home to get supplies. so it makes you feel like you really need to move to a different area to make things easier.

I hope not...)... game 1 lost...Bought Microsoft ""Flight"" because it was going to revolutionize the flight simulator genre... even though it was going to be hundreds of DLC packs to get a proper map going, I was ""in""... ended up getting Hawaii and Alaska before they called it quits... I still have it on steam here but when Microsoft gave up on it, the multiplayer side of it disappeared over night and there is only so much of Hawaii and Alaska you can see before you want more--a meere fraction of the content that was promised, that got me to buy in... game 2 lost...Bought this game here on Steam... full of bugs, unresponsive controls, glitchy animations... and as you can read from other posts: instead of patching this game, they remaster it (addressing the bugs) and then sell it as a whole new game... I only played this game fewer than 10 hours but more than the 2 required to get a refund... there are much better games in this genre from much less unscrupulous publishers.			"

Recommended: A solid action-RPG with survival elements which is diminished by some bugs and some jankiness in the game design.  Despite the flaws, State of Decay gives a compelling zombie experience.  This would easily be one of the best zombie survival games out there if only it had a co-op mode.Read the full review here[www.highlandarrow.com] "

												They updated the game but forced us to pay for it.The current version for any original State of Decay owners who bought prior to the YOSE edition are pretty screwed.The game doesnt even launch or run properly and unless you fork up the dough for the paid update, you're stuck with this broken game.

												It doesn't bode well when the first thing you see on loading a game is a screen trying to sell you other stuff.I found the controls and interface to be clunky. The third-person perspective was far worse than a first-person one - sometimes I couldn't even see my character because a bush was between him and the camera. They also made continuous inane comments to tell me if a room was empty or not. There are bizarre and overly-complicated systems. The best example of that - normally you might climb to a high point and look around. You don't need to make it more complex than that. But in this game there are special ""high points"" which then circle things all around - even if your character can't see them because the view is blocked by trees. Oh, I came to a locked car. I had a huge piece of wood, but couldn't break the windscreen to get in.I'm sure many could enjoy this, but I felt like the game was pushing me away right from the start. Hope you enjoy it more than I did.			"

												This is one of those games that, when you think about it objectively is kinda monotonous but when you're playing it feels compelling and somehow manages to hit your reward centers. The problem is that it has bugs and general shoddiness coming out the♥♥♥♥♥ It's a shame because the thought of a good open world zombie/survival game gives me chubbs.The main reason I recommend you don't buy this game at the moment is that it suffers from a serious but common bug where you stop getting new missions and so cannot progress through the game, you are relegated to just doing random side missions. Apparently this problem has existed since the middle of last year and still hasn't been fixed.			"

												A ambitious survival game unfinished, like a beta version. Has good graphics and a wonderful sandbox mechanics but important glitches too: sometimes crush to desktop and every play one or two keys stop respond, among other programing bugs, as generate corrupted dump files. No solutions, only exit and restart the last saved game. Also, third person camera works really badly in close combat, little places and vehicles: a view in first person would be essential. Has a lot of good concepts but not fine implemented. You can develop structures, but not objects; items non exist out of containers. The inventories are based in slots more than the space and weight. The hand weapons wear out fast and the vehicles are weak and deteriorate quickly by outrages and collisions. There are ways to automatic repairing but are slow because depend on daily cycles.You cannot sleep ingame and act by night has more contras than pros, specially when sometimes foes can pass through walls or doors or appear in the air, all by graphics glitches.The survivors react very slowly against the most amazing zombies ever seen: are fast, strong and resistant. The close combats against a dozen or less are lethal, even if they do not attack at once, just by the loss of endurance. They have a great hearing capacity that restricts use of fire weapons, the sound attracts them quickly, with accuracy and in increasing numbers. They can open doors without breaking them and climb fences. Usually they appear by surprising just at side or behind the player, or only when exits the car. They attack the vehicles fiercely, smashing the bodywork and doors to push the people off. Definitelly are much more than zombies or infected.A downloable content lets to play infinite times with a increasing levels of challenge, but the difficultly soon becomes into exaggerated and game turns repetitive after few levels because always is the same map and way to survive to next level is same. Anyway, when characters reach max skills levels and have a lot of items, there is no motivation to continue, like an arcade game, but this is more complicated, generating a bad sense of frustration and waste of time.And after all, when runs fine proves to be very addictive for the most perseverant fans, but never advisable to normal players by the amount of bugs and defects of finished. A good oportunity lost, maybe by time exigencies and budget problems of an indie study based on crowdfunding. The result, a sum of mixed ideas from several mithical games, sure would have been wonderfull a decade ago, but lacks the technical finish and a adaptation of those concepts to the requeriments of nowdays. A pitty, but a second part will be better, if designers learn of their errors.			"

												Zombies are NOT why I play State of Decay. The undead trope is wearing thin, but the reason to play this game is found in the group dynamics of the random survivors you encounter. For me, the draw was wondering who I'd meet next, and what skill they'd bring to my camp. In this way, State of Decay manages to foster a real sense of loss when a survivor dies. You'll genuinely miss what they brought to the table as all of their upgraded parish with them. That the combat, stealth and exploration are above serviceable is just extras on top of a great foundation.			"

												I'm completely done with this game.  It changes the rules on you at random, it perma-kills characters basically out of nowhere, and it does that god-awful thing where if you don't play it for several days, you come back to find the NPCs have used up your stuff off-screen.That aside, the engine is buggy and inconsistant.  Zombies can jump fences that players can't, and only take damage sometimes.  Hit detection is mediocre at best and completely bonkers at worst, explosion radius' don't always take cover into account (which will absolutely punish you sometimes), and the meandering, mindless directions the game keeps trying to pull you relentlessly towards only serve to irritate.All in all, the execution is infuriatingly under-thought.  Never, ever, EVER punish a player right off the bat for not knowing rules that haven't been stated or shown.  Permakilling characters out of nowhere is the worst possible thing you can do, and these guys seem to love doing it repeatedly.There will never be anything that fixes this game.  Drop it, uninstall it, and avoid it forever.			"

												State of Decay is a marvelous well developped game, and replayable as hell. For the first hundred hours or so only. This game is a loop, where you grind for survivors, items and materials. Its devestating when you lose ANYTHING, especially a survivor. Although, after some training and good survivors (those hundred hours), you are essentially invincible. I am on Breakdown level 25, and I haven't lost a single survivor since breakdown 7. This is because the surviors I have trained, are like 5 Schwarzeneggers just running around merking everything. Juggernauts can't stand a chance. This game would be more fun if the campaign wasd actually a campaign, instead having 0 story, but many missions. I've given up on this game, Gameplay 9/10, Story 0/10, Replayability 5/10. Don't buy unless on sale. This is a positive review because the game is still good, but lacking.			"

												Probably one of the best zombie games around, usually they're bland, boring, uninteractive and just the same thing over and over. Not to mention completely and horribly broken with poor voice acting, animations, movement, controls and optimisation (I'm looking at you, Dead Island)This, however, is the opposite. It's not only got a bit of uniqueness to it but it's actually good. Rather than write a wall of text I guess I'll do a list of pros and cons.Pros:- Well optimised- Nice, balanced combat- Not a zombie game that concentrates on firearms, rather a sensible mix of both melee and ranged- Makes the player use their brain, strategy is important in this game, going scavenging without a plan is a death wish- The AI is actually helpful- Pretty nice graphics and sound- RPG-like elements which're good for levelling each of your combat-able survivors at camp for different roles- Always something going on to keep you busy- There's other survivors in the world that you can get friendly with, the friendlier you are the more likely they are to help- No intrusive HUD, leaves the screen wide open for players to see everything they need- 3rd person games aren't usually terrifying, however this is. If you're stuck alone outside at night with hordes surrounding you, you'll be scared to move just in case they hear you. - The survivor you're playing as gets tired as they explore, or they get injured the more fights they get into, it adds realism to the game- Building on the above pro, character switching is seamless and easy.- It's just an awesome gameCons:- Voice acting isn't fantastic, but it isn't as bad as some. You'll hear everything survivors say after a few lines of dialogue before they start repeating themselves. However, this is an indie game and the gameplay more than makes up for it- An unfortunate lack of co-op play, I'm not sure whether or not the devs are looking into it for the 2nd expansion, I hope so because it would be a lot of fun!- It seems as though you're made to play round the clock, as one survivors goes to rest or heal up, you have to play as another and go out to explore. Whilst it does add more gameplay value, I'd prefer to run around in daytime more often- The addon - Breakdown - removes the storyline element from SoD, allowing you to do whatever you want to. You can do that in the base game, just don't complete the last story mission, however it's still worth getting- Sometimes zombies like to get stuck under things, making it impossible to kill them. It's especially irritating when they're an enemy you need to kill for a mission.I'm sure I've forgotten some things, but overall it's an awesome game, it's worth the £15 I paid for it.			"

												I enjoy this game quite a bit. Its an open sandbox but its limited by the fact that resources do not respawn. You can Run out of resources but you should be able to beat the game well before that point. Fights can quickly go from your favor to HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥A HORD JUST TUNRED THE BLOCK AND SAW ME!! Stealth plays its part quite well. Sure sometimes you wanna run and gun but you will quickly find out that sometimes its better not to fight. The random Events give it a very nice feel but they do not become problems later on. I would give this game a 7.5/10. Nothing higher because could have done more with it the game but what is here is well done. Also more outpost options. I would like to see the ability for outposts to be used as mini-forts not just resource points and Anti Hord landmine zones.			"

												I'm slightly on the fence over this game. It's fun the first time through. It'll take you about ten hours to get through the entire main storyline IF you take your time. It took me twelve hours to beat it and then I didn't want  to play it anymore; however, the DLC makes it much more playable for repeated runs.Y'see, the problem with State of Decay is that it just repeats scenarios, over and over. You wind up doing the same thing so much that you start losing interest. Sometimes tedious little quests will pop up that you don't want to do, but you have to, otherwise, the game will end before you get to the end. And that sucks, trust me.The good things about it, though, is the strange array of characters that you can gather. Most survivors that are in your group you can play as and each survivor has a different set of characteristics (some traits make the character better. Some traits make the character worse). If a character in your group gets infected, you can ask them to leave, let them stay and do nothing about it or kill them. You have to keep track of your supplies too. You can't survive a zombie apocalypse without any food, so, if you have the materials for it, you can actually build a garden for a steady supply of food at your base... Farmville rip-off (THAT WAS A JOKE, DO NOT TAKE ME SERIOUSLY!).It's a good game. It's not amazing, but it's worth at least checking out.If you get State of Decay, I highly recommend that you also get the DLC (Breakdown) as well. It's basically ""endless mode"" for the game, rather than stopping when you hit the final mission. Unless you're only looking for about ten hours of gameplay: the DLC is a must!Is it worth twenty dollars? Probably not. Is it worth ten? Yeah, I think so.			"

												All in all,State of Decay is a really nice zombie-survived,sandbox,free-choice,third-person fighting&shooting game existing on the steam market for open selling.Maybe it has some obvious drawbacks,such as lacking multiplayer which can bring players extensive and various ways of fun like what the Day'Z did,only game controller plugged but no keyboard functioned during the very first pre-released period can get you feel annoyed,and not satisfied first-hand game experience cuz this is a transplanted  game originly from Xbox,not PC.BUT,after we rule out these disappointed or unfinished aspects,we would find many shining spots on this unique game which is full of creative and inspiring.First and the most crucial point I wanna talk about is the different characteristics and abilities for each unique person portrayed in the game.Every person appeared shows his differernt and outstanding parts from others,someone's good at combat skills and another's fond of life skills like cooking,etc.This helps them look like fresh creatures wanna stay alive during this unexpected chaos and interact with other people,environment and situation naturally.These's gonna have happiness and sadness,luck and misery,hesitation and resolution among devastated people.I have to admit this setting is awesome.Personally,I think the graphics and sound are good,too.It also contains highly freedom,open map,sandbox.You can consider it as a zombie version of GTA.Meanwhile,the cost for this game is comparably low.You have to spend more the twice money to buy Day'Z.I mean when you have extra money and dont wanna play with other players in zombie types.State of Decay is a good choice for you.

												Unpolished yet enjoyable arpg take on Zafehouse Diaries.  The biggest design flaw is the focus on a storyline/campaign versus a sandbox/roguelike approach.  Yes, there's a sandbox DLC (which quite frankly should have come with the base game) but ultimately the developers would have been better off fleshing out the core mechanics of scavenging, community recruitment, and base building rather than tacking on a campaign.Visually the game is an eyesore with incomprehensible levels of post processing and warped constrast filters -- fortunately there are some handy mods and configuration files out there that make it more presentable.  Overall a great concept with slightly above mediocre execution.			"

												A great entry to the zombie game market. Game doesn't focus on any single one character (As your encouredged to take out diffrent people from your camp via a fatguie system). Game does continue while your not playing, resources are consumed, events might be missed and so on. Though the effect of this decreses as time goes on. So missing a few months, is about the same as not playing for a week or so. Gameplay is alot of search, loot, return, run over a horde of zombies in your pickup truck going backwards. A good deal of fun. Breakdown (DLC) adds some replayability, but not too much new too the overall gameplay.			"

You can build a home base and outpost and upgrade your home base, you can search for other survivors which u can play after u saved them, you can search for supplies and weapons. For a 2gb download, this game sure gives endless fun,♥♥♥♥♥♥tons to do and tons of replayability with random events.

												One of the better realistic zombie survival games I have played. Everything is auto saved as you play so if that lone scavenger get ripped apart by zombies, sad day. This game uses the ""guns attract zombies in a 1 mile radius rule"" so you have to get silencers to use guns effectively otherwise you shoot two zombies and four more show up. This game also uses a base system for survivors so you can choose what modules for your base you'll need like beds for people to sleep and/or a medical tent for injuries. My negative experiences are when meleeing something the auto target will expose my back to other zombies who happily latch on and deal a lot of damage and the game won't let up with the missions most of which are time based as a survivor will need help. In addition, this game tracks your out of game time and reduces resources accordingly. Why? Why does this game need to function like ♥♥♥♥ing farmville in this regard? You're telling me unless the survivors have the player as their motivation they just♥♥♥♥♥♥around waiting to die? Totally unneeded mechanic.			"

The Good:* Vast open world with great exploration* Adequate gameplay variety* Challenging combat and survival mechanics* Good story pace* Great voice acting and sountrack* Adapts well to play-style* Amazing randomisation engine makes for non-repetitivity* Verging on the perfect zombie survival game of its timeThe Bad:* Very low replay value* Not much to do once finished the main story* Saving people and fetching supplies gets tedious* Background continuation can be irritating if left unplayed for too long* After the first 10 hours of playing, the diversity loses its charm* Fluctuating difficulty levelsBottom line:Flaws must be expected from such a large game, but State of Decay manages to keep them to a minimum. Definitely worth a try.			"

												Fun Zombie survival game. It has a lot of options to build your base, character development on the other hand is pretty narrow. But the ever uppopping missions and the hurry they create make it a lot of fun ... and you will make mistakes and lose your favorite survivor because you get to cocky and will get cornered. Why? You can not save and reload!			"

												If you're a fan of zombies, exploration, some community management, violence, and survival, State of Decay will scratch a powerful itch. You're always on the edge of death and the one stupid mistake you make will be the one that does you in. It's not a hardcore simulation like Day-Z, nor is it at all multiplayer; nevertheless, the primary game is compellingly open-ended and you will make decisions  that allow some characters a chance to live and guarantee others will die. Sometimes, you'll have to make those decisions when your stamina is all gone, there's no cars to escape in, you're at half health because you haven't rested in days, you have 3 bullets, a damaged baseball bat, and a horde of biters moving to your position. Maybe you pop a morphine and hide in a bush until they pass, but you still have a long way to go to get home. While I am positively bullish on this game, temper your expectations. State of Decay is an indie game ported from XBLA. The controls are not tight, especially for mouse and keyboard. They are a little off-putting at first and you'll require time to adjust. The graphic style is fitting, but the graphic quality itself is not above average for 2013. It runs well enough, but you will not see a perfectly smooth framerate throughout; it'll drop at odd moments. Sometimes you hit a zombie with a finishing move and it'll be in slo-mo, but other times you wonder if the game is stuttering or if you're supposed to be seeing something awesome, but you don't know what it is. However, I predict that none of these presentation deficits will stop you from seeing the vision behind the game and getting immersed in it.This is a game that I would like to see a sequel for in about two years. I have not played the Breakdown DLC which removes the guiding storyline of the primary game and lets you just play the map. Though I look forward to trying it out next Steam sale. The developers had initially planned for the game to go multiplayer, but that effort has been canceled. Although, the developers promised that the sequel will focus on that feature. However, there are a lot of ways I could see the multiplayer game not being as compelling for me since I might lose the power to make decisions for my people. The comparison to Tell Tale's The Walking Dead are unavoidable and as with that game, I see this game gaining little from a full on multiplayer experience. Maybe if they made multiple maps and severely limited the number of players on each one so that each player could recruit their fair share of NPC survivors. Bottom line, if you see the game on sale, you might as well pick it up. State of Decay is all about risks and the ""fun"" you have taking them.			"

												  Rarely have I experienced a game that is by turns so engrossing and yet also frustrating as State of Decay.    These designers at Undead Labs undeniably share the vision I've always had for the ideal zombie apocalypse survival RPG.  For all the potential this game offers however, it falls a bit short of perfection due in part to limited optimization for PC, minor design flaws and a hundred little moments that will have you doing /facepalm.  The primary features like base building & upkeep, character progression and the constant need to scavenge while fending off hordes are highly engaging.  The dynamic mission system, the relationship system for playable and NPC survivors and the decent pacing of the story guarantee that you'll always have more to do than time to do it in.  Decisions like 24/7 near-real time progression and permanent character deaths enhance immersion and tension.  Gameplay goes back and forth between pursuit of the main quest line and addressing challenges to your (and others) survival.  Smart choices and hustle are rewarded with a secure base and (relatively speaking) happy community while poor ones are compounded by a variety of repercussions.  Combat is fun once you develop skills enough to unlock handy special abilities and acquire some slightly higher quality weaponry.  State of Decay is a PC port, and in short it feels and looks like what it is.  The combination of features here is awesome but I'm left wanting more depth, quality and variety in them.  They should also do a careful pass of the experience from start to finish for convenience and user interface.  I'd also like to see a more robust story, more unique survivors with their own side quests, a vast improvement of zombie AI/pathing and an effort to balance special zombies a bit more.  In other words, bring all of the people and zombies to life more convincingly.  This game is destined to divide players into:1) A hardcore group who want a higher level of difficulty and realism and,2) A more general group of zombie and RPG fans who get riled up over that first death and the coming to grips with permanent loss of a useful character (who you're emotionally attached to, to boot).  I highly recommend State of Decay to any genre fan.  Temper your expectations reasonably and you will be thrilled with this fun game; I loved it.  I have not yet tried the Breakdown or Lifeline DLC's but reportedly the former provides a satisfying level of difficulty from the getgo and in the end a serious challenge.  Any sequel to this has huge potential and I will be keeping an eye on the future developments by Undead Labs.  Any successor needs a Cooperative mode.  Demands it.TIP: Don't let yourself feel safe or secure, because this game has a nasty way of either suddenly hitting you with a new mechanic or simply bugging out and getting you killed with some form of glitch.TIP: Cultivate more than one survivor so that when your starter gets tired or dies you have solid options to fall back on.TIP: Respect the Juggernaut, he needs his personal space.  Do not let your friendlies anywhere near that big ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.TIP: Don't restart if you die, just take the hit and keep on truckin'.			"

												What can I say about this one? Other than it may well be the best zombie-survival I've ever had the pleasure to play. Especially when combined with some improvement mods available at the SoD Nexus. For example the possibility to transport supply-dufflebags in any pickup (thanks to modders adding physics to the said dufflebags), removing the zombies glowing eyes, and to top it off; only walking zombies, and a special infected-remover. Because let's face it... all zombie games with special infected is getting tiresome. What's wrong with a classic zombie experience?At any rate, I've spent a good chunk of hours in it. And the Breakdown DLC only improves with the new sandbox-mode. All in all... should you hesitate. Check out some gameplay in Youtube. I'm more than convinced that I'll be spending countless hours in this game in the coming year (if not years).			"

Well Ill start by saying yes the game is very glitchy, however the devs, while working on sequel continously patch and bugfix this game, and Ill warn you right now like everyone else if you play this you will beg for the co-op this game should have been released with! Wow that was one hell of run on sentence!If you love just killing zombies and hordeing resources buy the DLC (Breakdown) and go nuts, The story in this game is pretty good, You become very atteched to what at first seem to be disposable community members, and when they die they die!. No save and reload kiddies. Graphics mediocre, controls average, But it has a lot to offer in a (hopefully) upcoming sequel WITH co-op. And this is the Devs first title and they are listening and trying to fix this buggy super fun zombie survival adventure game. When it boils down to it we all still play videogames to have fun right?			"

I had lots of fun, Cars are easily flipped over with the handbrake, You get rushed a lot and when you're carrying too many things your stamina goes down fast as heck, Which may lead to being taken over by zombies as you attack way slower. Weapons break after a while, Tons of mini-missions although most of them are based on the same thing over and over. Had fun driving the sports cars though! One of the greatest features for me :)! Although I haven't passed the game, I greatly recommend this game based on the time I have played it so far.			"

												.... I'm gonna make it simple and straight forward:PROS* Gripping storyline.* What you did change the world (base camp morale, other survivors attitude towards you, etc (but not much)).* A LOT of randomized characters in each playthrough.* You decide the fate of your fellow survivor in your community (exile the useless, kill them before they turn, etc).* Lots of thing going on makes you never bored (or at least something to do) in game.* High replay value.* .... it's a crazy world (hey, zombie apocalypse, what else need to be said).* .... good game for those without life (no offense, will clarify).CONS* NOT beginner friendly for most.* Too much things to be done/choose from, and most of the time the mission is located VERY far (especially the important one).* Mission expires if left too long (apocalypse doesn't wait no one).* Companion's AI can be annoyingly stupid.* Requires daily monitoring (game world runs even when you don't play, left it too long and you'll find an overrun base the next time you play).* No co-op option (sometime people just want to have REAL friends among the survivors).* .... it's a crazy world (some might find chaos to be unbearable, tch....).* .... bad for those with life (unless you're willing to spend time each day on this, or you build good defenses for your base to avoid the unavoidable (which would be unavoidable in the end, maybe))..... to conclude, there's no special reason to play or not play the game, it is both good and bad in it's own way. It is an interesting game at the very least. Time to continue surviving....			"

												Pros: You rarely have a chance to be bored, and the interactions are great.UI is easy enough to use with only a few things I'd fix on it's current functioning.Gets you invested in several characters, leaving room for you to ""lose"" someone, yet still get to play since you -are- anyone you play.The Juggernauts... lets just say you don't get used to them enough to not pee just a bit when they roar near you. Some of the realistic take-downs still make you cringe no matter how long you play (may be a con for some, but it's supposed to keep you cringing, well done here).I enjoyed that the missions weren't all time sensitive, nor were all urgent to your gameplay. But still enough were to keep you on your toes.Vehicles offered to choose from all varied in handling, speed and passenger capacity. Making it necessary for you to find the right vehicle for the right job at times.Large enough map for the time-frame it takes to make this game happen.Cons: I felt there was more that could have been done before ending as quickly as it did, though there wasn't any forced ending really, if you didn't know what was coming, you would just wind up with it ended. I suppose it had to get there some time. State of Decay Breakdown addresses this by giving you a choice as to when you want to boggie out however. UI: needs a search function, or a filter when faced with finding characters in your group to choose from. At 40+ to choose from it's tougher to find who you need relatively quickly.The tutorial could have been a tad more interactive. In-game tuts irritate me, but only if I've seen them already. So in-game tut plus a toggle wouldn't hurt. Though learning hands-on is doable.Game function itself was great. Absolutely nothing mentioned in the ""cons"" was game breaking by any means. Well worth the price for what you get. Def a recommended play if you enjoy the jump-scares and immersive style games.			"

												This game is a great step in the right direction for Zombie survival, with its fortifications and reasource hunting. Even management of fellow NPC's.  The controls are barely servicable and even with my Xbox controller are not that great ether. You will often find yourself stuck on minor pixels and run into objects you cannot see due to the third person camera. You will also encounter a sluggish camera system so you do not have a responvie feedback when you need to turn to see something.Also the saving system is terrible. In my recent save I left the game with 25 ammo points in my safe-location, I load the save up again and it was set to only 1 point. And saving during the game appears crippled at best, I'm unsure if its from the BS console savepoint system or if its flawed by design to limit you from going through with-out mistakes. Thus encouraging failure. I realize this might be a thing for this game but leaving a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ saving system in place doesn't help the game or anybody. I still recommend this game though its fun as it is, but do not bother pouring much effort into it, just leads to disapointment.			"

Game playability and overall enjoyment would have been much higher with a cooperative mode.-Smaller map. Yes I know it was ported over from Xbox, but a larger map maybe with 2 more towns or so would have added a lot more. As of now, I feel like I am stuck wandering the same small little part of the world. JUst from town A to Town B and back.These are the main things that got me.

If you're on the fence, catch it on sale and give it a go.  I promise you won't be disappointed.			"

												This game is purely amazing, if u are looking for a open world survival zombie game this one is the best on the market. State of decay makes every recource worth more than Gold and makes every supply scarce because there is a limited amount of cars food and ammo which all eventually run out forever which makes this game golden it hits open world survival right on the head.  One of the things that i really like about the game is the outposts you have with survivors you set them up to keep fellow survivors safe and build defenses around them watch towers, Barb wire, Medical bay ETC.

												From what I had seen in trailers and the sales page, I wasn't convinced that this was a good game; one of those 'meh' feelings. Bought it for 5 euro's in the sale and I'd say it's well worth that money. Graphicswise it's not the best out there, but it has all elements that makes a good (zombie survival) game. It's basically a SinglePlayer, working version version of The WarZ (survivor stories: investation). Don't expect any replay value though; the scaveging get's quite boring fast (just like the boat stuff in Assassin's Creed 4) but stays fun just enough to finish the game.7/10			"

												At first: someone told me it IS a MUST HAVE for everys zombie survival fan. Well ... he was right.You have to scavange for weapons, suply and other survivor. Every time you travel is the question: ""loud car or sneaky shoes?"" and every freaking time a zombie horde or one of the deadly special is running to you - the ""f*ck"" moment where you have to choose between fight, run and/or shoot. Really great is: every new game means every item/suply will obviously somewhere else (or with really big luck at the same place) and even the ""tutorial"" place has not the same items at every start.  The Z's are pretty dumb but still clever enough to atack you whenever you won't like it plus there are some really special and great (sometimes totally funny) sayings.The story is really nice and ""SPOILER:"" the ending of the normal story is suprising.

												I've been playing this game for a few days now. I have quite a few zombie games. State of Decay's outstanding quality it has the best aspects of all the other games I played before. Basebuilding, resource management, great graphics, storyline, a map that's bigger than it looks and gobs of hidden loot. The fact the game persists whether you're there or not is quite a twist. I've failed a number of times already and am on my 3rd restart. While that's kind of tedious, particulurly with cut scenes, it proves this game isn't a pushover. You also notice that while the map may be the same the contents are not. Replayability is a plus, especially when you blow it often early on being a clueless clumbsy noob like I at first, one with a tendancy to overturn trucks into riverbeds causing a firey zombie-attracting clusterflub.

Keep your friends happy and make sure to collect food and supplies for you and your group of survivors. If this game had co-op mode it would probably be the funniest game created so far!			"

												This is the long awaited sequel to the hit game, State of Emergency. Although it veers strongly from the establish plotline of the State of Emergency series, it manages to stay connected, and even throws out oblique references. For example, the main character of the story mode is black. So was one of the main characters in State of Emergency, and they were both similarly named. Many parallels can be drawn to State of Emergency, such as The Law mission. However, this is where the review becomes negative. I was disappointed at how different the game felt and played from the original. The forumla for the first game worked pretty well, and there wasn't much of a reason to change it. This seems to be a total redesign in the wrong direction.Although open-world, there is now a resource-collecting and base-building sidegame, which adds to the confusion. Most of the additions seem tacked-on, and pointless. Zombies, while a welcome addition, provide nothing more than cannon fodder. Although cops served a similar purpose in the first game, in that game their A.I. was more advanced, and were generally more interesting to fight.Overall, I can't really recommend this game for State of Emergency fans. I was disappointed.			"

												So here's the deal: a stealth-oriented game where the stealth kill option doesn't friggin' work half the time. Boy, aren't we off to a good start.The plot doesn't exist, the writing is so-so at best.Gameplay is convoluted. This whole affair with stealth kills not executing properly half the time really messes up the game when you're torn apart by the friggin' horde.This also has a gimmick where stuff happens to your base while you're not playing, which is unpleasant for those of us who have a life to live apart from ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games.Dunno. It had some promise, but I'm still to see a decent open-world zombie apocalypse game.3 TORN APART MARCUSES OUT OF 10			"

												Very nice game, very adictive and funny gameplay. It does have some bugs tho... and sometimes it run slow in performance even having a powerful PC. There are hundreds of hours of gameplay in this tittle. Too bad there is only a single player mode...BTW!! DONT BUY THE DLC!! The DLC isn't worth it. Its kinda a joke. All you get is a 5MB patch that unlocks a bit harder difficulty level, few new weapons and few characters. REALLY not worth it, you will not get anything that is advertised like that ""infinite play"" mode that they suggest. This DLC should be free to compensate the huge amount of bugs in game...			"

												If someone created a tetrahedron (just roll with it) of zombie apocalypse entertainment with Left 4 Dead at one corner, No More Room in Hell at another corner, The Walking Dead at a third corner, and DayZ in the final corner, State of Decay would be somewhere near the gooey, festering, dead center of such a divine tetralogy of terror. This is my first enduring impression upon completion of the main storyline after marathoning 26 hours game time over the course of about 36 hours from point of purchase. I have yet to try the DLC, so my review covers the basic game only. I will try to keep spoilers to a minimum.You and a buddy have gone camping and are on your way back to civilization only to find that the campgrounds have become picnic at the park for zed. Your job is simply to survive and learn to survive more successfully and efficiently. As you make your way in the world, you find yourself essentially trapped within a large valley of small communities and farms with a few souls and a whole lot of folks who’ve no longer any use for theirs. You’ll see a lot of tropes and types that are standard for the genre, but most of them are written in a way that downplays their commonness and gives them the dignity of a measure of individual identity and unique situations. You’ll find that vehicles work pretty much as you’d expect them to—often to your advantage and, now and then, to your sorrow. You’ll learn quickly that the world reacts to your decisions in mostly logical ways and that, among the precious assets that will remain largely too sparse for your tastes, human beings matter greatly to you and your prospects for survival. Influence will become your currency. Interactions will become your keys to more currency, technology, and even more assets. Your chances will depend solely upon your actions and choices, but your outcomes will almost always depend upon how your actions and choices affect others. For a relatively small solo game, I never felt that the world was hollow or empty, or that I was truly playing alone the way you feel if you solo some games. The Good: Options. High degree of player interaction with environment and characters which carries lasting impacts. Ambitious design. Homage to the genre. Moments of pleasant surprise and genuine anxiety. Humor that is often subtle. You will roam a mostly open world with some depth of detail that I think may pleasantly surprise you at times. You choose how you will play, where you will go, and what you will do. If you play smart, the game will reward you. If you take foolish risks, you may find yourself sorely punished—likely, but not a guaranteed always. On a single run through from beginning to end, I found myself still trying to figure out certain triggers for various spawns and events, and that’s a good thing. It promises a level of continued interest for future game sessions. If you tear up a vehicle, it will break down, and even possibly explode. If you toss a flare or firecrackers in the night, you will attract a lot of unwanted attention, but you will also be able, if you’re quick and quiet enough, to take advantage of the diversion to make an escape. There’s a lot more I’d love to share, but some things are more pleasurable discovered on your own. If you’re paying attention as you go, you may notice a good number of locales or situations clearly intended as tributes to the genre greats, both to creators and to the works they created, and it comes off not simply as a checklist but as an honest homage. If you get the game, take time to revel in the sensation of racing down a country road in the night with your headlights off while swerving slightly to the side and opening your driver’s side door to take out an entire horde of zombies and freaks. Take a moment in the twilight to look out over a field of crops to see shambling silhouettes against the outline of a rolling landscape under an open country sky. Savor the tremor in the dark as you explore a quiet shed only to discover that you aren’t alone in there after all. Thrill to the delighted frustration of attempting to run down that creepy thing that moves just too darn fast and vaguely spider-like along the edge of the road. Regret smacking indiscriminately into that just-one-more batch of zed that somehow left such a foul aftertaste.The Bad: First, the downside to being such an ambitious game that aims to honor and do so much is that it has its limitations. I found myself in a few spots just wishing the game would go farther in a certain way to take things further in certain options that just weren’t available sometimes. I wanted more management options for people. I wanted a better explanation at times for certain things, though I think that the hands-off approach to this game actually improved the experience overall for me. I found other limitations, which I won’t share because I don’t want to spoil the fun but you are free to discover them for yourself.  Second, there were some moments when I felt the actions or dialogue of characters in the game were completely transparent as vehicles for forcing my attention in some direction. I didn’t like that at all, but thankfully this did not happen too often. Third, while we’re talking about dialogue and actions of characters and game limitations, I found it strange that a game that places such a high emphasis on influence would present me with so few opportunities for deep interpersonal interactions. Conversations, too often, are limited to, “Hey, what’s the sitch?” and that’s it. Not even an option given to answer that question. Fourth, a few persistent glitches in the game. I noticed a change in the condition of vehicles where you pass by one time and it’s in good shape and the next time it’s dinged up, but then the very next time you pass by it looks perfectly fine. Some people showed up as having run away from my compound, but were actually still living there and were still available as controllable characters. Fifth, companions hit some trigger point where a mission, a conversation, or some other key like stamina tells them it’s time to go home, and they run off. Even if you’re on the opposite side of the map with a perfectly good vehicle and getting ready to get in and drive home, they will run off across the countryside full of wandering hordes and freaks, sometimes creating a hazard where you have to rescue them in the process. I think this is a result of the game’s having been developed to emphasize stealth over combat. However, I played using reserved force and stealth, and all-out Car Wars/Death Race 2000 driving mentality, and found I did quite well.The Ugly: The game is a PC port from console and it shows. It’s not nearly as bad as some games I could mention, but the console history of the game makes certain things awkward for PC players at best. Playing with keyboard and mouse worked just fine, but sometimes I would discover a move that I couldn’t quite easily reproduce and it makes me wonder if it was supposed to be triggered by a combo that I just haven’t figured out on K&M control. That being said, mostly, to anyone who didn’t know it was a console port or had familiarity with the differences in play and feel, I don’t think anything more than the autosave function and a few other clues give it away. That’s not too bad a complaint for the ugly. Also, and this is my biggest beef with the game, I found the best compound for my strategies in the game broken or nerfed (I couldn’t tell which) in an incredibly stupid way: The rest of my review (you're getting very near the end of it) appears in the comments section below because I've run out of room again.

												Wat do you call a group of Zombies? Hmm, a pack of Zombies? No no, that is not it. Hmm, a gander of Zombies? Nooo. How about a pride of Zombies? Hell no! Aaaah YES. It is called a HORDE, a Horde of Zombies! And that is what you will be facing in State of Decay. Hordes and more Hordes of Zombies.But you are not alone. There is lots and lots of melee weapons to help you deal with the problem and there is lots and lots of fire arms to help you deal with the pest. You also have your characters that level in this RPG game. You can go stealthy, high cardio and run faster and for longer than them Zombies or simply go guns blazing and melee weapons swinging. But you will also need your own group, you need to band together and form a group. Work with other groups around the town/state and help each other out or simply let them join your group and become a bigger group. Your brothers and sisters in arms will help you with your daily life in the Zombie apocalyptic town.The larger the group the more mouths you have to feed, the more meds your will need and of course the more weapons/ammo you will need for your established base/group. On the other side the larger the group, the better the man power and better the protection. Your home is where you manage the group’s lives. Build a small infirmary, or upgrade your lookout tower for better protection and area coverage. However pick wisely, space in your walls is limited and you put people’s lives in danger every time you and your group go out for resources. On another note what would a Zombie Apocalyptic game be without the army? The army is also present but it seems they have their own agenda and could care less for the survivors on the street.But how does it all end? What happens to your band of brothers and sisters? I guess you will have to find out for yourself? Pros: -Fun Dialogue RPG Zombie Horde slaying game.-Story line is fairly good. Entertaining. -Weapons is fun and diverse, always fun to slay Zombies.-Your group can repair your decaying vehicles and weapons. -You don’t need to do the tedious runs over and over again, use your group to scavenge and deliver the goods you have discovered.-You have your group members at your disposal to help with runs and missions.-Setup more outposts for protection and ease of accessing the group stash.-Open world to explore.Con: -Graphics slightly out dated, but did not bother me that much.-Game was designed/created for Xbox 360/consoles and converted for PC.-Game feels a little too easy (however still challenging enough to be fun)-no Co-OP play.Conclusion:I feel this game is worthy of your precious time. It is worth mine. If you can pick this game up on the Steam sale for $4.99 then it is a no brainer (bargain). I would not feel cheated if I was to pay $19.99 for it ether, game is worth the cash. I noticed majority of the players finished this game (main story) between 16-18 hours. I usually play slower and discover every nook and cranny myself. This game would have scored beter if it had the co-op. I presonally would love to build a base and go slay some zombies with my friend. I bought the two DLC's on Steam sale too, but have not played them yet. My score is based on the main game only. I have played this game for 8hours already and is hooked. Very addictive game. Go ahead give this game a try. I recommend it and would give it a personal score of 8/10.			"

												If you use Steam on a regular basis, chances are you came across State of Decay on the frontpage, offering its tender body up to you, promising more ZOMBIES.If you think the gaming-world has had enough zombies as of late you're absolutely right. What is lacking, though, is an innovative approach to the zombie-genre. Something with more depth than your average Resident Evil. State of Decay (SoD) might just be exactly that.SoD starts you off in medias res, with only you and your buddy stranded in the midst of an already ongoing zombie-apocalypse. The gameplay comes along feeling a lot like Dead Rising at first, but quickly shows it tries to take on more than just that. As you hack and slash your way through Northern American forests and farmlands (on a fairly large, open map) you will meet other survivors (not actual people, mind you - this is a singleplayer-title). Some might not be too fond of you and avoid contact, others might be willing to join up. Soon, you will have a quaint little base to call your (temporary) home and you will quickly realise that not everything evolves around YOU and the character YOU play.SoD claims to be a Zombie-Survival-Simulator - and this goes beyond simulating how to best dismember the undead. You will have to keep an eye on all of your ""group"", as all of them have roles to play. There will be relations between characters, tensions, scarcity of resources and so on. Maybe most importantly of all: No one is safe. Every character can die, yet in return you also get to play as anyone who has joined you.Plan your adventures carefully, take only what you need, call for scavengers, answer the calls of your fellow survivors and occasionally plow through a zombie-horde with a car. This should sum up SoD in essence.All this glory does have its shortcomings, though. Missions will start to get repetetive due to their interchangable nature, many houses will look similar and the stuff you find in them is not very interesting. Being an Xbox-title originally, the game also looks a bit outdated and struggles with controls. An Xbox-controller is REQUIRED (quote from the store-page) to play this game, at least until they finish the mouse and keyboard controls in a patch.Speaking about patches, this game still is in early development, so a lot of changes will be made in the future. It certainly is promising, just not quite the Next Big Thing.--UPDATE (Aug 2014): SoD does no longer REQUIRE a controller to be played, it now supports mouse and keyboard controls, HOWEVER I still recommend playing with pad as using your mouse will give you some rather twitchy controls.

												State of Decay is one of the best zombie games in recent memory. However, I wouldn't call it perfection. In fact, this game has plenty of flaws.In the graphics section, I found it to be pretty nice for the most part. However, in the beginning of the game, the lighting is absolutely terrible and hurt my eyes a bit. Despite that, the visuals were extremely nice and I was itching to take a few nice screenshots. However, I can't call it the #1 best part. It's still very well done.The gameplay is heated, difficult, and in some ways, realistic. The gameplay is probably the best part to the game. When you think of zombie games, I assume that you would imagine some dude with a six-pack running around shirtless with shades on dual wielding sub-machine guns, right? State of Decay is NOT like that. These are just human beings we're talking about, not supersoldiers. In fact, if there's anyone people would consider cheap in this game, it would be the Army. But hey, we're talking about the Army here. Did you really think a soldier would be running around and getting tired quick and having a miserable aim? Anyway, running away from hordes IS NOT a good idea. I've tried to run several times, but I've only gotten out alive once or twice. The people who did survive had severe injuries, were extremely tired, or have no useful items left on them. The vehicles are simple enough to drive, and making them limited just makes the game even harder. Very good gameplay.The story is cliche, no doubt. Survivors are holed up in a certian place (In State of Decay, Trumbull County) and the Army refuses to help. However, it seems rather difficult to actually come up with a decent plot for a zombie survival game without realizing someone else did that already. The audio is above average at most. The voice acting is fine, at times weak. It sometimes sounds sarcastic or the mic is far away. However, some of the actors do provide some emotion. The music is great for a zombie survival game, and I usually rely on the music to tell me if the zeds are nearby. Although again, the music is a bit cliche since several zombie survival games (and even shows) use guitars or things like that for their soundtrack. But, the soundtrack is very good in this game and is better than lots of other games and shows that use the soundtrack like this.The replayability is very strong in this game. If you beat the game, you can play through it again once or twice. There's also the two DLC packs that were very critically acclaimed you can buy, too. I didn't get either one yet, but Breakdown looks extremely fun. It's actually number one on my wishlist right now.State of Decay does have a few other major flaws I'd like to point out: The AI in this game is absolutely HORRIBLE. One of my survivors stood there doing ABSOLUTELY nothing while getting eaten by a horde of zombies. Since my guy was tired, I had to run the zombies over. And because usually the survivors dodge the car, he just stood there, doing absolutely nothing. When I hit him, he stood there and I lost trust with him. It was even one of the trust missions where someone is feeling angry, sad, or whatever. He also took like half an hour to get all of his things while the houses next to him were infested when we rescued him. Still though, BAD AI. The dialogue is repetitive and there's not many stories when you're bringing survivors back home. That's probably about it in terms of major flaws.In the end, State of Decay is quite fun and there's lots to do, but the game has some very major flaws that can ruin your experience. Either way, this is a game I'd recommend for any zombie survival fan.Graphics- 8.0/10Gameplay- 9.0/10Story- 4.0/10Audio- 7.5/10Replayability- 9.0/10.:7.5/10:.+Great gameplay+Large world+Awesome soundtrack+Impressive job by some of the voice actors-Awful AI-Repetitive dialogue-Weak lighting early game			"

												State of decay is one of the best third person survival horror open world game. Graphics is good enough, story is fine. SoD is not a brainless zombie killing game, you are a member of a community stucked in Thumbull county. Player have to manage the community which includes doing favoures for survivors to gain trust to become friends later; scavenging for vital supplies such as food, medicine, building materials. In the game you have a ""home base"" which can be upgraded with 9 facilities, and also has  space for outpost to build. Outposts extends the safe area and have supply cache to restock your equipment. The game can be played id different ways, someone likes playing stealthy, others prefer brute force to complete missions. Ah, the missions; i found side missions a bit repetitive, but they are okay. Driving cars is useful but makes a lot of noise which attracts zombies. When you are at your base you can change the character you are playing if the other character is your friend. Changing is adviseable to let the used character rest to get their vitality and stamina back to maximum value. SoD is beyond my expectations, i recommended everyone who loves zombie games 9/10.			"

												So here's the deal: a stealth-oriented game where the stealth kill option doesn't friggin' work half the time. Boy, aren't we off to a good start.The plot doesn't exist, the writing is so-so at best.Gameplay is convoluted. This whole affair with stealth kills not executing properly half the time really messes up the game when you're torn apart by the friggin' horde.This also has a gimmick where stuff happens to your base while you're not playing, which is unpleasant for those of us who have a life to live apart from ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games.Dunno. It had some promise, but I'm still to see a decent open-world zombie apocalypse game.3 TORN APART MARCUSES OUT OF 10			"

												State of Decay é um jogo difícil de descrever. É mais fácil imaginá-lo como um grande simulador de apocalipse - no caso, de zumbis. A função do jogador é controlar não apenas um, mas vários membros de um grupo de sobreviventes com a missão de formar uma comunidade segura e funcional, garantindo os recursos necessários pra ficar de pé.É preciso lutar contra hordas de zumbis, revirar cidades desertas em busca de suprimentos, evoluir seus personagens, melhorar sua base improvisada, salvar aliados em apuros, fazer ""comércio"" com comunidades vizinhas e resolver conflitos internos. Parece bastante coisa, mas logo as mesmas ""quests"" começam a se repetir e o jogo cai na mesmisse. O pior: na tentativa de se tornar mais dinâmico, o jogo exagera na quantidade de missões que exigem a sua atenção por vez, muitas vezes anulando a aparente liberdade que o título oferece.Sem falar que não há quase nenhuma explicação sobre suas mecânicas, o que obriga a jogador a passar algumas horas tentando adivinhar como alguns elementos funcionam. (procure tutoriais na internet!). A jogabilidade em terceira pessoa é divertida e responde bem aos comandos. Jogar com um joystick é mandatório. Os gráficos são bons, especialmente os efeitos de iluminação. Porém, a resolução baixa das texturas (por ser um port direto da versão de X360) é notável, além de que as animações deixam bastante a desejar em alguns momentos.Mesmo com a mesmisse das quests, a falta de um enredo consistente para estimular o jogador, e a ausência de um tutorial melhor, State of Decay é um ótimo open-world, viciante e divertido (até certo ponto), servindo especialmente bem a quem gosta de jogos de zumbi.7,5/10			"

 State of Decay I am going to review the Base > Game  + the DLC later on, but i wanted to focus on SoD right now. There is a lot of Hate towards Undead Labs, over SoD being released way to early during Alpha, and it still being broken and or not finished! But they continue to apply Updates to the Base > Game  making it better each time. There are still a few bugs but I'm sure they will be addressed in the near future.I know there is still a lot of people not being able to play it because... Lets face it it's Poorly Optimized. Even a High End Rig can struggle playing it, but it's a Port from 360 and this may change in the future. I also experience a little lag from time to time, but it's not game breaking in any way for me. Usually when i enter Marshal it does it for a few seconds, then goes back to normal. For me it was an over all fun experience. I enjoyed it the first play though, but it does has those bugs that.  Well just ruin the atmosphere of the whole Survival experience, when a zombie falls through the floor during a mission and you cannot progress without killing it... (But you cannot hit it underneath the dang house) can be frustrating and take the fun out of it.There are Elements i wish they would have added or Left in as other people described from there experience on the 360 version. Like (Generators) i really liked that idea, and being able to (Load up your Truck) with Ruck Sacks when you find more than one. But don't base your judgment on (Should i Buy this? or Not?), merely based on haters in the forums, you should always form your own opinion while playing it your self. I love Horror/Zombie games, i gave it shot and I'm still here playing it :) (Love the DLC More) and I'm still unlocking Hidden Characters!Plus there are frequent Sales on the Store and you can pick up a copy pretty cheap, so really you have nothing to lose it  is worth the Price, some may disagree but to each his own. It has it's flaws and it also has it appeals, below is a list of my Pro's & Con's for State of Decay.Pro's of SoD:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 - Open world you can explore freely, at times. (Some Area's Require Story Progress) to access them.2 - Drive any vehicle you want, and run down Hoards of Undeads! (You know you want to)3 - Change your Home > Base (Several Potential Home Bases) to choose from all over the map.  4 - Build up your Base, to help you and your fellow Survivors... Well Survive lol.  Medical Tent, Sleeping Quarters, Garden, Work Shop, Sniper Post, Library. - I forgot a couple.  5 - Build Outposts, to better defend your Home > Base from random Hordes, and Zombie Spawns.  The number of Out Posts, is based on how large the Home Base is. It can be anywhere from 4 to 9.  6 - Interact with any Person (NPC) you meet, some are Neighbors. And some are just trying to Survive!  And some are just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Bags... Yes i am referring to the Wilkersons... When they killed Becca i wanted  to drive to there farm house and burn it to the freaking ground!!  7 - Enter/Loot any Building you may encounter, it's a large map so there is loads of places to Rob Blind :)  8 - Befriend Survivors, and have them watch your back while your out in the world Scavenging.  9 - Take part in Random Events that pop up, like Zed Hunting, or Besieged- odd name?  And gain trust with them, eventually they will join you.Con's of SoD:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 - Lilly Ritter... She can become quite annoying. While our immersing your self in the world of the dead, she will keep asking you to go here, go there, and just keep bugging you in general :( 2 - Vehicle Physics, are still not the best. They are still Floaty at times, and the smallest thing like a ""tiny Rock"" can flip over your 4X4 truck going 25 MPH. Even after a few Updates Tweaking this feature. /Facepalm. 3 - The Story is spotty and not really well done, at times if can leave you feeling lost and not sure what to next. And you can spend a lot of time just thinking WTF standing around... When it suddenly pops up telling you your next Objective to Progress the story... 4 - The Survivors AI is really poorly done, you can spend a lot of time back tracking trying to get Him/Her unstuck from behind a gate they could have just opened /Facepalm. That and they often just stand around your home base not doing anything but eating up Resources. They will get (Stuck/Lost) a lot making it harder. 5 - Looting a Building/Home, you will often find (Items/Weapons) you need but do don't have space for. So you will leave it in there and head back to base Unload and get side tracked. If you save Quit or Crash and load it back up they will be all gone, empty stash in the places you Scavenged... 6 - Optimization Issues, the game still needs Tweaking and Feature Updates. Hell it took forever before they finally allowed us to Pre-Define our damn Controls! But the Options/Settings are still lacking and will need to be addressed.7 - Boarding up windows... Ok i love the feature of being able to fortify my Base or Random House by Boarding up the windows keeping the Dead outside, but it was poorly implemented. It vanishes if you travel to far away from the place you boarded up, and when you Quit and load back up it was all for not... Now i can see losing some to Zeds trying to break in while I'm away but really? Just randomly disappears not cool.But that's always subject to change, like i said before they will be doing Updates to the Base > Game  and it can improve over time, but i like the game. Once i bought the DLC (Break Down) i just loved it because it removed the Story allowing me to really immers myself into the experince, i will do a review on BD next.I hope this helped some people, we all have different experinces when playing but overall it was a good game.

												This is the game I have been looking for since the Zombie Hype following ""DayZ"". It combines a Survival Game with fun fights (nothing beats fighting zombies with wrestling moves), several home bases, which can be upgraded and customized for your way of playing and rudimentary role-playing elements. And it is all completely Single Player. For some this might be a reason not to buy, but for this player it was the argument that sold the game. The game has a permadeath system and adapted it perfectly for a SP game. The player does not start with ""his own"" character. You rather start the story join a group of survivor, all playable for the character. All the characters in the game get exhausted and get debuffs through this. The player than has to return to the home base and choose another survivor to continue. This system is extremely fun as you can develop several different characters and ways of playing the game within one playthrough.Another mechanic which makes this game great is the resource management. The survivors don't spend all day with slaying zombies and driving around town. Most of the time cabinets, crates and all kinds of storage stuff is searched and looted. The player has to do this as the home base needs four resources. Food, to keep everyone well fed; Ammo, with a lot ammo in stock the home base has a decent supply of ammo for every firearm; Materials, to build and upgrade the home base and outposts, and medicine, this act the same way as ammo does a lot of supply equals lots of drugs at the home base. The most fun part of the game is the fighting. The player can either fight with blunt, sharp or heavy melee weapons or several firearms. The range of melee weapons goes from table legs to sledgehammers to cavalry sabres. Melee combat is mostly used in the game as guns are loud and the zombies react to sounds. This review just touches the surface of the game but I really hope that it helped you in any way. With best regards Invisiblo			"

												1. Too small map to explore for anything. If it is an open world then better be a world at least. also everywhere seems so similar and anyplace you make a basecamp, it is almost impossible to stretch out after you reached certain point. I really look forward to see some other types of environments in bigger size.2. Max stamina or stamina itself is way too limited so you can't really have any fun. Yes, it meant to be a realistic game but it's rediculously SHORT as if the Z-virus in game clogged half lung of every characters in this game.3. The resources are way too short... also even when you found a bag of something, the actual contents in the bag is almost nothing. Hand full stuffs when you break the bag. You are forced to keep on scavenging resources all the time makes you worried about them even when you are on a mission and never have a fun of hitting a jackpot. NEVER.4. No story what so ever. Well, some of you may say the entire purpose of this game is only surviving... I know that but it could've been something more, something even better than TLOU.. who knows?5. Lack of vehicles, vehicle space for bags... and they are... made of soft cheese cakes. pretty sure.6. Scavenging noise = fire arm noise... really? of is that also part of the ""reallity"" part?7. lack of ammo.. really...awww... I thought the game takes place in US but the amount of ammo makes me feel like I'm in somewhere else.. it's f**** zombie game! I want to enjoy shooting at zombies...8. The size of inventory is too small... and only 2 kinds of bags???? R U ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me??? Well, I'm not even expecting some kind of... magic pockets but even Farcry you can carry more stuffs. And to some of you saying ""oh, you need to learn using more than one character""♥♥♥♥♥♥ listen, can you even play them when they all fuc*** dying on beds all the time???9. Overall contents are too small... after playing about 5 hours, there are pretty much nothing more to do... really. all just... repeating over and over and over again...10. Even though they have a character level systems and stuff but players can't really enjoy.... why? you will never really get much reward of making your character stronger.. just... too small...11. If you want to spend your time and money, well I would recommend you to play some other cool, fun games not like player-torturing Japanese♥♥♥♥♥♥(Japanese game makers love to torture players with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ level systems and♥♥♥♥♥♥and they think player's love them too, so I said that) like this one.Last - I would probably think about buying later version of this game in the future BUT I will check out reviews, videos, player articles very carefully.

												extremly good singleplayer (!) game. Survival-aspects are very relevant. Also: buy with Breakdown. SoD Storyline is pretty short. While Breakdown is a classic ""you level up, by restarting the lvl by ""bus"" until it's too hard for you and you die""...also in all 3 parts: perma-death of everyone... when someone dies... he/she stays dead...

												Excellent and fun game. Unfortunately it's too short, but I enjoy games that go on forever. You'll have lots of fun collecting junk if that's fun to you, trying different weapons, and driving some fun vehicles. (Though not too many choices). It's open world (on a small map) so you can go where you want to with some urgency to submissions. Explosives and exploding environmental objects are fun too. Very few glitches and lots of hours to mess around with, esp if you buy the add on games.			"

												So lets start off with saying whats good about this game first. The gameplay is okay not to bad and not perfect but enjoyable. the graphics are nice and the driving is easy with a nice selection of cars.Now thats the good stuff out the way lets start with the bad stuff. The story doesnt really make sense as there is no real story as far as i can tell since you just get chucked in with endless missions. You end up doing the same mission pretty much all the time and gets kinda boring. The game feels broken as in some missions where there should be a cutscene there isnt, for expample someone dies who is important and theres no care about it at all its just like oh she died, how are you. Another thing is when the person is talking they always say the same thing like ""yeah whatever"" and other stuff and it just feels plain lazy.One last thing the zombies in this game just feels like its been ripped out of left for dead and retextured and dumped into the game, really dissapointed in this.

												Spent quite a long time before giving up on this game. It had a lot of potential but I found it ultimately frustrating. Not hundred per cent stable, sometimes crashing mid mission . Apart from the early stages the game lacks continuity and development. Good setting good characters but overall clumsy and unforgiving. I was never confident that stuff done in one session was being carried on to the next.			"

 Note: I deleted my initial popular review (March 30, 2014), in order re-write it and make sure the EDITED one (this one) re-appears again in the review section page.  Original Review (Short Version)  If you are obsessed with open-world zombie survival horror games, 'State of Decay' will give you an erection.  New Review based on the fiasco with the Year-One Edition I've become sick with the gaming industry, and this is perhaps one of the games that I'd never expect would go 'stealing' mode for a couple of extra bucks from people who ALREADY own their game.With their new edition of the game, they've added a 1080p quality with an extra car  (no fix for the ridiculous car physics though)  and an air-drop mission that sounds like a simple  grab-and-return-the supplies-home  feature and ask for customers who already own the original game and both DLC's to pay an extra 20 euro (with the -33% discount included) for this 'upgrade'. An 'upgrade' that  SHOULD BE FREE for owners  of the game, as is the case with all games out there (and especially the Indie titles). THIS IS A PATCH at best. It should be a PATCH. NOT A FREAKIN' FULL PRICE RE-RELEASE OF THE GAME.Moreover, the endless bugs of the original game were left unfixed, to be partly fixed in this new version, completely abandoning the ORIGINAL version... Funny enough, new bugs emerged so although some were fixed, the game STILL remains as buggy as it was, if not even more... Microsoft Studios  and  Undead Labs  are literally asking customers: ""You want some of  the bugs we abandoned fixing in the original game fixed? Pay 20 euro for them!""My answer to that is clear:  'NO'. I've paid around 30 euro for the base game along with the two DLCs. I am not paying an extra 20 euro for a 'remake'. And an  unecessary remake, to be precise, since the game was released no more than 1,5 years ago. Certainly, I'd understand such a visual upgrade if the game was a 2000's title, but doing so for a game released in 2013 is preposterous - clearly a quick cash-grab from the owners of the original game if you ask me. Why  Microsoft Studios ? Why?To me, unless owners of the game with BOTH DLC's have AT LEAST a -70% discount for this minor upgrade of the game, there is no way I am recommending this, and I'd advise you withhold purchasing  (especially if you already own the game)  because by supporting such moves from developers will only make things worst for  us  gamers... Just imagine every title, every game out there, after one year of the initial release, coming up with a hypothetical 'remastered' version of the game with slightly better visual quality and an extra 'car' or 'mission' that should be there in the first place and asking for almost the full price of the game AGAIN, from people who ALREADY own the full game. And above all, you are FORCED to buy it since the company no longer cares about the original (older) version, but rather ""focuses"" on the new one. Trust me, that would be a disaster... People are upset and this shows from the huge drop on the game's ratings (from 94% positive to 89% positive in two days), and the numbers keep dropping... Honestly, it pains me, because I used to like State of Decay. Unfortunately it's yet another game that fell in the pitfall of 'greed'.EDIT: As it turns out, YOSE is out and it is a complete disaster. People claim that they can barely tell the visual quality difference between the ""new"" and the ""old"" version and the new 'additions' are MODS at best and some of them already exist on the NEXUS!! I do NOT recommend it any longer   "

Ride around doing meaningless missions from one side of the map the the other. Didnt get any choices in my 9h of play apart from simple location changes, base building and characters are all basic and flat. No real impact anywhere.If you have nothing else to do and have played all the other zombi games maybe try but i am dissappointed, this was promising to be much better.If you are an Epoch player, this might be more amusing as a joke than a game.

Posted: June 21, 2014
												Let me just say this. I really wanted to enjoy this game. But after hours of playing it, I just can't.When it was announced, I was really hyped up and wanted to play it so bad. But once it got released and then I played it for hours, I was filled with nothing but boredom and disappointment.I'll start with the positives since good reviewers should always start with the good and then the bad. There's a lot of fun to be had here. The intense feeling of being chased by zombie hordes, finding supplies to keep yourself alive and fighting zombies. All whilst leveling yourself up so you can take on the hardest of things.Not only that, but there's quests that you get to do as well and some of these quests can repeat themselves too. So you're never short on never having anything to do except just running around.Unfortunately, here's where the bad comes in.The game plays like I'm playing a game on Facebook. If you had a stash of 35 food and then you quit the game to go do something else. Guess what? Once you come back to the game, you find out that your stash of food is only 10 and you'll have to spend all your hard work to go get some more. It ticks me off just to see a game that can play all by itself and then I come back to it, only to find that I'm doing worse than before once I come back on to play it. So it's either play this game after you get done with anything else or just stop playing it forever. Hey Undead Labs. This is Steam. Not freaking Facebook.Also, this is just personal opinion, but I hate the special infected in this. I encountered a big muscular zombie and then once I got too close to him, he grabbed my survivor with his huge hand and ripped him in two. This is an instant kill as well and it doesn't matter if you have full or near full health. I wouldn't have a problem with this if they would only appear AFTER I got a bunch of stuff and survivors. But they seem to appear too early in the game and it's just flat out unfair to the player in my eyes.This game can be unfair at times as well. For example, you'll be in a house with someone and you're trying to fight a few zombies that are attacking you. You are doing so great and you managed to beat them all. But then another zombie comes in and you're already out of stamina like you got freaking asthma. Hence, you can't fight as well if you don't have the stamina in order to swing a weapon. But the stamina drains like you're swinging a freaking sledgehammer when you're not even using one and it regenerates so slow as well if you don't level it up early in the game. The difficulty in this game can either be flat out frustratingly annoying or just total cheapness. Even so, they even promised and announced multiplayer on certain websites on this game too. But boy we're we disappointed when this game got released. This is another big issue to me. I hate developers who don't bring something they promise to their games. Undead Labs, if you needed more time to implement multiplayer into your games, I wouldn't mind. Just re-schedule the release date. I'm a patient man. But no, instead they decided to scrap the idea and just release the game anyway.Listen Undead Labs, you got a good game here. But unless you bring out a good game that doesn't play like a Facebook game, has challenge but, not at the very beginning and has something that you promised like multiplayer, I can't guarentee you're going to succeed as a video game making company. I'm talking to you as a gamer that knows what's best for the video gaming industry.Thank you and good bye. But please don't let this review take you away from buying this game. If you can handle this game playing it by itself when you're not playing it and if you don't mind it being singleplayer, go ahead at buy this. But I recommend buying it when it's on sale like it is now.			"

												Surival horror with ressource gathering, base building and exploration - thats pretty much describe this game.There's some pretty cool features and new mechanics in this game, like sending people out to scavenge for materials, food or meds; improving your home base (or even set it up a new place); different traits in characters witch you can change between (provided that you have helped them so much that they trust you); trading and helping out other groups of survivors; zombies reactiong to sounds like gunshot, cars and even the noise you make going through a closet looking for items; and more.. There are clearly some new ideas here (for the most obvious, just never really done before in zombiegames) and for the most they are conducted good, so you really get the feeling that your choices influences the game. In the basebuilding there are some explanations to what impact the improvements will have to the game, but for most parts  you really just take a chance and hope for the best. There are some serious issues though, for the most related to basic controls, like viewpoint being a totally messed up in close quarters (and some times even in open spaces too..), small hills being impossible to climb some times, a very (to me at least) confusing menu and inventory that doesnt make much sense + a inventory system that doesnt allow you to do anything else but destroy items to make space if your bag is filled (not very locigal in a game, where ressource gathering are a constant theme!) but at the same time allowing you to put down and pick up your WHOLE bag (???)You get the feeling that most of the issues are due to a rush job, a month or 2 more polishing would definately had payed of.. It allso seems pretty strange to put out the first DLC only a few days after release, without attending to the technical problems but I gues thats just due to the business model of gamecompanies today (greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!)What it all comes down to though is gameplay and the game clearly delivers here. Its fun and engaging and even though many missions are the same thing over and over, just in new places, it never gets to be a dealbreaker. As said, some good new ideas and features that helps the gameplay in a positive way. Definately worth its price in entertainment.7/10(reviewed after 9½ hours gametime) "

												State of Decay is one of the best zombie related games I've played. It has a strong focus on the survival aspect of the zombie apocalypse, but also includes plenty of action. I actually felt like I was part of the Walking Dead TV show.You are in charge of a group of survivors, although you don't play as one specific character. When you find and rescue people, they will often join your community, eventually becoming your friend. You can take direct control of any friendly character at any time. This is essentially a ""lives"" system, because if you die, that character is permanently dead, but you can continue playing as someone else. Characters also become tired after performing a few missions, so you need to switch control to a fresh character while the other one rests.Each survivor can endure a lot of damage. I only lost two people to zombie attacks, and only one of those was when I was in direct control. As long as you're sensible with the number of zombies you take on, and keep your inventory well stocked with weapons, ammo and health, the difficulty is reasonable.Combat is quite basic. You can use melee or guns, and there are different types of both, but they don't really feel different to use. Gunshots will draw more zombies from the surrounding area, so you only use them as a last resort. Melee is simply a case of bashing zombies till they fall over, then using a finishing move to destroy the head. There are some special zombies, very similar to Left 4 Dead's hunter and tank, plus Killing Floor's bloat and siren, but only the tank is difficult to kill, due to its high health.As you fight zombies, your melee and gun skills will automatically level up giving you passive buffs, which means its best to focus on playing as a couple of survivors, and getting them levelled up high. But if you lose a high ranked character and have to start again with a newbie, its not as punishing as, for example, Xcom.You also need to manage your community's home base. You start in a church, but have the option to relocate to one of several larger sites. You can upgrade the sleeping area, kitchen, storage, workshop and more, to support a growing population.You then have to scavenge houses and other buildings in the large open world, for supplies such as food, medicine, ammo, fuel, weapons and construction materials. The larger your community, the more supplies you need. You can carry resources back to base yourself, summon friendlies to assist, or set up outposts, which gives you ownership of the building and its contents. Fortunately there are plenty of cars available to help you travel around the map quickly. They're also very useful for running over zombie hordes.There are plenty of missions involving interactions with other groups of survivors. The story is pretty good, although nothing you haven't seen before in the zombie genre. Dialogue is well written and fully voice acted. I finished in just under 12 hours, which is pretty good value for money. Controls work great with mouse and keyboard, and most commands are fully rebindable. You can save at any time but only have one save file per game, so you can't reload to undo a death.The main reason I waited until now to play was because every time I checked the forum there were lots of bug complaints. It would appear that most of the major problems have been patched now, because my experience was very stable. I didn't crash at all, and although some aspects are a little rough around the edges, there was nothing that spoiled my enjoyment. I didn't have any framerate issues on high settings but I did get the occasional brief stutter while driving, which I assume was loading in the next area. The most common problem I had was I sometimes saw zombies and NPCs clipping through a building's door texture when the door is open. But I can forgive that because the rest of the game is fantastic.I very strongly recommend State of Decay, and a full price purchase is absolutely worth it.			"

												What can I say other than the fact that this game is an absolute gem! I waited impatiently for it to come to the PC after reading about it on the 360 - so I jumped at the chance to play it as soon as it came to Early Access (a perfect use of that system too by the way, the game was perfectly playable and only needed a few months to get keyboard support going and to get it properly optimised)Anyway, the game itself is basic but extremely satisfying for the the cost and the fact that is by no means a AAA title. You start out coming back from some hiking trip, there a zombies everywhere, shizzle goes down and you get contacted by some survivors. From there you are pretty much free to raid the towns, camp sites, farms, trailer parks and just about everything else for resoucres to help maintain moral at your base (which you can move around from a church, to houses, a fairground, a warehouse...), make trades with other groups and upgrade your base and make a few helpful trinkets (molotovs, silencers and whatnot)  A minor irritation to me was everyone will speak to you as if you were the same person no matter which survivor you switch to, but it's not that much of a bother as generally you'll build up a preference for one or two of them you'll end up only using anyway! And that's the other thing - you pour time and effort into survivors, build up imaginary details about their lives (They are relativly bland in the ingame story, but give just enough to get a hint of personality in most cases) only to then slip up and be eaten alive - and it's over. Yep, it's perma-death, you're gonna have to find a new favorite because there's no going back when you loose a survivor. And that's it really, the story is decent, may be a little weak if it was AAA but it's not - it's a cheap zombie survival game that most AAA games could only wish to be (I'm looking at you Dead Island!) For the most part graphics are rather nice here on PC, the animations are pretty basic but completly forgivable. The fighting and sneaking mechanics are solid too. It make you fill in most of the story gaps and lets you create your own attachment to the characters as you wish through the threat of losing time and effort put into each person.If you essentially want the closest possible thing to a real ""The Walking Dead: The Game"" this is it!

												What it does is very interesting and well done.  I can't help but feel though that it's almost like a facebook game where it keeps drawing you back with bonuses you recieve over time.  It's pretty addicting, however, and allows for quite a bit of micromanagment in your home base which is where you'll spend most of your later hours in the game.  It's a sandbox zombie survival that delivers what it promises and keeps you coming back for at least 15 hours if not more.  Not for everyone but quite a bit of fun when you get into it.			"

												State of Decay: One of the greatest - if not THE greatest - single player zombie survival games.Here's a short summary:-Several NPCs, who you can eventually play as         -Various characters         -Short and sweet backstories-Zombie killing by hand, by gun, or by car. Blood everywhere.         -While driving, you can open your door as a 'door attack'. Hilarity and bloodsplatters.-Stealth kills and sneaking away from hoardes: intense-Loot all the things!-An abundance of missions in a fairly expansive world-Build-A-Base mechanic makes your survival a changeable experience-Don't die! Hardcore lives. You die, you can't come back. Only play as another character. The autosave feature enhances this, as you can't just go and select a save file. Be safe out there.The game, in my opinion, is fantastic. I've had so much fun in the short time I've played it, and it looks like I have a way to go.There are a few problems, though, but not any that ruin anything.-Small glitches in fighting, grounded zombie can suddenly stand up and attack you from behind-Some repitition (though wouldn't surviving like this be repetitive?)-Dialog repeating (can get annoying)-Very easy sometimes. The difficulty should be toggleable, as right now some 'hard'-type missions can be done easily.If you're on edge about getting this game, I nudge you towards buying it. This game is full of moments, which is something I look for. Sometimes you'll be barely sneaking back to your base through zombies, other times you'll be driving down the road in a rusted up pickup truck, opening your doors to whack a couple of hitchiking zombies. Absolutely marvelous as far as zombie games go.			"

Bad show.  Yup for people with this version of the game they have to pay almost a full game price for hardly any content at all just to get some hotfixes and a tiny bit of extra content.			"

												What can I say other than the fact that this game is an absolute gem! I waited impatiently for it to come to the PC after reading about it on the 360 - so I jumped at the chance to play it as soon as it came to Early Access (a perfect use of that system too by the way, the game was perfectly playable and only needed a few months to get keyboard support going and to get it properly optimised)Anyway, the game itself is basic but extremely satisfying for the the cost and the fact that is by no means a AAA title. You start out coming back from some hiking trip, there a zombies everywhere, shizzle goes down and you get contacted by some survivors. From there you are pretty much free to raid the towns, camp sites, farms, trailer parks and just about everything else for resoucres to help maintain moral at your base (which you can move around from a church, to houses, a fairground, a warehouse...), make trades with other groups and upgrade your base and make a few helpful trinkets (molotovs, silencers and whatnot)  A minor irritation to me was everyone will speak to you as if you were the same person no matter which survivor you switch to, but it's not that much of a bother as generally you'll build up a preference for one or two of them you'll end up only using anyway! And that's the other thing - you pour time and effort into survivors, build up imaginary details about their lives (They are relativly bland in the ingame story, but give just enough to get a hint of personality in most cases) only to then slip up and be eaten alive - and it's over. Yep, it's perma-death, you're gonna have to find a new favorite because there's no going back when you loose a survivor. And that's it really, the story is decent, may be a little weak if it was AAA but it's not - it's a cheap zombie survival game that most AAA games could only wish to be (I'm looking at you Dead Island!) For the most part graphics are rather nice here on PC, the animations are pretty basic but completly forgivable. The fighting and sneaking mechanics are solid too. It make you fill in most of the story gaps and lets you create your own attachment to the characters as you wish through the threat of losing time and effort put into each person.If you essentially want the closest possible thing to a real ""The Walking Dead: The Game"" this is it!

												Probably one of the best zombie type games I have played in a long time. Picture GTA with zombies but with more complex gameplay. Build up your homesite the way you want. Make sure you have a medical area and enough beds for everyone to sleep. Create a workshop for crafting and repairing. Upgrade it and find a mechanic survivor and he/she can work on cars for you. Want to turn your canned goods into a feast make sure you have a chef survivor. When this place gets too small move to another area with a bigger site to call home. Missions go on even while you are not playing.. your other survivors are always active. The current state of the beta is still very much playable. A little buggy at some points but there is no reason you cant fully enjoy it. Oh and I just found out that while you are playing as X survivor they do have the ability to die but the game goes on. You can switch and play as any of the survivors that have a high enough firend/trust relationship with you.			"

												A single player game where you are a community of survivors trying not to die in a recent zombie apocalypse.Realtime Third person action/foraging game.SummaryI love the game but it has its flaws, well worth the price.The DrawPermenant character death (the gear/backpack is recoverable from a dead survivor) and you control an individual but can call out backup from home or other survivor communities in a fight or to cart the heavy cargo home (optional escort quest or let them solo the risk).Vehicles with decent variation (from sensible 4 door family wagons to 4 x 4 pickups and 2 door musclecars)suprisingly threatening zombies. The standard zombies are dangerous in packs, special infected need specific takedown methods (bullet immune, boomer, tank/charger hybrid, stalker), which can encourage you to take the risk and bring a friendly NPC with you (unless its the tank hunt mission in which case it is certain death to the somewhat sluggish NPC character)good map setup where after the campaign intro you can move to and fortify one of several base site options, the dlc provides an endless map escalation scenario (campaign map with an escape to make harder function), and a mode focussed on base defence and deep insertion rescue and harvesting missions.moving around is kept dangerous, campaign map resources are finite so each reload full of (noisy) bullets is important, damaged mele weapons need to be swapped out for fresh ones before they break so they can be repaired overnight, cars though numerous and powerful can start to become limited later on if you crash to many times or get caught offguard while mowing down a horde.the detrimentI had an issue with the storage box where it would force me ot take the 1st item selected whenever I opened the crate, gear is requisitioned by faction/fame points and taking an item out costa more than putting an item in. the bug lead to rare shortages of fame (when it pulled out a ranged weapon)The combat is functional but clunky, the special moves/passives earned by capping player traits help but the basic mele and gun combat lacks depth. distractions, firebombs, grenades, etc help but Lack of sneak options. Later on with a capable/levelled survivor I could manage a horde or 2 horde with manageable risk and careful use of a moltov, there were few opportunities where stealth felt like an option. quietly foraging a house in the middle of an infected area is one thing but every new house seemed to have 3-5 zombies you had to take out in the process, being quiet only prevents a roaming herd from getting in on the action (which tends to waste a sizeable portion of resouces to handle safely)core gameplay is similar to dead island, assassins creed (fixed world, unimaginative mele and satisfying stealth kills) and system shock 2 (there's you and an environment and the aggressive hordes out for your blood, resources are limited and you need to get stuff done)			"

												The story and gameplay was fun. I played without reading about strategy/tactics for the game before hand, and I think that helped. It was fun discovery while occasionally losing characters. Near the end of the story I did get bored with the repeat missions, only because I'd solved (for me) the most easiest way to do them.If you like scavenging, mini base building, and killing zombies you'll enjoy the game. The combat mechanics are also entertaining and (for me) just challenging enough to make it fun stress.			"

												Finally a zombie game that actually gets the point of zombies! It's not about shooting zombies - they're slow and stupid! No, it's all about the base - you know I'm right. You and your friends already know where your base is going to be if a Zombie Apocalypse happens - you've planned it in detail, worked out who you'd take, what to loot first.Yet Zombie games are all about wandering around on your own, shooting them. Until now. State of Decay places you in the midst of the Zombie Apocalypse and your onjective is primal - survive, by pulling together a team of other survivors with the skills you need, finding and modifying a base to fill your needs and keeping it supplied. To make this somewhat more difficult, you have zombies trying to eat you. You have your basic Ready Salted Zombie, slow, stupid, endlessly hungry and more than a little squishy, especially around the head. But just to make things a little more tricky, you have a cavalcade of Freaks - mutant zombies with different patterns of behaviour to normal. And they are NASTY.In any game about survival, it's important that however skilled you become, there is something that can kill you unless it screws up or you don't, and State of Decay provides these in a plethora of different ways. Zombies are attracted to noise, so fire your gun without a silencer, crash your car or have a companion who dies screaming and they will start homing in on you from miles away. The more zombies you're fighting, the louder things get and the more zombies come. The endless numbers can wear you down and as exhaustion takes its toll, the end is often close behind.If not through a steady trickle of reinforcements, you might instead fall afoul of a full-fledged zombie horde, wandering the streets looking for warm-blooded food. Your location might be surrounded by them and fall under siege and yes, you do get to board up the windows. It keeps you safe for a while, until some gigantic redneck farmchild too large to fit through the door punches it through, drags you out and tears you in two. Flee and you might be run down by a speeding deceased member of the armed forces or a SWAT team agent in full body-armour and helmet, or pounced on from out of the blue by the swift and deadly animalistic Ferals.Successfully combine your fighting and running and get clear and back to base? Don't worry, you'll probably still die from the Black Fever carried by bloated, ancient corpses in the mob - and by your companions, once they're exposed. Medicine is in short supply and medical know-how, even shorter - you either recover, or you die... and then come back for your friends.If all that's not enough, you have the armed forces up to dubious things in the area, a former judge attempting to enforce the rules of civilized society in a world where there isn't one, a redneck family one banjo short of Deliverance, a doomed love affair and a passel of mis-matched survivors steadily driving each other insane. Suicide, murder and run-aways are all risks you'll run, along with drug addiction from the amphetamines you're jamming down your throat and up your nose just to stay on your feet. Oh, and one of you might just be a serial killer. State of Decay gives a proper nod to all the tropes of the genre. I haven't found any chainsaws, which seems a grotesque oversight, but you can spot the zombies who've been chewed through the chest by a lawnmower a la ""Braindead"". Look closely enough at the magazine racks and grocery packaging and see the order to OBEY from ""They Live"", Hedge trimmers? Check. Oar? Yup. The faithful rusty pipe of Silent Hill? Aw hells, yeah. Can you knock a Zed's head off by opening the car door as you drive past it at speed? Of course!The base locations are also classics - a shipping warehouse, a posh walled manor, the local Church, a barricaded farmhouse out of town, an amusement park... all have their pros and cons and on the whole, are very well-balanced.The main weak point of the game is characterization, with little more than a few lines of insight into one motivation of some of the characters, which appears in a dialogue when the character is getting to know you. In a game where you're expected to lose a few characters and switch to playing others, a measure of emotional attachment would really add to the atmosphere. Game mechanics, however, provide a surrogate reason to get attached to characters - after all that time training their skills, the loss of a character can bring a chilling feeling of doom, especially if they were the only one in your band of survivors with an essential skill, and the moods of your fellow survivors crash drastically after any loss.While vanilla State of Decay's story mode is great fun, where it really comes into its own is with the Breakdown DLC. Breakdown sets the game to sandbox mode. You start with only your character (and Lily, your non-combatant radio operator) and build up a group and a base, accomplish certain objectives to unlock new characters or recruit other groups of survivors, play the level for as long as you wish, however you wish, then pick your six favourite characters, bundle them onto an RV with all your remaining gear and start the level again... only this time it's harder. And then you do it again, and again, and again. Your characters can become pretty experienced like this, but only if they survive. The ratio of difficulty to character skill is very well judged, so no matter how well you survived the last x levels and how godly your characters are, there is always a definite sense that you are in much more trouble this time... without it ever quite feeling impossible.The game has a few bugs, but they are mostly minor and don't crop up repeatedly, so they're not game breaking but you might lose a character or two to teleporting Freaks or your car suddenly flipping and exploding for no reason.If you're looking for a Zombie Apocalypse simulator, this is the one you've been waiting for while you plot your survival strategies in the pub with friends. Don't forget to buy Breakdown, because the story mode will have you aching for the sandbox during those moments when the plot is demanding your attention and you want to ransack just one... more.. cupboard.

												State of Decay is one of the best zombie related games I've played. It has a strong focus on the survival aspect of the zombie apocalypse, but also includes plenty of action. I actually felt like I was part of the Walking Dead TV show.You are in charge of a group of survivors, although you don't play as one specific character. When you find and rescue people, they will often join your community, eventually becoming your friend. You can take direct control of any friendly character at any time. This is essentially a ""lives"" system, because if you die, that character is permanently dead, but you can continue playing as someone else. Characters also become tired after performing a few missions, so you need to switch control to a fresh character while the other one rests.Each survivor can endure a lot of damage. I only lost two people to zombie attacks, and only one of those was when I was in direct control. As long as you're sensible with the number of zombies you take on, and keep your inventory well stocked with weapons, ammo and health, the difficulty is reasonable.Combat is quite basic. You can use melee or guns, and there are different types of both, but they don't really feel different to use. Gunshots will draw more zombies from the surrounding area, so you only use them as a last resort. Melee is simply a case of bashing zombies till they fall over, then using a finishing move to destroy the head. There are some special zombies, very similar to Left 4 Dead's hunter and tank, plus Killing Floor's bloat and siren, but only the tank is difficult to kill, due to its high health.As you fight zombies, your melee and gun skills will automatically level up giving you passive buffs, which means its best to focus on playing as a couple of survivors, and getting them levelled up high. But if you lose a high ranked character and have to start again with a newbie, its not as punishing as, for example, Xcom.You also need to manage your community's home base. You start in a church, but have the option to relocate to one of several larger sites. You can upgrade the sleeping area, kitchen, storage, workshop and more, to support a growing population.You then have to scavenge houses and other buildings in the large open world, for supplies such as food, medicine, ammo, fuel, weapons and construction materials. The larger your community, the more supplies you need. You can carry resources back to base yourself, summon friendlies to assist, or set up outposts, which gives you ownership of the building and its contents. Fortunately there are plenty of cars available to help you travel around the map quickly. They're also very useful for running over zombie hordes.There are plenty of missions involving interactions with other groups of survivors. The story is pretty good, although nothing you haven't seen before in the zombie genre. Dialogue is well written and fully voice acted. I finished in just under 12 hours, which is pretty good value for money. Controls work great with mouse and keyboard, and most commands are fully rebindable. You can save at any time but only have one save file per game, so you can't reload to undo a death.The main reason I waited until now to play was because every time I checked the forum there were lots of bug complaints. It would appear that most of the major problems have been patched now, because my experience was very stable. I didn't crash at all, and although some aspects are a little rough around the edges, there was nothing that spoiled my enjoyment. I didn't have any framerate issues on high settings but I did get the occasional brief stutter while driving, which I assume was loading in the next area. The most common problem I had was I sometimes saw zombies and NPCs clipping through a building's door texture when the door is open. But I can forgive that because the rest of the game is fantastic.I very strongly recommend State of Decay, and a full price purchase is absolutely worth it.			"

												Great zombie survival game. I love how you can grow your survivor community and fortify your areas. When I first bought this game I played it non-stop through the story and then bought the expansion and have since kind of stopped playing as much. As fun as it is, it gets repititious after awhile and you begin to feel the shallowness of the characters. Don't get me wrong, I love the game, but I think it would be nice if the developer would add more of a backstory on the characters, more events and missions, and more safehouses/upgrade/fortification options as that is the best part of the game in my opinion.I kind of burnt myself out on this game for a bit but then started watching AMC's The Walking Dead and got back in the mood for it. It's a good simple game that you can pick up where you left off and play off and on as you wish.All in all I think SoD is worth $20. I just hope to see better expansions in the future. The current expansion, SoD- Breakdown, is just more of the same original game. Same locations, safehouses and zombies. Not worth the money.			"

												State of Decay is the stand-out game of the Summer Sale so far.  It is an open world zombie game that does a lot of things right. In each expansion you control a community who is trying to survive the zombie apocalypse.  You are collecting supplies, upgrading your home, and trying to stay alive.  You control one character at a time but can switch freely between the other members of your community.  Easily worth the price of the Steam Sale.  The expansions are stand-alone scenarios so if you are wary about buying the game then you can just start with the base.  The only negative points I'd give it are for technical issues.  I was crashing semi-frequently but I was able to sort the issues out and hasn't happened much since.			"

This game is one of the better single-player zombies games without a doubt.			"

												If Walking Dead meetings Fallout 3 sounds good to you... you should buy this game immediately.  My only suggestion is that you have a usb Xbox 360 controller.  The mouse controls are a bit wonky, and I found the overall experience better with controller... since this was designed originally to be an XBLA title.  Really great game.			"

												This is the best zombie apocalypse game I could ever dream of. I am f*cking serious. Seems like developers took all the best from lots of games and made an ultimate zombie survival sandbox. This game reminds me so much of GTA, Left 4 Dead, The Walking Dead, Dead Rising and even the old Jagged Alliance (probably because of team management and it's color spectrum lol)- open world (area is not that big, but you can enter and scavenge any place or building you want);- tons of weapons ranged from melee (from baseball bats and shovels to wakizashi and braid) to heavy guns and grenade launchers etc.;- tons of different combat skills and perks, which really bring diversity into a simple fight;- random character generation (apart from plot characters);- character leveling;- plot missions which lead you through the game but are not annoying and you can play them whenever you want (I've played nearly 30 hours until I decided to get through the story);- base and team management, building of different facilities for survivors, upgrading them;- great soundtrack (COUNTRY ♥♥♥♥ YEAH) and ambient which makes already thick atmosphere even stronger;And of course, dat feel when you slam passing by zombies with your car's side door – OMG 10 out of 10 GOTYP.S. I didn’t expect this game to be so cool when I first heard of it. Some say (especially the ones who haven’t played it or played on youtube) that it is too casual, arcade and console-like, but it’s not true. This game has great atmosphere which overcomes everything. Seriously, just give it a try. Yes, graphics is not that good, but it is not that important. Plus, the developers have fixed lots of bugs and problems with controls, thank God I didn’t play this game during the early access, it would kill the first impression for sure.P.P.S. This game does not need multiplayer or co-op of any kind. It would kill all the atmosphere.			"

												Not bad when it's on offer; quite simular to Dead Island only third person. You find groups, you build resouces to protect etc as you move through the story.On my version for some reason the graphics were set to low, easily adjustable. Not amazingly designed; you'll notice a few graphical flaws here and there but if you catch the game on offer for around 7.49 then you will get your moneys worth. There isn't much of an introduction upon staring a new game and you are thrown straight into it with a journal to read to gain information on who you are, what you were doing up until the apparant zombie apocalypes.  The controls are pretty simple, nothing strenious i've found. No multiplayer which I found surprising at first but thinking about it; what's the point in paying out for servers when the top dogs are going to be the Left for Dead series and now Dayz for the forseeable future. If Microsoft Studios were realistic about this then possibly a wise move; and a little more investment into the game itself. I think the idea of this is more to game play; the graphics and charactor models themselves are not amazing. In fact if I was being over picky one could say the actual graphics and AI are somewhat terrible. I'd class it as the sensible soccer of zombie games,  it'll never beat the top dogs like fifa (or in this case left for dead and dayz) but does offer a fun alternative.Wait for the sale.			"

												One word. Actual survival. This isn't a standard ""Left for dead"" or even ""Dead Island."" you have to upkeep your home base as well as expanding. You can take over other areas. You have to keep your team's morale up. It actually has guns that you can get ammo for! Dead Island was a great game except the fact that there was no ammo. You found guns but never wanted to use them because all you have is 6 shots in the entire game. This game you have to manage resources as well. I have not played ""Dying Light"" because my computer cannot run it but this game beats all of other zombie survival games out there. I 500% recommend this. It is a great value for the price.			"

												With over 900 hours logged on this game, I can honestly say that State of Decay, and it's add-ons, is one of my all-time favorite games.  My wife, who isa casual gamer, kind of fell in love with this game, too.  From the brutal, Savini-esque gore, to the to the heart-breaking decisions of having to put a community member down, this zombie game has just about everything.  A character can climb into a vehicle and plow through a horde of zombies (which will ultimately destroy your vehicle), toss a pipe bomb over the shoulder into a window and clear out a zombie infestation, build structures in your base to aid your community, gather resources, call in artillery fire...for a game that only encompasses about 12 square miles, it is quite epic.  Add on the Breakdown DLC for some sandbox play with ever escalating difficulty levels and loads of heroes to unlock and you've got a LOT of fun.  If you're lucky enough to have the Lifeline DLC, you'll be introduced to a whole new set of characters, with new mission types, and a larger city that isn't Trumball Valley.Pros: Variety of zombie typesUseable vehiclesLarge assortment of melee and ranged weaponsRPG-style elements like leveling up skills, large areas to explore, character backgrounds to discoverExcellent graphics, very usefull 3rd person POVWell-made, moody soundtrack and eerie sound effects, especially in 5.1 surroundModableGamepad friendly (I recommend X-Box 36 controller)Cons:Missions can become repetitive, especially in sandbox (Breakdown) modeSteep system requirements for the highest quality settingsDialog can become monotonous, could use more custom linesWould benefit greatly from co-op, especially local co-op, modeOverall, I highly recommend this game, 4.5/5			"

You can build and upgrade existing structures in your base, which is very awesome.

All characters are playable, and the more you play with one character their skills go up.Missions and quests, drive the main plot or keep up with side quests.Think GTA crossed with The walking dead.I HIGHLY recommend this.

												State of Decay: One of the greatest - if not THE greatest - single player zombie survival games.Here's a short summary:-Several NPCs, who you can eventually play as         -Various characters         -Short and sweet backstories-Zombie killing by hand, by gun, or by car. Blood everywhere.         -While driving, you can open your door as a 'door attack'. Hilarity and bloodsplatters.-Stealth kills and sneaking away from hoardes: intense-Loot all the things!-An abundance of missions in a fairly expansive world-Build-A-Base mechanic makes your survival a changeable experience-Don't die! Hardcore lives. You die, you can't come back. Only play as another character. The autosave feature enhances this, as you can't just go and select a save file. Be safe out there.The game, in my opinion, is fantastic. I've had so much fun in the short time I've played it, and it looks like I have a way to go.There are a few problems, though, but not any that ruin anything.-Small glitches in fighting, grounded zombie can suddenly stand up and attack you from behind-Some repitition (though wouldn't surviving like this be repetitive?)-Dialog repeating (can get annoying)-Very easy sometimes. The difficulty should be toggleable, as right now some 'hard'-type missions can be done easily.If you're on edge about getting this game, I nudge you towards buying it. This game is full of moments, which is something I look for. Sometimes you'll be barely sneaking back to your base through zombies, other times you'll be driving down the road in a rusted up pickup truck, opening your doors to whack a couple of hitchiking zombies. Absolutely marvelous as far as zombie games go.			"

												What it does is very interesting and well done.  I can't help but feel though that it's almost like a facebook game where it keeps drawing you back with bonuses you recieve over time.  It's pretty addicting, however, and allows for quite a bit of micromanagment in your home base which is where you'll spend most of your later hours in the game.  It's a sandbox zombie survival that delivers what it promises and keeps you coming back for at least 15 hours if not more.  Not for everyone but quite a bit of fun when you get into it.			"

												State of Decay is one of the best zombie related games I've played. It has a strong focus on the survival aspect of the zombie apocalypse, but also includes plenty of action. I actually felt like I was part of the Walking Dead TV show.You are in charge of a group of survivors, although you don't play as one specific character. When you find and rescue people, they will often join your community, eventually becoming your friend. You can take direct control of any friendly character at any time. This is essentially a ""lives"" system, because if you die, that character is permanently dead, but you can continue playing as someone else. Characters also become tired after performing a few missions, so you need to switch control to a fresh character while the other one rests.Each survivor can endure a lot of damage. I only lost two people to zombie attacks, and only one of those was when I was in direct control. As long as you're sensible with the number of zombies you take on, and keep your inventory well stocked with weapons, ammo and health, the difficulty is reasonable.Combat is quite basic. You can use melee or guns, and there are different types of both, but they don't really feel different to use. Gunshots will draw more zombies from the surrounding area, so you only use them as a last resort. Melee is simply a case of bashing zombies till they fall over, then using a finishing move to destroy the head. There are some special zombies, very similar to Left 4 Dead's hunter and tank, plus Killing Floor's bloat and siren, but only the tank is difficult to kill, due to its high health.As you fight zombies, your melee and gun skills will automatically level up giving you passive buffs, which means its best to focus on playing as a couple of survivors, and getting them levelled up high. But if you lose a high ranked character and have to start again with a newbie, its not as punishing as, for example, Xcom.You also need to manage your community's home base. You start in a church, but have the option to relocate to one of several larger sites. You can upgrade the sleeping area, kitchen, storage, workshop and more, to support a growing population.You then have to scavenge houses and other buildings in the large open world, for supplies such as food, medicine, ammo, fuel, weapons and construction materials. The larger your community, the more supplies you need. You can carry resources back to base yourself, summon friendlies to assist, or set up outposts, which gives you ownership of the building and its contents. Fortunately there are plenty of cars available to help you travel around the map quickly. They're also very useful for running over zombie hordes.There are plenty of missions involving interactions with other groups of survivors. The story is pretty good, although nothing you haven't seen before in the zombie genre. Dialogue is well written and fully voice acted. I finished in just under 12 hours, which is pretty good value for money. Controls work great with mouse and keyboard, and most commands are fully rebindable. You can save at any time but only have one save file per game, so you can't reload to undo a death.The main reason I waited until now to play was because every time I checked the forum there were lots of bug complaints. It would appear that most of the major problems have been patched now, because my experience was very stable. I didn't crash at all, and although some aspects are a little rough around the edges, there was nothing that spoiled my enjoyment. I didn't have any framerate issues on high settings but I did get the occasional brief stutter while driving, which I assume was loading in the next area. The most common problem I had was I sometimes saw zombies and NPCs clipping through a building's door texture when the door is open. But I can forgive that because the rest of the game is fantastic.I very strongly recommend State of Decay, and a full price purchase is absolutely worth it.			"

												Surival horror with ressource gathering, base building and exploration - thats pretty much describe this game.There's some pretty cool features and new mechanics in this game, like sending people out to scavenge for materials, food or meds; improving your home base (or even set it up a new place); different traits in characters witch you can change between (provided that you have helped them so much that they trust you); trading and helping out other groups of survivors; zombies reactiong to sounds like gunshot, cars and even the noise you make going through a closet looking for items; and more.. There are clearly some new ideas here (for the most obvious, just never really done before in zombiegames) and for the most they are conducted good, so you really get the feeling that your choices influences the game. In the basebuilding there are some explanations to what impact the improvements will have to the game, but for most parts  you really just take a chance and hope for the best. There are some serious issues though, for the most related to basic controls, like viewpoint being a totally messed up in close quarters (and some times even in open spaces too..), small hills being impossible to climb some times, a very (to me at least) confusing menu and inventory that doesnt make much sense + a inventory system that doesnt allow you to do anything else but destroy items to make space if your bag is filled (not very locigal in a game, where ressource gathering are a constant theme!) but at the same time allowing you to put down and pick up your WHOLE bag (???)You get the feeling that most of the issues are due to a rush job, a month or 2 more polishing would definately had payed of.. It allso seems pretty strange to put out the first DLC only a few days after release, without attending to the technical problems but I gues thats just due to the business model of gamecompanies today (greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!)What it all comes down to though is gameplay and the game clearly delivers here. Its fun and engaging and even though many missions are the same thing over and over, just in new places, it never gets to be a dealbreaker. As said, some good new ideas and features that helps the gameplay in a positive way. Definately worth its price in entertainment.7/10(reviewed after 9½ hours gametime) "

												It has a lot of the good parts of DayZ without the difficulty of having to deal with other players. The way you manage your safe-house is well done, not too much micro. I've heard it compared to a single-player version of Left4Dead but that's not accurate at all. The map is extensive and the game is more about exploring and hoarding than it is about story. Speaking of story, just when it was getting a little bit tedious... the game ended. A little bit anti-climatic and predictable, but still good.The price was worth it at 20.			"

												State of Decay is the stand-out game of the Summer Sale so far.  It is an open world zombie game that does a lot of things right. In each expansion you control a community who is trying to survive the zombie apocalypse.  You are collecting supplies, upgrading your home, and trying to stay alive.  You control one character at a time but can switch freely between the other members of your community.  Easily worth the price of the Steam Sale.  The expansions are stand-alone scenarios so if you are wary about buying the game then you can just start with the base.  The only negative points I'd give it are for technical issues.  I was crashing semi-frequently but I was able to sort the issues out and hasn't happened much since.			"

												One of the best zombie survival games I've played.Managing the resources at your base, scavenging for those resources, vehicles.The things I don't like about it however is I wish there an easier way to ramp the difficulty up earlier on.(No difficulty options in Vanilla, on Breakdown you need to unlock difficulty levels by completing them.)I also wish there were more map selections and/or random maps.The default map is a decent size though, so i'm not overly picky about it, but it can get old after awhile.And also there's no multiplayer, though I've heard it might be added, that would definitely be a huge plus.Despite those negatives, anyone interesting in a good zombie survival game should definitely pick it up;I hesitated due to negative reviews and that was a big mistake, I'm very happy I picked it up.

												State of Decay but as some of my friends would call it, Just every other zombie game. This game however has certain elements to it that are different to any other zombie game I have played. In other games you usually start off with a large group of people with guns and you blast your way through the hordes of zombies that apparantly always know where you are but State of Decay is a different matter all together. Your first weapon is a simple branch you picked up off the ground and you have to use it as best you can to beat some skulls in, the animations for this is very well done and the finishing moves sends the zombies head into the sky. But if your not in the mood to kill or your branch has broken, you can just crouch down, move through the bushes and the zombies won't even know your there which is also good for sneak attacks for an easy kill.I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves survival games or just enjoy the feeling of beating in skulls with a variety of blunt weapons			"

												Open-world, with repairable vehicles and weapons, a wide variety of procedurally generated characters, lots of loot, a clever looting system, and persistent world that WILL continue without you. Absolutely definitely get this game...but make sure you have three or four days free, because otherwise that persistent world WILL ♥♥♥♥ing ruin you.			"

												First thing about playing State of Decay. DON'T TAKE A LENGTHY BREAK FROM THIS GAME! No. Just don't do it. I'll bring out the spray bottle of water. This game will use resources on each actual day. Not only does this game only have a set amount of resources each playthrough, but your enclave will fraggin' perish if you don't gather them resources after a few days. Only if you have the truck depot or fairgrounds will you be able to gather enough resources for them to last more then a week. And that's if they don't die due to your walls turning to crap.With that out of the way, this is a pretty good zombie sim. You can do distractions, there are special types, the guns feel great, and the artwork is good if it's your style. There is a decent amount of drama, not enough to drown in, and plenty of things to do. As long as, you know, don't run out of resources in your sandbox. That cat poop is useful sometimes.			"

												One word. Actual survival. This isn't a standard ""Left for dead"" or even ""Dead Island."" you have to upkeep your home base as well as expanding. You can take over other areas. You have to keep your team's morale up. It actually has guns that you can get ammo for! Dead Island was a great game except the fact that there was no ammo. You found guns but never wanted to use them because all you have is 6 shots in the entire game. This game you have to manage resources as well. I have not played ""Dying Light"" because my computer cannot run it but this game beats all of other zombie survival games out there. I 500% recommend this. It is a great value for the price.			"

												This is the best zombie apocalypse game I could ever dream of. I am f*cking serious. Seems like developers took all the best from lots of games and made an ultimate zombie survival sandbox. This game reminds me so much of GTA, Left 4 Dead, The Walking Dead, Dead Rising and even the old Jagged Alliance (probably because of team management and it's color spectrum lol)- open world (area is not that big, but you can enter and scavenge any place or building you want);- tons of weapons ranged from melee (from baseball bats and shovels to wakizashi and braid) to heavy guns and grenade launchers etc.;- tons of different combat skills and perks, which really bring diversity into a simple fight;- random character generation (apart from plot characters);- character leveling;- plot missions which lead you through the game but are not annoying and you can play them whenever you want (I've played nearly 30 hours until I decided to get through the story);- base and team management, building of different facilities for survivors, upgrading them;- great soundtrack (COUNTRY ♥♥♥♥ YEAH) and ambient which makes already thick atmosphere even stronger;And of course, dat feel when you slam passing by zombies with your car's side door – OMG 10 out of 10 GOTYP.S. I didn’t expect this game to be so cool when I first heard of it. Some say (especially the ones who haven’t played it or played on youtube) that it is too casual, arcade and console-like, but it’s not true. This game has great atmosphere which overcomes everything. Seriously, just give it a try. Yes, graphics is not that good, but it is not that important. Plus, the developers have fixed lots of bugs and problems with controls, thank God I didn’t play this game during the early access, it would kill the first impression for sure.P.P.S. This game does not need multiplayer or co-op of any kind. It would kill all the atmosphere.			"

												With over 900 hours logged on this game, I can honestly say that State of Decay, and it's add-ons, is one of my all-time favorite games.  My wife, who isa casual gamer, kind of fell in love with this game, too.  From the brutal, Savini-esque gore, to the to the heart-breaking decisions of having to put a community member down, this zombie game has just about everything.  A character can climb into a vehicle and plow through a horde of zombies (which will ultimately destroy your vehicle), toss a pipe bomb over the shoulder into a window and clear out a zombie infestation, build structures in your base to aid your community, gather resources, call in artillery fire...for a game that only encompasses about 12 square miles, it is quite epic.  Add on the Breakdown DLC for some sandbox play with ever escalating difficulty levels and loads of heroes to unlock and you've got a LOT of fun.  If you're lucky enough to have the Lifeline DLC, you'll be introduced to a whole new set of characters, with new mission types, and a larger city that isn't Trumball Valley.Pros: Variety of zombie typesUseable vehiclesLarge assortment of melee and ranged weaponsRPG-style elements like leveling up skills, large areas to explore, character backgrounds to discoverExcellent graphics, very usefull 3rd person POVWell-made, moody soundtrack and eerie sound effects, especially in 5.1 surroundModableGamepad friendly (I recommend X-Box 36 controller)Cons:Missions can become repetitive, especially in sandbox (Breakdown) modeSteep system requirements for the highest quality settingsDialog can become monotonous, could use more custom linesWould benefit greatly from co-op, especially local co-op, modeOverall, I highly recommend this game, 4.5/5			"

												I was skeptical at first what with all the horrible zombie games coming out lately, but this one is pretty great. I especially enjoy the base building and character development aspects. The DLC is also very much worth buying as it gives you an 'endless' game mode, which allows you to pack up and head to a totally new town when you've picked an area clean of resources and survivors.

												If you like bashing some undead skulls in while exploring a huge dynamic enviroment keeping yourself and other playable surivivors safe at the same time, this is one helluva ride with vehicles for travel and even home bases to fortify against the onslaught, however depsite the great fun and action, like all other games, it has some annoying bugs but nothing game-breaking and the devs can hopefully smooth out later on. The camera motion takes some getting use to though. The dlc gives it great replay ability and even supports modding, which I personally would love to see more of from those amazing modders out there! :) If your a zombie♥♥♥♥♥kicker or just  like to take your time with their play-through then this is one to grab, just don't let the Zees grab you alone in the dark...

												For a zombie post-apocalyptic game this rates very high on my list, because it touches base on strategic survival rather than running-and-gunning. Supplies must be used wisely and overuse of a single character is costly. The game forces you to balance out decisions in order to survive. This game is one of the better single-player zombies games without a doubt.			"

												Probably one of the best zombie type games I have played in a long time. Picture GTA with zombies but with more complex gameplay. Build up your homesite the way you want. Make sure you have a medical area and enough beds for everyone to sleep. Create a workshop for crafting and repairing. Upgrade it and find a mechanic survivor and he/she can work on cars for you. Want to turn your canned goods into a feast make sure you have a chef survivor. When this place gets too small move to another area with a bigger site to call home. Missions go on even while you are not playing.. your other survivors are always active. The current state of the beta is still very much playable. A little buggy at some points but there is no reason you cant fully enjoy it. Oh and I just found out that while you are playing as X survivor they do have the ability to die but the game goes on. You can switch and play as any of the survivors that have a high enough firend/trust relationship with you.			"

												Finally a zombie game that actually gets the point of zombies! It's not about shooting zombies - they're slow and stupid! No, it's all about the base - you know I'm right. You and your friends already know where your base is going to be if a Zombie Apocalypse happens - you've planned it in detail, worked out who you'd take, what to loot first.Yet Zombie games are all about wandering around on your own, shooting them. Until now. State of Decay places you in the midst of the Zombie Apocalypse and your onjective is primal - survive, by pulling together a team of other survivors with the skills you need, finding and modifying a base to fill your needs and keeping it supplied. To make this somewhat more difficult, you have zombies trying to eat you. You have your basic Ready Salted Zombie, slow, stupid, endlessly hungry and more than a little squishy, especially around the head. But just to make things a little more tricky, you have a cavalcade of Freaks - mutant zombies with different patterns of behaviour to normal. And they are NASTY.In any game about survival, it's important that however skilled you become, there is something that can kill you unless it screws up or you don't, and State of Decay provides these in a plethora of different ways. Zombies are attracted to noise, so fire your gun without a silencer, crash your car or have a companion who dies screaming and they will start homing in on you from miles away. The more zombies you're fighting, the louder things get and the more zombies come. The endless numbers can wear you down and as exhaustion takes its toll, the end is often close behind.If not through a steady trickle of reinforcements, you might instead fall afoul of a full-fledged zombie horde, wandering the streets looking for warm-blooded food. Your location might be surrounded by them and fall under siege and yes, you do get to board up the windows. It keeps you safe for a while, until some gigantic redneck farmchild too large to fit through the door punches it through, drags you out and tears you in two. Flee and you might be run down by a speeding deceased member of the armed forces or a SWAT team agent in full body-armour and helmet, or pounced on from out of the blue by the swift and deadly animalistic Ferals.Successfully combine your fighting and running and get clear and back to base? Don't worry, you'll probably still die from the Black Fever carried by bloated, ancient corpses in the mob - and by your companions, once they're exposed. Medicine is in short supply and medical know-how, even shorter - you either recover, or you die... and then come back for your friends.If all that's not enough, you have the armed forces up to dubious things in the area, a former judge attempting to enforce the rules of civilized society in a world where there isn't one, a redneck family one banjo short of Deliverance, a doomed love affair and a passel of mis-matched survivors steadily driving each other insane. Suicide, murder and run-aways are all risks you'll run, along with drug addiction from the amphetamines you're jamming down your throat and up your nose just to stay on your feet. Oh, and one of you might just be a serial killer. State of Decay gives a proper nod to all the tropes of the genre. I haven't found any chainsaws, which seems a grotesque oversight, but you can spot the zombies who've been chewed through the chest by a lawnmower a la ""Braindead"". Look closely enough at the magazine racks and grocery packaging and see the order to OBEY from ""They Live"", Hedge trimmers? Check. Oar? Yup. The faithful rusty pipe of Silent Hill? Aw hells, yeah. Can you knock a Zed's head off by opening the car door as you drive past it at speed? Of course!The base locations are also classics - a shipping warehouse, a posh walled manor, the local Church, a barricaded farmhouse out of town, an amusement park... all have their pros and cons and on the whole, are very well-balanced.The main weak point of the game is characterization, with little more than a few lines of insight into one motivation of some of the characters, which appears in a dialogue when the character is getting to know you. In a game where you're expected to lose a few characters and switch to playing others, a measure of emotional attachment would really add to the atmosphere. Game mechanics, however, provide a surrogate reason to get attached to characters - after all that time training their skills, the loss of a character can bring a chilling feeling of doom, especially if they were the only one in your band of survivors with an essential skill, and the moods of your fellow survivors crash drastically after any loss.While vanilla State of Decay's story mode is great fun, where it really comes into its own is with the Breakdown DLC. Breakdown sets the game to sandbox mode. You start with only your character (and Lily, your non-combatant radio operator) and build up a group and a base, accomplish certain objectives to unlock new characters or recruit other groups of survivors, play the level for as long as you wish, however you wish, then pick your six favourite characters, bundle them onto an RV with all your remaining gear and start the level again... only this time it's harder. And then you do it again, and again, and again. Your characters can become pretty experienced like this, but only if they survive. The ratio of difficulty to character skill is very well judged, so no matter how well you survived the last x levels and how godly your characters are, there is always a definite sense that you are in much more trouble this time... without it ever quite feeling impossible.The game has a few bugs, but they are mostly minor and don't crop up repeatedly, so they're not game breaking but you might lose a character or two to teleporting Freaks or your car suddenly flipping and exploding for no reason.If you're looking for a Zombie Apocalypse simulator, this is the one you've been waiting for while you plot your survival strategies in the pub with friends. Don't forget to buy Breakdown, because the story mode will have you aching for the sandbox during those moments when the plot is demanding your attention and you want to ransack just one... more.. cupboard.

												State of Decay is really fun and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys zombie games. There are a couple of issues that hold it back from being 5/5 for me. But I still really enjoyed it.First of all, the game doesn't look great. Partly because its slightly older, but also because its lower budget. With ultra settings the screen can be oddly hard to read sometimes, like there is too much texture that is too pixelated. Overall, the game passes when it comes to visualsBase building felt lacking to me. I had a lot of fun scouting the city, bringing in new survivors, and then sending them out to scavenge buildings. The problem I had is that each base has a set number of building slots. Even the trucking co yard can only allow 4 tents outside while there is tons of extra room. Its unfortunate because I was really interested in building up a large fully upgraded base but this is actually impossible.The cars are problematic too. The handling is atrociously bad. That being said, it really raises the question why DayZ (still in Alpha at this time) still doesn't have cars.But problems aside, the game is really FUN! This isn't Dayz, this isn't 7 days to die, this isn't TellTale's the Walking Dead. Yet, it feels close to the TV show the Walking Dead. You manage a large group of survivors, switching between nearly any of them at any time. They can level up, trade gear around, etc. Its a really fun way of managing a population of people during the Apocalypse. The combat is fun too, its simple but clearly takes skill. Shooting is challenging as you really need head shots which makes guns like the AK47 somewhat useless. The shotgun based off of a Remington wins here hands down.The story isn't half bad either, although not completely developed. Overall, I had a lot of fun with this game its usually a reasonable price. Its just single player but its really enjoyable.			"

												This game is brilliant. State of Decay is a game which is all about surviving a zombie apocalypse, but it has much more to it then you think. The game is a lot like the walking dead, meaning When you first start out you find a group within an hour of playing the story. Then to help out the group you can do tasks like fetching supplies, or even helping out neighbours for rewards. You can build utilities in your base, and even move bases later on in the game. If your neighbours trust you enough, they might even ask to join your group. You can also ask one of the main characters, Lilly Ritter to radio out to other survivors so they can join you, or ask if any other survivors know where food/weapons/ammo etc. can be found. Survivors will lose hope in the group's survival, because it's still a zombie apocalyse and they're dead people trying to eat you, so you can talk to them about it and get them to blow off their steam while killing zombies or boost their esteem. The weaponry in this game comes in different varieties, there's guns and melee weapons, but there's different types of them. for meleee weapons, there's blunt types, edged, and heavy weapons. For guns there's shotguns, snipers, handguns, and assault rifles (which are hard to find.)  Each survivor has their own pros and cons, for example one could be a good shot, but is an alcoholic, which would determine the survivor's stats. In the game, there are six slots for your character's stats. The four stats which every survivor will have is fighting, cardio, shooting, and wits. The other two can be for anything special about the character. For example, the first survivor you start out with, Marcus is a physical powerhouse, meaning you should have him using heavy weapons like sledgehammers, (my personal favourite combo) and he's also a born leader, making him one of the (best survivors in the game hint hint.) Each of those stats can be leveled up to a maximum of seven, but starting at four you can choose a perk that you can also level up seven times. Starting at level four of fighting/shooting, you can specialize in a type of gun or a type of melee weapon then level up that specialization up to seven as well. The fighting mechanics are pretty straightforward, if you use the rolling mechanic correctly you shouldn't actually have to use guns. There isn't that much of a story, but the game is mainly focused to surviving. The game can get kind of repetitive, but this game isn't actually in a completed state yet. This is one of my favourite games of all time, and I rate this 9/10.			"

												This game is amazing, just stunning. I completed the first part of the game up to (spoilers) where the military guy sacrifices himself to let the others get through the blockade. And I am glad to say that I will purchase the DLC when i have the chance. I recomend this game to all those who like the zombie genre or just good gameplay.			"

												State of Decay - original game:The good:- open world- characters and characters management- scavenging- cars- permadeath for charactersThe Bad:- optimalisation- tearing in high speed, due the texture loading- kinda boring in final part of a playthroughDLC BreakdownThe Good- challenging- tons of characters to play with- fear not to screw upThe Bad- same map- dull goals - Find RV, get the gas, GTFO, same map, similar starting position, higher difficulty- ever worse optimalisationDLC LifelineThe Good- new map- a lot guns (you play for an army)- straighforward story- optimalisationThe bad- cars, they weight like 2 kilos, jump way to far, really bad handling- map is not that big, as you might thinkTL:DR: Really good game, I bought it on x360 and was suprised how great the game is. Especialy part with characters, scavenging, building your community, exploring. I really enjoed it. Also I enjoyed DLC Lifeline, Breakdown not so much. But hey, it costs me 5€ and Lifeline cost me 2.49. For that Money I would recomended it anytime			"

												The game is good. The graphics are decent to play. The character control is alright. Clunky at times but you get used to it after a while. The devs said when it was going to be released on xbox it would have coop but they dropped it and that for me it's a let down and actually makes the game less fun. The gameplay is good, do not get me wrong. If you like driving around, killing zombies, building mini forts kinda (barricading windows) and getting supplies then this game is for you. At the moment at certain parts you'll notice a major lag and the resume. Reason being it is a console port. It has been ported to pc and the devs did say that. If the game had coop it would be so much more fun but if you like playing alone, by all means go and play. It is a good fun zombie killing game single player that you can play for a few hours befor getting bored.			"

												State of Decay, and it's accompanying DLCs make up the best zombie survival game I've ever played, bar none.  Does it have it's issues?  Of course it does, just like every other game in existance.  Little things you'd change if you were in charge.  However, with easily the friendliest, most helpful and involved player community I've ever encountered, you can get a mod to make just about any tweak you can imagine.  The game has all the elements you'd expect from the genre  - thrills and chills - action - scavenging -  a bit of base building - and plenty of those moments where you're left panting with a huge grin on your face asking yourself the question, ""Holy crap!  Did I really just survive that!?!""  Breakdown is basically a replay of the main game, without most of the story, but with increasingly difficult parameters.  You'd think doing the same thing over and over again would get boring.  It doesn't.  At least not for me.  I've got many hours logged on this game so far, and I've never even tried Lifeline yet, although I've owned it for months.  I'm still just so engaged with the Breakdown challange.  You can't beat the price on this game, and after playing it for a bit, I'm sure you'll feel, just as I did, that it's easily among the best bargains I've ever received through Steam.  You honestly can't go wrong with this game.			"

												This is a fun game, especially for Zombie fans.  It starts out with a pretty unique atmosphere and interesting challenges.  The characters though are mostly not memorable except for their names.As you progress through the main story, you kill a lot of zombies.  I'm talking in the thousands!  For a small country town setting it doesnt make much sense.  Personally It got boring to me after a while.  After a little break before the final missions, I came back to it because it was interesting enough still just to see what happens in the end.I would have much rather seen a lower yet more dangerous Zombie population instead of the infinite amount literally all over the map. In the end though its fun and worth the money especially if on sale.  I recommend this for zombie fans and if you like open world games.7/10			"

												I actually really like this game. The lighting is a bit odd at first, but the rest of the game is very nice.The graphics are good, and what you see in the video is basically what you get out of the game.You have to do a lot of scavenging, protecting of people and locations. Zombies are everywhere, and respawn a lot so there is always stuff to kill.Get to play your way. Become a rampaging zombie slaughterer or take it a little more queitly. Customize your survivors how you want, at least in terms of skills. Appearances, names, and basic starting stats tend to be random from what I see, and you may or may not get the same people from game to game. Its pretty nice. I definitely recommend at least trying it. Great for its price, at least.			"

												Never played DayZ but i guess this is comparable to offline DayZ with base-building and character leveling.Zombies happened so you set up camp, get dudes and stuff and avoid dying. It does an interesting thing in that it sorta separates available resources into items your current character uses - stashed in a locker which dont get touched by npcs at all and ""community resources"" (food, ammo, meds). As long as you play you use the locker items (weapons, ammo, stamina/health items etc), when you log off the game does a simulation spanning a certain amount of time and when you relog stuff will have gone to♥♥♥♥♥♥or not depending on how well stocked you are on those community resources and the general state of the community when you left the game. Kind of an Animal Crossing thing but less mafia badgers and more gore.The currency you use to take stuff out of your own (makes sense kinda) aswell as other survior groups lockers which is also used for stuff like base building - called ""influence"" - is barter based in that putting stuff into lockers will earn you points but the bulk of it comes thru doing side missions. Its also modified by a trust value (e.g how much have you done for someone you wanna trade with), taking stuff from home is the cheapest, taking stuff from neighbors you did some missions for will be so-so and then taking all the bullets off some doomed bozo enclave you just found is most expensive.To find items you scavenge, community resources are again abit different in that you can take them home for a fixed one time amount (might not be that easy since theyre quite heavy) or you can set up an outpost in the building theyre in which generates a smaller quantity daily - in most cases preferable since those also serve as forward bases with their own locker and a safe-ish zone and also have a defensive function in that they blow up the especially large roaming zombie mobs the game generates regulary with traps. The common way to find new dudes is to build trust with an enclave until they wanna join you, hopefully before they inevitably are wiped out the next time you log in.As for home bases, when you eventually get storypushed from the beginner base you select from fixed sites. Once set up depending on the location theres fixed facilities and a varying amount of free space you can choose to build whatever on. Stuff like a watchtower, extra beds, infirmary, garden etc. Not having or having certain ones will impact the simulation aswell as actual gameplay. To label the most important ones, with no beds everybody will be♥♥♥♥♥♥tired reducing max stamina, and next time you log in without an infirmary somebody coulda died from the coughs and ingame healing will take longer.Apart from these technicalities, you level your current dude you run around with (youre not bound to a main character) in a variety of stats ranging from stamina to weapon skills - some have extra plus good ones enabling them to wrestle zombies Frank West style at high levels, some might be relatively useless in the field but have skills like cooking or mechanic which make them invaluable at base.One thing to bear in mind is that in order to give you something to do outside of the story missions the game essentially makes everybody but the character you currently play stupid (or more stupid ohoho). Productivity rests entirely on you, everybody else produces babysitting tasks like ""HALP im sitting in a barn lead me home"" or ""I saw this totally nonthreathening thing i could kill myself easily/extremely dangerous and normally best avoided thing lets kill it"" among others. All sidequests are on a timer but generally all but one will end up lethal for the involved if ignored. You can prioritize based on morale/influence needs aswell as trust gain with the npc which is important if you wanna play as them. Character skills seem to factor in somewhat so its likely that youll have to get the same lowbies out of♥♥♥♥♥♥over and over again - tempting to boot the worst offenders sometimes. Opposed to that are the rare calls from the combat veterans which almost autocomplete on arrival because theyre already standing on a pile of corpses. Thanks for calling me to watch, braggart.In conclusion to this huge wall of text, in terms of a zombie apocalypse survival sim this is prolly the best you can get at the moment (that i know of). If youre on the fence or got a backlog of other games i would hold off until the next patch (december 2013) or so since there are avoidable but pretty annoying bugs, otherwise go for it, good stuff.

												Having finished this game, I felt it's time for a proper review, As usual skip to bottom for Pros, cons and small summarySo the story, story is really simple, but often too cheesey and doesn't go into a lot of detail. it disappears from the game at the start after moving and then appears in small, tiny bits and then does a disappearing act constantly till the very end in which only tells how the virus spread, what it originated from and the militaries cover up, not into detail too much which is something good for usual zombie games, but for it comes off as waaaaaaaay to generic and simple.The gameplay is once again simplistic but fits quite well actually, you have Melee weapons and ranged weapons, plays out like a slower version of Dead Rising but without the huge overuse of odd weapons and tools, it's not ridiculous but has the 3rd person view with slow zombies to either hit or shoot with guns, There's no crafting of weapons, so looting is needed and you will definitely need to often manage your invetory becuase you will fill up really quickly as the largest bag I believe is 10 or 12 slots and how much you can carry with weight is small but that just means you need to either drop everything or head back home.But that comes to the hardest part of the game, getting around, it's either so slow or just a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ there is no fast travel so have fun driving all the way to the other side of the map to do a fetch mission, tis a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥but adds to the realism of it, looting is something different as well since once you clear out a location, it's cleared out for good, don't think about going back for the stuff, infestations are hard because they are huge amounts, stealth is needed to avoid but don't need to, just be careful of your noise, because noise will attract zombies, make enough and they'll come in hordes.Setting is a pretty generic open world zombie game, not much different from the last really. Same as many George A Romero zombie movies, zombie outbreak happens in rural town, military contains it, military mistake. It's fairly disappointing as to what it could've been and the characters, well the characters just aren't good. They are all really bland and the voice acting is weakSound design is pretty decent although definitely not a good soundtrack at all, It's not terrible but it's not great.Graphics are rather decent but I think it could be better, but coming from a indie xbox title, it's good enough for this game.Pros + Realism make this game playable+ Gameplay is good enough to playthrough does its job+ George A Romero inspired for sure+ Special Infected and certain things make the game harder + The loudness design works well because if you alert zombies, or worse off hordes, you will have trouble+ Does feel like a survival+ Once characters die, they dead for goodCons- Very simplistic story - Simplistic setting- Characters are blank robots- The world is dull- Missions are repetitve- World is huge and gets incredibly repetitive to travel around- Gets repetitiveOverall it's a 7.4/10, it's decent enough to be fun, realism makes it interesting and the overall design mkaes it better, I'd suggest getting this at a low price if you want to waste some time and enjoy some Zombie R&R			"

												There are so many zombie games and so many open-world games coming out these days that it can be disorienting.  This is a rare gem among zombie games in terms of its openness, realism, and immerion.  That's not saying much, though.  Most zombie games are either empty bloodbaths or are stiflingly linear rpg or puzzle games.  In this game violence comes in short, ultra-intense bursts and can easily be deadly if you aren't playing the right character for that particular situation.  And though I really wanted a sandbox game, the linearity in this game doesn't seem quite as opressive as in other zombie games, and the level of player choice in problem-solving and resource control technique is impressive.7/10I am dissapointed by the lack of multiplayer.Then again, if the devs took these mechanics and put them into a procedural sandbox mmo, my life would end.Edit: If you don't play for a few days you lose resources.  Having these mechanics in a non-online game is ridiculous.  I don't appreciate feeling pressured to play every day.  Almost enough for me to take back my recommendation.  Buyer beware!			"

												So, originally i heard bad things about SoD. However, after playing for an entire 12 hours straight, i will say they were wrong and it is an awesome, and unfortunately very addicting game. The game does tend to pester you with a lot of missions you dont really care about at once, and there is no real upgrades for your home encampments ( I raided a warehouse and invited one group of survivors and i was able to move to the best Base available an Snyder Trucking) It is extremely fun and definitely an improvement over a lot of the zombie games ive been playing. If you want one thats more authentic survival experience, I would try Project Zomboid, although it is a completely different style of game.9/10			"

												A decent play, there are aspects of play that make this game fun that being said the main game and its story is garbage (and you end up paying $20 to play this segment) with the new expac being $7 and promising sandbox play I am left wanting. Why should I pay another $7 for functions of the game that were promised pre release, especially when you did such a ""wonderful"" job with the vanilla version? My advice for the producer (or any up and coming producer) please just charge up front  for the game in its totality, don't nickel and dime players for features that are essential for making the game more than a post-apocalyptic grocery run.I cant in good faith give this game a good rating despite the fact it has potential, because of the way they structured their vanilla around the release of the ""breakdown"" expac. The producer's willingness to put forth a measly 12 hours of ""fetch me this"" into the vanilla version with no sandbox world is really the epitome of modern gaming, for the love of all that is holy please stop selling me functionality separate from my bloody game!

												The best thing about this game is that its challenging (yes people its not an easy game)  .The second best thing about this game is that it has the biggest list of weapons (fire arms ) ive ever seen in a game so basicly you love a gun you will find it there .The third best thing is that driving , fighting , running around searching is done in a very nice way unlike some other games we know where driving becomes a problem . So This Game Is Great "

												I really enjoy(ed) this sandbox game. It's a super great, funny and enjoyable strategy/action game, total timeconsumer. Just don't expect there to be rhyme or reason, cause there is no real plot per se, but then again, who ever needed a plot in a zombie apocalypse survival game? A lot of people gave it a hard time because of technical stuff, I have personally not met anything but lame animation glitches which can be fixed with going out into the menu and back.			"

												State of Decay can be one of those games that is thrilling to play, and still give you a headache while playing it. Now having forty hours logged into this game just after a few days, I can safely say this game is totally worth it at a discounted price. It has a terrific blend of Sims and Day Z. However, after a long period of time it throws in the staleness of Infestation: Survival Stories.Make your way to a safe house, build up defenses, recruit survivors, and monitor meters. That's State of Decay in a nutshell. Once you've done that, you do it all over again after you pack up and move. Difficulty increases as you progress, but it isn't quite enough. The game excels in keeping players interested by looting, meeting new people, and having interesting missions. These do outweight the negatives, but when you run into one of the negatives, it packs one hell of a punch.For those starting off, they may feel overwhelmed by the amount of things that are thrown at them at once. Even after they get the hang of everything, they still may feel overwhelmed. I never really thought I'd complain about a game having TOO much stuff to do, so State of Decay takes the award for that. There would be times that I'd leave my safe house to knock out a mission and immediately gain three or four more after moving fifteen feet. Some missions will take precedence over others, and others are a nuisance simply because it's going to lower a meter on another survivor.AI can be a hassle at times as well. Your fellow survivors LOVE to pick the most infested area to be in. Smashing zombies is fun, but sometimes the odds are against you and your AI companion refuses to assist. They'll stand in the center of a horde, kick a few zombies, and then get knocked prone after a matter of seconds. The entire time you'll be too busy attacking what is in front of you, and end up getting sacked from the backside. Unfortunately, reflexes will not be too handy as the controls are a bit wonky at times. Players can dodge, but sometimes you get cheap-shotted and end up losing your already very valuable health. This leaves you your only option of evacuating the premises.  If you're lucky, you'll resort to using a car to run over the pursuing zombies. Hopefully you don't run into a special zombie.Playing State of Decay will require a lot more caution than other skull bashing game. It stays true to the nature of DayZ in terms of not wanting to die. Players get a bit attached to survivors simply because they invested time im building their skills up. The auto save feature, with no choice of manually saving is a double-edged sword. You're grateful that your progress is always saved, but at the same time you will completely go bonkers when you end up losing a survivor to a completely silly death. For example - while climbing a survey tower I paused to look at my map. In that moment, I accidently tapped my jump button - hurling my survivor through the air and to his death. There was no chance of getting him back, no pity for him, no chance at redemption from an embarassing death.After bashing in thousands of zombie heads, you'll come to realize that this game isn't really going anywhere, anymore. The sandbox novelty is slowly wearing off and the game is now a chore of constantly keeping supplies up and people happy. Once you've got things maxed, you'll move locations in hopes of another difficulty or play style. Then you do it all over again.All in all, State of Decay - for a discount price, has a lot more to offer than many $50 games *cough Ghosts cough*. The game provids enough entertainment for a 40-100 hour play through. You'll restart several times, try different locations, look for different survivors, and play in a different style.  That will definitely be enough for $10.00.			"

												Really interesting and well-done survival game. Just enough difficulty, a lot of things to consider while planning your survival. You really get into it fast and once you're in it, you can play for hours. Gameplay: Quite nice, you have to watch your stamina bar, pay attention to zombie hordes, and your fellow survivors. Just one thing: Your car will do flips. And you'll get stuck on little rocks. Driving sucks. The fact that each of your character can be diferent and have diferent skills or personnality is really interesting: you could have a cop who is trained in firearms and cardio, but you also can have an asmathic geek. And also, you can die. Like, definitly. Your move, player.  9/10Graphics: Well, it's far from being the most beautiful game I've ever played, but it's not bad at all. Weather effects are cool, landscapes are cool, and they match the ambiance of the game. 8/10Ambiance: Let's be honest: this is the best. You're truly into the game, because the ambiant suspense and stressing is well-made. You're constantly afraid of hordes or big zombies. Death is permanent, so you don't want to rush your way through hordes of Zeds. Relationship with other survivors is also really important and bring even more immersion. Everything is working together. 10/10Sound effects: MEEEH. Weapons sounds kinda bad, and running too, and driving too, and... This is really far from perfect. It's not horrible, but the sound my rifle made the first I fired it... *sigh* 5/10""Lastability"": Nearly infinite. It depends on you. If you play well, you can survive for really long time, and play again to start over with other choices, other survivors, etc... 9.5/10Enjoyment: Dit I enjoyed playing State of Decay? Well my answer will be short: HELL YES. This game is really enjoyable and you can have loads and loads of fun playing it. Believe me. Even if you'll be stressed, anxious, angry sometimes when you'll die, you'll enjoy it. Because this game is really COOL. 9.5/10FINAL NOTE: This game is really awesome. Even if a lot of bugs are really annoying, and driving is really bad, you'll enjoy playing State of Decay, you'll enjoy the frustration of loosing your character forever because you falled from a cliff. The ambiance is so damn perfect that you'll get on the ""survival mood"". You can't do otherwise. Just get along with it. TOTAL: 85/100: REALLY GOOD [/b] "

												""Do you recommend this game?""Oh  sweet zombie Lordy, of course I do!Your're in a zombie apocolypse.The graphics are savage, you can enter almost every building in the game, you can use any car you see and you build skills and make a small community during a zombie apocolapyse.State of Decay is about survival.If you die in the game, you ARE dead, there's no coming back! Not even quitting the game before saving when you die will bring back a dead 'un, you just end up playing as another character in your community.Each character has unique emotions and can display fear and depression and anger.There are aload of missions to do and places to explore.Like every zombie game there's the normal dopey, ""eat yo brainnnns"" and then other ""Freak"" zombies.One Freak zombie is like the jockey from L4D2 and one is a giant fat f**ker.The map is so vast and the characters all so different. You begin to care for your character and will enjoy the satyisfying sound effects of brains being smashed in.Fair price for such a great game,.  "

												I bought this game for 5 dollars during a steam sale, and bought all the dlc almost immediately after. This game is amazing at what it does; it's a zombie survival game, where scavenging and leveling up your character are the most important things you can do.I'll say this much, however; the game is poorly optimized (though not watch_dogs level, it still screams of poor coding) and it's hard to maintain a constant 60. The graphics options are lazy, and there's little more than draw distance that changes with the settings. The game is really awkward and clunky sometimes as well, especially in fine mouse control when shooting. You may actually want to plug in your controller for this one.All in all, I say buy it, and play it, especially if it goes on sale again. It's not worth 20 dollars when there are so many other games out there that offer similar ideas, but it's worth 15 with all the DLC included.I give this a solid 7/10, and wish they would bring a sequel.

												This is a very good game with zombies added to it.  You could replace the zombies with wild animals and the game would play the same. You could slap it around and turn it into Rise of the Planet of the Apes: The Game and it would still be fun. Every system working in this game works well, and comes together in a fine stew. Character growth? Natural and instinctive, no arbitrary levels and XPEnvironment? No painted on walls and doors. You see structure, you enter structure, you hope you can loot structure.Combat? Melee feels right, aiming feels right, I've never had a bad fight that made me feel the game was to blame.Structure? I've lost three characters on my most recent game and it hurt, badly.  They were different, they had unique skills, voices, clothes, it didn't feel like loosing a grunt in XCOM, it felt like loosing a real character. You know how on game of thrones, you know people are going to die but it still hurts, even though its just a story? Yeah, that's how I feel.  Except its usually my fault in tihs game.			"

Posted: June 30, 2014
												SUMMARY: Its really fun and something no zombie and RPG fan should be without. I'm glad someone finally did a decent open-world zombie apocalypse RPG. (Red Dead Redemption's DLC doesnt count, although it was fun) However, the game seems a bit rough around the edges and unpolished. Ive encountered many minor-but-annoying graphical glitches such as clipping, pop-ins, twitching enemies, and weapons disappearing when wielded. I'm hoping that will be cleaned up in a patch or something. Overall, its a great game and I can see myself playing this one for hours.MAIN:Ok so where to start. This game is everything a single player zombie apocalypse RPG should be, although it is definitely not perfect. Ive been looking at it for a long time, but it was early access, and I generally don't buy e. a. games. I saw the e. a. tag was gone and it was extremely reduced for the summer sale, so I figured why the hell not.You start the game as a guy named Marcus on a fishing trip in the remote wilderness with his buddy, but later you get the option to play as others in your group of survivors. There are two aspects to this game, one is the open world run around doing random missions, story missions, collecting supplies and fighting zombies, the other (and what makes this game more than just an open world zombie-smash-fest) is managing your base's supplies and rooms and survivor's morale and trust. The base needs supplies such as food, ammo and medicine, which you can only get from raiding places. You can also build different areas inside your base, and upgrade them. Also, you can turn various outside areas into outposts which help you with the supplies, create safe zones, and set traps. Your survivors can go off on their own too, so you may have to rescue them. Random events happen, that can make survivors angry, or happy. The more stuff you bring back, the more you can ask for favors such as friends following you, radioing for certain supply caches, taking stuff out of the supply crate and so on (the mechanic in the game is your ""reputation points"").Personally, I think it sucks that even if you were the one who braved the zombie hordes to bring back gear, once you put it in the base's supply chest, it costs MORE rep points to pull it out then you earned putting it in. I understand why the devs did it from a gameplay standpoint, but it only makes me want to put items I am probably not going to need in there.Theres a LOT of stuff to do, just running around causes you to get random radio requests from your base. Things like clearing an infested house, helping a survivor (both strangers and ones in your group), hunting a dangerous type of zombie, raiding a certain building and many more. Helping people builds up trust, morale, and rep points, while ignoring requests for a certain amount of real-world time can fail the mission with negative consequences.Thats another interesting fact. The game is run off of a real world timer. So say a character gets ""hurt"" (worse than just injured, their health permanently goes down until they rest and heal) or tired (max stamina goes down), you have to take them back to base and let them rest. Also, the in-game clock and date is the first day you start. So say you started playing on June 9th. Your diary would start that day as well.The combat is simple to master and very fluid. It feels great to smash zombie heads with a lead pipe or other blunt object. There are various attacks you can do, as well as dodges(absolutely a must to master), finishing moves, and stealth kills. There is also many different types of firearms, with firing being relatively realistic. Not as much as a reality-based FPS army game, but more so then a typical 3rd person shooting game like GTA. The game also tries to be realistic with the sound of a shot drawing a crowd, so except for certain situations, sneaking up and bashing away seems a much better idea. The standard zombies are the running/jumping type for the most part, but generally go down easy as long as you arent swarmed. Not so for some of the rarer types, such as one bloated with poison gas and one that seems to act more like a werewolf.Sound is a major part of the game. As your character walks, a little blue circle surrounds him/her getting bigger or smaller the more or less noise you make. The zombies are attracted to sound, so things like banging around while searching, driving a car (always fun to plow through a horde) and shooting draw them. The zombies also make noise, and it is very important to make sure you dont walk up on one lurching around where you cant see it by listening for the sounds it makes.So, whats the bad points? Well. The graphics are glitchy as all hell for starters. Expect plently of pop-ins, clipping, disappearing weapons (even though your character still is rendered as if s/he is swinging away with it), enemies suddenly being on top of your car when you go to smash them and so on. The weirdest one I saw so far is a zombie laying down (some lay, then stand up and go after you when you alert them). I walked up and was about 5 feet away, and instead of getting to his feet, the zombie model laying on the ground did a jittery complete horizontal 360, and then suddenly disappeared, then popped-in standing and right in my character's face, where he bit me. Fun.Another is it doesnt seem to be optimized very well. It jacks my core temp up by 20c or so no matter what graphics setting its on. And its not pushing my gpu/cpu very hard at all. Its not a big deal, though, just smacks of a rushed finish.But even though its a bit glitchy and has rough edges, its still fun as hell. Anyone whose an RPG and zombie apocalypse fan should check this out.			"

												A solid Zombie Survival Title and worth its price. The game's Serious take on Zombie and Survival Put it in a place where many AAA titles fail to Push for, for reasons because you can actually Fail and or Lose, other games that praise survival do not do this and use mechanics such as unkillable Npc's, infinite ammo, Restart Points, Linear Plot devices Etc..  Though not a challenge at first the game will ramp up its difficulty slowly, but with some planning you can Survive without losing any of your characters, but neglect can lead to disease, sickness and having to execute and or leave people behind. The Game also Has Persistant Mechanics where Even if you dont play your Group of survivors still work, Buildings are constructed, Events happen, and Resources are consumed, a 24hr Game cycle.  Game mechanics come down to Characters learning certain Traits depending on how you play them, Sneaking Mechanics, Real time base building, Improving on peoples Respect and trust levels across not only your own party members but other Communities (conclaves, army, allies) as well. The Game's movement and crontols Handel very well, and nothing Happens where you call ""that a lod of BULL!"", If you mess up it is because you messed up and did not jump out of the way or bring the right materials Etc..(you know why you died). Along with a simple but yet convincing Story the game feels Fluid and allows you at the end to continue playing even after you have finished (without DLC)And now the Least important part, The graphical properties...The game is designed well but you can tell there was 1 model for all the females and 1 model for all the males, not very many models for Humans but the Zombies looked really nice, and the Game looks Great! if compared to its Xbox Counterpart.This Game is Extremly Replayable and immersive so give it a shot!CONS: from what makes this game Seem Perfect is the Feeling that BREAKDOWN DLC needing to be Part of the main Game and not DLC, it feels like it was supposed to be shipped with it and not seperate. The Main story line is short but not bad. Replayable other wise.			"

												The way the tutorials during the game's opening hours lull you into a false sense of security while glossing over crucial gameplay mechanics is kind of a wonderful parralel to suddenly having to survive in a collapsed society and/or a Stanley Parable type commentary on gamers doing whatever you tell them to even when it makes no sense (I took my survivor out completely unarmed because a box popped up saying 'GO HERE!', with results that would be predictable in any situation other than the tutorial-heavy opening hour of a commercial videogame in the year 2014).Game's pretty good too! Way more management and procedural sandbox craziness in there than you'd initially expect. There are some rough edges like WHY WON'T MY CHARACTER JUST LIE DOWN AND SLEEP IN THIS BED INSTEAD OF STANDING THERE COMPLAINING HE'S TIRED (I have no idea, but exiting the game and then reopening it works) but with this much freedom and stuff to do it's definitely worth putting up with.

												State of Decay is thrilling. You're dropped into a zombie infestation and forced to manage your resources and survivors. There are various missions that pop up alongside to main story and if you ignore them your survivors can get injured or die. The zombies are easy enough to deal with, but if you're out on your own and you make too much noise you can find yourself being swarmed by all sides. A few lucky grapples by the zombies can leave you in an undead dogpile, slowly being torn to shreds. Once a character is dead it is gone forever.There have been times where I find myself surrounded and being beat down, and after barely knocking them off I stumble towards a car out o breath, zombies running after me and trying to grab me. One bite away from death I get into the car and drive off with several zombies hanging on banging at the doors. I can't remember the last time a game has made my heart race so much. There is so much character development and macro management in this game that you really feel like you're ""surviving"" rather than adventuring.Now for the flaws. The game is riddled with bugs. It's annoying to be heading into a dangerous area only to have your partner teleport back to base for an ""Angry resident"" mission. The zombies often clip through walls and into the floor. Sounds don't always play and cars can get damaged on invisible bumps. But none of the bugs are really gamebreaking and they're easy to shrug off. The resource management part of the game is too simple. There's supposed to be some sort of resource usage where some of your food/ammo/medicine are used up each day, but it seems like I'm always at max resources and the only thing I ever NEED to gather is building supplies for more upgrades at base. Because of this there's always more than enough time to do every side mission and there's no sense of urgency in the game.A few minor tweaks could make the game so much more difficult and so much more exciting. Side missions should force you to choose between saving a survivor or gathering necessary resources (think XCOM). Outposts should require a person there to be useful (instead of giving resources and killing zombies as an autonomous house), making you trade labor for safety. Resources should decay faster so you actually have to spend time scavenging inbetween or during missions. There are a limited amount of resources on the map but I haven't even come close to depleting them all. Before I moved my base to a new town I still had unsearched houses a two minute walk away.Overall the mechanics of the game are solid. THe game is enjoyable and exciting. With a few tweaks to make it harder could make it a game of the year. If you're thinking about buying it, buy it. If you'e not, buy it anyway.			"

The game excels in keeping players interested by looting, meeting new people, and having interesting missions. These do outweight the negatives, but when you run into one of the negatives, it packs one hell of a punch.For those starting off, they may feel overwhelmed by the amount of things that are thrown at them at once. Even after they get the hang of everything, they still may feel overwhelmed. I never really thought I'd complain about a game having TOO much stuff to do, so State of Decay takes the award for that. There would be times that I'd leave my safe house to knock out a mission and immediately gain three or four more after moving fifteen feet. Some missions will take precedence over others, and others are a nuisance simply because it's going to lower a meter on another survivor.AI can be a hassle at times as well. Your fellow survivors LOVE to pick the most infested area to be in. Smashing zombies is fun, but sometimes the odds are against you and your AI companion refuses to assist. They'll stand in the center of a horde, kick a few zombies, and then get knocked prone after a matter of seconds. The entire time you'll be too busy attacking what is in front of you, and end up getting sacked from the backside. Unfortunately, reflexes will not be too handy as the controls are a bit wonky at times. Players can dodge, but sometimes you get cheap-shotted and end up losing your already very valuable health. This leaves you your only option of evacuating the premises.  If you're lucky, you'll resort to using a car to run over the pursuing zombies. Hopefully you don't run into a special zombie.Playing State of Decay will require a lot more caution than other skull bashing game. It stays true to the nature of DayZ in terms of not wanting to die. Players get a bit attached to survivors simply because they invested time im building their skills up. The auto save feature, with no choice of manually saving is a double-edged sword. You're grateful that your progress is always saved, but at the same time you will completely go bonkers when you end up losing a survivor to a completely silly death. For example - while climbing a survey tower I paused to look at my map. In that moment, I accidently tapped my jump button - hurling my survivor through the air and to his death. There was no chance of getting him back, no pity for him, no chance at redemption from an embarassing death.After bashing in thousands of zombie heads, you'll come to realize that this game isn't really going anywhere, anymore. The sandbox novelty is slowly wearing off and the game is now a chore of constantly keeping supplies up and people happy. Once you've got things maxed, you'll move locations in hopes of another difficulty or play style. Then you do it all over again.All in all, State of Decay - for a discount price, has a lot more to offer than many $50 games *cough Ghosts cough*. The game provids enough entertainment for a 40-100 hour play through. You'll restart several times, try different locations, look for different survivors, and play in a different style.  That will definitely be enough for $10.00.			"

												Really interesting and well-done survival game. Just enough difficulty, a lot of things to consider while planning your survival. You really get into it fast and once you're in it, you can play for hours. Gameplay: Quite nice, you have to watch your stamina bar, pay attention to zombie hordes, and your fellow survivors. Just one thing: Your car will do flips. And you'll get stuck on little rocks. Driving sucks. The fact that each of your character can be diferent and have diferent skills or personnality is really interesting: you could have a cop who is trained in firearms and cardio, but you also can have an asmathic geek. And also, you can die. Like, definitly. Your move, player.  9/10Graphics: Well, it's far from being the most beautiful game I've ever played, but it's not bad at all. Weather effects are cool, landscapes are cool, and they match the ambiance of the game. 8/10Ambiance: Let's be honest: this is the best. You're truly into the game, because the ambiant suspense and stressing is well-made. You're constantly afraid of hordes or big zombies. Death is permanent, so you don't want to rush your way through hordes of Zeds. Relationship with other survivors is also really important and bring even more immersion. Everything is working together. 10/10Sound effects: MEEEH. Weapons sounds kinda bad, and running too, and driving too, and... This is really far from perfect. It's not horrible, but the sound my rifle made the first I fired it... *sigh* 5/10""Lastability"": Nearly infinite. It depends on you. If you play well, you can survive for really long time, and play again to start over with other choices, other survivors, etc... 9.5/10Enjoyment: Dit I enjoyed playing State of Decay? Well my answer will be short: HELL YES. This game is really enjoyable and you can have loads and loads of fun playing it. Believe me. Even if you'll be stressed, anxious, angry sometimes when you'll die, you'll enjoy it. Because this game is really COOL. 9.5/10FINAL NOTE: This game is really awesome. Even if a lot of bugs are really annoying, and driving is really bad, you'll enjoy playing State of Decay, you'll enjoy the frustration of loosing your character forever because you falled from a cliff. The ambiance is so damn perfect that you'll get on the ""survival mood"". You can't do otherwise. Just get along with it. TOTAL: 85/100: REALLY GOOD [/b] "

												""Do you recommend this game?""Oh  sweet zombie Lordy, of course I do!Your're in a zombie apocolypse.The graphics are savage, you can enter almost every building in the game, you can use any car you see and you build skills and make a small community during a zombie apocolapyse.State of Decay is about survival.If you die in the game, you ARE dead, there's no coming back! Not even quitting the game before saving when you die will bring back a dead 'un, you just end up playing as another character in your community.Each character has unique emotions and can display fear and depression and anger.There are aload of missions to do and places to explore.Like every zombie game there's the normal dopey, ""eat yo brainnnns"" and then other ""Freak"" zombies.One Freak zombie is like the jockey from L4D2 and one is a giant fat f**ker.The map is so vast and the characters all so different. You begin to care for your character and will enjoy the satyisfying sound effects of brains being smashed in.Fair price for such a great game,.  "

												This is one of the better zombie sandbox games I have played. This game has been remastered and if i had not already bought this one then I would have bought the year-one edition. The achievements in this game are fairly easy to get and only one of the DLC (Break down) doesn't seem worth it because it doesn't add very much to the game			"

												This game mixes part zombie horror/survival with some city building and people management.  The game starts with you taking control of a couple guys coming back from a remote fishing trip to find out that the area they are in is now in the middle of a zombie outbreak.  You meet up with other survivors and try to get enough supplies and weapons to survive long enough to..... well I'm not sure to what end cause I'm pretty sure I screwed up somehow and wasn't sure what happened but I got to the end game screen.I recommend this game because it was fun to play.  I've played it on both Console and PC and both times the game was enjoyable.  That being said there was some design decisions that made sense for the game I guess, but just didn't sit well with me.  Slight SPOILERS ahead I guess.The game is constantly forcing you to do things, there is never seems to be a break.  There is always someone in trouble getting supplies, or someone missing or someone who wants to take out a zombie infestation.  While you are doing those misssions there are also story missions that are happening and this game doesn't care what else you are doing, if you don't show up for that story mission someone is gonna die and that part of the storyline is gone.  The problem with all these side/main quests happening ALL the time is it doesn't just let you explore the game.  The map is a pretty decent size with some neat areas to find and explore.  The problem is that you don't want to be on the northwest corner of the map when a story mission suddenly pops up on the southeast corner.  Maybe I just failed at seeing the options to tell the people in my little fortification to just sit there and don't leave but it was annoying to have these quests pop up all the time.  Made the game probably a little more of a realistic zombie game but from a guy who likes exploring, the way these  side quests worked just didn't work for me.I did really enjoy the way the inventory worked in this game, it was really well done.  You can get different sizes of backpack, though you'll pretty well get the biggest size pretty quickly and that is usually enough to get the job done.  You also get the trunk of the vehilce that you're driving (if you use a vehicle to get around).  In addition you can carry one bag of supplies (again the trunk of the vehicle can store multiple bags).  Anything that you find can be stored into the community inventory which gives you influence points (instead of using money), so you can trade things you find for other things in the community inventory(either things that were there originally or things that other survivors have made).  Finishing various side quests or main quests will also give you points to get additional items out of the inventory.  If you get the big bag and use the vehicles trunks/box efficiently you'll have enough points for pretty well anything you'll ever need.The Zombies were pretty standard zombies, they moved at about the same pace as your characters but could be out run with sprinting, however you can only sprint for a limited amount of time.  There are also several different types of zombies in addition to the average ones ranging from super large/strong to super fast/aggresive and more.  But none of them felt over powering or cheesy in some way.  The fit the game really well.  As well they reacted decently to your actions for the most part.  Driving, sprinting or shooting would all draw in zombies from surrounding areas, pretty standard zombie logic.You can play as a variety of characters from your base and level each one of them up.  Each character is not exactly unique, they have some individual traits but are pretty interchangable.  The amount of playable characters is decent as each of your characters may become tired/hungry/sick if they've done a lot of exploring or fighting and adds a bit of realisim to the game.  You can either choose to use items to recharge them or switch out characters to let them rest.  Only problem again with this is relating back to the questing point.  One of the characters you use might decide to go off questing while you are playing as another character and then they won't recharge as well.The one thing I found lacking is that the story is pretty forgetable.  There are some choices in there that will affect your game and the story but for the most part it's pretty standard zombie game.  Survive for a while and then get the heck out of there.Controls are decent enough, Camera can be a little stupid at times but for the most part never really bothered me.			"

												I fricken' love this game!  This is what I originally envisioned DayZ(sa) would be like - building outposts, home sites, supporting your community of survivors, meeting other groups of survivors, seemingly never-ending open world.I understand that this is a single-player game, and so the ""supporting your community"" and ""meeting other groups"" is just a bunch of NPCs, but still.Undead Labs has designed something amazing here!  And it's only going to get better!I was so dissappointed to discover that DayZ(sa) wasn't much more than a serial-killer-simulator.  I've been murdered so many times, for absolutely nothing (we're talking no gear - a flashlight and a battery is worth sniping over?) that it's amazing anyone gets anything done.  People don't team up?  Or I've just tried the wrong 100+ servers so far, I guess.Anyways, I am so addicted to this game.SoD is just a ton-load of fun to play.  Wanna follow the story/missions?  Feel free...  Wanna just roam endlessly and hoard supplies?  That's game too...  Swipe an abandoned car and plow through some zombie hordes, just make sure you don't open your mouth as you turn those zeds into bloody soup!  LOL.I've barely made it a fraction of the way through the story so far, but I'm taking my time.  Taking advantage of the open-world environment to just build up my home site, and increase my reputation with the group.I don't even plan on playing the Breakdown DLC until I play through the story at least twice, and there's another DLC in the makings.  Can't wait to see what we get in the next update!  The forums are talking about some awesome enhancements to the game.Undead Labs is certainly on the right track with this gem of a title...  If they eventually break into the co-op/mmo bracket, they're sure to do amazing things! "

It's not just ""sims with zombies""; it's Walking Dead translated to open, very well-designed, emergent gameplay, that poses you strategic challenges on par with survival and emotional thrills with high dose of sense of urgency.

												Buy this game if you like killing zombies, dynamic open world environments, don't mind sub-par graphics, and enjoy resource management.The game starts off shoddy and pretty awkward. I quit the game after 25 minutes, but after a few days I picked it out of my steam library to give it another shot. I don't regret that in the slightest.There is no main character really. You're going to be swapping through characters very often. There is a story and a plot but it's somehwat minor. It doesn't tell the details from just one characters perspective, and many dynamic set of characters cause the game to focus on the plot of other people around you, such as the various factions you can help or hinder, rather than the set of characters that you can have on your team.You might dislike the same voice acting from several characters, but their lines were voiced very well and it didn't bother me. The cast seems to have a unique design for the set of characters save for the voice acting.If Microsoft invested a bit more money to give it more polish, it could have recieved universal acclaim.

												Game gives me mixed feelings. It's a good concept with poor execution.Things happen way, way, way too fast in the game for having it simulate itself when you're not playing. The survivors you rescue are basically like children and randomly wander off and get lost and die. Okay, I can buy getting sick. But these idiots deliberately seek out dangerous zombies on the auspices of making things ""safer"" It's no wonder people quit and come back and half their home place's population is gone. It's far less about foraging than about babysitting because of this and it's a real shame because it makes it feel more like grinding than survival.It's not particularly a bad game but it's not something I would recommend to my friends or anyone with a full-time job for that matter. It just needs to be fleshed out a lot more.			"

												So, so disappointed. I was very excited about this game; I don't have a lot of money for games and usually only buy them on offer, sub-£5, but I couldn't wait for this game and all the hype I read sounded great.So I bought it full price and played it through. Whilst I can't deny having some enjoyable times - I was a fan of the way the game seemed to persist when you weren't playing, making a base was enjoyable and some of the missions were fun - I was overall very disappointed and felt kind of cheated by the critic reviews and the game developers. The game was just too easy; it felt as though there were no real challenges and that the game was designed so that everyone could finish it without too much trouble. I don't feel as though I am some elitist gamer; I'm happy that the game can be accessed and enjoyed by players of all skill levels but there really is no reason in the world why a game developer should choose not to include a difficulty setting in the game menu.. unless of course they were selling an expansion pack shortly after release which would advertise 'increased difficulty' as one of its selling points. I haven't bought the expansion pack out of principle and I stopped playing the game shortly after completion, which really does not take very long at all. I delayed finishing the game until I had completed all the side missions but the main story finishes very quickly - another selling point for the expansion. This feels like a rant, but one of the aspects of reviews which made me most interested was the idea of character permadeath. This turned out to be a huge exaggeration and I didn't lose a single character that wasn't scripted (one). To be fair, I was being careful at first, but before long I was wading into hordes with a golf club and coming out unfazed. There really seemed little need for stealth, which took away much of the gravity and tension of the game.Aside from that rant, another criticism of the game was the zombies themselves - it felt as though effort had been made to aim the game at a younger audience with cartoony zombies with glowing green eyes. In all, maybe buy it on offer but don't pay more than a fiver for it. Don't expect much and you might have a bit of fun.Tl;dr: can be fun but purposely designed way too short and way too easy, with no option to adjust difficulty. Also cartoon zombies. "

												Read the recent reviews, this developer has a trend in abandoning games that are Early Access. They also bait their customers in with promises that they will release bigger better products (See online State of Decay) but they never come to realization. They have stopped selling this title and are trying to get you to purchase the ""remastered"" edition. Undead Labs recently put out an early access title that was a pokemon clone of sorts, it had a lot of backing and the CEO basically said it wouldn be profitable enough and they bailed on it. Star far away from Undead Labs. Shame too, this game could have been better.			"

												If you're into zombies, this is a great game for you. The combat is pretty solid, exploration and building your base is very interesting. The sidequests are different enough to keep you interested for a while.It lacks solid story and dialogue but that is forgivable. What is really bad is the lack of character customization. I mean, the whole point of this zombiekalypse fetish is seeing yourself there, being tough and heroic, and the game totally blows that.The day and night cycle, gaining trust with other survivors and finally banding together feel very imersive. But the inmovable and indestructable garden fences and car wrecks do their best to remind you that you're playing a game.If you can look past the bad animation, zombies going through doors and so on, you have a solid 30 hours of fun ahead of you. I feel that Breakdown does not add much because the map is very small and (sensible) homebase choice is pretty limited.			"

												If you're into zombies, this is a great game for you. The combat is pretty solid, exploration and building your base is very interesting. The sidequests are different enough to keep you interested for a while.It lacks solid story and dialogue but that is forgivable. What is really bad is the lack of character customization. I mean, the whole point of this zombiekalypse fetish is seeing yourself there, being tough and heroic, and the game totally blows that.The day and night cycle, gaining trust with other survivors and finally banding together feel very imersive. But the inmovable and indestructable garden fences and car wrecks do their best to remind you that you're playing a game.If you can look past the bad animation, zombies going through doors and so on, you have a solid 30 hours of fun ahead of you. I feel that Breakdown does not add much because the map is very small and (sensible) homebase choice is pretty limited.			"

												I have waited for this game since I first found out about it in 2012. I bought it with it's release June 2013 for XBLA, and instantly  bought it when it came out for PC. This game has everything. Guns, zombies, gore, guns, zombies, and survival. This game really hits the bullseye when it comes to survival instinct, since it's solely based on gathering materials in order for the group to survive. The graphics in this game are a definite step up from the XBLA version, with resolutions up to 1080p ultra, this game sure packs a punch. Get it.			"

												Another Zombie game? Yes, one of the BEST zombie games that has ever been crafted.State of Decay kind of reminds me of what Fort Zombie was aiming to be... but didn't quite get there.This game will have you playing for so many hours, you'll be wondering where the daylight went every single time you wake up and go on your computer to play this.This game has base management, character development, skills, levelling up, driving, shooting, melee fighting, zombies, special zombies, walking zombies, running zombies, fat zombies, exploding zombies, different bases to live in, item management, resource management and MORE.When you first start the game up you'll find yourself wondering what is going on, but after a very brief tutorial you'll understand what happened to the land and you can now play however you wish to play.You'll start in your first (or only if you want) base where you'll need to scavenge supplies such as food, medicine, materials, fuel and ammo from nearby locations such as houses, businesses, farms, factories, ruins etc. The game has permanent death, so if your character dies, he's gone forever, no reloading of saves will bring him back. But you can play as other NPC's in your base, so all is not lost, you can continue playing, just you'll have lost a character you may have put a lot of time into training.All bases consume resources, you'll find that in the menu how much it uses a day and it's up to you to make sure you have enough. If you don't have enough resources or the right facilities in your base then people will start to get sick, die or leave.You can upgrade bases by adding facilities to them such as a shooting platform to keep the place safe, more beds to invite more people to join you and all sorts of other facilties. Certain facilities offer a variety of services, such as storage for more resources to be stored there, Munitions shops to build better and more fun weapons, Farms to grow food and machine shops to repair your cars.Because cars can be damaged and they do explode when they catch fire. You need to correct facilities to repair them and cars don't grow on trees, if you blow them all up, you'll have no cars to use and will have to go on foot everywhere.There's a stealth system in the game too, you can sneak around and kill zombies without being detected, it's a very handy skill to master. Noise is VERY important in this game, be too loud and you'll attract every zombie in the area, fire a gun without a surpressor and you'll also attract them all to you.Sometimes hordes appear and if you attract the attention of just one zombie in the horde, all of them will come after you, so always approach them with caution or avoid them completely.The combat system in this game is very fleshed out, a variety of weapons can also be mastered such as blunt (bats, hammers etc), edged (knives, swords etc) and heavy (microphone stands! sledgehammers etc) and even guns such as rifles, pistols, revolvers, smg's and more. You can do so much in this game.There's also an awesome DLC called Breakdown which expands greatly on the original game and instead of the game just ending when you get across the final bridge to escape like it does in the main game, you can play sandbox mode, where the resources are randomly generated and you can play as long as you like, however you like, no main quest missions or anything like that.I really recommend this game because this is how a zombie survival game SHOULD BE!Zombie game developers take note from this game, you could learn a thing or two about making a fantastic zombie game that people want.The only downsides to this game is that it's single player only, it's designed in a way that makes it look like it should be co-op or multiplayer, but it never came and will never be added. So get the sequel when it comes out if you want to play online. Another downside would be that the options aren't very fleshed out, mostly because this is a port from an xbox 360 game, so your favourite video resolution may not be supported or if the game runs bad on medium but plays fine but looks bad on low graphics then you'll have to look online for workarounds to that.Anyway, I recommend the game, I give it 9/10 because it really is a fantastic zombie survival game, even if it can make you angry when your favourite character is ""unfairly"" killed by a zombie (mostly because you weren't prepared for that one horde or big fat zombie).Get it, get it now and have fun! You'll enjoy it!			"

												State of Decay is, without doubt, the ultimate zombie experience. You start the game with a pair of survivors and you get more as you advance through the game. You can switch between them with ease and at will, there's no main character here. There's also permadeath, so whenever a survivor falls to the zombie hordes you keep playing... as one of the other survivors, therefore losing the game whenever your whole group gets eradicated.Then, there's the resource factor: you need to gather food, ammo, construction materials, medicine and fuel in order to keep your base up and running - yes, you have a base, and you can settle in other places if you feel like those might turn out better - , so you spend a lot of time doing scavenging and looting all over Trumbull County: houses, drugstores, grocery stores, mini marts, offices, warehouses, factories and so on and so forth, are all ripe for the looting. Aside from the aforementioned resources you obviously get also some handy items, such as weapons, medicine for yourself, food to recover stamina and some other miscellaneous items, such as cooking clocks and fireworks, to attract zombies to some location. I would like to add that all of these, both resources and items, are FINITE. So you would do well in progressing through the storyline every now and then.True to the game's spirit, vehicles are, while not in short supply, not infinite. That alone is an extra incentive to get your smoldering vehicle to your base, so as to give it some needed repairs.Finally, the only downside to the game is that the game world keeps going on even when you are not playing. So it may be that if you don't check on your survivors every now and then you may find upon returning that some have left the base due to lack of resources, while others might be in a hurry, being ovverrun by zombies... and others downright dead. Therefore, my advice is for you to check on the game on a daily basis until you accomplish whatever goal you have in mind, be it the storyline or some other.On the technical side, graphics are alright, but the framerate is not what you'd expect. Getting the game on Ultra settings takes its toll on my rig when I'm in the city, and I have a GeForce 660 GTX, which runs Battlefield 4 as smooth as silk on high. Voice acting and sound is downright lacklustre. The AI is OK, both for other survivors and zombies. They may bump into minor obstacles every now and then and may show some inconsistencies when in a fight, but nothing big here.All in all, this is a 8.5 for me, it's deeply immersive and a must buy for any zombie and sandbox games lovers out there. The only cons I can think of is the 'still running when you are not playing-world' and the framerate.REVIEW UPDATE:Having played both Breakdown and Lifeline, and especially that god-sent update that lets you store stuff in the boot of your car, I must say this game has improved, and by that I mean a LOT: while Breakdown does not offer much in terms of replayability, being essentially the same wave after wave, Lifeline does truly revamp the experience.  It is an absolutely different take on the State of Decay formula, where scavenging and lone survival make way for relentless zombie action on a scale you've never seen or fathomed, as you fend off wave after wave of Ferals and Juggernauts using a vast array of military-grade equipment, such as state of the art weaponry, drone strikes, air strikes and whatnot. Also, while I cannot confirm this, I do believe that Lifeline does not keep going while you're not playing, as vanilla did, which is an excellent change. Only qualms I may have with Lifeline is not being to explore the more urban part of the city depicted.With the addition of the fabulous Lifeline DLC - and even Breakdown is kinda enjoyable for a while - and the car storage, I would safely give the game a 9/10. Zombie games just don't get any better than this.			"

												I don't generally care for zombie games, but this one is a real gem.You control a group of survivors of a zombie apocalypse, and are free to wander the (fairly large) map, killing zombies, looting building, setting up outposts, interacting with other survivors, etc. The kicker being that most resources are finite. Once you loot a building, it'll stay empty forever. When your trusty melee weapon wears down, it'll permanently break. And once a member of your group dies, he or she will stay dead. No going back: the game autosaves, and it keeps only the last one. While never being particularly hard, the game very effectively makes you feel that you are in a bad situation that can only get worse in the long run.To me, this game feels like a cross between Mount & Blade and The Walking Dead. If that sounds like a good thing to you, then definitely check it out!			"

												How do you imagine the perfect zombie apocalypse game? For me it's storyline from The Last of Us, characters and dialogues from Telltale's The Walking Dead, weapon crafting and time expiring events from Dead Rising, many side quests from Dead Island (ignore the one where the drunk guy asks you for alcohol), the real survival from Project Zomboid, horror mood from Resident Evil, open world from most of them and the multiplayer combining the best from Left 4 Dead and DayZ.State of Decay ads to that managing your own base and group of survivors. Game draws you in its world very quickly and is very addictive. There is always something more to do in it. But it lacks a good story and multiplayer. I can stand no multiplayer in it, but the good plot? Not so easy.What i mean is not that the game has no storyline at all. It has, but after a few missions the story of your survivor crew breaks off and you have to witness boring stories of army and some other groups. Most of people that joins your crew is generated randomly. They have no personality so it is hard to become acquainted with them. Death in State of Decay is permanent and hurts very bad, but it would hurt even more if you would knew these people.State of Decay is not an ultimate zombie survival game but it's really, really close. So i recommend it to all of you looking for a good zombie apocalypse game. Developers - Undead Labs have a name that obliges and they are already making their new game so I keep my fingers crossed.

												This game is brilliant and addicting, but whatever you do, don't die. Once your character is dead you won't get it back unless you start a new game. As such, if a Juggernaut gets a hold of you, just exit out of the game, unless it was your goal to get ripped in half and get ♥♥♥♥ed. Best to just go back to the start of the mission than lose your character. In any case, brilliant game, great time, and completely worth the hours lost in the abyss to this beauty.			"

												I played through the single-player campaign and found the game to be a pretty enjoyable experience overall, even if whoever decided to not make constant zombie spawns toggleable (or to make ""persistent world continues even when you are not playing"" toggleable) obviously did not realize how much more versatile a game it could have been for less-skilled action gamers if those were included.  The fighting is usually pretty fun, the base management is simple enough to be enjoyable without overly hindering the rest of the game, scavenging runs feel useful, the vehicles are lots of fun to use--overall, lots of little fun elements working together as a cohesive whole.Interestingly, while I played and LOVED ""Lifeline"" (possibly because I am apparently so much better with guns than with melee that I found it surprisingly easy), I think ""Breakdown"" is about the least compelling possible version of this game, as there is no longer an actual end goal.  With ""Breakdown"" the game feels more like you are playing a 1980s arcade game to get the highest score, and, well, I think we have moved beyond that as a gaming goal by now, surely?  Ha.  But obviously plenty of people love it, as it sounds like the most fun version of the game for many.  But ""run around the base game map and do all the same stuff as the base game, and your reward in the end is to do it all over again on a harder map until you die and lose your save"" does not exactly sound appealing to me.BUT!  This is still a -spectacular- zombie game, and a pretty great game by any standards.			"

												EDIT June 2016 - So this developer basically STOLE MY MONEY at this point. I went to check if any updates have been made, and they've completely removed this game from the Steam store, and replaced it with a ""Remastered"" version. And of course Steam won't give me a refund for this THEFT because it's more than two weeks old.I will never touch another game from this developer, EVER.(Previous review below.)The game is promising, but was nothing like I was expecting when I bought it.  The biggest issues I have are related to game mechanics that waste the player's time:If you have to quit the game in the middle of a mission, when you reload your save you will end up back at your base.  For missions with a time limit, this likely means you will fail because A) you can't get back out to the location and finish it before time is up, and B) something else will come up to prevent you from getting back out there, like another damn horde attack as soon as you load your game.Good luck taking care of a horde attack early in the game.  Gunfire just attracts MORE zombies, and melee weapons break too fast to do much good.  Zombies scale walls instantly even if barbed wire is on top, and barriers on doors and windows DISAPPEAR after an attack.  This makes reinforcement useless and stupid.			"

												State of Decay offers a fun GTA-zombie style of gameplay, yet it feels incomplete. The AI is straight up dumb. Zombies will run around houses to crawl in windows if you open a door in front of them, your teamates only seem to be competent at getting left behind or wacking a zombie a few times, but only a good time after you start attacking or they get attacked. It lacks many features I would expect, and has many small annoyances, such as the lack of team-features. The only time a character is worth anything to anyone is when you control them. Virtually all of the cars are the same. Maybe 2 skins each on 5 types of cars. Leaving about 10 total different vehicles. The driving also seems incomplete, like some of the physics are just a little wacky. There seems to also be an overall lack of content. after playing it, I actually thought it was another alpha-stage zombie game like Rust or Dayz.			"

Supplies are limited, some people don't like each other (seriously? It's the end of the world and people gotta be all drama queenin' it up...). It's a good game with good depth. Cars are limited. Weapons break down, ammo is scarce. People have specialties and can suck at other things. People perma-die. You gather supplies and allies and build up your outpost. You survive, you look for help and other survivors and supplies. Oh and cars break down too. Plough through too many zombie hordes and your car will eventually quit from all the abuse. Feral zombies are evil. They'll tear your charcter in half. Literally. One of my survivors lost a fight and had his upper body torn off from his lower body. Yeah, brutal.Recommend? Yes.			"

												SoD is the definitive zombie RPG experience. When I first started up the game, I instantly thought ""Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ did I just buy Dead Island again?"". The answer was no, I didn't. The first few missions and maybe first hour are pretty directed in terms of gameplay and missions but after that, it's a free universe. Gather survivors, supplies, weapons, cars, and influence through a series of life-threatening missions. Wipe out entire hordes of zombies so they don't attack home. Build medical tents, workshops, sleeping quarters, sniper towers, and much more! Drive around the graphically appeasing world but be careful! It might be tempting to run through hordes of Zeds but your car will take alot of damage! Here are some of the highest points of SoD:-Realism: melee weapons and cars all take damage after overuse. Nothing lasts forever!-Challenge: Zombies are actually dangerous and it is always better to avoid them. Don't rush into a fight, bullets are few and so is your energy-Immersive Environment: Witness the world fall apart around you. The military is not your best friend, niether is the established government in Marshal. Have the opprotunity to help total strangers or leave them for dead. It's the closest thing to a Walking Dead experience you'll get if you're looking for something like that. -Defensive Battles: Home is never perfect or completely safe. Zed hordes can rush in any moment if you don't control the population of them yourself. When they come, they come. They climb over walls from all directions and it becomes an Alamo-esque atomosphere. Hold or die, it's simple.-Death is a new begining: Since you can play as multiple characters, your death is not the end of the game. My first character, Marcus, I used to go out and look for survivors in the woods. I was surrounded by Zeds and torn apart. After one character's death, another one will give a quick eulogy and the whole camp's morale will go down. -Home: Make it your own and get involved in that well known zombie apocalypse drama. Keep the morale of your camp up by scavenging and defending against zed hordes. If one character in particular is saddened or angry, do a mission with them to boost their morale and keep them going. Random events will generate (gun misfire, arguments, etc) that all effect the morale of the camp. The Bad:-Not fully optimized for PC: This is obviously a Xbox game, using a mouse can give you sometimes a more glitchy feeling. It does not fully hold back gameplay though, it can make it harder to get the full scope of your surroundings though. -Invisible walls: In houses or other structures, it is common for invisible walls to pop out of nowhere and you will have to shake your mouse vigorously to be free.All in all, the game is great besides for those few bugs. 8.9/10!

												This game had a lot of potential but really fell short. The biggest issue for me were the bugs/mechanics. I was scavenging for supplies after having killed all the zombies around than out of the corner of my eye I saw a zombie appear out of thinn air. The other issue I had were the rucksacks, which you could only cary one of even if you had a car! This makes material gathering long and tedious. Also a big thing for me was how road signs respawned after you destroyed them, things shouldn't rebuild after you leave the game! I wish that this game was more like its name and you eventually start to worry about the lack of supplies and you need to be careful with cars because their are a finite amount of them. Also I wish you could have attacked other survivors for supplies. This game was okay but really was reppetitive and had major imersion issues for me.			"

												Hardcore zombie post-apocalyptic survival game. Third person perspective. Your characters get tired, sick, hungry, like real people. Supplies are limited, some people don't like each other (seriously? It's the end of the world and people gotta be all drama queenin' it up...). It's a good game with good depth. Cars are limited. Weapons break down, ammo is scarce. People have specialties and can suck at other things. People perma-die. You gather supplies and allies and build up your outpost. You survive, you look for help and other survivors and supplies. Oh and cars break down too. Plough through too many zombie hordes and your car will eventually quit from all the abuse. Feral zombies are evil. They'll tear your charcter in half. Literally. One of my survivors lost a fight and had his upper body torn off from his lower body. Yeah, brutal.Recommend? Yes.			"

												Probably one of the best openworld zombie games to come out in a long time. A very satisfying combat system, unlike most other DayZ-esque games out there, which has more of a Dead Rising feel to it. State of Decay also has a lot of great features, such as switching between survivors throughout the whole game, all in which you can level up and progress individually. Each survivor has a unique story behind them, as well. Your safehouse is a base that you can upgrade with more defenses as well as things like weapon and vehicle repairs. Yes, this game has open-world vehicle driving. If there was an openworld zombie game worth checking out this year, it's definitely State of Decay, because instead of trying to ride on the rise of DayZ-esque games, it tries to do its own thing and does it well.

												Amazing, if you like zombie survival games, then get this.I was so impressed with how much this game offered. You scavenge supplies, find survivors, help out locals, find bases and move to other bases, create items needed to survive, and have resources you need to keep stocked.The two other additions to the game, were also fun, Lifeline offers a new map and a new persona as you play the military who are trying to clear out the city before leaving it to the zombies to overrun.

												State of Decay is by far one of my all favourite zombie games.It's centered around zombies and not like alot of other zombie games these days where you must also fight humans. The main story of SoD is decent but nothing amazing. Don't buy this game if you're only in it for the storyline. You'll only be left very dissapointed as there isn't much meat on the story. The gameplay on the other hand is what makes this game so addicting and entertaining.The graphics are quite well and there is alot to explore. Ever wanted a zombie game with Sims elements? SoD is what you want. You and your community must survive and gather resources, with small events randomly being triggered around the community and game world. Each new community member that joins you is another someone you can play as. If your character dies you will reappear back at your base as one of your current members. The game itself is only in thirdperson, not that it's an issue, the characters are very detailed and interesting to play as and you almost never feel like playing the same one.As for DLC, Breakdown offers alot of new content such as weapons and unlockable hero's, characters from the main storyline and a few bonuses. Breakdown also makes the game less storydriven and more focused on sandbox style. Surviving or doing whatever it is you wish. Breakdown also has a level stage system. You can fix a RV and eventually, if you desire, leave Trumbull Valley only to reappear somewhere randomly in the game again, just on a new, reset game world with your previous survivors. Going an level up, surviving becomes harder in alot of factors. There are less items to be found, more zombies, harder to kill etc.If you've always wanted a zombie sandbox game with minor, sims elements, just in this case, community overall, SoD and Breakdown is defently a must buy for you.

												Although the game is supposed to be more of a simulation (compared to typical zombie shooting games), the almost constant limiting of the camera angles seems like a forced attempt at a cinematic experience. This frequently makes it hard to glance around and get a proper view of things, leaving you open to attack from places that you can't see--places you could easily look if the game would let you turn your head or body.[Update 2014-10-07: When playing with an Xbox360-compatible controller, there seems to be much more control of the camera angle than with the mouse. This removes my primary irritation with the game.] [Update 2014-10-12: When playin with controller, shortly after I got two people following me instead of one, the game very frequently popped up a prompt to Taunt/Cheer/Agree/Disagree. Nobody had said anything, so the last two don't even apply! The buttons to answer the prompt are the same as buttons you need to do melée, finishing strokes, searches, open/close doors. This means that I randomly was unabled to attack, defend, or close a door in time. Sometimes I could work around it be quickly pausing, unpausing, and immediately pressing the desired key before the Taunt/Cheer/Agree/Disagree prompt got in the way again.]You can control many different characters and improve their skills, such as with a particular weapon. However, they all seem completely unable to handle themselves without you present, regardless of purported skills. Keep in mind that when you close the game you are not considered present, so the next time you open it you may find that a nice situation has become dire, or that a desperate one has already been turned into failure. This is not a game you can play ""from time to time"", but rather one that requires you to frequently come back to make sure that things haven't collapsed while you weren't playing. And if you have to exit the game during an in-game crisis to deal with real life, you may have to do a lot of rebuilding, healing, and recruiting of new characters when you return. You may even have to start over.[More Update 2014-10-07: Although they did eat all the food and use all the other supplies in the months that I left this title alone (and the window barricades mysteriously disappeared without the window glass being broken), nobody died--not even the one supposedly in critical condition. Now wishing I could change my ""Not Recommended"" mark to ""Don't know if want"".]			"

												State Of Decay is brilliant! It's like Dead Rising in a large, open world, but with a more serious tone. It's also like The Walking Dead (TV series) with permanent character death, viscious and numerous zombies and a strong emphasis on survival.Set up an outpost, then venture out into towns and forests in search of food, weapons, vehicles, guns, ammunition, building materials and medicine to improve your home-base and keep your survivors alive. Lots of drivable vehicles, and every building is enterable to scavenge.Every character you find is fully voice-acted and can be played at any time. If they die, they're gone for good and you simply switch to another character. Very good, tense, addictive fun!			"

												State of Decay is a polished single-player open world zombie survival game. It requires you to take on the mindset of a survivor than just another player. After slowly taking my time and beating the single player campaign in about 25 hours (100%), here are some highlights from the game..Pros:- The game is not actually hard BUT the consequences are tremendous if you do ♥♥♥♥ up (you'll be instilled with a feeling of loss)- Resources are finite. It can be counterbalanced with resource investment into sustainability (for survival).- You don't just play one character. You raise up a community. The more time to take into building up the group as a whole, the greater your chances of survival.- Vehicles are considered a resource. If you take better care of them, you'll find that they can do more than just get you from point A to B.- 25 hours worth of content (main story and side quest included).- For a single player game, the NPC companions are quite capable. They don't take the lead but they don't fall behind either.Cons:- The story is quite average.- Vehicles are overpowered. They can kill everything except for one special infected.			"

												Dull and lifeless gameplay, not only do you repeat the same basic type of missions over and over. The way you complete them is the exactly the same as the mission before. While this game has some interesting concepts like permadeath of characters, the absolutely repetitive style of gameplay wears thin rather fast. I didn't bother finishing the game after playing for awhile and realizing I wasn't enjoying it anymore.			"

												It is quite hard to write a review on a game like State of Decay, every run you make can be a tiny bit different, which makes it near impossible to write a review that is useful to someone who is looking to buy.Therefore I will do the next illogical thing...I'll tell you a story. [spoiler free]Once upon a time, in a forest far far away. There were two redshirts, who magically plopped into a campsite with no reason to be there.Generic redshirt one was very good at leadership!Generic redshirt two was very good at...well...nothing.Generic redshirt one and two both stumbled upon a small campsite, however the campsite had been designed and developed by the Call of Duty school of object interaction. And therefore redshirt one could only take items from BRIGHT AND PULSING ILLUMINATED PILES OR OBJECTS, redshirt one and two blissfully walked past the obvious packets of food around the barbecue as well as the backpacks laying around.Later they stumbled upon a park ranger station where they met many other redshirts, all who were as clueless and redshirted as them. They were then guided to a gunshot in the distance, where they recruited redshirt three. They all joyfully hopped back to the ranger station and found their fellow redshirts had lived up to their names and died.They all decided to leave on a suspiciously empty road that covered a good quarter of the map. Entering an American sedan with wood exterior. There was enough of them to turn on the radio to ""what is love"" and nod their heads in unison. But they didn't.After a while Redshirt one, two and three found another group, full of more redshirts. They were all sent on varying missions, taking it in turns to go out into the towns nearby and eventually as their kill count increased they began to become less redshirt-ish.I finally had a Picard, a Data and a Seven-of-nine.**The rest I never bothered with, my 3 main character choices were enough to keep me going for the whole gameThe rest of the group just sat about, complaining and taking resources while each of my characters in turn broke their backs bringing back mountains of supplies in their trucks each run. Aside from each character starting out a redshirt, there is no customization. So you are dumped with what are basically blank slates with a smiley face drawn on. Hell, where can I make my own face with a smiley face on?Maybe I would become more attached to my character and actually care if they got seriously wounded or sick?Soon after my band of redshirts moved to a bigger location, where was like the old location but I kept getting harassed to move by a fellow redshirt****State of Decay tries to make this atmosphere of ""you are doomed, panic!"". But it never fully achieves this. One example was when my group had one day of food left, everyone was panicking and harassing me about it. I casually walked across the street, found a rucksack of food from a store and walked back...Crisis averted in less than 2 hours in game, about 30 minutes in real time.Speaking of which, the majority of work you do in this game is simply busywork. It is ""go here"" ""help this guy"" ""look here"" etc. If you don't pull time out of the important stuff you are doing and go help this one guy in a group you never talk to then they will be angry when they return.I had to refuse a quest from a fellow redshirt because I was too busy to follow up on hunting a mutated zombie, since I was more concerned about starving to death. Naturally did the logical thing and decided we were no longer friends, simply telling me to ""get lost"" every time I went near them.******It is a lose-lose scenario where you grip and control slowly slips away and you can't do anything to stop it. It quickly becomes frustrating.Eventually all my redshirts survived, with only a few scripted deaths along the wayHooray and suchConclusionIn essence State of Decay isn't a game I would call ""bad"" or ""poor"", but more ""rough"". It has plenty of problems such as the logic behind the world it shows you. One NPC was talking about rioting in the streets and looting, yet in this town I could only count 4 looted buildings out of around 50. Many of them were untouched.Great attention to detail has been made for this game, if you are sprinting towards a window and press the action button ""E"", you will throw yourself out of the window to safety. Also the scavenging system is quite unique because you can ""rush"" a scavenge and make more noise, or maybe create a lot of noise that will draw zombies from everywhere to your location, a good risk-reward system in my opinion.There is no casual dialogue with anyone unless they have a mission, which combined with the lack of character customization makes the game quite shallow.However characters do comment on things such as zombies flanking you or meeting some NPCS.The skills are done D&D style. The more you use them, the better they get.After a while you can pick additional perks to enhance your combat ability. However many of these special moves require the use of the left shift/left control + another key, which you can imagine is very difficult on a keyboard. I strongly advise using a controller.As I said. Rough. But not bad. Get it on sale			"

Despite the reports of mouse/keyboard being implemented (it's utterly ridiculous that this had to be patched into a ♥♥♥♥ing PC game and still allowed to be sold), it's in an unusable garbage state.  For all intents and purposes, it still isn't implemented due to how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ a state it's currently in.No graphics options, you have to edit configs which need to be extracted first, to actually turn off garbage like motion blur.Utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ camera control, with no way to disable things like camera auto-'correct', so you're constantly fighting the controls.  Oh and don't forget mouse acceleration, it would be silly to expect to be able to disable that crap.The utter audacity of the devs to be working on DLC right now before they even get the game into a releasable state is just the icing on the cake.Avoid this steaming pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ and this developer.

												Awful. Not worth the money even though I got it on sale. Keep looking for a good game and don't trust good reviews, not even totalbiscuit.pc optimization and graphics: Can't max the game at 1080p 60 fps on an overclocked r9 290. Turning the settings down I still see dips below 60 fps. The game also seems to want to lock itself to 50fps at certain points for no reason. The menu screens still have xbox buttons on them. This is the worst console port I have ever played. The worst. They didn't even add anti aliasing, just a quality slider and shadows options and that's it. I had to force AA with radeon pro because catalyst control center doesn't work for this game. The graphics are awful. I'm no professional artist, but I could make a better looking game than this. I would never have the audacity to sell a  product that looks like this. The graphics could have been for the original xbox. Actually, halo 2 looked better. The shadows/shading had to be fixed with mods so I could see during daylight. Tried other mods but held off because I read mods like the sweet Fx ones made the game even more buggy than it already is. The screen shots you see on the store page are BULL SHOTS, and even from the bull shots you can tell the game looks a bit dated. The game doesn't look as good as the store page screen shots  at all. It looks like they downsampled and added better shading or something. Sad how bad steam's quality control on games is. soundtrack: Forgettable is all I can say. I can't even hum one song off the top of my head. Once looking up some music on youtube, it was alright and set a decent tone.story: Hardly there, and not worth paying attention to any real progression. More of a survival game I guess. ♥♥♥♥ that, I want  a good story driven, open world zombie game. Instead I got this garbage.gameplay: A little better on this front but still nothing special. The pros include open world with some missions that pop up along side the ""main missions"" to keep things interesting. However, that's where it ends. The cons are plentiful and make the game worthless even if you are someone who can look past the bad graphics. The management is no fun. The resources are limited with unlimited zombies. Haven't run into the problem of people getting killed off while not even playing the game like some have reported, but I have had to deal with the infuriating save system. The saves are auto save only with no loading previous saves. The inventory system is dumb, with the largest backpack barely holding anything. Looked for a fast travel mod so I could atleast drop stuff off at base and couldn't find one. Half the time I can't even switch to another character or get another character to follow me, and there seems to be no reason.(glitch/bug not a matter of team liking me) As soon as the fact that  its open world wears off, which will be within an hour or two considering how small the world is, you'll just see the game as repetitive: go here, clear area/loot house/ hold off incoming zombies mission over and over. The world sucks to explore. Like really sucks. More shallow than an ubisoft open world game. If you're someone who thought skyrim was shallow, stop reading this review, cancel all thoughts about this game, and do something else. Guns are unsatisfying (probably due to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mouse support) and all feel about the same except for maybe the shotguns having spread and less range. Silencers were poorly implemented and break for no reason after a set number of shots. The decision to include no human enemies with guns was a terrible idea. Look at a game like dead island, which I also thought was pretty bad, but atleast had decent gameplay pacing with the mix between zombie and human enemies. The AI of your team and zombies is horrible and makes the game even more horrible to play. Overall, this game is bad, even for an indie game. It won't hold your interest if you have some sort of standards for games, even if you are a zombie fanatic.			"

From a larger developer, I would be just as angry- but the game's store page has no reference to any incompatibilities it might have had or anything like that. After buying it, and being super psyched to play it after seeing a few let's plays; I downloaded it and waited until everything was done; only to find that when I finally booted the game I was greeted iwht a message 'This game is incompatible with your graphics card, the game was not built to support onboard graphics cards' referencing the model my computer uses. All the while, I can play Skyrim or Xcom on medium settings just fine; but I got to see the menu of the game and if I tried to start a game was greeted with a black screen. I wouldn't have ended up upset or irritated at the game at all, which now just taunts me in my library view; if I hadn't picked it up and spent 15$ (Thankfully it was on sale) only to end up finding that it's paying that much for a game that functionally works; less than even a coaster. I'm glad the game is successful, but one thing I can only hope of indie developers, especially those who have went past the 'bug-testing stage' of their games; is that they follow the method of Paradox Interactive, and actually give support on these matters. While I want to believe in this game, I've basically been shanked for the belief.			"

												I was rather dissappointed in this game. They made it look open world but it really isn't so. It's too story-line based for what I was expecting. The gameplay is rather clumsy and doesn't feel fluid. It still feels like it's in Beta but it isn't.			"

												The game is very fun at first. The idea of being thrown in a zombie infested city and building your own fort/gathering resources is pretty awesome. After about ~7 hours or so the game begins to show its flaws. Missions are repetitive/annoying, resources are abundant, game combat is questionable. And although there's permadeath, an eager supply of victims are always ready to join your cause. This game is great for a short tryst; but for those who look for a longer, more immersive world should look elsewhere.			"

												Generally enjoyable although somewhat repetitive. Night time lasts too long and is just way too dark - like frustratingly dark (not atmospheric, you just can't see what you are doing). Has some nice touches like player deaths (if  you die you can become another survivor in your camp), caring for cars (they aren't endless). Environment is big, but most of it wasted in just driving around. Car physics is average. Searching for stuff is tedious. Combat is pretty  clunky. No crafting of weapons. Storyline predicatble but ok. All that said, it kept me going and was worth the price paid in the sale.			"

												Best Zombie game hands down!  More in depth than Dead Island, richer story than the Walking Dead and better gameplay than Left for Dead.  Awesome game! Super entertaining! You will spend hours building your bases, collecting supplies, recruiting civilians, and destroying zombies. If you love Zombie movies and games, then you'll love State of Decay because it puts you into your very own Zombie horror movie. Did I mention it's sandbox? So you can do whatever you want whenever you want. Have fun slaughtering Zeds!			"

												A great zombie survival game that makes you scavenge, survive, and manage a group. I highly reccomend the DLC ""Breakdown"" package after you play through the story which leaves you to scavenge until you have to fix an RV and restart the map with a higher difficulty each time you move out . If you're a survival horror guru then this title is for you. Despite this being a console port it is a great title for the low price.			"

												A game very different from L4D / Walking Dead series but it still provides a nice immersion about zombie appocalypse.In the game, you must take care of each other, gather resources, and search for new survivors. You are able to use guns, driving, crafting items and even building. But, don't go looting all resources in the beginning because they aren't infinite and try to make silencer soon as possible - any kind of noise will call more atention of nearby zombies. If you run out of materials, try to trade with neighbour survivors, always work.			"

The pc ports fairly solid, Watch out if you start a new game in the Dlc which is worth picking up you will erase your progress in the original game. Loved my time with it, for an indi title I put this up there with other third person games I love, It's pretty much rockstar quality except in the voice acting department.

												Game is great.  Managing a base, your survivors, doing supply runs, morale etc.  All in an enjoyable sandbox.  Glad I waited a few months to play it after trying it out on early release.  Having full mouse and keyboard controls with remapping of keys is great.  Controls can be a bit awkward inside building but other than that no probs.  Guns are kinda weak, but may its engrossing trying to keep your survivors alive, having to go out on missions in the dark, etc.  Well worth full price, though a steal on its current daily sale.			"

												Not an immaculate game by any means but a very addicting and fun game. This is one of those special games that gets you hooked enough to look forward to a sequel with improved game mechanics. The ambitions of this game is quite impressive. In gameplay, many times, all the elements will flow perfectly and the whole game will really feel like an exciting struggle for survival. Each time you go outside your compound with a character there is slight hesitation as you aren't sure if your character will survive a scavaging run, because when a character dies it is permadeath and they are gone from the game for good. Other times, various bugs will break that immersion and become frusterating. However, despite those buggy occurances, the game still shines. There is a problem where the latter half of the game will become easier as you start to horde more weapons and supplies but that is the natural side effect of becoming much better at the game. I would have liked to have seen difficulty ramp up a bit more as you go on. Though I have to admit it is satisfying nearer to the end of the game when you can just walk down mainstreet with a .45 colt and caution thrown to the wind because your characters have become survival badasses. Overall, it's an easy game to recomend to anyone who enjoys zombie beat downs and survival/horror. A final positive: this studio has been really dedicated in trying to resolve bugs and continue to improve their product which is a really nice thing to see.			"

Posted: June 22, 2014
												I had real trouble deciding if I would give this a 'yes' or 'no'. If you want this review summed up in one sentence: The developers of State of Decay have made a wonderful basket of a game, but have then proceeded to fill it with too many eggs, some of which are of questionable quality.The game feels good, the controls certainly aren't sloppy - just wondering around the world feels quite enjoyable, the graphics aren't bad (they aren't brilliant either, but it falls far above acceptable), gunplay (from what I've done with it) has been well implimented, the stealth aspect is fairly nice too, but then we dig slightly further into this apple of a game and find the rotted meat of the game. The stealth of the game requires you to have near constant attention on everything around you to avoid alerting zombies - which on paper, seems fine, except you get no help with this. Some might claim this is to help with 'immersion', but I feel that this is the exact opposite. In the real world you have all five senses to notice danger, in this game you're limited to two (and even then, sound isn't all too helpful unless you have five speakers), but this is forgivable. I've not actually run into any problems as of yet that weren't brought about by my own hubris, but it does lead me neatly on to the camera. Third person perspective; good for glancing around corners before you've reached it, not good for getting caught in bushes when hiding from zombies, where the bush then obscures your vision. Given that a bit of the game is done indoors, first person perspective may have been much appreciated, but it wasn't. Again, not a big thing, it's usable as it is, but I'd have to give the stealth a 6/10.You're able to climb specific objects/buildings and take stock of your surroundings, examining a couple of shops from a vantage point and they're added to your map, spot a hoard of zombies and they get added too. A nice touch to the game - not required, but nice. You decide to go and loot a house and creep to it. After a sweep of the house to make sure there are no zombies - killing them if there are - you're given the option to set up an outpost. Don't know what an outpost is? As far as I can see, the game doesn't give much information on the subject either. You decide to loot the building, and make your way back home with some small loot. Your character is tired. How do you get them to sleep? Change to another character if you're friends with them. You want to give your items to them? Put them in the communal safe box (which gives you community points), change the character to a new one, and retrieve the items from the communal safe box (costing the same community points to remove - so you don't just go in and steal everything). When I heard that this game had the ability to swap between characters, I assumed it would mean inventory management and swapping whenever you wish on missions, but no. What this game allows for is a required change of characters to one of a different skillset, along with a needless method of inventory switching. Once you've switched your character, you decide to go out on another looting spree, however this time a side-mission pops up to go and rescue someone. If you don't do it, they die, and moralle drops. I can see why this was included - it fits the theme very well, but a fun game thematics alone does not make. I've seen a lot of people mention that this game is fairly 'realistic' and not like the Left 4 Dead style zombie-killing-spree, and for the most part, they're right to an extent. Like with all games it seems, the characters are so unfit they can't run any longer than thirty seconds (even the military woman), and weapons dont stick around forever. I can't say I've had enough epxerience with the game to see better tiered weapons, but the weapons I've had have been destroyed quicker than I would have liked. But now we get to the crux of this paragraph. While your characters are bound by the curse of real-life (or as much as the game can simulate it), the zombies are not. This isn't going to be a 'zombies-aren't-real-hurr-durr', but there are the occasional nine/ten foot zombies that can rip you in half.  When a game is trying to be realistic (or focus on the planning / building elements) and includes boss like zombies? This is what I meant about the too-many-eggs in one basket. Which then also leads onto the game continuing after you've stopped playing;I would LOVE this game if I could play it for a couple of hours, do a mission or two, upgrade my base, and then go, but no. The game insists on altering itself when you return - this could be just a drop in resources that the characters needed to stay alive, or a completed building - and again, this might be absolutly loved by some, but for me, it's just not something that I enjoy in this kind of game.Ok, I'm getting a bit bored of writing this now, I'm going to stop with a summary.For me, the game feels as if it's not finished yet. It may very well not be. Would I recommend the game at full price? No. Would I recommend this game at half-price or less? Yes, easily. "

												State of Decay is what I had hoped Day Z was before playing it. I prefer single player games for some concepts and this fit the bill nicely. The game is basically a ""build your zombie survival base and make it a functional community"" game. You start off with very little and build up to some formidable equipment. I like how the game is effectively open world exploration combined with resource management. Once I started playing, I couldn't really stop. Pros: combat system - guns or melee, they are both pretty solid ways of handling the hordes!- dynamic environment- wide range of weaponry- simple and rewarding character development- open world exploration- Handle a zombie apocalypse in your own wayCons: Resolution capped at 1280.....a shame!-perma-death! If your juiced up character dies....its gone forever with its developed stats!! (realism?)-A little bit too much micro management with side quests (repetition)			"

												One of the best zombie survival games there is, State Of Decay is an extremely well-made game and when I found out about it I realized I had finally found ""The Game."" ""The Game"" I had been searching for but could never find. ""The Game"" that doesn't force you to restart missions if they fail, where failed missions effect the storyline. ""The Game"" that requires you to battle waves of zombies for resources needed for your own survival. ""The Game"" where you aren't just one linear character, but where instead at any instant your favorite character can die and death is permanent. In State of Decay, it is necessary to scavenge for resources and every single character has their own needs. Every character in State of Decay has their own unique personality and (not including the main story's characters and Lily) have randomly generated names. Every step you take could be your last, one mistake and you become zombie-chow, never to be seen again. But don't worry, that isn't the end of your game! You can earn the friendship of other survivors and recruit them to join your community, and they will become playable if you earn enough trust with them. Nobody is safe and at any minute, any second, the zombies could breach your defenses and you can be left with nothing. Unless you're well prepared. It's fairly easy to prevent total devestation of your community. All you have to do is stay well supplied, and keep your community healthy. Sometimes you'll have to make life-or-death choices. If your favorite character gets infected, will you kill them to protect the community, or will you take the chance of them turning and let them live? Every choice is yours in State of Decay, but it doesn't always work out for you.PROSExtremely Well-ThoughtWorth The MoneyEndless FunRealistic NeedsDay/Night CycleRPG FactorsRequires a Good Strategy to SurviveCONSSeveral bugs (EX: Zombies can sometimes phase through walls)Overall I recommend State of Decay and although there are tons of bugs, Undead Labs is always working to fix them and even add new content now and then! The two DLC: Breakdown and Lifeline are more than worth their inexpensive cost, as they are presented like a whole other game. I give State of Decay a 20/10, but that's my opinion. I feel that if you can afford it, and you're thinking of buying it, (and you're into zombie survival games) then State of Decay is the game for you!			"

												So i was looking for a game thats a bit different from the ""kill as many zombies as you can"" game and more like a duck and dive, try to survive the zombies sort of game. i was not dissapointed. From the start it is clear that this game isnt about zombie death count, its about surviving the Zombie apocolopse by gathering resources, befriending the local population and securing the best territory to enable to to live and survive in relative comfort.Firstly the bad bits about gameplay. there are quite a few bugs, casually looting some food and a zed decides to come through the wall and mall me. luckily only the one! the graphics are in no way next gen, which i kind of like in a way, it gives it a retro zombie authenticity lacking from some apocoliptic games. loss of stamina is annoying, especially when a horde of zeds decides to turn up! but in truth it adds a little more dynamic to the game, making you think about exit stratagies before searching a property, worth noting, check rooms and close doors behind you!I've found using vehicles to draw enemies out and run them over was a good strategy but you'll go through a fair few vehicles this way so ensure you are able to repair them, and also dont ram a juggernaught at full speed, nasty consequences as i found out when i lost one of the games first notable characters. Yes when someone dies they stay dead, no continues or respawns, there gone! Gonna wrap this up now by saying if you want something a bit different from the normal zombie game, this could probably be for you, with a price tag thats not too bad considering the other titles out there. not quite completed this yet but i'm around 10 hours in and im still hooked, i'll be downloading the dlc once the games complete for more action!

												A nice, relaxing zombie survival game compared to other unforgiving games like Day Z. Sometimes you want to go out for a stroll with your fellow survivors in the single-player game without real player looters popping in on your fun and busting a cap, leaving you for the dead to feed on. In this game, you can bash a few zombie heads into the ground and explore, bring a little something, something back, make everybody happy. If you happen to  die, there is always another survivor waiting back at camp to take out . The DLC looks pretty interesting, can't wait for it to come out just to see how long I can outlast a zombie apocalypse.			"

												The first time I played this game...I was let's say not sure what to expect...A good friend told me to play this game so I haven looked into it before I bought it...yeah I live dangerously I know ;-D.The game is a WORLDCLASS zombie game. I love it..Some technical problems here and there...even lost a character because of an enginenug that flipped a car and exposed her to a horde that killed her...Besides that I haven't found any BIG bugs. And the gameplay experience was MENTAL! To all of you out there that loved The Walking Dead (the TV-Series) you will love this game as well....even tho it has a comic touch...And I would recommend this game to every Zombie freak/fan out there!

												State of decay is definitely an interesting and addicting game. Which says a lot for a game in a genre that's been beaten to death. What sold it for me was definitely the surviving and recruiting aspect, mixed in with the chance of perma-death. For the surviving aspect, you need to go out and collect supplies like weapons, food, and building material. Most of that can be found in the neighborhood/town, however at some point those supplies can run out and you'll have to scavenge in farther places. Don't feel like going back and fourth? You can move your base/group, somewhere else! It feels very Walking Dead(kinda).Recruiting is also neat. Every survivor has their own set of traits that make them shine, or make them poop. Some might be doctors who boost your infirmary strength, some are athletes who can go for long distances, and there's even some with asthma! I think something that's a little tedious(in a fun way for me) is that you can train people up(some easier than others). Knowing that this game is persistent, even when your not playing, it feels good to set your crew up for success, so you don't come back to a dead camp.Then we got the death aspect. If someone dies, they are gone for good! This includes ""story"" characters. People in your group can randomly get sick and die if you don't have proper treatment at the time(or act fast enough), I've seen characters mercy kill the sick/wounded(that may just be story though), and sometimes they want you to mercy kill them. Depression and fear can instill fights and suicides. People can go on missions and not come back. If you like to get attached to characters, keeping them alive will be a treat!I think what mostly sold this for me, is that it feels like a much more developed version of an flash game called The Last Stand. I used to love that as a kid, and this game brings it back 10x more. You might like it, you might hate it. But I recommend it!			"

												One of the better ""survival"" type games that I've come across. It starts off a bit janky and crappy, but stick with it until you get out of the starting area. When you get a good idea of how the game works, it can suck you in completely. It's single player, which may be why it works so well, but there's undoubtedly some missed opportunity there. Maybe in a sequel. Regardless, if you're interested in a smallish open world zombie survival game where you round up survivors, gather supplies and construct bases, etc. - this is worth picking up. A definite buy if it's on sale.			"

												State of Decay is an interesting mix of zombie survival and storyline.  The game has strong emphasis on survival, guiding you to gather various types of materials (building, weapon, food, medication, etc).  However, you take the role of different characters (between which you can, and many times must, switch).  The game is semi-realistic, in that, people fatigue, weapons break, ammo and guns aren't everywhere, and morale is actually a mechanic (and yes, your NPCs can be eaten by zombies and be gone forever).An interesting and, in my opinion, awesome mechanic is its rogue-like feature that will save your game up until you die.  At which point, you must start over.  This only adds to the suspense of the game once you've built and expanded your survivor community.The game play itself is very well thought out.  The mechanics work upon each other to create a more realistic rendition of survival during a zombie outbreak.  There are a few mechanics that are wonky and can be exploited (about to die?  Exit the game to be teleported alive back to base).  But all in all, well balanced.  The only serious gripe with this game is the outdated graphics.  I've seen better graphics from games put out in the early 2000s.  If the developers would put a little time into developing HDR textures, the game would look as good as it plays.  I would definitely recommend this to any gamer who wants a zombie survival game.			"

												This game is simply too much fun. I have not found any glaring faults as yet, though I do wish vehicles carried more items (a kitchen timer should not really take up the same space as a duffle bag in the back of a pickup truck) and that fully metal weapons, such as a pipe, lasted far, far longer than they do.Deaths are real, and as a character dies you are stuck with whomever is left. While that does not change the game itself, it does limit what you are able to do later in the game if you have not been working on all the available characters' skills. I consider this a bonus, as it prevents the game from getting boring.Vehicle stability is reminiscent of Grand Theft Auto. This is a good thing.I have not played The Walking Dead series, so I have no basis for comparison. All I can really say, is that I have a ton of fun in this game.			"

												The game isnt finished yet, and it's apparent. Graphics at times can be janky, but if you set the settings an option under where you would normally play it it isn't too bad. The game opens up well, and the story is the same as any zombie game. Maintaining your base can be tricky, and the UI isnt the most player friendly, but is easy enough to get used to. The characters are interesting enough, and the way they react to eachother. The fact that if something happens to affect them (like SPOILER, a best friend dying if you arent quick enough) they can go into depression and commit suicide. Its hard to get a foothold in the game early on since youre just kinda thrown straight into the game post tutorial. Overall it has the huevos to become an amazing game, and is still entertaining enough to play now.			"

												Absolutly splendid gameplay, a little rough around the edges, but any roughness can be refined nearly instantly.I do, however, feel that the story is, well, short. Alright, alright. It's a good 20-some hours when you first play the game, but once you know how to do everything, the story just becomes shorter. My second run and I only spent about 13 hours, and I was already where I was in 19. I personally think that they did that for DLC purposes, but then again, I'm a nutter that thinks all people want to do is make a quick buck until proven otherwise.The story is, however, interactive and you gain a love for all the characters, even the survivors who just joined you. However, be warned, there is permadeath. You will feel for those who die...So, Semper Fi boys and girls, becuase we leave no one behind!			"

												Great game with high potential.Awesome music, though it would be welcome more often.The graphics are all right - the dynamic interaction between the world and you is on the other hand high, and this kind of makes up for the graphics, which aren't bad in any way.Game-wise it tends to become far too easy when you learn your way around. You stop fearing mobs of zombies and just mow them down. I've never lost a survivor to the zombies. (Except one I didn't want and committed suicide-by-zombie)The RPG elements, while unneeded, doesn't shine through and when a home event, mostly negative, happens, it happens, whether you prepared or not. Also a sandbox/unlimited mode would be nice. (Can't wait for Breakdown)Overall I think the game somewhat lives up to its potential. You will gather supplies and live through a zombie apocalypse, yes, though it tends to become a walk in the park.Also more urban areas and generally fewer vehicles (which are supposed to be rare but aren't) would be really welcome.Also, superzombies... Sigh... All right, most of these can be excused because an armoured zombie is just a zombie in a flak jacket or SWAT equipment, but the juggernaut is ridiculous. The Screamer is all right because, well... It's kind of fair game as well. The bloated zombie is just... Hardly ever meet it anyway.All in all, you'll want to play this game. It is very much worth the 18,99 €, though until BREAKDOWN it only has limited replayability.Expect to have fun and be entertained, but do not expect to find the new holy grail.			"

												Short Version Review:""Crashed a pickup truck into a guard rail, got stuck, got beset my 20 zombies pouring out of the nearest house and lived !  Thank you, sledge hammer!  Then rammed a junky little sports car into the truck over and over until it was off the rail.  Got the truck back, left the burning car .... Thumbs Up !!!""Slightly Lengthier Review:So far, so good !  To start, I'll begin with the disclaimer of ""I've never played a zombie apocalypse game before this one.""  Unless you count some of the Fallout Games ( mmmm ... a lot of those mutants were pretty similar to zombies ).  Anyways, after a couple of crash n' burns both figurative and literal, I'm on my 3rd run of this game and it's a pretty fun romp.  There's a whole steamin' pile of paranoia to be had exploring in the towns, trying to keep one eye on the stuff you're trying to scavenge, and another eye out the window for things that might be jumping through it, trying to eat you.  An ear to the ground also helps.  Screamers are no picnic.  And it also might help to drive a little better than me, b/c when I see a mass of zombies coming down the street at me, my gas pedal foot gets a mind of its own.  I've dented enough hoods, lost enough car doors, and blown up enough vehicles to fill a modest junkyard already.  Hmmm, and I'm still just barely into the storyline itself, b/c the act of survival from day to day is a story all on its own.Of course, no game's complete without at least a few gripes.  I wish some of the NPCs weren't so petty or inherently stupid.  Nothing says "" HEY, WE'RE OVER HERE !!! "" quite like the sentry on the tower wielding a shotgun instead of a high powered rifle and shooting multiple times at zombies on the fringe of shotgun range.  There used to be an ornery guy with a hat on the tower - he was a jerk, but at least he had a rifle - can't figure out how to get the girl with the shotgun to come down and put the sniper guy back up there .... or convince her to swap weapons ...The other gripes are fairly mild in comparison.  It's been a bit of a trick for me trying to figure out where the main storyline wandered off to after my original party stumbled half-chewed into this church compound.  We've been fighting to keep our sanity and our skins ever since.  Having a whole lotta fun, though - $5 well spent.			"

												I am quite enjoying State of Decay so far, finding it quite addictive.  There are a few flaws (stamina, stamina loss after exploring for too long etc) but the overall gameplay makes up for these imho.  Well woth the £6 i paid for it whilst it was on sale :)			"

												7.5/10State of Decay is a lot of fun, but not without it's shortcomings. It plays a bit like GTA, but in a zombie apocalypse based world.It totally nails the feeling of holding back a never ending tide of undead, and slow looming desperation. The gameplay is simple, yet fun. Managing your base and survivors is cool, and you end up becoming attached to your favorites. (I actually restarted once because my ""main"" character got overrun by zombies.) Building up your base, and upgrading facilities was rewarding while not being overly in depth to the point it was annoying.The combat is easy to pick up, the weapons have variety, and the enemies have a decent amount of difference between them. I like how sound attracted enemies while scavenging for survival tools, and made it seem threatening to be out there, especially when alone. Gunshots attract anything in range of the noise as well (until you get a supressor), which made gunplay a double edged sword.The cons are: Random bugs with Zombie placement/walking through walls. Lack of quest variety, and being unable to do multiple quests at the same time. Overall, I was very pleased. While the game does get bogged down a bit in the late game due to lack of mission variety, it's a very enjoyable experience overall. It's the most realized apocalyptic world I've played in a game. No rails, you can go anywhere, and it's fascinating to see the world they've created. I'd totally recommend this to any Zombie game fan, or anyone wanting a solid gaming experience. Great bang for the buck!			"

												Zombies (l4d) + free roam rpg (gta3 ish in size) + wingman  + Carmageddon :-D  There are a few little frustrations in game mechanics around upgrades and moving stuff about (like baulders gate when it first came out) but you can get over this. My son said it is more like Shaun of the dead  than left 4 dead but there are still some fast ones and shocks a plenty even with the gamma up ;-) I have not progressed far enough but having a wingman/woman to hold a zombie while you blat it's head off can be really helpful. Finally probably my favourite bit of the lot is running Zombies down AKA Carmageddon. Getting your first door kill will make you feel like watching zombieland again :-) at this price worth a few hours of your life defiantly.			"

												"" Recklessly killing zombies you will die , but playing it smart and managing your colony well you will survive , this is TRULY a Zombie Survival game for the Hardcore fans ! "" Firstly I won't recommend this game to peopl who's looking for a 101% hack and slash pure action , overpowerig character and you mow down zombies like they are made out of "" tofu "" No , this game isn't about being a badass. This game is purely about surviving. Killing zombies is also part of the job for the sake of surviving , but this game doesn't focus on killing. Everything you do will inflict upon the game, go ahead and recklessly shooting zombies you will end up short in ammo and lesser chance of survival. Instead of looking for food for your team and wasting time killing zombies you will too ending in big trouble. I say this game it's 50% Strategy 30% Survival and 20% Action and Killing Would I recommend this game ? Yes definitely if your looking for a "" TRUE "" zombie survival game.			"

												Great game with high potential.Awesome music, though it would be welcome more often.The graphics are all right - the dynamic interaction between the world and you is on the other hand high, and this kind of makes up for the graphics, which aren't bad in any way.Game-wise it tends to become far too easy when you learn your way around. You stop fearing mobs of zombies and just mow them down. I've never lost a survivor to the zombies. (Except one I didn't want and committed suicide-by-zombie)The RPG elements, while unneeded, doesn't shine through and when a home event, mostly negative, happens, it happens, whether you prepared or not. Also a sandbox/unlimited mode would be nice. (Can't wait for Breakdown)Overall I think the game somewhat lives up to its potential. You will gather supplies and live through a zombie apocalypse, yes, though it tends to become a walk in the park.Also more urban areas and generally fewer vehicles (which are supposed to be rare but aren't) would be really welcome.Also, superzombies... Sigh... All right, most of these can be excused because an armoured zombie is just a zombie in a flak jacket or SWAT equipment, but the juggernaut is ridiculous. The Screamer is all right because, well... It's kind of fair game as well. The bloated zombie is just... Hardly ever meet it anyway.All in all, you'll want to play this game. It is very much worth the 18,99 €, though until BREAKDOWN it only has limited replayability.Expect to have fun and be entertained, but do not expect to find the new holy grail.			"

												The game isnt finished yet, and it's apparent. Graphics at times can be janky, but if you set the settings an option under where you would normally play it it isn't too bad. The game opens up well, and the story is the same as any zombie game. Maintaining your base can be tricky, and the UI isnt the most player friendly, but is easy enough to get used to. The characters are interesting enough, and the way they react to eachother. The fact that if something happens to affect them (like SPOILER, a best friend dying if you arent quick enough) they can go into depression and commit suicide. Its hard to get a foothold in the game early on since youre just kinda thrown straight into the game post tutorial. Overall it has the huevos to become an amazing game, and is still entertaining enough to play now.			"

												State of decay is a great game with many weapons and a map to explore loot and find many survivors along the way to invite to your community. The game is made where you have to make a base with your community to defend against zombie attacks and help injured, sick and tired survivors get back on there feet. The game doesn't always have to be played all guns blazing, sometimes you can stealth around zombies. All together this game reminds me of the walking dead and is brilliant.

												This is not the perfect zombie experience... but it makes a really good effort towards it. Short answer: I recommend this game for anyone who likes sandbox or zombie games.Long answer:zombie sandbox game emphasizing survival during the outbreak, have been really enjoying it so far and I think I will easily get another twenty hours out of it before I shelve it.The gameplay is alot of fun and mechanically most things feel fairly good. There are some nice ideas being tried out and for the most part they pay off and result in a fun game. Some more options for difficulty would have been nice but I believe the DLC has that covered.The graphics are not amazing but they are good enough that it does not detract from the game, there is room for more optimization but it ran fine on my machine which is mid range. I have not yet had a crash which is nice.Considering this is the first game from this developer I am actually suprised how good it is, I know I picked it up rather late in the update list so many issues have been fixed. I recommend picking up the DLC if you see it at a good price purely because I believe that a true sandbox mode is needed once the campaign has been finished. I also think needing to purchase this DLC is a let down in terms of value as the mode should be in the main game from the start!There is a small list of annoyances in regards to gameplay but nothing game breaking, the primary being the inability to set survivors with special skills roles (and not go out and risk their lives). Other than that one though nothing else jumps out at me enough that it detracted from the game. So far I have not had any gameplay bugs which is suprising.There is a really good foundation here to build upon and I am sure if they release a sequal it will be amazing.7/10			"

												Awesome apocalyptic-survival game. This game focuses more on gathering ressources, having good relations with other communities, survive as a group, than kill every zombie you see, and scavenge everything. For some, this is what they don't like, and other, what they prefer. In my case, I fall in love with the open world, the different communities all over the map, and the fact that you actually have to survive in GROUP. Anyone that liked The Walking Dead series on TV should love this piece of art. The only concern are the graphics (no advanced settings), and some zombies issues (they go through walls sometimes, they fall under porch, etc). Out of 10, I'd give it a 8.5. Recommended for any post-apocalyptic game fan.			"

												Not an immaculate game by any means but a very addicting and fun game. This is one of those special games that gets you hooked enough to look forward to a sequel with improved game mechanics. The ambitions of this game is quite impressive. In gameplay, many times, all the elements will flow perfectly and the whole game will really feel like an exciting struggle for survival. Each time you go outside your compound with a character there is slight hesitation as you aren't sure if your character will survive a scavaging run, because when a character dies it is permadeath and they are gone from the game for good. Other times, various bugs will break that immersion and become frusterating. However, despite those buggy occurances, the game still shines. There is a problem where the latter half of the game will become easier as you start to horde more weapons and supplies but that is the natural side effect of becoming much better at the game. I would have liked to have seen difficulty ramp up a bit more as you go on. Though I have to admit it is satisfying nearer to the end of the game when you can just walk down mainstreet with a .45 colt and caution thrown to the wind because your characters have become survival badasses. Overall, it's an easy game to recomend to anyone who enjoys zombie beat downs and survival/horror. A final positive: this studio has been really dedicated in trying to resolve bugs and continue to improve their product which is a really nice thing to see.			"

												This game is pretty much everything what anyone would want a Survival game to be. Thou there could be some improvements of course. The feeling is there and the basic game play is mostly enjoyable, after the slightly stiff start.The only things, that I think, could be improved, are the lack of placing supplies to a vehicle, so you always have to carry them on your back. You can't seem to give supplies to your fellow survivals either, so that they could carry them. A co-op atleast would be a nice addition and it would solve these problems, when you and your friend could carry their own stuff. Other than that, SoD is a nicely done game, which is pretty loyal to the Zombie genre (except for the special zombies). And so far (I have only played the game about 7 hours), I haven't met any hostile survivals, which is a nice change for the typical ""trust no one"" attitutude, what you would usually see in these games.

												Imagine Walking Dead Survivgal instinct if it was good and didn't have the Walking Dead IP.Story.Story wise this game is a bit lacking, there doesn't seem to be much going on besides the zombies an some quests here and there, but that's what expected from the game and i won't hold it against it.Presentation.State of Deacay looks really great and the animation looks good, although there isn't much music in this game it's really ambient and is only there when it needs to.Gameplay.The gameplay in State of Decay is great, not perfect but not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ down 3rd aisle.most of the game you are either scavaging for weapons and reasorces, doing a quest for someone or both, the time you aren't doing that is usually spend getting to the places where you can scavage or as a part of a quest.Weapons are common especially melee weapons and finding ammo isn't too hard but finding stuff like health and food can be a bit more tricky.There are also cars in this game, some that works and others that don't and the handeling feels realistic and works well so it's your fault if the car goes boom, not the games.This game also features a perma death system, once your character dies he/she is gone for good and you get a random bloke/lass and continue playing from the safehouse, you can you go back and pick up what he/she had on him/her when he/she died, but that might take a while and takes up a rugsack slot untill you get back to the safehouse.The gameplay can be a bit repetitive at times, but is overall great.Pros+ Nice Visuals+ Ambient Sountrack+ Great but somewhat repetitive gameplay+ Not too hard but not too easy eithercons- Lacking story- buggy- Somewhat repetitive gameplayoverall this game gets 3 severed zombieheads out of 5 soup cans.

												The game, while fun and enjoyable, does still lack some of the polish that is typically expected by a casual gamer. It can be buggy at times and some areas of the game, namely the missions, are in some need of clarification. The difficulty of the game is fairly balanced aside from the occasional buggy encounter with a zombie horde. Companion AI is decent, but if you're planning for your allies to not walk into molotov fires... well... then you'll have a problem. Also, as a pc port of a xbox game, the graphics are pretty painful if you're used to pretty sparkly scenery. Assuming a graphics enhancement comes out that point is negligible, currently though the biggest hurdle you will encounter is seeing whats going on. Still, it's a pretty solid game.  10/10 for concept and game elements, 5/10 for execution.   If they had more money/time to polish this game then it would have been perfect.			"

												If you're a fan of zombie games even in the slightest, then this is the game for you. This game really hits home on how living in a zombie infested world should feel. If you don't forage for supplies, you die. If you don't keep up on your weapons, you die. If you are not meticulous about getting that last supply crate into the truck before the charging horde reaches you... You die. State of Decay is a wonderfully done game in the way that it doesn't quite feel like anything else. The idea is that you're on vacation when SHTF and you have to rally other survivors you find to build an encampment to combat the infected. You have to make sure it has good walls, ample food and shelter, and most important of all.. Quick, easy access to nearby supplies. Everything in this game is Finite. You WILL run out of supplies eventually. Blow up too many cars, and you won't have any left to drive. You really have to want to survive in order to get anywhere in this world and this game couldn't have done it any better. There were moments where I had a horde just behind me. I'm 50 yards from the truck. Do I run for it or dart off into a nearby building to try and lose them? Do I drop the bag of supplies I just collected, or hope for the best? Fire off some rounds at the risk of attracting more undead? The choice is yours. This game is entirely open world and completely non-linear. Play how you want. But you've been warned. How long will you fend off the State of Decay?			"

												Beautiful game  --some things lacking are: Co-op mode; optional 1st-person view(for tight spaces, like searching through a house for supplies); higher display resolution modes for single display at least, like 2560x1600(only goes up to 1920x1200 max last I played); 7.1 surround sound setting for those who actually have those kinds of setups....especially for games like this that require a keen hearing sense from all directions as to make sure you're not jumped on..................Some things that need fixing are the bugs and glitches.

												A really enjoyable game.Now that every thing is out propbly the game is hugely imporoved and over all I think it a amaizng port from the xbox to the pc, with some problems with glitches and zombies clipping but this is already been patched a few times.Gameplay: 4/5: While slow at time the gamplay can be easy to get used to, Hand wepaons to guns you have a wide range of weapons you play around with, from bashing zombies skulls in.Story: 3/5: the story is not the best hell the really not much of a story at all, so I won't really recomend if you are after an amazing game with an awesome story, go play skyrim.World: 4/5: Mainly trees and easter egg from walking dead and lot of places to explore, well hell yea good world :)Well over all i say hell yea worth picking up, really just play it ill give it 4/5 out of the unog meter :)			"

												State of Decay is an honest to god good open world zombie survival game. It has some small quirks and bugs but they're forgivable since the general experience is excellent. Get it along with the Breakdown DLC, which adds a lot more challenge to the game and is great for playing after finishing the story.If you like zombie and/or survival games, you can't miss out on this one.

If you're reding this you're probably wondering if you should buy this game or not?Well....to be honest i wasn't disapointed with the purchase of this game even though I'm not the biggest fan of zombie themed games/movies/books,...but i would recommend it getting it on sale (as most games on Steam). This game's got a pretty tense single player campaign in which you're trying to survive a zombie apocalypse. You start of with simple tutorial mission that introduces the basics of the game to you. After that...you're on your own.It's all about survival, gathering supplies, building outposts...all for your small community. What do I mean by small community? Well...if you think you'll be like f-ing rambo and go all out solo in this game you're wrong!The stamina is drained quickly and it doesn't replenish for quite some time if you're playing with one character for a long time, so you're kinda forced to play with more different characters. Mainly you can play with only one character and have some help in form of switching to other community members, while your main charaters' health or stamina is regenerating (unless you died :P ) . This is game is, like any other RPG games based on getting lots and lots of quest/mission/assigments (whatever you wanna call it). So you shouldn't be suprised if you get loads and loads missions trown at you wich will lead you running around (more or less) the whole map. And yeah, before you ask...it does get repetitive after a while!The combat system is really diverse...From fighting, slashing, whacking, shooting, drive thru-ing,...you name it, you got it! You get your adrenaline pumping when melee weapons gets destroyed , the guns gets jammed, the cars get wrecked and will explode after too much of ""abuse"" from all the zombie killing.I would defintly recommend this game for players who're seeking a lone wolf survival zombie game. Yeah it does have flaws and some bugs/glitches, but it is enjoyable experience. Also, the missing of CO-OP mode (wich this game should definitly have in my opinion) are the only 2 major things that can make you change your mind from purchase.The game's got 2 DLC's so far(Breakdown and Lifetime), wich can prolong your playing of this game.At the end of this review i would like to give a shoutout to Michael Jones from Rooster Teeth/Let's play youtube channel who made couple of let's play videos of this game that made up my mind about buying this game. Also a big shoutout to anybody rating this reviewP.S. :don't even bother to post insulting comments, cause I'm gonna ignore them :D			"

												For once a nice, realistic zombie survival game, where you don´t chase mad scientists, secret organizations or evil geniuses as some kind of super agent or something. You play as a community that needs food, medicine, guns, doctors, builders, fighters and more to survive in a place of your choice (which you can change at anytime, why not move into that old warehouse? it has nice strategic position. move up!). It can become slightly monotonic, but not quite like the 1st AC, because there are always some new quests, world events or things to strive for. Highly recommended.			"

												It is what it is: an open world action game with zombies.  There isn't much of a story to speak of, and the characters are roughly the same.  Some may have different skills or traits, but it is only a slight variation that doesn't change a whole lot.  You can get the character you start with killed, and the game will continue on with you playing someone else.  In that plus the base building and scavenging, it tries to be a somewhat realistic apocalypse survival type game.  It does so decently albeit with an arcade feel.It's the standard open world in which you can go where ever and do what ever with missions thrown in as well.  Missions are divided up into story missions and missions to help survivors in your group that got in trouble (basically when you don't control them there is a chance they go outside your base to do whatever).  Then you also have to scavenge for items and equipment to make sure your base can survive.  You are, relatively, freely able to switch between all the survivors in your group (some excepts to this though).			"

												Generally enjoyable although somewhat repetitive. Night time lasts too long and is just way too dark - like frustratingly dark (not atmospheric, you just can't see what you are doing). Has some nice touches like player deaths (if  you die you can become another survivor in your camp), caring for cars (they aren't endless). Environment is big, but most of it wasted in just driving around. Car physics is average. Searching for stuff is tedious. Combat is pretty  clunky. No crafting of weapons. Storyline predicatble but ok. All that said, it kept me going and was worth the price paid in the sale.			"

You have the requirements to build your home that aren't quite realistic but they are to an amusing level.  The game makes you constantly with you could stay out to get more, or come home and switch characters.  You can add more people to your community through gaining their trust or helping them to your home.  The fighting is done well, frantic to not let them grab you, which is perfect.  A loose open rpg story lets you roam around and build up your home until you've exhausted the map's supplies.  The game is good, let's just leave it at that.			"

												Core game - Good as long as devs don't break something with each patch. Breakdown DLC - Ok, poor execution of added features like the motorhome.Lifeline- This DLC plays like a game still in beta phase and the main reason for the negative review. The devs did not test this DLC very well before releasing it,Lifeline DLC issuesBroken missions - First mission spawns zeds in inaccessible area that needed to be cleared, unable to complete since it was armored zeds that could not be reached and had to fail it.Zombies(zeds) respawn on top of you in a bunch, moments after clearing an area. (Destroys any realism). Far worse than anything you'd see in the core game.Zombies(zeds) walk/run through windowless walls to attack. They previously got stuck on doors in the core game. Now the code the devs used to fix that allows Zombies to run through windowless walls without issue to reach you. Not constant but regularly happens and looks sloppy for a DLC release.On certain mssions in lifeline, your car will drive through zeds like you were a ghost(phasing trhough all ofthem for an extended period of time), not killing them. You have to drive away from them and come back for the code/AI to figure out you're driving a car into the zeds to kill them. I did not see this in the core game.Cars in lifeline now roll over quite easily in slow motion on the slightest bump when compared to the core game.In a lifeline seige a soldier kept hitting the same prone zombie(zed) over and over again with his shovel, never killing it and this went on for 5 minutes. I had to go over to him and kill it myself with one hit to bring in the next wave.There's the Illusion of exploring a city when actually you are only exploring highway off ramps and the few buildings near them. Very linear and claustrophobic compared to the core game. The core game takes place in a small town, but the town is very large and is fun to explore.Lifeline forces you to repetitively stay on a cluttered narrow highway with off ramps as your ""minimal"" access to a destroyed city. Inaccessible areas are common place in lifeline and frustrate to no end.And the last thing in lifeline to takes the reaslism and fun away. ""Danger"" zones that are filled with an endless supply of zombies that can not be stopped. You can not clear these danger zones no matter how much artillery you use on them. The devs even put one of these ""danger"" zones right next to the poorly setup base that you have to constantly defend. It appears the devs wanted to make lifeline more challenging for the player, but to do that they had to throw realism out the window that would be seen in a zombie survival situation/experience and put the player in ludicrous situations they would not allow themselves to be in.I suggest only getting the core game if you like zombie survival. Stay far away from lifeline, you've been warned.			"

												While you can certainly tell that this game was rushed out or lacked funding or had some other issue in its implementation and polish stages, that does not stop it from being probably the best zombie game on the market. It really is about managing your survivor group and your base and staying alive, and due to the leveling system you grow to care about certain characters. It is a shame interacting with other NPCs is so basic and that there are not a very large amount of random events (they end up getting recycled fairly fast) because the way that events take place in the world mostly seamlessly is impressive. There are certainly some bugs with the AI, and it's not very smart to begin with. Despite these few drawbacks I have mentioned, the sheer massive amount of ambition in the features the game has to offer more than makes up for it's failings. If you are interested in sandbox games or survival games, this is probably your best bet.			"

The amount of loot, events, and objectives are -almost- over the top, so there's plenty enough to keep you busy. Sometimes other survivors may get too needy or problematic in your camp, however, this problem can be solved by giving them the boot out of your camp, OR, partaking in missions to ease their troubled minds, if you've got the patience for it! All in all, absolutely solid game that focuses on survival, which I wish more games like DayZ would revert back to.			"

State of Decay: So Much Done RightI just completed State of Decay (not yet any of the DLC) and this will be my review of the game. In a sentance, this game is great one. I played it compulsively once I picked it up and finished it in two (2.1 if you want to nitpick) sittings. If you were to take Grand Theft Auto San Andreas (for the RPG and open world elements), Red Dead Redemption (for the zombies and some of the scenery) and just about every good idea all other zombie games have ever had, State of Decay is close to what you might end up with.State of Decay does so much right that even what it does wrong comes accross as just simple disagreements between what I might like and what the devs did instead. For instance, I kept wanting to build the ultimate refuge, but this was not to happen. Instead after my second relocation, when I had found what I thought might be the penultimate locale it was instead just a small upgrade if that and of course I lost all of the work I had done on my second (and first) bases. This game was not about perfect refuge amongst the chaos it was about surviving and getting out while you still can. The game in its presentation delivered this sense of urgency and chaos and the story supported and expanded upon this through to the very end.			"

												It's a third-person shooter, sandbox, zombie survival game with roguelike and RPG elements. Stats and abilities level up from use, in a sensical way, and characters who die stay dead; you have to pick another survivor to play as if you die. Cars and supplies also stay permanently destroyed/scavenged. It's an interesting game, but I'll break it down quick:If you wanted a zombie survival game thats simply a sandbox where you try to survive and occasionally help others out and have little stories here and there, this is perfect. Don't expect a good story or characters though. They're flat as boards, as they're mostly randomly generated. Writing is okay I spose, few good chuckles and references as well as in the world. There's also not much of an ending. Felt dry. Gameplay wis it isnt bad though, fun to kill zombies, to scavenge, and play with the mechanics. A few missed opptunities for more expansive base-building, but still a nice leap from most 'strictly-shooter' zombie games. Still recommended to try out.			"

												Fun but get's very repetitive really fast. Better that you just do the story mode and get it over with. Because once you've completed the first couple of random missions, you will begin to see an obvious bland pattern. State of Decay is probably one of the best ""survival"" games I have played but shows just exactly why this genre won't ever really catch on. That said, State of Decay is pretty and I feel it is worth the money but I would advise you to save your money on the DLC. 3/5 for this game.			"

												It's fun for a while, but begins getting repetitive.The story is fairly uninteresting (of what little there is) and the characters are pretty void of actual character. Running over zombies and shooting them with a sniper is, and always will be a blast, which is ideally the only reason I found this game enjoyable.Scavanging and looking for supplies to upgrade your base is also kind of cool, but while doing this you're often forced to go do something to make sure your incompetent fellow survivors don't get killed.All in all, it's good. I liked it, and I'll reccomend it. Most of the game is pretty well done, and if zombies are you kind of thing then go for it, but if you're on the fence maybe look at some gameplay before making the decision. Oh, and obligatory complaint about it not having multiplayer. The game is begging for it, but the developers have clearly stated their disinterest in adding multiplayer to the game.			"

												A nice, relaxing zombie survival game compared to other unforgiving games like Day Z. Sometimes you want to go out for a stroll with your fellow survivors in the single-player game without real player looters popping in on your fun and busting a cap, leaving you for the dead to feed on. In this game, you can bash a few zombie heads into the ground and explore, bring a little something, something back, make everybody happy. If you happen to  die, there is always another survivor waiting back at camp to take out . The DLC looks pretty interesting, can't wait for it to come out just to see how long I can outlast a zombie apocalypse.			"

												One of the better Zombie games I have played in awhile! Everything from the combat system to having to avoid large groups instead of trying to be a tank is what a post apocalyptic zombie survival is about. The game has cars loads of different items from wrenches to even kantas (one of my faves). there is skill progression so as you combat the zeds, your characters level up skill to help with running, combat, stamina, etc. The only thing that sucks is making sure to balance out characters because perma-death is a real thing in this game. build in character too much and rest will suffer when trying to scavange on their own and such. Overall, best game to simulate a survival zombie apocalypse!			"

												Really good game of basebuilding, survival, zombie bashing, adventure, horror and an ok story, despite being a bit buggy (NPCs getting stuck that sort of thing). With the DLC it gets even better because you never know what you will get. Well worth the cost. Want a zombiegame this is the one to get. Though I wish basebuilding was better (a bit too simplistic now) and that there would be more room to build stuff, there's still free space in the bases not used which is a bit sad, also that the razorwire would stop the zombies.

												I personally really enjoyed this game. The game has some bugs and glitches here and there but from my experience ive had nothing game-breaking. If you are to get the game just to kill zombies and just explore I recomend getting the Breakdown DLC. I spent most of my time on that. The story is alright but nothing too great. A small list of some pros and cons.Pro- Some what classic zombie, they run but can only be killed by damaging the brain.Pro- Great mechanics such as building up a base with survivors and gear to survive the hordes, a rouge like system that has you play as multiable characters but if he/she dies you can no longer play as him/her, cars will never respawn after you destroy them. Pro. Different types of zombie found all over the map.Pro- A large map that has many places to settle in and explore.Pro- Many different types of weapons from melee to guns.Con- Zombies will glitch that causes them to not load in correctly so its just their head and arms.Con- (personal con) I dislike the survivor walking animation. Con- Survivor AI can glitch causes them to just stand still and die. Con- Sadly no co-op or multiplayer. I deeply wish they added that in. State of Decay is a pretty fun game, when your done with the base game you can always get the Breakdown DLC that makes the game harder and it ends when you die or the Lifeline DLC that ands a new map and a new story. :D			"

												I heard of this game in a Cracked article a few weeks ago, downloaded it immediately and it blew me away. It's basically exactly what I've wanted out of a video game; the Breakdown DLC in particular. It's a hopeless struggle in which the only destination is failure and death. But it still makes you want to struggle and fight and survive as long as you possibly can. The campaign is a bit crap, but Breakdown more than makes up for it. Highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't shy away from a challenge.			"

												Would have given this game a decent review, but not after the devs ripped off it's customers by turning what should have been an update into the 'year one edition'...essentially the same game again but with new textures and a $22 dollar asking price.The original game has now been abandoned in favour of the Year one edition, which isn;t much better it seems. If you'd rather buy that then feel free, but be aware it'll likely be abandoned too when they repackage the same game again and call it the Year 2 edition, for a whole new asking price.Instead of remastering, they should have made a sequel, with co-op like we all want. Clearly that is beyond the developers who can only keep replacing the textures on their dated graphics engine.Do not reward this dodgy practice. Do not buy.			"

You can upgrade your bases and play as many different characters adding variety to the game.  Learning how to stealth is pretty critical, bushes are your friend.  So poor optimization, some bugs and a lack of co op are the negatives.  I do not understand why this game does not have co op.  However if you can move past these negatives State of Decay is a pretty decent game.I would give this 7.5/10			"

You can follow the storylines or go completely sandbox.

												Truly one of the best value for money games I have ever bought. If you want to go on a zombie killing spree, you'll actually have to plan escape routes, bring supplies and be very mindful of what's going on around you, because if you go ahead and facetank the horde, you're gonna get murdered pretty quick!It incorporates what I don't see enough of in general zombie survival games, the SURVIVAL factor. You need to gather and store supplies in order to keep everything running correctly. Strength is in numbers, but the more people you recruit, the more supplies you have to dish out to everyone. If you don't meet your daily quota of supplies, then your camp can fall ill, or your defences can be weakened, etc. However, supplies are not in such a high demand that you'll find it a chore to go and find them, they balanced the feature very well.All in all, this is one of the most perfect zombie games that I've ever seen, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who's up for a survival game, and not just a mindless hack & slash.

												This game has to be one of the best zombie games I've played. First off you have a free roam open world to go and do as you please. All locations are accessible, you can enter any building and have a rumage around for supplies. it's third person so none of that confusing twirling around trying to see who's sneaking up on you. throw into this vehicles and you can do what we've all dreamed of, hurtle into a hoard of zeds in a car and play zombie skittles. Such a satisfying past time. There is a lot to explore though it can become repetative once you've clocked up a good many hours though!  They've added the safe zones upgrades too which means you can add workshops and gyms and such like to your safe zones allowing you to fix weapons or vehicles and gain extra stamina. The characters are all playable once you've gained their trust and can be levelled up, but bear in mind once they die that is it they are gone, run out of survivors that you've befriended and it's game over.  Yes I love this game, hope they can continue to bring out more DLC.			"

												So, all these zombie survival games coming out recently, I wanted to play SoD again.And I have to say, this is one of the greatest games I have played and I played A LOT of games.State of Decay is a open world zombie survival game with a basic plot.You have a party of people that you can add people to or people from it can die which is pretty nice.At the beginning, there are some mandatory missions to discover the whole world but then, the game really opens up.You can control any party members and there is this ""trust"" mechanic.If you bring resources into the HQ, you gain points that you can then use to get items from the base and interact with people.Game world is pretty large and nearly every building can be entered one way or another.One of the best mechanics that are included in this game is, changing bases.You have a single home base and some little safe zones that you can create by clearing the zombies in it.Changing bases is really neat, you can relocate to gain tactical advantage or get closer to an area that you would like to invest more time in.The bases are upgradeable with a lot of stuff.Weapons are what you would expect from a zombie game;mostly melee with a few firearms and explosives.Melee combat is pretty satisfying to say the least.Animations are done well though they can bug out sometimes.There are finishers and stealth kills included.By the way, there is a stealth mechanic and it works decently;it's not really deep but it serves it purpose fully.There are drivable vehicles around the area and they control okay, pretty good for taking out hordes.Mentioning hordes, there are special zombies around, basically L4D specials.Kinda hard to kill but provides some diversity so it's okNow for my most hated point of the game;the performance.Since this was a XBL Arcade game before it was ported over to PC, it drops FPS sometimes, like when you are running through a horde.I have a really good gaming pc, so it's minimized but it can cause some problems on lower rigs.Overall, it's gonna be a 8/10, 2 points gone for the performance and sometimes repetitive side missions.

												Great game, while I shouldn't really compare this to a game like DayZ, it introduces many zombie survival mechanics that DayZ didnt. for starters the game has a simple but good combat system, LMB to melee, RMB to aim gun and RMB + LMB to fire, there is no need to go into your inventory to de-equip a melee weapon to equip a gun as both can be used at the same time. You can also perform finishing moves with Z and dodge zombie attacks with C. The game also takes a page from L4D and has unique zombies like juggernauts who are huge zombies that can deal a lot of damage and take it at the same time, you also have screamers which attract zombies and riot zombies which are like normal zeds except that are immune to gunfire requiring melee attacks. You are required to lead the group and can make important calls like setting up multiple outposts and improving and moving homes. You have to be very careful in this game and plan out things such as routes and manouvering around zombie hordes and special zeds, one wrong move and you can have your car tipped upside down about to explode with all of your rucksacks of ammo, medicine etc. inside or even have a whole horde chasing you while you have no ammo. Not much to complain right? Well no this game isnt perfect. The game is very repetive and can get boring when you are required to do the same mission in usually the same area over and over, however this hole can be filled with the other 2 DLC that you can download and the game still has loads of replay value. Also, I found that the characters were also boring as some even had the same voices and dialogue which is a shame as they could be more unique. This is still a great game that doesnt get the praise it deserves and if we could see a State Of Decay 2 with more improvements, then you will definitely see that on my wishlist. I am currently playing this game and would recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap, singleplayer experience.Review 2:This game has only got better as I have played on. This game definetely makes zombies a huge threat unlike Day Z (sorry, I had to :0 ) and makes noise in the game have huge consequences. When you are searching containers you could make a loud noise, this causes a huge amount of zombies to swarm to your position; this is made worse by nearby hordes. I got cornered in a storage shed by 10-15 zeds because I reckless and tried to get everything quickly. My strongest character (Marcus) who has max shooting, melee and blunt weapons skills (backed up by a wrench and ak47 custom silenced) almost died from this and was seriously injured as the zeds kept attacking. This meant I couldn't take any out with my AK or wrench and had to find an small opening which was 1 door with 5% of Marcus's health remaining. This is true zombie apocalyspe survival, leaving you with near death experiences and adrenaline pumping. also, choices you make with survivors at the grange has huge consequences as Becca (sorry spoilers) died as I told Quinten she was a, oh how could I say this in the review?, an 'escort'. I now make sure I use quiet or silenced weapons as more powerful guns like the AK47 and River Snake generate a lot of noise (check the wiki for more details). Because of the noise made by the River Snake revolver, one of my group members died as zombies began to swarm us on a normal anger mangement mission. Play this game like you would with Day Z, with extreme caution and planning, as one wrong move can get you or your group members killed.Review 3: I am drawing near to the end of the game. I have actually got my chef killed at the hands of a feral which ripped him in half like a chocolate bar; now I am not sure if I want that achievment on my steam profile. I managed to build up an arsenal of weapons, which include 100+ melee weapons and 50+ guns (which include a few Automatic rifles and 2 50 Calibre rifles). fighting zombies is no easier with these guns as the ammo for my 50 cal guns are so rare that I only managed to collect 30+ rounds, this is further worsened by the guns stumbling recoil and extreme weight that can encumber a non powerhouse character. Since I am near the end I may as well just give you some tips for surviving the zombie apocalyse of State Of Decay. 1. When setting up a new home, always make sure you prioritise building a workshop and infirmary (and if possible a medical lab if you can get a library). This is because if you get injured or sick group members you can heal them back up to good health quickly, meaning they can hone their skills and do scavenging runs for you; having a workshop means you can repair your veichles which are very limited in this game aswell as make very important homemade supressors which benefit all of your characters. 2. Dont use inexperienced characters for tougher jobs. this is how my chef got killed. I sent him out to help an ally deal with a few zeds attacking her and what happens when I complete it? A feral an armoured zombies come after me and since ferals are the strongest and worst zed to face in the game, I was screwed with my 22. pistol and pipe wrench. The moral of the story is train you charcters, but always have an ally with you incase the freaks come knocking.3. USE STEALTH!!! Now yes stealth can be slow especially when scavenging, but it pays off as you will deal with less zeds and you will be less likely to get injured or killed. If there are zeds closing in on you while you are searching a container, then search it quicker and risk making noise as you will already have zombies trying to get through the doors and windows. If a horde spots you then either run away and find a car to escape or ram the horde, you could even (if you have the weapons and ammo) engage and destroy the horde so long as it doesnt attract more attention.

												While this game offers a unique survival simulator, it is terribly hampered with several deep flaws that detract from the overall quality of the game:1: No actual save option. You only get a single autosave per campaign that will often trigger at awkward moments when you didn't want it to save. What's that, you spent many hours trying to get a character to elite status and you make one mistake and blunder into a feral zombie? Too bad, your character is now dead, FOREVER. You cannot make a mistake, not a single mistake, and this would not be so bad if the poorly programmed AI didn't take control of the characters you are not currently controlling (basically all but one), but it does, so sometimes it's not even your pleasure to make that mistake.2: Idiotic AI. This includes things like: Not helping out in a melee fight for survival, running straight into zombie hordes when sent on a scavenging pickup mission, or even not defending the base when a zombie night raid summons. 		3. Emotionally immature characters. While your out and about kicking zombie♥♥♥♥♥and gathering precious supplies for your home base, the characters at base will become discontent very quickly and easily, and the only way to prevent them from draining the moral of the base is to take them out on little suicidal raids on zombie infestations. If it was just a quick conversation in home base it would not be an issue, but you have to go out of your way to some randomly selected zombie place and fight side by side with them in order to cheer them up. But of course right after you complete that mission you might have to do it again, for the SAME character, just half a day cycle later. I thought this was a zombie survival game, and not Dr. Phil with a shotgun?4. Broken hit-boxes and glitched zombies. If there was one resource that was perhaps the most precious in this game it would be ammo, and there just happens to be a horrible glitch that drains this precious resource: Sometimes when new zombies spawn at a location they are out of phase with the game, thus when you shoot rounds at their head the bullets go straight through and do nothing. Sometimes you will have to run around in circles to wait for them to engage you and then you can actually hit them with a weapon.  5. Skewed third-person shooting. While it is perfectly normal for third person shooters to have the camera just above the right shoulder when looking down the sights of a gun, this game has that same effect exaggerated to a unbelievable extent. Instead of it being just over the shoulder, the camera rests several feet away from the shoulder, as if it were the perspective of a drill instructor. Unfortunately, the invisible drill instructor cannot help you aim better as the mouse sensitivity and aim axis is wobbly and frustrating to master. I can understand the aiming to get wobbly if the character was fatigued, but to have it this inaccurate as a default just screams troll intent from the game developers.6. Your outposts are only somewhat effective. While it is advertised in game that establishing an outpost at a location will stop zombies from spawning in the area, this is a lie. Even after having several overlapping outposts in a given area, you might still have zombies spawn on the main thoroughfares. While outposts do indeed reduce the amount of zombie spawns, the effectiveness of outposts is one of degree and not definition. Overall I would say this game is too plagued with glitches and suffers from poor execution of brilliant game concepts. While the auto-save only function can be argued to be an effort by the developer to make the game seem more hardcore, the fact that you are FORCED into the auto-save-only system takes away the freedom of the gamer and thus the ability of the gamer to fully enjoy the game. What they should have done is offer a choice between a regular mode (that has normal save and load functions) and then a hardcore mode that would be autosave only (for those with the patience to wade through trolled frustration).  		This game has crippled my appetite for zombie survival games, and I now regret even purchasing this game on sale for ten dollars.  "

												I waited until the early access phase had ended and until the game was in full release. I have to say; this is by far the most polished and refined zombie survival sandbox experience I've ever had. The only limitations I belive it had was its budget; things such as amazing graphics -not that they're bad -I'm just used to high end AAA titles which boast amazing visuals. Knowing that the budget wasn't massive; Undead labs have reached for something quite ambitious. Have they pulled it off? I belive they have. This game is immersive and has enough variety between missions and sidemissions for it not to feel like a 'grinding' or 'mechanical' use of your time but an meaningful and deeply engaging experience.The great thing about it is you get the hoard fighting feel of L4D2 without the sense that you're just passing through but actually warding off hoards to defend yourself or your home. And when people die -espcially characters you put a good deal of time into; well it's meaningful; not in a tear to the eye way the Walking Dead boasts but in a way which means something to you because you played through the experience of the game, trained that character, equpped them, knew their skills and hobbies, had seen them interact with others and that's why it sucks when they die -not just because the narrative told you it was sad but because of the time you invested in that character. Thankfully the permadeath system does not halt your gaming experience but reverts you to alternate characters within your home base. Every decision you make and even to an extent, the WAY you carry out that decision (eg: reckless driving, putting things off too long or even friendly fire) can really make a difference to how the characters in the game react to you and the situation. Ammo is fairly rare and weapons arn't that common themselves, so you have to really mean it when you choose to draw your weapon instead of using melee combat -which makes the guns feel so much more desirable and your persona far more secure when you use them. Thankfully they're not too rare so if you miss a shot or decide to shoot a zombie that you'll fell bad.It isn't a complete sandbox like DayZ, there are missions and randomly generated side missions which keep coming so while you're free to prioritize hunting ammo or supplies you'll never have a sense of aimlessness.There is an element of stratergy invovled with SOD when it comes to upgrading and deligating resources for differrent things; do you want to prioritize defences around the perimiter of your homebase? Or is putting resources into a family dining arrangement to avoid discord within the walls of your base more important to you? There are many other decisions you can make with the investment of your resources which will directly impact on the readiness of your characters, weapons and vehicles when they are called upon.It's a pretty slow start and will initially require some more patience than the opening segments of most games but by the time you're 2 hours in you won't want to stop playing. It's managed to even pull me away from the latest release in my favourite game frachise ever within a month of it's release -the game I built this high end machine to play. And yet I find myself perfectly content lobbing off zombie's heads, or jumping in a car and running over zombies hordes at a time.SOD is an immersive, meaningful and addictive gaming experience which gives back so much more than what you pay for it by the gaming industry's standards today. Having said that I'm the kind of gamer who will persevere with what others consider to be punishing and sometimes repetitive games which demand persistence and patience such as Metro 2033, Far Cry 2 and the original Assasin's Creed. All things considered (including the liklely budget for the developers) I can not fault State of Decay. Personally; I'd give it a 10/10.			"

												It is a fun game. It has some strategy and much action. No rewards for killing zombies other than the leaderboards or maybe making it slightly safer for people in the community, but no direct gain. The game play is interesting and fairly gripping.

												I had my doubts about State of Decay, suspecting yet another shark hunting the blood of Day Z fans.  I was wrong, and I am very happy to be wrong.  I enjoy this.  It's a fair bit strategic, and a fair bit luck based.  It's all built around survival, maintaining and upgrading a base and outposts, as well as recruiting survivors to your group and keeping them happy.  Oh, and there's zombies too, and they're♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  This game is punishing, even on the easiest difficulty.  Sometimes it's downright unfair, BUT you can learn from your mistakes, learn the game, and get better.  My #1 gripe here is that there's no coop, and I hear a sequel with coop is already in the works, so we'll see.  Great buy for me.			"

												Open world, third person survival zombie game with choice based missions.- Has a story and a plot, that goes like most good zombie series.- Day/night cycle. Zombies become more aggressive at night.- Kill, explore, gain allies, gather ressources and build bases/outposts.- Switch between characters. Life, stamina and injuries are essential factors.- Skill system for each character making them good at different tasks.- Use cars to drive around the map and slaughter zombies.- A lot of different weapons including swords, machetes, snipers, shotguns, assault rifles, grenade launchers etc.In generel good/bad:- A lot to explore. The gameplay is addictive and fun.- Graphics are ok and sounds are good. - Controls not the best, but can be played. Cars are stiff in handling. (console port).- It has no MP, but does not need it, as the SP is satisfying long enough, to keep you going.Similar game(s): - It reminds me a bit of Dead Island, which I played on the PS3. That game went more fluid for me than this one.However Dead Island is much more linear than State of Decay. Also Dead Island is easier than State of Decay.Score: 9/10.			"

												This game is completely amazing! Nothing more satisfying than hearing the music ramp up as I knee zombies in the face, splattering beautiful guts all over the place with a marvelous crush sound. The sounds and animations are completely gorgeous and well done, using a sword and slicing through zombies feels sooooooooooo damn good!The game takes good things from all sorts of genres, it has great elements of role playing, strategy, action, survival, shooters and even stealth sims. The game has great replayabilty and is highly addictive, warning!There are definitely things that could be improved. Some missions and when or where they pop up are really annoying. losing characters is very sad (kind of a good thing maybe), carrying rucksacks gets very old, NPCs on scavenger missions just stand there even with zombies around. Overall though, I might complain, but the game is so completely awesome, it's so good that any problem feels meaningless.GREAT GAME.			"

												It's a decent game, but I'm still giving this one as well as the Breakdown DLC a thumbs down.The game starts out quite promising, but turns out to be repetitive and boring as soon as you've established a decent home base. The zombie sandbox seems vast at first, but excitement fades when you realize that the houses are pretty much the same everywhere. There aren't that many interesting items or people to find. And even though Breakdown seemingly adds more challenge to the game, things get pretty easy as soon as you've established a home base and started upgrading your characters. Your neighbors are super needy, you constantly need new equipment for your home base and there's always some shmuck that has to be saved or a zombie horde that has to be mowed down. In the end you just drive repetitively from one waypoint to another until you've helped everyone with their needy needs and the game is over.At worst the zombies are mildly annoying. The fight system doesn't offer much immersion. You just keep clicking and ""smash spacebar not to die"". The game would have benefited from a more hands on fight system like they had in Condemned.State of Decay had some redeeming qualities, mainly the way you're able to earn people's trust and create a community of survivors. The scripted events breathe life into the characters who are actually able to do some useful stuff on their own while you're completing missions. And if they die you can't bring them back. The graphics are pretty okay and there's a satisfying POK sound when your baseball bat hits an armored zombie's helmet.The game is very ambitious, and while it doesn't suck horribly, I still feel it falls short.

												I really like how this game focuses on survival and fighting off zombies. Once you build a community you have to go out and gather ressources to survive, and don't be careless out there because you will get overrun and killed. The fighting system is really simple and fun wether you choose to go melee or use guns. The zombies animations and movements are nice and fluid and thier artificial intelligence is simple and well done. They react to sound and light and will run to you if you make too much noise. You can still sneak around them, especially in the dark and score a few stealth melee kills wich is always nice. I also like how you can choose to build your community by finding more survivor, controlling certain characters to level them up and get them to learn new abilities and be stronger. You have quite a big map to explore as well, a lot of scavenging to do. You have to be carefull to keep the zombie population in check around your home base so it doesn't get overrun. The gameplay is really fun and well done. And of course, among all of that, you have a nice little quest story line that gets you to learn about what  happened and what caused all this. Although not everything is answered at the end of the game it opens the door for a nice sequel or expansion. I give this game a 9 out of 10 because the only downside is that you cannot bring your friends to play with you in co-op... how awesome would it have been.			"

												For the price, this is a fantastic game. Although 28 hours in, I still haven't beaten it yet, I feel like I've put enough time in to give it a fair review. This game combines base building and team management mechanics like X-Com, with open world driving and shooting like Saints Row or GTA. Each survivor in your team has his/her own skills, gear, and traits, and once you've made friends with them, they can be played. There are also perks you can unlock as you go through the game, like vehicle delivery, calling for backup, etc.As you go through the game, you discover vantage points that let you reveal points of interest like places to scavenge, other survivors and their enclaves, potential new base locations, and zombie hordes or special zombies.There are a few minor pathfinding glitches here and there, with characters getting clogged up in doorways or spawning in odd places, but none of them are game breaking. The game also features permadeath with auto-save, so you find yourself trying to be extra careful not taking unnecessary risks and protecting your survivors. Sometimes they get sick, or can get defeated when they're out and about. For this reason, it pays to switch characters often and keep each member leveled and geared. Focus on one, and you might lose them to a freak accident, get overwhelmed, or they might get sick and die. There are also morale issues that come up if you neglect one of your survivors. Play as them and do a few good deeds and they'll be back in fighting form. Survivors can also be specialized, unlocking special moves when using certain types of weapons, or various bonuses.The game isn't too terribly difficult if you're careful, don't take too many risks, and always keep ammo and consumables on hand. There are no difficulty options, but the Breakdown DLC allows you to replay the game at progressively higher difficulties (fewer resources, more/tougher zombies, etc.).I'm pretty hooked on this game. It has interesting mechanics and a mix of gameplay elements that seem to hit all the right notes for me. There are a few things that keep me from giving it a perfect 10: Lack of character creation or customization (wardrobe, hair, face, skills, etc.), no relationships (romance options, friendships between survivors), and you're limited to one map. Now, the map is pretty big, and resources, events, and the location of some of the NPC's are different on each playthrough. The keyboard/mouse controls are excellent, and for everything except driving, seem to work better than a gamepad. The interface is a little clunky though, and it's not always obvious how to build certain types of skills like cooking, medicine, or even what certain skills do. A bit more feedback or explanation would be helpful. The lack of co-op multiplayer is also noticable. You can take survivors with you as you run around, but they fatigue quickly, they don't gain XP or morale, and they ditch you as soon as you start a mission. Overall I'd have to give this one a solid 8/10. If you're a fan of open world games with base building and team maangement, you can't go wrong with this one. It's a blast!			"

												Interesting concept of an open world where you play as a community of survivors in a zombie apocalypse and you have scavenge resources from a small town in order to survive.  Fun melee mechanics, the shooting mechanics feel alittle awkward, in any case, using firearms is limited due to ammo and the noise. Awkward indoor camera angles make it tricky to enter a building. Main story plot is short and easily played if you are not distracted with exploring the town in your first playthrough. Various playable characters that has some depth and different skillsets. Decent graphics with good lighting, especially with a day/night cycle in game. DLC tries to introduce a game world without story plot and challenges the player to survive as long as possible. But having only one map kills much of the replayability and the exploration factor of the DLC.			"

												Where to start? This game is everything you could want in a zombie survival game. You have to constantly hunt for ammunition , food, medicine, and other things. You have to be careful and use your wits, overconfidence can be deadly in this game. An urge to rush through and take chances will likely get your character killed. One of the most addictive zombie games I have ever played, I simply can't put it down.			"

												This game is fairly straight forward, you switch between a number of survivors in the zombie apocalypse where you must seek out resources and fight off zombies to preserve and expand your base. Your resources dwindle day by day and you must be strategic in prioritizing which resources you pursue. This game excels because of its simplicity but that simplicity unfortunately leads to the game becoming repetative later on with no clear goals and no further progression. The underlying mechanics of the game remind me of mobile games but with much stronger graphics and interface. The game feels repetitive once you have an established base and full group of survivors, which can happen pretty quickly if you want it to. At this point you're really just playing to keep the game going because while there is a story mode there is no clear objective besides just surviving. The game would really benefit from a more comprehensive base building element or something that maybe gives you a sense of rebuilding society or fighting back a gainst the zombies in a meaningful way, but then I guess it deviate from the norms of the zombie-sirvival genre. Zombies just keep spawning and after a point you'll feel like you've killed more zombies than the population of the little country towns of the setting. Combat leans more in favor of melee as noises will draw the hordes. I like the combat mechanics that give you the right level of contectual animation, when you swing at a hoard of zombies the way you swing takes into consideration how you're moving and how the zombies are moving around you. Driving takes a little getting used to but reminds me of how the driving feels in the GTA games. Vehicles are as much a resources as ammunition, food, medical, and building supplies with a finite number of them that dwindle as you wreck them. People are also as much a resource that you must weigh whether to allow them into your group and if and when you prioritize aid over your own resource gathering.I bought the game for $7 and its worth a bit more than that, but not too much.

												I absolutely love this game. Despite what it might lack as compared to Day Z, or 7 Days To Die, ect. ,and the lack of multiplayer/co-op modes, its still an awesome game. I have spent quite of bit of hours playing it, mainly the Breakdown DLC *aka sandbox mode*, yet I never get tired of it. Even when i'm not playing it, I find myself thinking about, ""what if i did this?"" or ""Maybe i should have started at this spot. "" A game that can make me consider so many things, and keep me constantly engaged is exactly what i expect for my money. Replay ability, open world, guns, cars, variety of things to do, obstacles to over come, as well as a good story line! How can you not like this game??  Seriously?? I highly recommend it and its DLCs!!			"

												I held off reviewing this game for a year because when I first bought it, State of Decay was so absolutely epic that I thought it was too good to be true. Well, one year later, after I've had time to process this game all I can say is this:This game is the greatest zombie apocalypse simulator ever made. I've never played a game that even comes close to the pure genius that is State of Decay (Sorry DayZ fans, but no contest here). While I admit the graphics in this game are a bit dated, there are a few annoying but minor glitches, and after many many hours of this game it can start to feel repetitive but everything else more than makes up for it. The controls are reminiscent of Resident Evil 4, the atmostphere is similar to that of The Walking Dead, and the ability to control an entire group of survivors trying to survive a zombie apocalypse is just the icing on the cake. If you don't already have this game do yourself a favor and BUY IT NOW (At the time of this review it is currently 75% off the base game and both DLC) I also recommend the Breakdown DLC if you're looking for more of a challenge and the Lifeline DLC for an entirely new story. Overall Review:+Brilliant Game Design+Amazing Atmosphere+Hours of Replayability-Slightly Dated Graphics/Minor Glitches9.5/10			"

												Do not take notice of the 1 hour playtime, I have worked my xbox to death playing this game. This review will focus on the gamplay and mechanics, story is not as important for this game. Lets start the review!When State of Decay first appeared on my Xbox 360 dashboard I thought of it as another cheap Zombie arcade game, I decided to download the demo and since that day, I have been hooked. This game throws you in the midst of zombie apocolypse and lets you know your only option to survive is to group up with other characters. You then go through the game saving (or leaving) survivors and inducting them into your community which you build up, choose what to build, where to build and what base will be yours. This game takes realism to the extreme, all characters that you can switch between have their own personalities that effect how they react in situations and how their mood is during their stay in your community. They also have their own skills, weaknesses and backstories that let you know what person you want over others and let you feel a connection with these characters. With so many different personalities staying under one roof in such a severe time, problems are bound to happen and sometimes you may need to help calm down a survivor or go take them out and have a chat, maybe someone is scared or upset and needs you to give them reassurance that everything will be alright and this level of realism for what actually would happen in this situation is amazing. One thing you must keep track of is supplies, having a large community may keep it safe from zombies but starvation and illness can hurt large groups. You will need to scavange and set runners to go collect these resources to reimburse the daily supply usage.The best thing about this game is the death, in State of Decay if somone dies, they die. Runners going to get supplies and get caught up by a horde? dead. Survivor is ill and there is no supplies? Dead AND infecting others. This really gives the incentive to stay aware of whats going on and doing your best to keep everyone alive, I let my guard down when I got near the end of the game and ended up with the games first character dead because I left him alone when he needed help. There is nothing more sad than having to go collect your dead friends bag.This game is a must have for any survival lover, 10/10!			"

But as I've always said gameplay>graphics and this is a good example of that. The story is good and the rpg scavaging for materials and base building while smashing zombies skulls in is good fun all around. Totally worth the $8 on sale.			"

I definently got my $26 worth of the game and the dlc, and hope to see more content and mods released for it. If $20 is a bit to heavy on the wallet, I would atleast wait to get it durring a steam sale..			"

												I played this game a lot more than I thought I would but I thought it would be more worth it. This game provides an illusion of depth and replayability. It had potential to be way more dynamic and varied but fell short in the aspects it wanted to show off most. It's still worth the amount it asks for and is fun for a short while. However it definitely isn't as replayable as it would like to boast as most of what you do will start to feel like the filler content it is.State of Decay is a game with a lot of depth to characters and an interesting take on surviving an apocalypse for the ""Long-Term"". In my eyes it is a game where the goals were about building a strong, large community to rebuild civilization. Most zombie games I have played focused on escaping a threat or surviving relatively short terms of time without safety. State of Decay answers some of the questions of what might happen after that.The Basics of the GameThe tutorial gets you through a typical zombie panic scenario so it can focus on the main aspects of the game. The game really places focus on settling down in a base and holding your ground which is somewhat conflicting with the large map. You will quickly find strength in numbers by teaming up with a community of survivors. The character you play as cannot protect themselves alone and you'll need to take shifts with other characters so that they can heal or sleep. With the community caring for each other you are able to thrive in the apocalypse by maintaining a good base. A good base is maintained and upgraded with obvious essentials like food, fuel, ammo, medicine, and building materials. You can get these essentials by scavenging or trading. By making a strong and safe community you'll gain attention from competing communities and even the military. The military has more power and resources than anyone so gaining their attention and trust allows you to escape and ends the game's story.Conflicts and Negative PointsI felt like this game had an unclear focus for player objectives. State of Decay places a lot of focus on both exploring a huge map and settling down in a single, small base. I will say that the map for this game is absolutely huge and I was initially very impressed with how much content it had. However, exploration is encouraged but it doesn't really provide any unique incentive to do so.No incentive to explore the huge mapYou could complete the entire game by staying in one base. The benefits from moving to a different base are not very noticeable and the places you can set a base at are very limited (I think 6 or so places). Getting the largest base possible is important to have more people and facilities but the benefits for having a large base is too small. Having a different base might let you have 13 people instead of 10 but having more than 8 people is probably more than enough to easily survive. Some bases allow more facilities but it doesn't really matter as long as you have a few basic ones. Packing up your base and moving is pretty much only dependant on finding a base that can hold as much people as possible and what scenery you like to look at.There are no areas that offer unique resources. Living in one area is pretty much just as resourceful as living anywhere else. There is no reason to go somewhere far to get something valuable making less of a reason to explore the huge map.Materials for scavenging are seemingly infinite. I thrived way too easily, I had too much food and medication than I could ever need just by staying around my base. You might scavenge the area around you dry but I never reached that point. Additionally resources are randomly generated so that might be impossible.Story and Missions are lackingAt the same time the game places focus on being story driven and infinite playability. Perhaps the only part of the game that actually encourages you to explore unvisited locations is the story. However the story is extremely short and will only show you a tiny percentage of the entire map. The story will easily skip large chunks of the map which shows how useless it was to actually make the map as large as it is. The impact of the story with the rest of the game world is minimal because it struggles with trying to be infinite with filler content.The events of the story don't matter to the world. The game uses cutscenes sometimes but doesn't give them any cinematic impact. The supposed ending of the game felt as important as tying my shoe. The lack of music made story events all the less unique from the rest of the game. It was very clear that none of the story mattered after the intro which is insanely deceiving when the first moments of the game are very heavy on letting the story drive the player. After that first tutorial ""chapter"" it quickly feels like nothing matters.The infinite playability is advertised because of the endless respawning of 10 kinds of very simple missions. It actually felt like the game placed less emphasis on the story as an excuse to say the story doesn't matter and you are meant to endlessly play the game. State of Decay says it's dynamic by randomly generating things like events, missions, resources, and characters which would be interesting if the randomizations had more variables. The random things in this game are basic templates. You will quickly find a character who has the same voice actor as someone standing right next to you. Most characters will literally say the exact same script as someone else. Every random mission plays out the same way. A rescue mission is always a ""rescue"" mission and nothing unique ever changes with a mission besides the location and people involved. These missions don't even really get harder as you progress through the game. In the end, the ""Dynamic"" events become annoying, unoriginal filler content way too fast.I mean you can pay extra to get the DLC which adds a gradual increase in difficulty and more variety but these seem like things that should have been in the game anyways. DLC shouldn't charge to fix a game's flaws or even worse, intentionally reduce a game's core aspects for a quick buck.			"

												state of decay delivers an amazing story driven survival experience in the vein of tv-show ""the walking dead"". i was very sceptical about it, i heard about this console port gta-like zombie survival single player game. to be honest, wasnt expecting much, because i normaly play and enjoy online games, like arma, dayz, the dead linger, infestation, rust, etc.... man, was i wrong. this game brings us survival dilemas at its best.goal is similar to gta games, explore huge open world maps, play side and main missions, plus you have big group to take care about (feelings, interactions) and your shelter. you need to provide for your group many things, like securing shelter from zombies, food, workshops, guard towers, sleeping space. sometimes it gets rough, so you can try play it hero style trying to keep everyone satisfied and fed and secure, or you can try ""governor"" style, getting rid of ""dead wood"" in the group :)also, you can swith main characters, if your current one is tired or hurt much, you can go to shelter and ask someone else to take over for a while... every character has its own skills, depending what and how many actions you performed with it.survival group realism is amazing, and no bull**** there. for example my main character (group leader) died trying to help other survivor in danger. he's gone forever now, dead as dodo. no respawning or any other funny business. group keeps on surviving. play on without him, with other characters. come back and grab usefull stuff from his dead corpse, keep gruop alive.i am really amazed by concept of this game. now i am so glad this is only sp game, it has it's own thing, without all pvp and kos thing like in every other game (and we have planty of those to play that way). just try to survive and provide for your group. 10/10 (graphics could be a bit better though, and more non-console-like)			"

												To date, this game is the best re-creation of the feel of the AMC series, ""The Walking Dead"".  This is one of the finest indie games I have played and better than a lot of stuff out of huge mega corps.This is a gather resource/build community/follow multithreaded adventure model.  You can follow the storylines or go completely sandbox.  Your interaction with the locals in the game can benefit you, but if you feel like going your own way, you can still have a blast with this game.If you are a zombie fan, you owe it to yourself to at least try this game.

												State of Decay has some rough edges. There are some unpolished elements, some AI and glitch and design issues that could use some work. But with that disclaimer out of the way, it is essentially a hugely ambitious game that actuall pulls off so much of its goals that it makes up for its own flaws.Sewing together so many gameplay elements isn't easy - there's combat, character development, base building, resource collection, resource management, territory control, missions, more missions, side missions, auto-generated missions, plot missions, and all sorts of things you can do that will eventually become a mission if you just happen to keep busy long enough that they become important. So what, some of these many elements kind of get lost in the shuffle. I realized that if I just did my own thing, I never had to worry about resources. In fact, the biggest complaint over the radio was that I was always out of stockpile space. So, I ignored resources. And that's kind of the biggest problem with the game as well as its greatest success - it packs so much gameplay in, you simply don't have the time or the consciousness to DO everything. So I finished it in 24 hours, and it felt way to soon... after struggling for that many hours to reach the end, you relized that thtere as still so much left to do. So many things left to build, so many homes to try out, so many infestations left to clear... and I was left, in the end, wanting more. Is it a perfect game? No. But its flaws are compensated, the acting is solid, the gameplay is balanced, and it all works together to keep you having fun. I'll be looking at the DLC very soon, because I WANT MORE State of Decay.			"

												It's a decent game, but I'm still giving this one as well as the Breakdown DLC a thumbs down.The game starts out quite promising, but turns out to be repetitive and boring as soon as you've established a decent home base. The zombie sandbox seems vast at first, but excitement fades when you realize that the houses are pretty much the same everywhere. There aren't that many interesting items or people to find. And even though Breakdown seemingly adds more challenge to the game, things get pretty easy as soon as you've established a home base and started upgrading your characters. Your neighbors are super needy, you constantly need new equipment for your home base and there's always some shmuck that has to be saved or a zombie horde that has to be mowed down. In the end you just drive repetitively from one waypoint to another until you've helped everyone with their needy needs and the game is over.At worst the zombies are mildly annoying. The fight system doesn't offer much immersion. You just keep clicking and ""smash spacebar not to die"". The game would have benefited from a more hands on fight system like they had in Condemned.State of Decay had some redeeming qualities, mainly the way you're able to earn people's trust and create a community of survivors. The scripted events breathe life into the characters who are actually able to do some useful stuff on their own while you're completing missions. And if they die you can't bring them back. The graphics are pretty okay and there's a satisfying POK sound when your baseball bat hits an armored zombie's helmet.The game is very ambitious, and while it doesn't suck horribly, I still feel it falls short.

												I would definately recommend this game to anyone who enjoys playing zombie killing games, I loved it!A brief summary about this game: - Its singleplayer and has a great main story (it also has plenty of side missions) - It has a large open world so you can run off to explore and scavenge for resourcres when you want - During the story more new bases become available that you can move to (and upgrade to add different types of rooms eg library, garden, repairshop, etc all with different benefits) if you choose- You meet new survivors and they can join your group and you can change to control each one when you are friendly enough- Each survivor has different traits and you can choose different fight styles to level up - You can use vehicles to move around the map quickly but noise attracts zeds- There are different types of zombies to fight (eg: ones that explode) - When you exit the game real time continues ingame and so depending on how many days it is before you login different things can happen without you, usually resoucres used for different events so you need to build them up again or you need to talk to another survivor who is upset/angry and not coping well.Although there are so many alpha zombie games right now and state of decay is older and only singleplayer, I still believe its a classic and worth grabbing in a sale :)			"

I woud really recommend it!Good:Great atmosphere.Nice characters.A few light-rpgish upgrade elements.Decent graphics.Bad:Very thin main story.Characters don't react to situations.No coop.Very few upgrade possiblities @ Base.I really hope they will make a part 2 but then with a much deeper base/character development.

												In a world rapidly being filled with generic and increasingly boring zombie games, State of Decay is a rare gem that gets zombie survival right. It's that game that makes you a part of the world you wanted to play in after watching a good zombie flick.State of Decay is... just that zombie survival game I have been looking for. I was surprised that more people are not talking about it. Where some games get a little too caught up in humans fighting each other over resources in a post zombie-apocalypse world (like DayZ) or zombie slaughter simulation (like Dead Island and Dead Rising), State of Decay perfectly scratches that 'build a community of survivors and scavenge for resources' itch.You get to choose a location for your group to set up in, manage your resources by scavenging, building base upgrades, and helping people out in the world. Even though the game has a story - and that story is interesting to play - I found myself just exploring, scavenging, and killing some zombies.This is exactly the kind of zombie games I want to see in the future. Let's face it, the zombie genre is hot right now, and I am tired of the endless DayZ clones where you are in a zombie-themed minecraft world with the greatest danger being the other players. State of Decay gives you an open world that is exciting to explore. There are many buildings, and they are full of resources, and sometimes also full of zombies. The zombies themselves are trivial on their own, but in groups are quite deadly, and you have to take them into account when trying to figure out whether a place is worth raiding, or a route worth traveling down.Overall, I love this game, and I hope we can see a bigger, multiplayer version of it in the future.

												Great game, while I shouldn't really compare this to a game like DayZ, it introduces many zombie survival mechanics that DayZ didnt. for starters the game has a simple but good combat system, LMB to melee, RMB to aim gun and RMB + LMB to fire, there is no need to go into your inventory to de-equip a melee weapon to equip a gun as both can be used at the same time. You can also perform finishing moves with Z and dodge zombie attacks with C. The game also takes a page from L4D and has unique zombies like juggernauts who are huge zombies that can deal a lot of damage and take it at the same time, you also have screamers which attract zombies and riot zombies which are like normal zeds except that are immune to gunfire requiring melee attacks. You are required to lead the group and can make important calls like setting up multiple outposts and improving and moving homes. You have to be very careful in this game and plan out things such as routes and manouvering around zombie hordes and special zeds, one wrong move and you can have your car tipped upside down about to explode with all of your rucksacks of ammo, medicine etc. inside or even have a whole horde chasing you while you have no ammo. Not much to complain right? Well no this game isnt perfect. The game is very repetive and can get boring when you are required to do the same mission in usually the same area over and over, however this hole can be filled with the other 2 DLC that you can download and the game still has loads of replay value. Also, I found that the characters were also boring as some even had the same voices and dialogue which is a shame as they could be more unique. This is still a great game that doesnt get the praise it deserves and if we could see a State Of Decay 2 with more improvements, then you will definitely see that on my wishlist. I am currently playing this game and would recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap, singleplayer experience.Review 2:This game has only got better as I have played on. This game definetely makes zombies a huge threat unlike Day Z (sorry, I had to :0 ) and makes noise in the game have huge consequences. When you are searching containers you could make a loud noise, this causes a huge amount of zombies to swarm to your position; this is made worse by nearby hordes. I got cornered in a storage shed by 10-15 zeds because I reckless and tried to get everything quickly. My strongest character (Marcus) who has max shooting, melee and blunt weapons skills (backed up by a wrench and ak47 custom silenced) almost died from this and was seriously injured as the zeds kept attacking. This meant I couldn't take any out with my AK or wrench and had to find an small opening which was 1 door with 5% of Marcus's health remaining. This is true zombie apocalyspe survival, leaving you with near death experiences and adrenaline pumping. also, choices you make with survivors at the grange has huge consequences as Becca (sorry spoilers) died as I told Quinten she was a, oh how could I say this in the review?, an 'escort'. I now make sure I use quiet or silenced weapons as more powerful guns like the AK47 and River Snake generate a lot of noise (check the wiki for more details). Because of the noise made by the River Snake revolver, one of my group members died as zombies began to swarm us on a normal anger mangement mission. Play this game like you would with Day Z, with extreme caution and planning, as one wrong move can get you or your group members killed.Review 3: I am drawing near to the end of the game. I have actually got my chef killed at the hands of a feral which ripped him in half like a chocolate bar; now I am not sure if I want that achievment on my steam profile. I managed to build up an arsenal of weapons, which include 100+ melee weapons and 50+ guns (which include a few Automatic rifles and 2 50 Calibre rifles). fighting zombies is no easier with these guns as the ammo for my 50 cal guns are so rare that I only managed to collect 30+ rounds, this is further worsened by the guns stumbling recoil and extreme weight that can encumber a non powerhouse character. Since I am near the end I may as well just give you some tips for surviving the zombie apocalyse of State Of Decay. 1. When setting up a new home, always make sure you prioritise building a workshop and infirmary (and if possible a medical lab if you can get a library). This is because if you get injured or sick group members you can heal them back up to good health quickly, meaning they can hone their skills and do scavenging runs for you; having a workshop means you can repair your veichles which are very limited in this game aswell as make very important homemade supressors which benefit all of your characters. 2. Dont use inexperienced characters for tougher jobs. this is how my chef got killed. I sent him out to help an ally deal with a few zeds attacking her and what happens when I complete it? A feral an armoured zombies come after me and since ferals are the strongest and worst zed to face in the game, I was screwed with my 22. pistol and pipe wrench. The moral of the story is train you charcters, but always have an ally with you incase the freaks come knocking.3. USE STEALTH!!! Now yes stealth can be slow especially when scavenging, but it pays off as you will deal with less zeds and you will be less likely to get injured or killed. If there are zeds closing in on you while you are searching a container, then search it quicker and risk making noise as you will already have zombies trying to get through the doors and windows. If a horde spots you then either run away and find a car to escape or ram the horde, you could even (if you have the weapons and ammo) engage and destroy the horde so long as it doesnt attract more attention.

												Interesting concept of an open world where you play as a community of survivors in a zombie apocalypse and you have scavenge resources from a small town in order to survive.  Fun melee mechanics, the shooting mechanics feel alittle awkward, in any case, using firearms is limited due to ammo and the noise. Awkward indoor camera angles make it tricky to enter a building. Main story plot is short and easily played if you are not distracted with exploring the town in your first playthrough. Various playable characters that has some depth and different skillsets. Decent graphics with good lighting, especially with a day/night cycle in game. DLC tries to introduce a game world without story plot and challenges the player to survive as long as possible. But having only one map kills much of the replayability and the exploration factor of the DLC.			"

												This game isn't just another zombie survival game.  Although there are zombies, and quite a few main survival mechanics, the core gameplay is an RPG.  You use influence points in your community to build new things, take weapons and supplies from the storage chest, and even relocate to new bases.  All-in-all, not a perfect game, but it combines the scavenging and survival aspects that I love from zombie games and combines it with RPG aspects that are very well balanced.  The open world is beautiful and does a good job of not looking too repetitive.  Also for the price of just 20 USD, who can complain about what could be hundreds of hours of gameplay?			"

												I had my doubts about State of Decay, suspecting yet another shark hunting the blood of Day Z fans.  I was wrong, and I am very happy to be wrong.  I enjoy this.  It's a fair bit strategic, and a fair bit luck based.  It's all built around survival, maintaining and upgrading a base and outposts, as well as recruiting survivors to your group and keeping them happy.  Oh, and there's zombies too, and they're♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  This game is punishing, even on the easiest difficulty.  Sometimes it's downright unfair, BUT you can learn from your mistakes, learn the game, and get better.  My #1 gripe here is that there's no coop, and I hear a sequel with coop is already in the works, so we'll see.  Great buy for me.			"

												It's a decent game, but I'm still giving this one as well as the Breakdown DLC a thumbs down.The game starts out quite promising, but turns out to be repetitive and boring as soon as you've established a decent home base. The zombie sandbox seems vast at first, but excitement fades when you realize that the houses are pretty much the same everywhere. There aren't that many interesting items or people to find. And even though Breakdown seemingly adds more challenge to the game, things get pretty easy as soon as you've established a home base and started upgrading your characters. Your neighbors are super needy, you constantly need new equipment for your home base and there's always some shmuck that has to be saved or a zombie horde that has to be mowed down. In the end you just drive repetitively from one waypoint to another until you've helped everyone with their needy needs and the game is over.At worst the zombies are mildly annoying. The fight system doesn't offer much immersion. You just keep clicking and ""smash spacebar not to die"". The game would have benefited from a more hands on fight system like they had in Condemned.State of Decay had some redeeming qualities, mainly the way you're able to earn people's trust and create a community of survivors. The scripted events breathe life into the characters who are actually able to do some useful stuff on their own while you're completing missions. And if they die you can't bring them back. The graphics are pretty okay and there's a satisfying POK sound when your baseball bat hits an armored zombie's helmet.The game is very ambitious, and while it doesn't suck horribly, I still feel it falls short.

												Kind of buggy, kind of ugly, and kind of not exactly everything you wish it would be, State of Decay is nevertheless a great game that deserves your attention.   At first glance there is no doubt that this was a port from the Xbox 360.  The game looks like it needs a good coat of Anti-Aliasing turned way up.  The keyboard and mouse controls work, although the game feels better when played with a controller.  The game play itself is richly satisfying.    You and group of survivors, search and scavenge your way through a fairly large map dealing with mobs of zombies.   Smacking, hitting, shooting, all work well and is richly satisfying.  Zombies are not that dangerous, unless they are in a group.  There are special zombies which can be a challenge, and they keep you on your toes.  The story is… Okay…  You rescue survivors, and work on trying to figure out why the dead are eating people.  Its okay, but really what you want to do is your own thing without the story pushing you along.  Rumor has it a free mode is coming soon.  In which case, without the confides of the story, the game should becomes more enjoyable.  For $15.00 you can hardly go wrong, as there is hours worth of gameplay that goes along with it.  Give it a look.			"

Posted: January 12, 2015
												I played this game a lot more than I thought I would but I thought it would be more worth it. This game provides an illusion of depth and replayability. It had potential to be way more dynamic and varied but fell short in the aspects it wanted to show off most. It's still worth the amount it asks for and is fun for a short while. However it definitely isn't as replayable as it would like to boast as most of what you do will start to feel like the filler content it is.State of Decay is a game with a lot of depth to characters and an interesting take on surviving an apocalypse for the ""Long-Term"". In my eyes it is a game where the goals were about building a strong, large community to rebuild civilization. Most zombie games I have played focused on escaping a threat or surviving relatively short terms of time without safety. State of Decay answers some of the questions of what might happen after that.The Basics of the GameThe tutorial gets you through a typical zombie panic scenario so it can focus on the main aspects of the game. The game really places focus on settling down in a base and holding your ground which is somewhat conflicting with the large map. You will quickly find strength in numbers by teaming up with a community of survivors. The character you play as cannot protect themselves alone and you'll need to take shifts with other characters so that they can heal or sleep. With the community caring for each other you are able to thrive in the apocalypse by maintaining a good base. A good base is maintained and upgraded with obvious essentials like food, fuel, ammo, medicine, and building materials. You can get these essentials by scavenging or trading. By making a strong and safe community you'll gain attention from competing communities and even the military. The military has more power and resources than anyone so gaining their attention and trust allows you to escape and ends the game's story.Conflicts and Negative PointsI felt like this game had an unclear focus for player objectives. State of Decay places a lot of focus on both exploring a huge map and settling down in a single, small base. I will say that the map for this game is absolutely huge and I was initially very impressed with how much content it had. However, exploration is encouraged but it doesn't really provide any unique incentive to do so.No incentive to explore the huge mapYou could complete the entire game by staying in one base. The benefits from moving to a different base are not very noticeable and the places you can set a base at are very limited (I think 6 or so places). Getting the largest base possible is important to have more people and facilities but the benefits for having a large base is too small. Having a different base might let you have 13 people instead of 10 but having more than 8 people is probably more than enough to easily survive. Some bases allow more facilities but it doesn't really matter as long as you have a few basic ones. Packing up your base and moving is pretty much only dependant on finding a base that can hold as much people as possible and what scenery you like to look at.There are no areas that offer unique resources. Living in one area is pretty much just as resourceful as living anywhere else. There is no reason to go somewhere far to get something valuable making less of a reason to explore the huge map.Materials for scavenging are seemingly infinite. I thrived way too easily, I had too much food and medication than I could ever need just by staying around my base. You might scavenge the area around you dry but I never reached that point. Additionally resources are randomly generated so that might be impossible.Story and Missions are lackingAt the same time the game places focus on being story driven and infinite playability. Perhaps the only part of the game that actually encourages you to explore unvisited locations is the story. However the story is extremely short and will only show you a tiny percentage of the entire map. The story will easily skip large chunks of the map which shows how useless it was to actually make the map as large as it is. The impact of the story with the rest of the game world is minimal because it struggles with trying to be infinite with filler content.The events of the story don't matter to the world. The game uses cutscenes sometimes but doesn't give them any cinematic impact. The supposed ending of the game felt as important as tying my shoe. The lack of music made story events all the less unique from the rest of the game. It was very clear that none of the story mattered after the intro which is insanely deceiving when the first moments of the game are very heavy on letting the story drive the player. After that first tutorial ""chapter"" it quickly feels like nothing matters.The infinite playability is advertised because of the endless respawning of 10 kinds of very simple missions. It actually felt like the game placed less emphasis on the story as an excuse to say the story doesn't matter and you are meant to endlessly play the game. State of Decay says it's dynamic by randomly generating things like events, missions, resources, and characters which would be interesting if the randomizations had more variables. The random things in this game are basic templates. You will quickly find a character who has the same voice actor as someone standing right next to you. Most characters will literally say the exact same script as someone else. Every random mission plays out the same way. A rescue mission is always a ""rescue"" mission and nothing unique ever changes with a mission besides the location and people involved. These missions don't even really get harder as you progress through the game. In the end, the ""Dynamic"" events become annoying, unoriginal filler content way too fast.I mean you can pay extra to get the DLC which adds a gradual increase in difficulty and more variety but these seem like things that should have been in the game anyways. DLC shouldn't charge to fix a game's flaws or even worse, intentionally reduce a game's core aspects for a quick buck.			"

												Would have given this game a decent review, but not after the devs ripped off it's customers by turning what should have been an update into the 'year one edition'...essentially the same game again but with new textures and a $22 dollar asking price.The original game has now been abandoned in favour of the Year one edition, which isn;t much better it seems. If you'd rather buy that then feel free, but be aware it'll likely be abandoned too when they repackage the same game again and call it the Year 2 edition, for a whole new asking price.Instead of remastering, they should have made a sequel, with co-op like we all want. Clearly that is beyond the developers who can only keep replacing the textures on their dated graphics engine.Do not reward this dodgy practice. Do not buy.			"

												This game is pretty f'n amazing. I own this here on Steam and the Xbox 360 versions and absolutely fell in love with it. Like others, I only wish there was a two player co-op to add a bit more replayability to the game, but that's not enough to hate on it at all. The game itself is incredible to lose yourself in if you are into scavenging and collecting supplies while dealing with the hardships of a band of survivors and the undead constantly trying to eat your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s out.

												I really like this game. Its a super fun experience. Its got a realistic feeling/ setting to it and really is a true zombie game. The zombies are smart and respond to any behavior or sounds. Building ip your community takes some skill as you need to also cope with all the things like depression and missing people within the community. The controlls are meh on pc but are easy when you get used to them. All together its a really good game and i would recommend it to any zombie game fan!8.5/10			"

												Interesting concept of an open world where you play as a community of survivors in a zombie apocalypse and you have scavenge resources from a small town in order to survive.  Fun melee mechanics, the shooting mechanics feel alittle awkward, in any case, using firearms is limited due to ammo and the noise. Awkward indoor camera angles make it tricky to enter a building. Main story plot is short and easily played if you are not distracted with exploring the town in your first playthrough. Various playable characters that has some depth and different skillsets. Decent graphics with good lighting, especially with a day/night cycle in game. DLC tries to introduce a game world without story plot and challenges the player to survive as long as possible. But having only one map kills much of the replayability and the exploration factor of the DLC.			"

												Open world, third person survival zombie game with choice based missions.- Has a story and a plot, that goes like most good zombie series.- Day/night cycle. Zombies become more aggressive at night.- Kill, explore, gain allies, gather ressources and build bases/outposts.- Switch between characters. Life, stamina and injuries are essential factors.- Skill system for each character making them good at different tasks.- Use cars to drive around the map and slaughter zombies.- A lot of different weapons including swords, machetes, snipers, shotguns, assault rifles, grenade launchers etc.In generel good/bad:- A lot to explore. The gameplay is addictive and fun.- Graphics are ok and sounds are good. - Controls not the best, but can be played. Cars are stiff in handling. (console port).- It has no MP, but does not need it, as the SP is satisfying long enough, to keep you going.Similar game(s): - It reminds me a bit of Dead Island, which I played on the PS3. That game went more fluid for me than this one.However Dead Island is much more linear than State of Decay. Also Dead Island is easier than State of Decay.Score: 9/10.			"

												This game is completely amazing! Nothing more satisfying than hearing the music ramp up as I knee zombies in the face, splattering beautiful guts all over the place with a marvelous crush sound. The sounds and animations are completely gorgeous and well done, using a sword and slicing through zombies feels sooooooooooo damn good!The game takes good things from all sorts of genres, it has great elements of role playing, strategy, action, survival, shooters and even stealth sims. The game has great replayabilty and is highly addictive, warning!There are definitely things that could be improved. Some missions and when or where they pop up are really annoying. losing characters is very sad (kind of a good thing maybe), carrying rucksacks gets very old, NPCs on scavenger missions just stand there even with zombies around. Overall though, I might complain, but the game is so completely awesome, it's so good that any problem feels meaningless.GREAT GAME.			"

												I really like how this game focuses on survival and fighting off zombies. Once you build a community you have to go out and gather ressources to survive, and don't be careless out there because you will get overrun and killed. The fighting system is really simple and fun wether you choose to go melee or use guns. The zombies animations and movements are nice and fluid and thier artificial intelligence is simple and well done. They react to sound and light and will run to you if you make too much noise. You can still sneak around them, especially in the dark and score a few stealth melee kills wich is always nice. I also like how you can choose to build your community by finding more survivor, controlling certain characters to level them up and get them to learn new abilities and be stronger. You have quite a big map to explore as well, a lot of scavenging to do. You have to be carefull to keep the zombie population in check around your home base so it doesn't get overrun. The gameplay is really fun and well done. And of course, among all of that, you have a nice little quest story line that gets you to learn about what  happened and what caused all this. Although not everything is answered at the end of the game it opens the door for a nice sequel or expansion. I give this game a 9 out of 10 because the only downside is that you cannot bring your friends to play with you in co-op... how awesome would it have been.			"

												OK, quick PROS/CONS review:PROS:-Solid zombie experience, sound mechanics works just fine-Decent size map, with well designed details-Good looking game, well ported-Satisfying combat -Good price for what you get (specially if it's on sale)-DLCs give good replayability, Lifeline brings a new urban map-Tons of different weapons-Dozens of different characters to play with, some of them randomly generated-Well developed survivor community mechanics-An easy fight can go south very quickly, making it more immersiveCONS:-After about 50% of the main game, ""standard zombie story"" becomes ""weak and poor zombie story""-Some loading issues in specific areas, dangerous specially while driving-GUI/commands scream ""controller"" and focuses on multiuse keys-The camera tends to be quite uncomfortable in tight spaces, and when aiming in CQC-Driving experience is barely sufficient (some cars have ridiculous handling/behaviour)-Zombie animations sometimes bug with the terrain or obstacles-Looks a little dated despite the use of Cry Engine 3-After some hours, it can get repetitive. I found starting from scratch to be more entertaining than late endgame-The other survivors' AI can be stupid quite often, getting themselves chewed on with ease Minor stuff I complain about and might not be so important for you:-Unrealistic/cartoonish looks for some of you out there (they're ok, but...)-Lack of easily visible explanations for advanced controls (ie combos)-Almost half of the mechanics aren't explained anywhere (ie outpost resources and their costs)-Zombies sometimes spawn right behind you following the sound mechanics, but the place was just clear...-Cars can make things all too easy sometimes, killing bunch of zombies in one go-Lack of hard-to-reach places, special points of interest, ""secrets"", etc-Unsatisfying main storyline ending, at least in my opinionIf you've read this far, why not give you some more text...This game feels like bunch of good ideas but with just a decent execution. It could have been much, much better with more work, yet I guess the original console constraints took that away. However, IT WORKS. It's a cool zombie experience, it has many classic stuff like hordes of zeds assaulting a position that you need to barricade and fight for, hit n' run rescue missions and the (not so classical) special zeds, that actually reminded me a lot of Dead Island. You get a really good game for the 20 bucks price tag, that is very fun to play and despite being easy at times, it can also be very punishing. Sometimes you're Rambo, sometimes you're Deadmeat. Watch yourself out there.There is another small Pro, and that is the Mod community. It's still small, but it will grow and that will only extend the game's life. If you're handy with that stuff, check the Nexus Mods.I'd say it's a solid 8/10. Absolutely recommended for zombie lovers out there.			"

												Ok so as you can see I've racked up nearly 160 hours on this game. Addicted? Possibly!So where to begin. I don't think its worth me providing you with a ""good"" & ""bad"" list because a lot of that will down to personal taste. The game to me is delicious and is best played via the Breakdown DLC. The storyline is ok, but it's merely a filler. The game is all about survival and you don't need a plot for that. The Graphics are decent enough and while I'm sure someone with attention to detail may be able to point out some issues with them, they do the job well and you feel immersed.Unlike a lot of Zombie games I've played, this isn't all about melee. There are tons of weapons too but like everything in this game you have to find them, and the ammo too. By far one of my favourite things about this game is that more or less every building can be entered and the loot from each is completely random every play through. Sure there are hotspots fo some of the loot in the game, but it doesnt detract from the fact that you have to hunt them down, carry them home and do it with zombies crawling all over you.I've had the chance to play with mods too and found one which gave me the ability to disable the ""special"" zombies. While these present a decent challenge and are great additions, they can at times be a bit overkill with 2 out of the 4 able to kill even your highest level character in just a few hits. I could go on and on about this game... I'm still playing it and expect I'll be close to 1000 hours before I tire of it, if not beyond. There is a new DLC on the way too with a new map (sweet) so this will just refresh the game for me. The forums are also alive with both friendly players and staff so you are never far from help.If like me you want a survival challenge, want it with Zombies and on a reasonably large map (we always want bigger and better Undead Labs :P) then don't look anywhere else. I've searched long and hard for a game of this type, and this ticks most of the boxes for me. I'd be really surprised if you were disappointed.Hope this review was useful and if you buy the game... enjoy!			"

												Do you like DayZ or H1Z1?  Do you need a break from getting killed every 20 minutes by mean random people?  Get this game! This game is a survival game kind of like DayZ but it is single player.  Because of this, it seems to be more polished.  It's a finished game so the graphics look a lot better than early access.  You don't have food and stamina bars, instead you have to find enough food, meds, water, and other stuff for your settlement of survivors.  It's really cool to play this game because you aren't just thinking about your survival, you are thinking of all of the people in your group.  You can also get supplies and build up your base.  Even in a single player game, you feel like you are part of a group because you are always getting supplies for other people.Since this is single player, you get all of the loot!  It's awesome that you don't have to play for 2 hours just to find a can of beans like in other survival games.  The game has perma death, so each time you die with a character he never comes back.  You don't have to start over, you just have to play as another person in your group.  Even though this game doesn't have a great story, what's there is okay, and I felt a lot of tension becasue I didn't want these characters to die.  It also means that if you play this game you will have a different outcome on every playthrough.  It won't really change the story much, but you can level up each survivor differently to add variety to your gameplay.  There are some technical issues here.  I have a pretty powerful laptop that is about equal to the recommended system requirements, but I still had to mod the game to get a respectable framrate.  You will have to mess around with the game to get it to run.  Luckily, the nexus now supports mod for this (and apparantly for any) game.  You can get a mod that disables shadows that will double your framerate easily.  The game is poorly optimised, and keep that in mind if your machine is closer to the minimum requirements.  I have to recommend this game.  I really like survival games, but was getting tired of all the mmo titles because people are jerks.  If you want to change up your survival experience, this is the perfect game for that.			"

												I will have to say this is the first time I got a ""early acess"" game. So far the experience has been good.  I won't rate this game because it is unfinished. However things are looking up for this game.  It has good play mechanics that are unique for zombie games. Others have described it by comparing it to various other zombie games. In all fairness I have to say its got its own flavor and i don't really find the experince repetitive of other games. I recommend  this unfinished game highly i'm sure the finished version will please many zombie fans even more than it does in its current state which is very satisfing game exprience as it is.UPDATE: OK i've had this game a long time now and it's been finished now as well as had a few DLC release for it. So with out further stalling here's my breakdown. The Good: Great story that doesn't hit you in the head with trying to explain zombies.Lots of characters to play as.Nice Tired/food/water mechanic that doesn't consume your game time.Gorgeous graphics. The bad: Seemed a bit short start to finish. I highly recommend you grab the DLC to extent this one.Random graphic slow downs despite having a powerful system. Harsh HDR lighting, some games get this tuned right some don't While this game does look great the contrast  from HDR can be a bit much at times.       Overall I give this game an 82%. Zombie fans wil love it and non zombie fans will stil find it a enjoyable experience.			"

												If you like zombie slaying and saving survivors, but always wanted the experience to be a bit more personal, this game is for you.SoD gives a satisfying level of depth to saving people and character building, something largely missing from more acrade style shooters of this type. The base building and resource management is a constant source of both pressure and accomplishment; trying to house, feed supply and develop 20+ people is a challenge.Time becomes a big issue in this game, you won't have enough of it be everywhere and do everything, some things simply have to be prioritized. You may WANT to help those farmers out, but you have a team member in trouble and your base is nearly out of food and ammo...All up, SoD is a pretty well rounded sandboxey survivor sim. Few bugs to speak of, and I've never felt this invested in a zombie game before.  Definite thumbs up.			"

												This game has some rough edges for sure, but if you can get into the survival aspect of the game then it can be quite addicting. I played the story mode for about five minutes before I went stright for the survival modes, which I found way more fun. This game was originally released on Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360 and it feels like a direct port from that, so I would recommend playing it with an Xbox controller if you have one.			"

												State of Decay plays like Grand Theft Auto's gameplay into Day Z's themes of zombie fighting, scavenging, and survival. I really like how State of Decay has users meet other survivors and build trust for trading, setup and move camp, and a interesting without being cumbersome resource system which causes the user to venture from their enclave. It's very fun and can get a little repetitive towards the end of the story mission but I enjoyed this game a lot.My one complaint is that things aren't always obvious or explained well which caused me to restart this game 3 times before I did an entire play through. Before selecting any skill you might want to check out a guide to get a better description of what each skill actually does.			"

												One if not the best single player zombie survival game out there. It has all the features of the old school z survivals such as going out to scavange resources, establishing outposts, fortificating buildings, etc. The graphics are amazing, it has a great storyline and while it can be a bit heavy to bear at times the next day you want to play it again. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing, keeping the calm moments calm and the thrill to danger when zeds are nearby. The Breakdown expansion is what the survival experts and fans want here. Little to no story line, focus on long-term survival and pretty limited resources are what make this game and the DLC great. If you are looking for the Zombie Outbreak Survival game but don't want to go like DayZ with other people, this is the game you want.			"

I love how every character you meet and encounter is essentially unique and has their own traits. Maintaining a safehaven and upgrading it is a lot of fun. This game had me on it ALL day and night.

Even when i'm not playing it, I find myself thinking about, ""what if i did this?"" or ""Maybe i should have started at this spot. "" A game that can make me consider so many things, and keep me constantly engaged is exactly what i expect for my money.

												Decent open-world zombie RPG.  The main story doesn't seem very deep, though, and there are bugs and glitches.  Still, if you can get this for under $10 or so, it might well be worth your while.  It reminds me of Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl and the other games in that series, but with everything taking place in a single, huge level instead of many separate maps.			"

												To date, this game is the best re-creation of the feel of the AMC series, ""The Walking Dead"".  This is one of the finest indie games I have played and better than a lot of stuff out of huge mega corps.This is a gather resource/build community/follow multithreaded adventure model.  You can follow the storylines or go completely sandbox.  Your interaction with the locals in the game can benefit you, but if you feel like going your own way, you can still have a blast with this game.If you are a zombie fan, you owe it to yourself to at least try this game.

												This game is fairly straight forward, you switch between a number of survivors in the zombie apocalypse where you must seek out resources and fight off zombies to preserve and expand your base. Your resources dwindle day by day and you must be strategic in prioritizing which resources you pursue. This game excels because of its simplicity but that simplicity unfortunately leads to the game becoming repetative later on with no clear goals and no further progression. The underlying mechanics of the game remind me of mobile games but with much stronger graphics and interface. The game feels repetitive once you have an established base and full group of survivors, which can happen pretty quickly if you want it to. At this point you're really just playing to keep the game going because while there is a story mode there is no clear objective besides just surviving. The game would really benefit from a more comprehensive base building element or something that maybe gives you a sense of rebuilding society or fighting back a gainst the zombies in a meaningful way, but then I guess it deviate from the norms of the zombie-sirvival genre. Zombies just keep spawning and after a point you'll feel like you've killed more zombies than the population of the little country towns of the setting. Combat leans more in favor of melee as noises will draw the hordes. I like the combat mechanics that give you the right level of contectual animation, when you swing at a hoard of zombies the way you swing takes into consideration how you're moving and how the zombies are moving around you. Driving takes a little getting used to but reminds me of how the driving feels in the GTA games. Vehicles are as much a resources as ammunition, food, medical, and building supplies with a finite number of them that dwindle as you wreck them. People are also as much a resource that you must weigh whether to allow them into your group and if and when you prioritize aid over your own resource gathering.I bought the game for $7 and its worth a bit more than that, but not too much.

												State of Decay has been one of my most favorite games of all time, yes it may have some repeating dialogue and gameplay, but they make up for it with the great DLCs also the story for the main game and one of he DLCs are great in my opinion. Some people think the game is too eazy and ends way to fast, and it is ture for both, but they made one DlC that is never ending and gets harder and harder as you go on.Overall this is a great game for almost everyone and i would recommend this game to anyone who loves zombie games.

												OK, quick PROS/CONS review:PROS:-Solid zombie experience, sound mechanics works just fine-Decent size map, with well designed details-Good looking game, well ported-Satisfying combat -Good price for what you get (specially if it's on sale)-DLCs give good replayability, Lifeline brings a new urban map-Tons of different weapons-Dozens of different characters to play with, some of them randomly generated-Well developed survivor community mechanics-An easy fight can go south very quickly, making it more immersiveCONS:-After about 50% of the main game, ""standard zombie story"" becomes ""weak and poor zombie story""-Some loading issues in specific areas, dangerous specially while driving-GUI/commands scream ""controller"" and focuses on multiuse keys-The camera tends to be quite uncomfortable in tight spaces, and when aiming in CQC-Driving experience is barely sufficient (some cars have ridiculous handling/behaviour)-Zombie animations sometimes bug with the terrain or obstacles-Looks a little dated despite the use of Cry Engine 3-After some hours, it can get repetitive. I found starting from scratch to be more entertaining than late endgame-The other survivors' AI can be stupid quite often, getting themselves chewed on with ease Minor stuff I complain about and might not be so important for you:-Unrealistic/cartoonish looks for some of you out there (they're ok, but...)-Lack of easily visible explanations for advanced controls (ie combos)-Almost half of the mechanics aren't explained anywhere (ie outpost resources and their costs)-Zombies sometimes spawn right behind you following the sound mechanics, but the place was just clear...-Cars can make things all too easy sometimes, killing bunch of zombies in one go-Lack of hard-to-reach places, special points of interest, ""secrets"", etc-Unsatisfying main storyline ending, at least in my opinionIf you've read this far, why not give you some more text...This game feels like bunch of good ideas but with just a decent execution. It could have been much, much better with more work, yet I guess the original console constraints took that away. However, IT WORKS. It's a cool zombie experience, it has many classic stuff like hordes of zeds assaulting a position that you need to barricade and fight for, hit n' run rescue missions and the (not so classical) special zeds, that actually reminded me a lot of Dead Island. You get a really good game for the 20 bucks price tag, that is very fun to play and despite being easy at times, it can also be very punishing. Sometimes you're Rambo, sometimes you're Deadmeat. Watch yourself out there.There is another small Pro, and that is the Mod community. It's still small, but it will grow and that will only extend the game's life. If you're handy with that stuff, check the Nexus Mods.I'd say it's a solid 8/10. Absolutely recommended for zombie lovers out there.			"

												Now that I've got a solid number of hours under my belt and played the crap out of breakdown i feel more confident in giving a review. This game is buggy as hell. This game needs patches. BADLY. Driving a vehicle will cause your framerate to drop. Driving a vehicle is also dangerous because giving certain objects the lightest tap can send you and your vehicle into LOW ORBIT. There are also multiple texture glitches that cause large black squares to appear on the ground. Often times during combat, you will notice your weapon passing harmlessly trhough enemies allowing them to latch onto your backside and chew on you.During missions it is also possible for the waypoint to fling itself off the minimap and thus become unreachable, making it difficult to complete the mission. It can also become permanently stuck on the map after completion of the mission making it IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPLETE ANOTHER MISSION UNTIL AFTER GAME RESTART. Oh and did we mention you can't save during a mission? This means you'll lose an untold amount of progess.Certain LAUNCHER errors can cause the game to crash an hour or two after it launches. TLDR HEY DEVS FIX THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME! In spite of all the glitches and bugs I still love playing it and 30 hours in I am still nowhere near done playing it. Definitely got my money's worth playing this game. Just wish they would fix some♥♥♥♥♥♥My advice? Buy it, it is a fun game, it just needs more polishing. The DLC is good too, I can't get enough of Breakdown.			"

												This game is simply too much fun. I have not found any glaring faults as yet, though I do wish vehicles carried more items (a kitchen timer should not really take up the same space as a duffle bag in the back of a pickup truck) and that fully metal weapons, such as a pipe, lasted far, far longer than they do.Deaths are real, and as a character dies you are stuck with whomever is left. While that does not change the game itself, it does limit what you are able to do later in the game if you have not been working on all the available characters' skills. I consider this a bonus, as it prevents the game from getting boring.Vehicle stability is reminiscent of Grand Theft Auto. This is a good thing.I have not played The Walking Dead series, so I have no basis for comparison. All I can really say, is that I have a ton of fun in this game.			"

												Very addictive and clever Zombie Apocalypse simulation. For those wondering it's pretty much Grand Theft Auto meets your favorite zombie simultor (Day Z / War Z). Don't take State of Decay lightly, it has the true ""end of the world"" environment, meaningful missions, crafting, weapon decay, group management and so much more.Where Dayz and War Z fail, State of Decay excels! True randomization of enemy hordes that actually make zombies a REAL threat. Lack of ammunition, food, and other supplys force the player to take real care in their movements to prevent the loss of their group. One your favorite character dies the story continues on without themIn my personal opinion if you are a fan of the zombie genre you should pick this little gem up immediately.			"

You don't have one main character like other games and you have to look out for the other survivors and maintain your enclave as best as possible. I highly recommend this game.			"

												This game is amazing. For a smaller studio this is really a very worthwile venture. The game puts you into a familiar zombie apocalypse. Only this time, you not only work with your team to kill zombies... but together to survive for the long haul. Killing zombies may be a necessity at times but it is no way a major goal of this game. If you can collect food, fuel, materials, medicine and/or ammo without combat, more power to you. Build your base. Place strategic outposts. Then Outlast.The game has a fresh experience to a very familiar genre. I actually felt anxiety at the prospect of losing a favored character. (damn ferals!) For when they die, the are G.O.N.E. to great beyond. It's the ""one more turn"" sort of action that makes 4 hrs go by in a blink. The only major drawbacks is that to some the action may be to similiar sometimes. However, different characters can be affected by your decisions and the challenges you choose. Secondly, there is a big lack of a in game guide/help screen. This is the real short coming of the developer as this would be simple enough to fix.Overall, worth it's full price in my mind. This is what the Walking Dead should have put out as their game (aside from the TellTale which was amazing, this should have been Survival Instinct) I can't wait for a new map.			"

Things can get dangerous fast, don't wont that survivor you have been powerlevling for a week to get perma-ate) as far as mods ussually go in my opnion its pretty easy to follow. You can make the zombie population near impossible to survive, make them fast, make zombie attacks  more realistic and take surviors out in 1 bite, etc. Theres alot!

												State of Decay is a great game. There is a great, open-world to explore, a church to upgrade, and yes, plenty of zombies to kill.  However, there are a few issues in the game, primarily the frame rate and zombie teleporting. The frame rate drops out of nowhere, stooping to rates of 5-10, though only for a second (long enough for you to get your neck chewed off).  Also, zombies to teleport and respawn almost instantainously, without your realizing. One for instance, popped right in front of me when I was barricaiding a room. Finally for the issues, there is perma-death.  That means, when you dead, YOU DEAD!!! But, none of these minor problems should stop you from playing one of the best zombie games in history.  Combat is fluid, and the ground take-downs are sick.  The amount of blood and gore also makes each swing of a spiked bat murderous and powerful.  Probably one of the game's highest strong points is the sound.  Each moan of a zombie and the shuffiling of the footsteps make your heart skip a beat and wonder where the heck that one (or two, or three) zombie is at.  All and all, State of Decay is an amazing game and an even better zombie survival RPG, witch shouldn't be passed up because of a few minor bugs.			"

Pros: Awesome graphics, gameplay, and voice oversCons: Still very buggy, can use a lot of working on to elieviate some graphical glitching and in game bugs.Overall a fantastic game, and definitely worth $20.00.

												Open world, third person survival zombie game with choice based missions.- Has a story and a plot, that goes like most good zombie series.- Day/night cycle. Zombies become more aggressive at night.- Kill, explore, gain allies, gather ressources and build bases/outposts.- Switch between characters. Life, stamina and injuries are essential factors.- Skill system for each character making them good at different tasks.- Use cars to drive around the map and slaughter zombies.- A lot of different weapons including swords, machetes, snipers, shotguns, assault rifles, grenade launchers etc.In generel good/bad:- A lot to explore. The gameplay is addictive and fun.- Graphics are ok and sounds are good. - Controls not the best, but can be played. Cars are stiff in handling. (console port).- It has no MP, but does not need it, as the SP is satisfying long enough, to keep you going.Similar game(s): - It reminds me a bit of Dead Island, which I played on the PS3. That game went more fluid for me than this one.However Dead Island is much more linear than State of Decay. Also Dead Island is easier than State of Decay.Score: 9/10.			"

												I really like how this game focuses on survival and fighting off zombies. Once you build a community you have to go out and gather ressources to survive, and don't be careless out there because you will get overrun and killed. The fighting system is really simple and fun wether you choose to go melee or use guns. The zombies animations and movements are nice and fluid and thier artificial intelligence is simple and well done. They react to sound and light and will run to you if you make too much noise. You can still sneak around them, especially in the dark and score a few stealth melee kills wich is always nice. I also like how you can choose to build your community by finding more survivor, controlling certain characters to level them up and get them to learn new abilities and be stronger. You have quite a big map to explore as well, a lot of scavenging to do. You have to be carefull to keep the zombie population in check around your home base so it doesn't get overrun. The gameplay is really fun and well done. And of course, among all of that, you have a nice little quest story line that gets you to learn about what  happened and what caused all this. Although not everything is answered at the end of the game it opens the door for a nice sequel or expansion. I give this game a 9 out of 10 because the only downside is that you cannot bring your friends to play with you in co-op... how awesome would it have been.			"

Nothing more satisfying than hearing the music ramp up as I knee zombies in the face, splattering beautiful guts all over the place with a marvelous crush sound.

The game has great replayabilty and is highly addictive, warning!There are definitely things that could be improved. Some missions and when or where they pop up are really annoying. losing characters is very sad (kind of a good thing maybe), carrying rucksacks gets very old, NPCs on scavenger missions just stand there even with zombies around. Overall though, I might complain, but the game is so completely awesome, it's so good that any problem feels meaningless.GREAT GAME.			"

												Do not buy this game for $20.. with that being said I got this for $10 on a sale and it might be the best $10 I've ever spent on Steam. The game's combat and missions are too repetitive, so to speak, to justify buying this for $20 and to be honest, I would say the game is pretty short (not including the DLCs).However, this is anything but a casual game.. once you start, I would say you need to play this 1-2 hours a day just to keep your base from falling apart, getting pretty close to it.  because it progresses while you're offline. The special zombies can get pretty tough during a horde, but once you get used to the way the combat works it becomes trivial. The morale/save me missions can get pretty annoying when you're spread thin in the beginning.All in all, it got a 79 metascore but could've had the potential of a 90+ game, which in itself is a bit disappointing, but nonetheless worth playing, especially for $10			"

												Short Version Review:""Crashed a pickup truck into a guard rail, got stuck, got beset my 20 zombies pouring out of the nearest house and lived !  Thank you, sledge hammer!  Then rammed a junky little sports car into the truck over and over until it was off the rail.  Got the truck back, left the burning car .... Thumbs Up !!!""Slightly Lengthier Review:So far, so good !  To start, I'll begin with the disclaimer of ""I've never played a zombie apocalypse game before this one.""  Unless you count some of the Fallout Games ( mmmm ... a lot of those mutants were pretty similar to zombies ).  Anyways, after a couple of crash n' burns both figurative and literal, I'm on my 3rd run of this game and it's a pretty fun romp.  There's a whole steamin' pile of paranoia to be had exploring in the towns, trying to keep one eye on the stuff you're trying to scavenge, and another eye out the window for things that might be jumping through it, trying to eat you.  An ear to the ground also helps.  Screamers are no picnic.  And it also might help to drive a little better than me, b/c when I see a mass of zombies coming down the street at me, my gas pedal foot gets a mind of its own.  I've dented enough hoods, lost enough car doors, and blown up enough vehicles to fill a modest junkyard already.  Hmmm, and I'm still just barely into the storyline itself, b/c the act of survival from day to day is a story all on its own.Of course, no game's complete without at least a few gripes.  I wish some of the NPCs weren't so petty or inherently stupid.  Nothing says "" HEY, WE'RE OVER HERE !!! "" quite like the sentry on the tower wielding a shotgun instead of a high powered rifle and shooting multiple times at zombies on the fringe of shotgun range.  There used to be an ornery guy with a hat on the tower - he was a jerk, but at least he had a rifle - can't figure out how to get the girl with the shotgun to come down and put the sniper guy back up there .... or convince her to swap weapons ...The other gripes are fairly mild in comparison.  It's been a bit of a trick for me trying to figure out where the main storyline wandered off to after my original party stumbled half-chewed into this church compound.  We've been fighting to keep our sanity and our skins ever since.  Having a whole lotta fun, though - $5 well spent.			"

												I waited until the early access phase had ended and until the game was in full release. I have to say; this is by far the most polished and refined zombie survival sandbox experience I've ever had. The only limitations I belive it had was its budget; things such as amazing graphics -not that they're bad -I'm just used to high end AAA titles which boast amazing visuals. Knowing that the budget wasn't massive; Undead labs have reached for something quite ambitious. Have they pulled it off? I belive they have. This game is immersive and has enough variety between missions and sidemissions for it not to feel like a 'grinding' or 'mechanical' use of your time but an meaningful and deeply engaging experience.The great thing about it is you get the hoard fighting feel of L4D2 without the sense that you're just passing through but actually warding off hoards to defend yourself or your home. And when people die -espcially characters you put a good deal of time into; well it's meaningful; not in a tear to the eye way the Walking Dead boasts but in a way which means something to you because you played through the experience of the game, trained that character, equpped them, knew their skills and hobbies, had seen them interact with others and that's why it sucks when they die -not just because the narrative told you it was sad but because of the time you invested in that character. Thankfully the permadeath system does not halt your gaming experience but reverts you to alternate characters within your home base. Every decision you make and even to an extent, the WAY you carry out that decision (eg: reckless driving, putting things off too long or even friendly fire) can really make a difference to how the characters in the game react to you and the situation. Ammo is fairly rare and weapons arn't that common themselves, so you have to really mean it when you choose to draw your weapon instead of using melee combat -which makes the guns feel so much more desirable and your persona far more secure when you use them. Thankfully they're not too rare so if you miss a shot or decide to shoot a zombie that you'll fell bad.It isn't a complete sandbox like DayZ, there are missions and randomly generated side missions which keep coming so while you're free to prioritize hunting ammo or supplies you'll never have a sense of aimlessness.There is an element of stratergy invovled with SOD when it comes to upgrading and deligating resources for differrent things; do you want to prioritize defences around the perimiter of your homebase? Or is putting resources into a family dining arrangement to avoid discord within the walls of your base more important to you? There are many other decisions you can make with the investment of your resources which will directly impact on the readiness of your characters, weapons and vehicles when they are called upon.It's a pretty slow start and will initially require some more patience than the opening segments of most games but by the time you're 2 hours in you won't want to stop playing. It's managed to even pull me away from the latest release in my favourite game frachise ever within a month of it's release -the game I built this high end machine to play. And yet I find myself perfectly content lobbing off zombie's heads, or jumping in a car and running over zombies hordes at a time.SOD is an immersive, meaningful and addictive gaming experience which gives back so much more than what you pay for it by the gaming industry's standards today. Having said that I'm the kind of gamer who will persevere with what others consider to be punishing and sometimes repetitive games which demand persistence and patience such as Metro 2033, Far Cry 2 and the original Assasin's Creed. All things considered (including the liklely budget for the developers) I can not fault State of Decay. Personally; I'd give it a 10/10.			"

Posted: December 1, 2013
												When I first heard of State of Decay, it sounded amazing. A zombie game where I have detailed survival requirements that require me to scavenge nearby areas for supplies, giving me access to an open world where there are multiple areas to explore and find useful stuff in, challenges presented in the form of large groups of zombies and special ones, and best of all no other people to worry about ruining my fun by randomly coming by and shooting me in the face for no reason. The scavenging and community management elements of the game are spot on. Sneaking into abandoned buildings and picking them dry quickly while trying to keep the zombies away is so rewarding when you finally find the materials you need or the items you want. Making sure that everyone in the community is happy, healthy, and doing their part was quite fun. Story is pretty standard, zombie outbreak, you have to survive it, the Army did stupid stuff, and now we have to find a way out. This game falls into a similar category as Papers, Please wherein the gameplay itself can turn rather tedious but the implications and outcomes of your actions in the game are what's interesting. I spent a large portion of the game watching videos on youtube while just scavenging and it was extremely fun. The game is more about scavenging than it is about fighting zombies, which I suppose is more realistic for a zombie apocalypse. However, my biggest only real complaint about the game is that there are some missions that you need to do for story completion and they are locked off by a certain amount of in game time. For example, once you complete the mission Insubordination you have to wait about 3 in game days, which is about 6 hours, before you get access to the next bit of story. The idea is that you're supposed to do those missions first then do side-quests and scavenging  while waiting for the next mission to pop up. I tend to do side-quests first then the main quest so I don't end up missing any content. Unfortunately this meant that the last 8-9 hours of the game were just mindless scavenging while waiting for the missions to pop up. It didn't bother me too much because I enjoyed the scavenging and because I was watching videos but that sort of game design doesn't sit well with me. It's artificial game lengthening and I don't feel it's necessary or warranted. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed State of Decay as it played like a simpler, less brutal, and solo version of DayZ, which is something I've been waiting for.			"

												When first released, I blew this game off without a second thought-- mainly because it looked like a console game ported to pc to me, and I figured I already had the Dayz (early beta) L4D and Dead Island going.   An easy 'pass.'   However, after picking it up on sale, I'm loving it.   The ""Breakdown"" DLC especially.  It's like someone made a single player version of Dayz with less bugginess, and added in a healthy dash of base building and management.   Others say it's like a zombie themed Grand Theft Auto.   I wouldn't go that far, but I can see where they're getting that from.I'm sure in time I'll get bored, for the present, I'm loving it.  If you can pick it up for $20 or less, JUMP on it.			"

												Pros:-Pretty good graphics, runs good, never had the game crash.-Fun gameplay, I can play this feeling like how I would approach a zombie survival situation instead of being forced to follow certain rules and pre-determined paths.  Open world makes it fun.-Lots of melee, guns, and items to be found, you are rewarded for exploring and can actually load up a vehicle!-Upgrading and customizing character adds a lot to the game.-Upgrading your safehouse and choosing what to put in it is a good touch.Cons:-Buggy at times, have had zombies climb through walls and fences.-Seems a little un-realistic how many zombies are found in what I would consider secluded areas.-Easy for the most part,  you can clear out most places by getting a durable truck and backing over swarms.-Blah story for the most part, really didn't care too much about any of the characters.Very fun game that fits well into the zombie survival-horror genre.

												While you can certainly tell that this game was rushed out or lacked funding or had some other issue in its implementation and polish stages, that does not stop it from being probably the best zombie game on the market. It really is about managing your survivor group and your base and staying alive, and due to the leveling system you grow to care about certain characters. It is a shame interacting with other NPCs is so basic and that there are not a very large amount of random events (they end up getting recycled fairly fast) because the way that events take place in the world mostly seamlessly is impressive. There are certainly some bugs with the AI, and it's not very smart to begin with. Despite these few drawbacks I have mentioned, the sheer massive amount of ambition in the features the game has to offer more than makes up for it's failings. If you are interested in sandbox games or survival games, this is probably your best bet.			"

However even though it isn't easy it doesn't mean that is this not a fun game. That it the opposite of the truth, you need to plan, manage and stratigize  for the survival of you group. This game is already great I only wish that there was a co-op feature not multiplayer, just co-op so me and my friend could play together. I mean we still do we sit down and play but, I would love for co-op to have been a part of the game. However this is still a great game definately worth it especially for SoD and SoD: Breakdown.

Describing it with the hit name series is much simplier for me than to explain what State of Decay is about, but, lets get to it anyways. :)State of Decay brings you to a world with set objectives and has a storyline. Breakdown and Lifeline add's more of a open freedem make and survive you're choices. Everything from searching for loot, key objectives, survivors, cars, homes & forts. Infection is everywhere and the spawn system on the zombies can be you're dieing breath. Minor bugs do happen but overall the gameplay makes up for it. The game is updated every 3 months or so since I've got it. & sure everyone agree's, multiplayer or coop support would have made this game bigger news.SoundFX: 7.0Graphics: 8.0Gameplay: 8.0Fun Factor: 7.5Overall rating: 7.5			"

												If you like zombie survival games, you want this one. State of Decay is one of those rare gems that started out on the Xbox Arcade and was developed under that whole 2GB limit. I honestly would love to have seen what Undead Labs would have been able to do with this if they were not working under such restraints.The base game itself can play out in a number of ways. You have several bases to choose from, various weapons, vehicles that have their own set of stats (fast and flimsy or slow and durable). The main game has a storyline that can take a while to complete, an advancement system that lets you choose a set of skills to specialize for each person as you level them up (easy to miss if you're new, second tab in the character screen), and a colorful set of characters.The Breakdown DLC is the survival mode you want to play. This does have some drawbacks though; luckily it's not that expensive. Breakdown removes the story mode and puts you in the Trumbull map. After a while you'll find an RV, repair it, and move on to the next map. The next map is the same map but with harder zombies, more spawns, and a higher chance of being torn to pieces.Where my grievances come in with this DLC is the character parts were done a bit lazy. Most don't have their regular voices from the original game. Pastor Will has Ed's voice in mine and was once telling me how he got laid behind a park bench or something. So while minor, it's noticeable.(Edit: Adding in some new info now that I've had a chance to play Lifeline and the updates to fix things are likely finished) There are still some lingering glitches even after several updates, one of the most notable being that some zombies can at times run through the house and get stuck in the floor, Big'un zombies can sometimes glitch through doors and lead to mission failures or the death of a playable character if you're really unlucky. The Lifeline DLC is it's own map and introduces several new characters, weapons, and vehicles. While it's a fun little game with its own unique story to the SoD world, it offers less freedom than the original. In Lifeline you will have access to many new techs to help fight off the zombie hoards while you evacuate survivors. But as time goes on, you'll lose some of these advantages. Luckily you can get them back later, but the tradeoff is you'll have to sacrifice your outposts to certain areas to maintain them. You also work on a bit of a timer throughout the game. Hoards will periodically atack your base and you'll need to be back there to help fight them off or bad things will happen.All in all, Lifeline is a pretty decent story on its own, but I think the original game still stands as the better of the two.Overall, I can't recommend this one enough for fans of zombie survival and building games. With any luck Undead Labs will have a chance to expand on this one in the future and make something truly unique.			"

												This game is amazing. I bought it on the Xbox 360 and was dissapointed by the choppy framerate. The game could barely run at 30fps on console so I was really excited when I got State of Decay on PC and of course the game runs like butter on my rig. The game is a ton of fun and I have put about 40 hours into it and I plan on putting 40 more into it. My one gripe that I will get out of the way is that we had to pay for the Breakdown DLC (the sandbox mode) which was supposed to be apart of the intial release, but I got it on sale so I brushed that off. The story mode is a nice experience that you really don't have to follow, but if you want to progress, you might as well do it. It has a sense of urgency to it like the original Dead Rising (one of my favorite games) on the Xbox 360. You build a community, gather resources and help out other survivors while engaging in the main quest. However, do yourself a favor and buy the Breakdown DLC. This is where I put and will be putting the majority of my time in. This mode is fantastic and takes away the linear aspect of a main quest. You can play it for as long as you want or until you run out of the finite resources on the map. I love how you can play as a ton of survivors with their own traits and even have one tag along to help you. The permadeath feature is terrifying and getting attacked by more than 2 zombies makes you♥♥♥♥♥♥yourself. Every encounter is a white knuckle ordeal because you do not want your survivor to die. The survivors can be leveled up and specialized with adds some depth and personality to them. Minus a few glitches here and there, you can get passed them very easily. Plus, there is a decent amount of mods to help your State of Decay experience. For $20, you will get your money out of this game or $27 with the DLC. Must buy!			"

												Great fun, definately worth sinking a few  hours of trying to keep everyone alive and supplies coming in. Random missions are a bit much due to the frequency of events(missions) and the possible penalties incured for not addressing them. In addition, due to the frequency of random events (missions) very little time can be dedicated to exploration which is kind of drag considering how large the map is. All in All I highly recommend this game, worth every cent. Can't wait for a new DLC, breakdown was a lot of fun, hopefully a voice pack as well because it is weird that every other person has the same voice.			"

												Hello to all!State of decay is a joy to play.Hard at times but not hard enough to turn you down, can keep you coming back for more. All the DLC worth it and i wish there were more, as there is no similar game out there, (at least, as far as i am aware).The fact that your character can die anytime if you are not carefull, is what make it unique, in my opinion. Knowing your limits is key in battles and you should never leave home without being prepared for the worst. (As it should be if it was in real life).I would love to see a new instalment in the near future.Thank you.			"

												This game is one of the best open world zombie games I've ever played! Hours of fun and due to random loot and survivors, has great replay value! Would be far better with a coop online feature, and it is something I'd like to see in the future.			"

												I recommend this game to anyone who has an extra $20 lying around that isnt going anywhere else ...lol other than the hefty price for State of Decay, my personal rating for overall gameplay : A SOLID 8.5 / 10  Oh and btw if one should compare this game to any other Zombie-Style game, such as Left 4 Dead 2, one would find that State of Decay is somewhat similar in a way, but at the same time, it has MANY different gameplay features that differ compared to the competition... Finally, like I previously stated above, if you have the extra cash that you aint putting towards Metal Gear Rising LOL than Id def take this game for a ride! GL & HF !!!			"

												First off; this is NOT a zombie killing game. It's a zombie survival game. There's a big difference in how you play.There's also Perma-death. As in ""I made the wrong decision, now that survivor is dead for good."" So don't spend all your time with one survivor. Because if they die your group will be left considereably weakened overall. That's right. Group. Think in terms of ""Group survival"" not run-n-gun and you'll be fine.Don't worry though, as the game's not that hard once you figure the mechanics out. Deaths usually involve people running around overconfident in their ""skill"" at the game, only to aggro several passing Hoards and getting torn to shreds. It's about sneaking. It's about survival. It's not about running about like an idiot, thinking you can take on the entire world alone. I finished the Story mode without a single non-plot related death, after thirty-odd hours. Change the way you play zombie games and you'll find endless enjoyment, especially with the latest Breakdown DLC. That adds a fully story-free Sandbox mode, with lots of Story mode ""Hero"" character challenges to unlock.Watch a few youtube Let's Play clips like I did. Then buy it!*Note: This game has been on 50% sale in the past, so watch out for them in the future. Highly recommended.			"

												Totally enjoyed playing State of Decay. My only gripe is the main game is over far too quickly but this is somewhat bulked out by the first DLC entitled ""Breakdown"" which enables you to carry on playing the same map over and over with increasing difficulty but utilising your favourite six characters recruited as you go.  You can have as many recruits at your home base as you like but can only carry over six.  Choose carefully.			"

												Great game with high potential.Awesome music, though it would be welcome more often.The graphics are all right - the dynamic interaction between the world and you is on the other hand high, and this kind of makes up for the graphics, which aren't bad in any way.Game-wise it tends to become far too easy when you learn your way around. You stop fearing mobs of zombies and just mow them down. I've never lost a survivor to the zombies. (Except one I didn't want and committed suicide-by-zombie)The RPG elements, while unneeded, doesn't shine through and when a home event, mostly negative, happens, it happens, whether you prepared or not. Also a sandbox/unlimited mode would be nice. (Can't wait for Breakdown)Overall I think the game somewhat lives up to its potential. You will gather supplies and live through a zombie apocalypse, yes, though it tends to become a walk in the park.Also more urban areas and generally fewer vehicles (which are supposed to be rare but aren't) would be really welcome.Also, superzombies... Sigh... All right, most of these can be excused because an armoured zombie is just a zombie in a flak jacket or SWAT equipment, but the juggernaut is ridiculous. The Screamer is all right because, well... It's kind of fair game as well. The bloated zombie is just... Hardly ever meet it anyway.All in all, you'll want to play this game. It is very much worth the 18,99 €, though until BREAKDOWN it only has limited replayability.Expect to have fun and be entertained, but do not expect to find the new holy grail.			"

												When first released, I blew this game off without a second thought-- mainly because it looked like a console game ported to pc to me, and I figured I already had the Dayz (early beta) L4D and Dead Island going.   An easy 'pass.'   However, after picking it up on sale, I'm loving it.   The ""Breakdown"" DLC especially.  It's like someone made a single player version of Dayz with less bugginess, and added in a healthy dash of base building and management.   Others say it's like a zombie themed Grand Theft Auto.   I wouldn't go that far, but I can see where they're getting that from.I'm sure in time I'll get bored, for the present, I'm loving it.  If you can pick it up for $20 or less, JUMP on it.			"

												Truly one of the best value for money games I have ever bought. If you want to go on a zombie killing spree, you'll actually have to plan escape routes, bring supplies and be very mindful of what's going on around you, because if you go ahead and facetank the horde, you're gonna get murdered pretty quick!It incorporates what I don't see enough of in general zombie survival games, the SURVIVAL factor. You need to gather and store supplies in order to keep everything running correctly. Strength is in numbers, but the more people you recruit, the more supplies you have to dish out to everyone. If you don't meet your daily quota of supplies, then your camp can fall ill, or your defences can be weakened, etc. However, supplies are not in such a high demand that you'll find it a chore to go and find them, they balanced the feature very well.All in all, this is one of the most perfect zombie games that I've ever seen, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who's up for a survival game, and not just a mindless hack & slash.

												Intense zombie fun!  You can play as any of the characters that you interact with (once you are friends) and each has a back story and specific skills that can help the community that you create.  Scouting for resources is time consuming but an intrigal part of the game as that is how you meet new people and find new items.  Well made game with an engaging story and characters you actually can care about.  At times the situations can become so intense that I have found myself all tensed up that my shoulders actually hurt.I recommend this game if you are into story driven, challenging games.  You don't need to be a zombie fan to enjoy this game.The best part is driving around taking out hordes.  There is something gratefying about body parts flung through the air and your car covered in goo.  :)			"

												I am really enjoying this game. I am on my first playthrough, and it's pretty good. Personally, I like that this is a single player only game. Overall the game is entertaining and fun, with enough to do to keep you going for a while. I kinda wish that the playable area were larger. Gathering resources is basically your job alone, and you need to swap out characters every so often if you get hurt or things like that, there is no way to automate scavenging parties or things like that. You are always the only person leading a team outside the camp. Overall, 7/10. Worth the play, buy on sale if you are hesitant.			"

												Absolutely great game. If only they implemented multiplayer, it would have been the perfect zombie game if they had. Nevertheless, State of Decay absolutely had my heart and kept me on my toes. I had to wait all the way until the end before I wrote this though.I personally liked the story, though it flings you right into the action and explains the game a bit before sending you out by yourself to fare the harsh world. During your time in the game, you'll make decisions that will sway the happenings in Trumbull valley until you manage to escape. Whether you save every person you meet or leave them all to their grim demise, once you've settled into the church it all begins. Some of the zombie threats were very challenging, especially taking on specials alongside hordes, but it's all doable. Caution and preparation are key to success.Little shortcomings in the game include it's occasional oddity and glitch, one of which was a Juggernaut zombie somehow phasing through the fence AND the door to my base to slaughter one of my favorite characters. Another fault is in small effects not registering, like killing a specific special zombie not triggering the end of the mission. Apart from where the game acts up, it runs fairly smooth and I recommend playing it with a controller over keyboard and mouse.Oh Sgt. Erik Tan... So noble, yet so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. So jerky, yet so honest. Most memorable character to me.			"

												State of Decay is a delightful game to play. It does have replay value when it comes to the main story, Lifeline, and Breakdown. Now I do have a few complaints, however, but my overall view on the game is still good.The first and foremost complaint would be that there is no co-op. Of course what they did do for it as a substitute is use the in-game AI characters as your partners (the player can ask another member from the home base/community to come watch your back). I do like that idea, but they could have had the option to also have 2-4 player co-op.My second reason would be that there's not really any sort of dynamic weather system in the game. It would of course add to the atmosphere a little and make it seem slightly more like a realistic world, but the overall game is, of course, not a simulator. I just think that, in my opinion, dynamic weather would make the game a little more interesting in a way. Like the rain could affect the zombies somehow or the rain could cause some flooding down in Marshall. Or perhaps some snowy, cold weather that affects everyone. And fog which affects how far you see, so you can't see your enemies (zombies) coming as soon as you want.And the final reason would be a gas system. You know, for the vehicles. And I know in Lifeline there is a gas system for the generator, but that's only until you upgrade it into a solar powered generator. You, as the player, probably will use cars a lot throughout the game, so why not add in a gas system? Because how I see it, gas looks like the last resource you'll have left over that you'll have the most of. Now that's all I have to say about this game. And those reasons above don't really ruin the game for me and make me hate it, I just think it'll add to the experience and make it better. (Well, perhaps not the co-op for some because some people might have some troll-ish friends that'll like.... bring hordes to you, or leave you to battle with the mutated zombies, or even make sure you have to go a long distance just to get a car.)

												One of the better ""survival"" type games that I've come across. It starts off a bit janky and crappy, but stick with it until you get out of the starting area. When you get a good idea of how the game works, it can suck you in completely. It's single player, which may be why it works so well, but there's undoubtedly some missed opportunity there. Maybe in a sequel. Regardless, if you're interested in a smallish open world zombie survival game where you round up survivors, gather supplies and construct bases, etc. - this is worth picking up. A definite buy if it's on sale.			"

												I had real trouble deciding if I would give this a 'yes' or 'no'. If you want this review summed up in one sentence: The developers of State of Decay have made a wonderful basket of a game, but have then proceeded to fill it with too many eggs, some of which are of questionable quality.The game feels good, the controls certainly aren't sloppy - just wondering around the world feels quite enjoyable, the graphics aren't bad (they aren't brilliant either, but it falls far above acceptable), gunplay (from what I've done with it) has been well implimented, the stealth aspect is fairly nice too, but then we dig slightly further into this apple of a game and find the rotted meat of the game. The stealth of the game requires you to have near constant attention on everything around you to avoid alerting zombies - which on paper, seems fine, except you get no help with this. Some might claim this is to help with 'immersion', but I feel that this is the exact opposite. In the real world you have all five senses to notice danger, in this game you're limited to two (and even then, sound isn't all too helpful unless you have five speakers), but this is forgivable. I've not actually run into any problems as of yet that weren't brought about by my own hubris, but it does lead me neatly on to the camera. Third person perspective; good for glancing around corners before you've reached it, not good for getting caught in bushes when hiding from zombies, where the bush then obscures your vision. Given that a bit of the game is done indoors, first person perspective may have been much appreciated, but it wasn't. Again, not a big thing, it's usable as it is, but I'd have to give the stealth a 6/10.You're able to climb specific objects/buildings and take stock of your surroundings, examining a couple of shops from a vantage point and they're added to your map, spot a hoard of zombies and they get added too. A nice touch to the game - not required, but nice. You decide to go and loot a house and creep to it. After a sweep of the house to make sure there are no zombies - killing them if there are - you're given the option to set up an outpost. Don't know what an outpost is? As far as I can see, the game doesn't give much information on the subject either. You decide to loot the building, and make your way back home with some small loot. Your character is tired. How do you get them to sleep? Change to another character if you're friends with them. You want to give your items to them? Put them in the communal safe box (which gives you community points), change the character to a new one, and retrieve the items from the communal safe box (costing the same community points to remove - so you don't just go in and steal everything). When I heard that this game had the ability to swap between characters, I assumed it would mean inventory management and swapping whenever you wish on missions, but no. What this game allows for is a required change of characters to one of a different skillset, along with a needless method of inventory switching. Once you've switched your character, you decide to go out on another looting spree, however this time a side-mission pops up to go and rescue someone. If you don't do it, they die, and moralle drops. I can see why this was included - it fits the theme very well, but a fun game thematics alone does not make. I've seen a lot of people mention that this game is fairly 'realistic' and not like the Left 4 Dead style zombie-killing-spree, and for the most part, they're right to an extent. Like with all games it seems, the characters are so unfit they can't run any longer than thirty seconds (even the military woman), and weapons dont stick around forever. I can't say I've had enough epxerience with the game to see better tiered weapons, but the weapons I've had have been destroyed quicker than I would have liked. But now we get to the crux of this paragraph. While your characters are bound by the curse of real-life (or as much as the game can simulate it), the zombies are not. This isn't going to be a 'zombies-aren't-real-hurr-durr', but there are the occasional nine/ten foot zombies that can rip you in half.  When a game is trying to be realistic (or focus on the planning / building elements) and includes boss like zombies? This is what I meant about the too-many-eggs in one basket. Which then also leads onto the game continuing after you've stopped playing;I would LOVE this game if I could play it for a couple of hours, do a mission or two, upgrade my base, and then go, but no. The game insists on altering itself when you return - this could be just a drop in resources that the characters needed to stay alive, or a completed building - and again, this might be absolutly loved by some, but for me, it's just not something that I enjoy in this kind of game.Ok, I'm getting a bit bored of writing this now, I'm going to stop with a summary.For me, the game feels as if it's not finished yet. It may very well not be. Would I recommend the game at full price? No. Would I recommend this game at half-price or less? Yes, easily. "

												I'd rate this game at a B-. The concept is exactly what I believe people have been waiting for in a zombie game. Base building, character development, finding surviors and resource gathering. It's definately worth a play - but it's a one time play through. If this game comes out with some expansions and DLC then it would make a great game.In this game you start as a survior who came back to small town life to find the world in ruins and zombies everywhere. Your saved by the kindness of a small survival group that sets you on your way. The goal is to build a base camp, gather supplies to run your base and find other survivors then escape the militarized zone. PROSThe 3rd person shooter stand point makes it a fun action game while keeping in mind your need to keep finding materials to build. Keeps the game exciting. Backpack weightlimits and sizes are adequete as well. You'll have to pick and choose what you want to carry out and back and the game keeps this pretty accurate with stamina penalties for carrying more than you should. Character developments are ok as everyone you find has a different history, background and can benefit, or take away from, the work that needs to be done. For instance, you may find someone who was a chef and he can be your cook. Or you may find an alcoholic prick that is lazy and makes morale lower. It's easy enough to kill these people if you dont like them though. This small addition makes you feel a bit of a connection to the characters you find - and yes - anyone you find you can play as and take on missions.The game is wide enough to explore and can keep you on your toes as zombies chase you from one side of the map to the next. Nightfall makes things interesting and there is definately a spook factor. There are many different factions that you can help keep alive, or vice versa, but their role in the game is slim. Zombie base building is always exciting. There are many options to choose from depending on the size of your group and base size. Build your base depending on how you choose to play. Its always fun to come back from zombie killing to see the fruits of your labor flurishing behind a barbed wire fence. Definte plus.CONS:The game lacks story line and substance. The game itself is actually pretty short and the story doesn't leave you in awe. Plus, you find yourself running the same missions over and over again ultimately praying a person from the main quest line shows up so you can move on. The regurgitation of the same missions seems non-stop and frankly gets annoying.Along the lines of substance - you only fight one enemy! What happened to raiders or rival survivors groups! What about fighting the military? This makes it a bit less attractive and in my opinion much easier to win.You also do not get the ability to choose who stays at base camp to defend and work and who runs willy nilly through town. Its frustrating to come back from a mission to see half your people have run off into the city and are unavailble to you - then you have to go off to save them. You dont get to assign duties as the game automatically chooses. It'd be nice to have more control over assignments.Lots of glitches that need to be worked out. You'll run into invisible rocks, walk through closed doors or jump through windows that don't shatter. Zombies will get stuck in walls then suddenly appear. The driving is a tad glitchy and frames can skip causing unintended collisions. Overall its not too bad but little things like that can make the game much more enjoyable.Resources!! There are three main types - Food, Ammo and Fuel? Yes Fuel. I never once used it. That seems more like a commodity especially since the game doesn't give you any reason to have it. Water would seem more appropriate. That seems like an unforgivable oversight in a zombie survival game.OVERALL:Its definately worth one play through - maybe buy it when its on sale. If the creators worked 3 more months on the game it could have been turned into a great game. With some DLCS and patches this game could become great.			"

												Highly recommend. While the game is by no means flawless, it delivers a truly worthwhile and novel experience. The difference comes from not simply dealing with stockpile numbers as part of the survival horror experience, but needing to manage and prioritize an entire community of human resources, where and how to build a base, what facilities to maintain, how many and which survivors to recruit, then bother to support and protect. It succeeds in creating a ""Sim Community"" experience within a survival horror apocalypse, meanwhile still predominantly being a tight action game.			"

												I originally tried the demo on Xbox 360, and the only thing that hit my was how ugly it was. After that it could have played like a Big Mac and an ice cold beer, and I still would have been looking how awful the graphics were.However, I did like the idea, and when I saw it was coming out on PC I was interested. Graphics are not much better, but at least 1080p is supported so it just looks a bit unpolished, and not resembling a zombie minecraft like it does on the 360.Would I recommend? Sure, it's a nice, deep game. Once you get used to the interface then it really opens up. Running missions, improving your character, building bases up. Very fun, and very enjoyable. One thing to be wary of, that bloke you start off as? If he dies, that's it...no coming back you have to be a new person and start levelling their skills again. Makes it quite tense knowing you may actually really lose some hard work if you die.Anyway, top game, well worth it. A bit glitchy here and there, but nothing that's a game killer.Buy.			"

												Now that I've got a solid number of hours under my belt and played the crap out of breakdown i feel more confident in giving a review. This game is buggy as hell. This game needs patches. BADLY. Driving a vehicle will cause your framerate to drop. Driving a vehicle is also dangerous because giving certain objects the lightest tap can send you and your vehicle into LOW ORBIT. There are also multiple texture glitches that cause large black squares to appear on the ground. Often times during combat, you will notice your weapon passing harmlessly trhough enemies allowing them to latch onto your backside and chew on you.During missions it is also possible for the waypoint to fling itself off the minimap and thus become unreachable, making it difficult to complete the mission. It can also become permanently stuck on the map after completion of the mission making it IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPLETE ANOTHER MISSION UNTIL AFTER GAME RESTART. Oh and did we mention you can't save during a mission? This means you'll lose an untold amount of progess.Certain LAUNCHER errors can cause the game to crash an hour or two after it launches. TLDR HEY DEVS FIX THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME! In spite of all the glitches and bugs I still love playing it and 30 hours in I am still nowhere near done playing it. Definitely got my money's worth playing this game. Just wish they would fix some♥♥♥♥♥♥My advice? Buy it, it is a fun game, it just needs more polishing. The DLC is good too, I can't get enough of Breakdown.			"

												Very addictive and clever Zombie Apocalypse simulation. For those wondering it's pretty much Grand Theft Auto meets your favorite zombie simultor (Day Z / War Z). Don't take State of Decay lightly, it has the true ""end of the world"" environment, meaningful missions, crafting, weapon decay, group management and so much more.Where Dayz and War Z fail, State of Decay excels! True randomization of enemy hordes that actually make zombies a REAL threat. Lack of ammunition, food, and other supplys force the player to take real care in their movements to prevent the loss of their group. One your favorite character dies the story continues on without themIn my personal opinion if you are a fan of the zombie genre you should pick this little gem up immediately.			"

												It is what it is: an open world action game with zombies.  There isn't much of a story to speak of, and the characters are roughly the same.  Some may have different skills or traits, but it is only a slight variation that doesn't change a whole lot.  You can get the character you start with killed, and the game will continue on with you playing someone else.  In that plus the base building and scavenging, it tries to be a somewhat realistic apocalypse survival type game.  It does so decently albeit with an arcade feel.It's the standard open world in which you can go where ever and do what ever with missions thrown in as well.  Missions are divided up into story missions and missions to help survivors in your group that got in trouble (basically when you don't control them there is a chance they go outside your base to do whatever).  Then you also have to scavenge for items and equipment to make sure your base can survive.  You are, relatively, freely able to switch between all the survivors in your group (some excepts to this though).			"

												Very fun zombie game. Deals with the logistics of survival as much as the combat. You build up a group of survivors, scavenge supplies from the area, and build up a stronghold. Then, move to a different area and do it again. It's low on production quality. The story isn't particularly strong, there are some difficulties with controls (though they're making a patch to address some of them), and it doesn't feel like a AAA title. On the other hand, it's a lot of fun if you like zombie survival.			"

												This review was posted on 5/31/2014.Now, I wanted to make this post about Lifeline but it wouldn't be fair to talk about only the DLC. I decided to include the game in general.State of Decay is absolutely a must have for those who enjoy Zombie Apocalypse Simulators. The gameplay is fun, suspenseful and sometimes risks need to be taken to survive. When you have to fight zombies it's best to avoid the large groups because you WILL die, it's a problem you may have to deal with and sometimes you'll lose your favorite guy in the group. You will constantly need to restock on supplies especially after you come back, Things will happen even when you're not playing. I know because when I came back the next day there was three to five missions on my map and my supplies went down a couple digits.I enjoyed the campaign, it was interesting and it kept my imagination trying to figure out what was going on. There were times when the game deviated from the main plot but it wasn't too bad. There was also the deal with expendable cars, if you blow up a car it's gone for good. No reparing a dead car so if you can you should make the effort to avoid hitting large crowds of zombies or your vehicle will get bent out of shape.In the Breakdown DLC you are basically playing in sandbox mode, at the start you pick a settlement with what little supplies you have and start where you want in a small area with very few survivors. You can just focus on survival, and there is also the part where if you are able to perform certain tasks you can gain special survivors. But when you're moving on to a higher difficulty in Breakdown you can only bring a handful of your survivors so choose carefully.I don't know much about Lifeline but I will say this, it's a refreshing change of scenery, literally. A whole new map, with a whole new storyline. It may be the same gameplay but I was surprised by how much was changed. There are some bugs but they're not game-breaking.I personally believe this game has alot of potential and with the new DLC I certainly believe Undead Labs is in the process of something great. Take my word for it when I say, if your a fan of Zombie games this one is a must. "

Posted: December 1, 2013
												While this game offers a unique survival simulator, it is terribly hampered with several deep flaws that detract from the overall quality of the game:1: No actual save option. You only get a single autosave per campaign that will often trigger at awkward moments when you didn't want it to save. What's that, you spent many hours trying to get a character to elite status and you make one mistake and blunder into a feral zombie? Too bad, your character is now dead, FOREVER. You cannot make a mistake, not a single mistake, and this would not be so bad if the poorly programmed AI didn't take control of the characters you are not currently controlling (basically all but one), but it does, so sometimes it's not even your pleasure to make that mistake.2: Idiotic AI. This includes things like: Not helping out in a melee fight for survival, running straight into zombie hordes when sent on a scavenging pickup mission, or even not defending the base when a zombie night raid summons. 		3. Emotionally immature characters. While your out and about kicking zombie♥♥♥♥♥and gathering precious supplies for your home base, the characters at base will become discontent very quickly and easily, and the only way to prevent them from draining the moral of the base is to take them out on little suicidal raids on zombie infestations. If it was just a quick conversation in home base it would not be an issue, but you have to go out of your way to some randomly selected zombie place and fight side by side with them in order to cheer them up. But of course right after you complete that mission you might have to do it again, for the SAME character, just half a day cycle later. I thought this was a zombie survival game, and not Dr. Phil with a shotgun?4. Broken hit-boxes and glitched zombies. If there was one resource that was perhaps the most precious in this game it would be ammo, and there just happens to be a horrible glitch that drains this precious resource: Sometimes when new zombies spawn at a location they are out of phase with the game, thus when you shoot rounds at their head the bullets go straight through and do nothing. Sometimes you will have to run around in circles to wait for them to engage you and then you can actually hit them with a weapon.  5. Skewed third-person shooting. While it is perfectly normal for third person shooters to have the camera just above the right shoulder when looking down the sights of a gun, this game has that same effect exaggerated to a unbelievable extent. Instead of it being just over the shoulder, the camera rests several feet away from the shoulder, as if it were the perspective of a drill instructor. Unfortunately, the invisible drill instructor cannot help you aim better as the mouse sensitivity and aim axis is wobbly and frustrating to master. I can understand the aiming to get wobbly if the character was fatigued, but to have it this inaccurate as a default just screams troll intent from the game developers.6. Your outposts are only somewhat effective. While it is advertised in game that establishing an outpost at a location will stop zombies from spawning in the area, this is a lie. Even after having several overlapping outposts in a given area, you might still have zombies spawn on the main thoroughfares. While outposts do indeed reduce the amount of zombie spawns, the effectiveness of outposts is one of degree and not definition. Overall I would say this game is too plagued with glitches and suffers from poor execution of brilliant game concepts. While the auto-save only function can be argued to be an effort by the developer to make the game seem more hardcore, the fact that you are FORCED into the auto-save-only system takes away the freedom of the gamer and thus the ability of the gamer to fully enjoy the game. What they should have done is offer a choice between a regular mode (that has normal save and load functions) and then a hardcore mode that would be autosave only (for those with the patience to wade through trolled frustration).  		This game has crippled my appetite for zombie survival games, and I now regret even purchasing this game on sale for ten dollars.  "

												I’m completely enamored with this game. Put simply this is a fun game to jump into casually. It does however have its quirks albeit random such as driving into a horde only to have your car suddenly flip high into the sky. Character then tossed from the car only to land back down again amongst the horde and devoured…. Hmmm sad day, sad day. But this is a rarity and the regular updates help keep things balanced.The randomness however equally appeals prolonging it’s game play from the immediate main quest. If I can make an extra recommendation, grab the DLC Breakdown. The DLC is essentially for those wanting more of a challenge after fleshing out the main game. It essentially jumps in after the prolog from the main game. In part it almost feels like a prequel minus the main quests. But it’s the DLC's infinite play that gets progressively harder that has its main appeal.			"

												An amazing sandbox. You can literally go anywhere, do anything. Complete survival management. There are several uprgades for your bases but you have to think ahead. You need to meet the needs of your fellow survivors so they don't leave you for another group because they might have more food etc. Amazing game, I'd say the first in the FPS/RTS genre that really delivers. And there's a ton of zombies to kill.			"

												Best Zombie game to date has the feel of an open world The Walking Dead/28 Days later. Though some of side missions can get annoying when they pop to often. The tower defense mechanic, leveling of character, resource management and base building makes it the zombie game I always wanted. Oh yea not for the faint of heart! Prepare for a lot of tension while playing, due to actually creepy zombies!			"

												Huge world, I know of invisible walls, but normal play has never taken me to one. I've had a lot of fun with both the base game and the DLC. Sometimes story items are inconviniently far away from my location, but I suppose the zombie apocolipse wouldn't exactly be the most convinient thing overall. Big modding community, lots of great mods. The lady who gives you missions is naggy and talks to you about every little thing, I added a mod that made her shut up. 7/10 - Would buy on sale again.

												A REVIEW BASED ON HOW MUCH GAME MONEY YOU HAVE AND THE GENRES YOU LIKEI could give you a long complicated review of the pros and cons, wheather this is a good game etc etc, but there are already hundreds of those ( and yes it is a good game). Here is am going to tell you wheather or not you should buy it based on your favourite genres and the amount of money you have free for games. I have picked the 3 genres/ tags that will help you decide. So, first pick the genre or genres of games you like the most then read on from there:IF YOUR FAVOURITE GENRE IS ZOMBIES: This is a great zombie game that i really enjoyed. This will be one of your favourites that will go on your list of true zombie survival games. Note: all these prices are based on the presumption you are buying the game on saleSo if you have $ free:                          $20+: Definatly grab this                          $10-20: Grab this                          $5: As long as you are not saving up for anything grab this                          $0: I would suggest getting some more steam credit and buying thisIF YOUR FAVOURITE GENRE IS SURVIVAL:This will be a decent surival game that you will remember. It lacks the basic functions such as a hunger and a food bar. However it makes up in the fact that it requires you to gather neccasary resources, and has fatigue and sickness ( as well as a few others). Note: all these prices are based on the presumption you are buying the game on saleSo if you have $ free:                          $20+: Grab this, you will enjoy it                           $10-20: Nothing to run out for, only grab this if you have already played the major surivivals such as                           dayz, dont starve etc.                          $0- 5 If you are getting more game money soon then grab it, but dont go out of your way for just thisIF YOU ENJOY BOTH SURVIVAL AND AND ZOMBIE GAMES:Chuck what you were playing out the window and grab this! IF YOUR FAVOURITE GENRE IS SHOOTERSThis is not a shooting game! Dont think that for one second. It has guns however you wont be using them much and they have a very slow progression. If you want to try out the other 2 listed genres then grab this but not if your looking for a shooting game!IF YOU PLAY NONE OF THESE GENRES:This is a good taste test for a zombie and survival game. It includes solid but not everwhelming gameplay, and should give you a good idea of wheather or not you like the genre. However if you have no urge to start playing zombie/ survival games then move on.I hope this different type of review helped, and give it a thumbs up if it did :)			"

												I waited until the early access phase had ended and until the game was in full release. I have to say; this is by far the most polished and refined zombie survival sandbox experience I've ever had. The only limitations I belive it had was its budget; things such as amazing graphics -not that they're bad -I'm just used to high end AAA titles which boast amazing visuals. Knowing that the budget wasn't massive; Undead labs have reached for something quite ambitious. Have they pulled it off? I belive they have. This game is immersive and has enough variety between missions and sidemissions for it not to feel like a 'grinding' or 'mechanical' use of your time but an meaningful and deeply engaging experience.The great thing about it is you get the hoard fighting feel of L4D2 without the sense that you're just passing through but actually warding off hoards to defend yourself or your home. And when people die -espcially characters you put a good deal of time into; well it's meaningful; not in a tear to the eye way the Walking Dead boasts but in a way which means something to you because you played through the experience of the game, trained that character, equpped them, knew their skills and hobbies, had seen them interact with others and that's why it sucks when they die -not just because the narrative told you it was sad but because of the time you invested in that character. Thankfully the permadeath system does not halt your gaming experience but reverts you to alternate characters within your home base. Every decision you make and even to an extent, the WAY you carry out that decision (eg: reckless driving, putting things off too long or even friendly fire) can really make a difference to how the characters in the game react to you and the situation. Ammo is fairly rare and weapons arn't that common themselves, so you have to really mean it when you choose to draw your weapon instead of using melee combat -which makes the guns feel so much more desirable and your persona far more secure when you use them. Thankfully they're not too rare so if you miss a shot or decide to shoot a zombie that you'll fell bad.It isn't a complete sandbox like DayZ, there are missions and randomly generated side missions which keep coming so while you're free to prioritize hunting ammo or supplies you'll never have a sense of aimlessness.There is an element of stratergy invovled with SOD when it comes to upgrading and deligating resources for differrent things; do you want to prioritize defences around the perimiter of your homebase? Or is putting resources into a family dining arrangement to avoid discord within the walls of your base more important to you? There are many other decisions you can make with the investment of your resources which will directly impact on the readiness of your characters, weapons and vehicles when they are called upon.It's a pretty slow start and will initially require some more patience than the opening segments of most games but by the time you're 2 hours in you won't want to stop playing. It's managed to even pull me away from the latest release in my favourite game frachise ever within a month of it's release -the game I built this high end machine to play. And yet I find myself perfectly content lobbing off zombie's heads, or jumping in a car and running over zombies hordes at a time.SOD is an immersive, meaningful and addictive gaming experience which gives back so much more than what you pay for it by the gaming industry's standards today. Having said that I'm the kind of gamer who will persevere with what others consider to be punishing and sometimes repetitive games which demand persistence and patience such as Metro 2033, Far Cry 2 and the original Assasin's Creed. All things considered (including the liklely budget for the developers) I can not fault State of Decay. Personally; I'd give it a 10/10.			"

												I grabbed this on X-Box when it first came out, then got the PC port for XMas, and I have to say I like the PC port a lot better.A typical zombie game, but with managing survivors, building strongholds, and of course, the over-arching story you can take your time to follow. I prefer more sandbox games, but this one still is very good.If you like zombie games and survival games, this one should fill your desire for both.			"

												Great fun, definately worth sinking a few  hours of trying to keep everyone alive and supplies coming in. Random missions are a bit much due to the frequency of events(missions) and the possible penalties incured for not addressing them. In addition, due to the frequency of random events (missions) very little time can be dedicated to exploration which is kind of drag considering how large the map is. All in All I highly recommend this game, worth every cent. Can't wait for a new DLC, breakdown was a lot of fun, hopefully a voice pack as well because it is weird that every other person has the same voice.			"

												A 3rd person game that scratches the itch of playing a more action intensive ""The Walking Dead"" (the current TellTale games for TWD are incredible though).  Whereas the TellTale games focus on telling a story and mixing in moments of action, State of Decay focuses on action and mixes in enough story to keep things moving.  The story in State of Decay is pretty darn good!The game starts off with you controlling a specific character.  It doesn't take long before you can toggle between characters and head off into the Zed filled abyss.  You do have to earn the trust of any character before you can play as that character.  There's enough story to keep a game like this moving with purpose, yet the game is built to allow you choose not to pursue the storyline.  Randomly generated missions can keep you entertained, while you move your nomadic tribe around to different temporary homes (main base).  Only a limited number of buildings can be converted to be your main base.  Very briefly let me say - this is not a lone wolf style game.  You may go off and handle certain things ""on your own"", but this game is intended for you play as part of a surviving, nomadic group.You can upgrade your main base to increase your defensive posture against incoming Zed hordes.  Maybe you want to increase your storage capacity so you can hold more food, medicine, ammo, or construction materials.  Perhaps you want to integrate a workshop to build home made weapon attachments...and even allow for repairs to the limited number of vehicles that exist in game.  There are enough options to warrant multiple playthroughs, and there are enough NPCs with special skills that you can recruit along the way to help you towards whatever goal you have in mind for your base.You may have limited options when choosing to move your main base, but those options broaden when you start considering which buildings you wish to use for an outpost.  Outposts add a powerful advantage to your surviving group (no...you don't get Daryl).  Outposts allow you to build mines\traps.  You don't actually physically walk around and setup the traps.  Instead you spend some Influence and hit a button.  And...WHAMO!  The next time a horde is tracking through the nearby area.  BOOM.  A very nice feature to have.Influence is a type of in game currency that is earned through actions that positively benefit your group.  It can degrade over time if left unused.  The Influence system works for the game very well.  It is very fun to break into homes, clear out Zeds, and take all the supplies back to base.  And when you deposit the extra supplies into your base's stash you gain Influence.  The developers did well to make sure earning Influence feels fun!Fighting Zeds is fun, particularly melee.  Gunplay can be effective, but aim for the head and use a suppressor to reduce the chances of attracting more Zeds due to the noise.  Targeting can be a challenge.  Just because you've lined up the targeting reticule does not mean you are going to hit that exact spot.  Through the building of your character, unlocking special moves & improving gun play accuracy can make encounters very satisfying.  Fighting can quickly drain your stamina.  Without stamina you cannot run and you cannot effectively fight.  You can increase your stamina cap over time.  You can also increase your proficiency with melee combat, which will assist by making your stamina decrease at a slower rate when in combat.  Still...I find it mildly annoying at the small amount of fighting that can generally be handled at any given time.  The developers would tend to agree, as they have worked in a system where you can spend Influence and ask a fellow survivor (who trusts you) to accompany you on missions.  THIS IS VERY USEFUL!I have many hours playing this game on the Xbox 360 before it was very handily ported over to the PC.  Button mapping is available, as is full controller support.  I have not yet played the Breakdown DLC.  I have not completed the game's storyline.  I recommend this game to those who can handle mature dialog, blood, and violence.  Parents, make sure you check out some YouTube footage before letting your child play this game.Review also at www.blog.trollercon.com "

												Other zombie games out there are either:1. Completely broken (The WarZ, DayZ) and unplayable2. Way too hardcore and punishing, not for having fun, and only multiplayer (Project Zomboid, Rust, DayZ, Left 4 Dead series, etc...)3. Lacking all kinds of features that make it a fully fledged open world survival game (all of the aforementioned)This game not only is immersive (singleplayer only) is playable and doesn't have many bugs, and gives you the ""fun"" factor that is missing in all of the other zombie games, you get to actually experience killing zombies without dying in 2 hits or being killed by another player for the lulz. Permadeath is a thing in this game, but you will barely experience it.Some people will not like it to not be very challenging, thus the DLC came with, enhanced difficulty and other options.All in all, a very fun open world survival game that deserves your time.

												Pros:-Pretty good graphics, runs good, never had the game crash.-Fun gameplay, I can play this feeling like how I would approach a zombie survival situation instead of being forced to follow certain rules and pre-determined paths.  Open world makes it fun.-Lots of melee, guns, and items to be found, you are rewarded for exploring and can actually load up a vehicle!-Upgrading and customizing character adds a lot to the game.-Upgrading your safehouse and choosing what to put in it is a good touch.Cons:-Buggy at times, have had zombies climb through walls and fences.-Seems a little un-realistic how many zombies are found in what I would consider secluded areas.-Easy for the most part,  you can clear out most places by getting a durable truck and backing over swarms.-Blah story for the most part, really didn't care too much about any of the characters.Very fun game that fits well into the zombie survival-horror genre.

												I would definately recommend this game to anyone who enjoys playing zombie killing games, I loved it!A brief summary about this game: - Its singleplayer and has a great main story (it also has plenty of side missions) - It has a large open world so you can run off to explore and scavenge for resourcres when you want - During the story more new bases become available that you can move to (and upgrade to add different types of rooms eg library, garden, repairshop, etc all with different benefits) if you choose- You meet new survivors and they can join your group and you can change to control each one when you are friendly enough- Each survivor has different traits and you can choose different fight styles to level up - You can use vehicles to move around the map quickly but noise attracts zeds- There are different types of zombies to fight (eg: ones that explode) - When you exit the game real time continues ingame and so depending on how many days it is before you login different things can happen without you, usually resoucres used for different events so you need to build them up again or you need to talk to another survivor who is upset/angry and not coping well.Although there are so many alpha zombie games right now and state of decay is older and only singleplayer, I still believe its a classic and worth grabbing in a sale :)			"

												This game is completely amazing! Nothing more satisfying than hearing the music ramp up as I knee zombies in the face, splattering beautiful guts all over the place with a marvelous crush sound. The sounds and animations are completely gorgeous and well done, using a sword and slicing through zombies feels sooooooooooo damn good!The game takes good things from all sorts of genres, it has great elements of role playing, strategy, action, survival, shooters and even stealth sims. The game has great replayabilty and is highly addictive, warning!There are definitely things that could be improved. Some missions and when or where they pop up are really annoying. losing characters is very sad (kind of a good thing maybe), carrying rucksacks gets very old, NPCs on scavenger missions just stand there even with zombies around. Overall though, I might complain, but the game is so completely awesome, it's so good that any problem feels meaningless.GREAT GAME.			"

												At first when I started playing State of Decay I was slightly put off by the lack of polish. There's a ton of things that looks like it needs fixing. A lot of the layout seems everwhelming since nothing gets explained properly.  And it is probably the most frustrating pc game to play with a Mouse and Keyboard (don't even try). This game is meant to be played on a controller. The UI is messy, there's a lot of things that they could have implimented better,However, with that said. This has got to be the best Zombie Survival game I've ever played. Once you get a few hours in and read up a little bit the whole puzzle fits together. I am truly in love with this game.			"

												Far more entertaining with the sandbox DLC. It is somewhat disappointing that the game doesn't have a better framerate. It would be a fairly interesting game to play with limited multiplayer options ( co-op or 4 player lobby - I don't believe the game could support an MMO gameplay style and maintain any sense of survival horror ). Over all recommendation - catch it while it's on sale, it's not worth the full price of admission.			"

												I really like how this game focuses on survival and fighting off zombies. Once you build a community you have to go out and gather ressources to survive, and don't be careless out there because you will get overrun and killed. The fighting system is really simple and fun wether you choose to go melee or use guns. The zombies animations and movements are nice and fluid and thier artificial intelligence is simple and well done. They react to sound and light and will run to you if you make too much noise. You can still sneak around them, especially in the dark and score a few stealth melee kills wich is always nice. I also like how you can choose to build your community by finding more survivor, controlling certain characters to level them up and get them to learn new abilities and be stronger. You have quite a big map to explore as well, a lot of scavenging to do. You have to be carefull to keep the zombie population in check around your home base so it doesn't get overrun. The gameplay is really fun and well done. And of course, among all of that, you have a nice little quest story line that gets you to learn about what  happened and what caused all this. Although not everything is answered at the end of the game it opens the door for a nice sequel or expansion. I give this game a 9 out of 10 because the only downside is that you cannot bring your friends to play with you in co-op... how awesome would it have been.			"

												STATE OF DECAY vs. PROJECT ZOMBOIDI originally purchased Project Zomboid when it hit steam and was fairly happy with it. It seemed like the ultimate zombie survivor game as anything that could be scavenged could be and was useful and the zombies were actually scary and threatening.That was until I bought State of Decay WITH Breakdown dlc.With the addition of the dlc, State of Decay becomes a truely open-world zombie survival game. If you ever wanted to have your own Walking Dead adventure, this is what you need.Where PZ dropped the ball was in the sense of isolation. Granted, that was a feeling they were going for and it works well, this same loniless would make the game at times boring to play. This was due in large part to the lack of npc's. State of Decay works with the group of survivors trope and charges you with scavenging food, medicine and weapons on a cosistent basis to keep them alive. Decay also incorporates the use of vehicles and 3d space, so when driving or simply walking through an abandoned and infensted town, you truely feel like you are living out this adventure. I know that PZ is still in beta and if it every does fulfill all of it's promises then it may truely rival or beat State of Decay.Until till, this is the game you want if you want to live the Walking Dead fantasy, but NOT if you want to simply slaughter zombies. This game requires more strategy than L4D or Dead Rising.			"

												I personally think its a really solid game. It feels polished now that it is out of early. The game is fun, combat is pretty balanced, and the new dlc has made re-play alot better. I definently got my $26 worth of the game and the dlc, and hope to see more content and mods released for it. If $20 is a bit to heavy on the wallet, I would atleast wait to get it durring a steam sale..			"

												I drive my car down the highway, and screech off the side as I hop out of the vehicle.  Lily told me not to use cars (they attract zeds) but I don't really care.  Suddenly, I realize that I'm surrounded by three hordes.  Too far away from my car, I begin to shoot rapidly into the crowd of zeds, until I get pulled apart and see a screen:  ""Marcus is dead.""  I waited for the ""Game Over"" section.  It didn't come.  Soon I respawned back at my home base to realize that Marcus was dead forever, and I had to take up a new survivor.  This game is lethal, a blast, and is one more step closer to the perfect Zombie MMO everyone would buy.  You will find yourself getting attached to characters, investigating things, and dodging hillbilly mafia.  Buy it, and get hours of enjoyment.			"

												After just over 9 hours of play I thought this game delivered what it promised. A survival game with multiple dimensions and excellent replay ability. The ""one life"" aspect is fantastic as I have not played a game in quiet awhile with this feature and it really added to the game play. Whenever you lost someone to either a miss calculation or complete underestimation of the other side, it really made you think twice the next time out. Only negative is the lack of an immediately available online feature in the vanilla version of the game.			"

												its a great game and it makes you think about where to go and not to focus on one person and its a good touch to give when you need to stay on your toes and it runs even if you dont play it so when you come back and play it some  missions that were there before are passed by and new ones appear and the story is really good and the character traits some of them dont matter but stats like cardio,powerhouse,leadership,fighting,shooting actually matter and all in all its a great game to play my rating is 9/10stars			"

												To date, this game is the best re-creation of the feel of the AMC series, ""The Walking Dead"".  This is one of the finest indie games I have played and better than a lot of stuff out of huge mega corps.This is a gather resource/build community/follow multithreaded adventure model.  You can follow the storylines or go completely sandbox.  Your interaction with the locals in the game can benefit you, but if you feel like going your own way, you can still have a blast with this game.If you are a zombie fan, you owe it to yourself to at least try this game.

												Open world, third person survival zombie game with choice based missions.- Has a story and a plot, that goes like most good zombie series.- Day/night cycle. Zombies become more aggressive at night.- Kill, explore, gain allies, gather ressources and build bases/outposts.- Switch between characters. Life, stamina and injuries are essential factors.- Skill system for each character making them good at different tasks.- Use cars to drive around the map and slaughter zombies.- A lot of different weapons including swords, machetes, snipers, shotguns, assault rifles, grenade launchers etc.In generel good/bad:- A lot to explore. The gameplay is addictive and fun.- Graphics are ok and sounds are good. - Controls not the best, but can be played. Cars are stiff in handling. (console port).- It has no MP, but does not need it, as the SP is satisfying long enough, to keep you going.Similar game(s): - It reminds me a bit of Dead Island, which I played on the PS3. That game went more fluid for me than this one.However Dead Island is much more linear than State of Decay. Also Dead Island is easier than State of Decay.Score: 9/10.			"

												Generally enjoyable although somewhat repetitive. Night time lasts too long and is just way too dark - like frustratingly dark (not atmospheric, you just can't see what you are doing). Has some nice touches like player deaths (if  you die you can become another survivor in your camp), caring for cars (they aren't endless). Environment is big, but most of it wasted in just driving around. Car physics is average. Searching for stuff is tedious. Combat is pretty  clunky. No crafting of weapons. Storyline predicatble but ok. All that said, it kept me going and was worth the price paid in the sale.			"

												For once a nice, realistic zombie survival game, where you don´t chase mad scientists, secret organizations or evil geniuses as some kind of super agent or something. You play as a community that needs food, medicine, guns, doctors, builders, fighters and more to survive in a place of your choice (which you can change at anytime, why not move into that old warehouse? it has nice strategic position. move up!). It can become slightly monotonic, but not quite like the 1st AC, because there are always some new quests, world events or things to strive for. Highly recommended.			"

												this is my thoughts on the base game!a GTA,Saints Row... like 3rd person view zombie survivor game! its only single player which i have no problem and its very fun to play.there is almost no story but game has its depth in building a community, base layout and working on your members skills builds. i find it very addictive and love it.The game has lots of weapons! and many characters with different traits. the variation is so high that you will not see all weapons and characters in one playthrough which adds a replayability to the game.I find the art style of the game unique, specially the zombies and characters! i would love to have more customization options but there are mods which just do that for you.the game has a learning curve, its not hard to learn but need play time to master it and become badass.there are 1 or 2 minor issues which really doesn't worth mentioning! nothing game breaking at all. like sometimes very rarely it happens a zombie glitches through a wall but very rarely.i absolutely ""recommend"" this game further to everybody who can handle the gore and blood. and i wish to see a sequal to this game.best single player zombie game out yet.

												The pinnacle of zombie games, State of Decay has raised the bar for any future zombie games. The mix of base building, driving simulator, and fighting comes together to bring a satisfying experience. My favorite, is the fact that zombies can only be killed with headshots. Add to that the fact that your gunshots will bring more zombies and you have a very finite amount of ammunition and you will end up slugging it out with a 2x4 and golf club. There are no such thing as electrified machetes or goofy weapons. The game has a good mixture of realism without forgetting it is a game. Another aspect is that you dont just play as one character. You can play as any of the survivors that are in your community. Each has there own set of skills and abilities. In the end, this is the zombie game we have been waiting for.			"

												It's fun for a while, but begins getting repetitive.The story is fairly uninteresting (of what little there is) and the characters are pretty void of actual character. Running over zombies and shooting them with a sniper is, and always will be a blast, which is ideally the only reason I found this game enjoyable.Scavanging and looking for supplies to upgrade your base is also kind of cool, but while doing this you're often forced to go do something to make sure your incompetent fellow survivors don't get killed.All in all, it's good. I liked it, and I'll reccomend it. Most of the game is pretty well done, and if zombies are you kind of thing then go for it, but if you're on the fence maybe look at some gameplay before making the decision. Oh, and obligatory complaint about it not having multiplayer. The game is begging for it, but the developers have clearly stated their disinterest in adding multiplayer to the game.			"

												Fun but get's very repetitive really fast. Better that you just do the story mode and get it over with. Because once you've completed the first couple of random missions, you will begin to see an obvious bland pattern. State of Decay is probably one of the best ""survival"" games I have played but shows just exactly why this genre won't ever really catch on. That said, State of Decay is pretty and I feel it is worth the money but I would advise you to save your money on the DLC. 3/5 for this game.			"

												If you like zombie survival games, you want this one. State of Decay is one of those rare gems that started out on the Xbox Arcade and was developed under that whole 2GB limit. I honestly would love to have seen what Undead Labs would have been able to do with this if they were not working under such restraints.The base game itself can play out in a number of ways. You have several bases to choose from, various weapons, vehicles that have their own set of stats (fast and flimsy or slow and durable). The main game has a storyline that can take a while to complete, an advancement system that lets you choose a set of skills to specialize for each person as you level them up (easy to miss if you're new, second tab in the character screen), and a colorful set of characters.The Breakdown DLC is the survival mode you want to play. This does have some drawbacks though; luckily it's not that expensive. Breakdown removes the story mode and puts you in the Trumbull map. After a while you'll find an RV, repair it, and move on to the next map. The next map is the same map but with harder zombies, more spawns, and a higher chance of being torn to pieces.Where my grievances come in with this DLC is the character parts were done a bit lazy. Most don't have their regular voices from the original game. Pastor Will has Ed's voice in mine and was once telling me how he got laid behind a park bench or something. So while minor, it's noticeable.(Edit: Adding in some new info now that I've had a chance to play Lifeline and the updates to fix things are likely finished) There are still some lingering glitches even after several updates, one of the most notable being that some zombies can at times run through the house and get stuck in the floor, Big'un zombies can sometimes glitch through doors and lead to mission failures or the death of a playable character if you're really unlucky. The Lifeline DLC is it's own map and introduces several new characters, weapons, and vehicles. While it's a fun little game with its own unique story to the SoD world, it offers less freedom than the original. In Lifeline you will have access to many new techs to help fight off the zombie hoards while you evacuate survivors. But as time goes on, you'll lose some of these advantages. Luckily you can get them back later, but the tradeoff is you'll have to sacrifice your outposts to certain areas to maintain them. You also work on a bit of a timer throughout the game. Hoards will periodically atack your base and you'll need to be back there to help fight them off or bad things will happen.All in all, Lifeline is a pretty decent story on its own, but I think the original game still stands as the better of the two.Overall, I can't recommend this one enough for fans of zombie survival and building games. With any luck Undead Labs will have a chance to expand on this one in the future and make something truly unique.			"

												State of Decay is an excellent game that is not weighed down by its console origins. Although my experience with the game has been solely with a controller, the performance aspect of the game is phenomenal. SoD looks good and has not crashed a single time in my ~40 hours of play. The level of repetition in side quests is high and the plot line is lackluster, but its open world nature leaves the player with plenty of options in the way of entertainment. If scavenging and the management of a semi-autonomous community in a zombie infested world is something you want, please give this game a try.			"

												It isn't perfect, but I find the deaths in the game to be rather unique, and the whole thing is rather challenging, and rewarding to play, and yes, this is bad grammer.To go into full, I'd have to say, the game is worth playing, and the price is fair.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys zombies, the combat and scavanging can get rather repetative, but the side missions and survivor tasks break it up nicely and are rather fun.  But the most unique thing about it is how they handle the character deaths.  When a character dies, they die.  You don't get a chance to reload before that happened and try again, you are moved to another survivor at your base and continue on.  I find it rather neat, if frustrating at times, since it makes it a lot more important to avoid zombie hordes when playing as the better survivors.			"

												Ok.  At first, I wasn't a fan of this game because of the interface.  It was clearly designed with a controller in mind, and if you know me, you know I HATE PC ports of games that don't consider things that PC gamers EXPECT to have as norms:  PC keyboard and mouse control (done well), and SAVE ANYWHERE.   Checkpoint systems, for the most part, are dated concepts tied to systems with insufficient resources to implement proper saves.   That said, you can turn down the mouse sensitivity to the point it's fairly playable, and even though you can't ""save anywhere"", the biggest detraction I've seen isn't saving per se, it's LOADING.   You can't load after a mistake...and I have to say, for a survival horror game, that works for me.   Shortly into my first game (a couple hours), my main character died...and the game went on.   I went and looted his corpse and he was gone, leaving the rest of ""us"" to continue to try and make it in the world.Gameplay is for the most part very similar to Dead Island, except the game world is quite open and bases may be relocated and upgraded.  It's mission driven, but there's some story elements that keep it going.   I'd prefer a little more storyline and character developement, instead of the ""build a base"" options, but for the most part it works...I keep coming back to play more.   We'll see if after my first play through I go back, but it was a steal during the summer sale, and it has already paid itself off.			"

												I've been trying to get into this game for nearly 2 years now. I feel like I'm babysitting, not building a community of tough survivors. I leave to get some ammo to go town and destroy all the infestations. everyone is healthy and were going great on food and materials. I come back, two people are missing one is sick, food is all gone and a horde is attacking even though two of my people had assault rifles and all pistols and good melee weapons. And the ♥♥♥♥♥ on the radio wants me to be everywhere at once and harasses me every five minutes to help some random group I've never met for a reward of like 2 bullets for revolvers. This game is exausting to me.			"

												Fun little open world zombie game, which I enjoyed very much.If you focus solely on the story missions, it probably wouldn't last you that long though.Art assets seem like a hold over from the 360 version, but game still looks reasonable.Is also reasonably priced and getting discounted regularly, so give it a shot if smashing in zombie skulls is your king of fun.I would also recomend the sod savemanager if like me you don't like being at the mercy of a single autosave.Lifeline DLCI think it's worthwhile too.Is a new map and a different more gun heavy experience than the base game.

												State of Decay is... A pretty bad game. The DLC, however, fixed everything wrong with the base game. So, with that, I'd suggest getting the game with the DLC whilst on sale - I got it for a few bucks and don't regret it, but I wouldn't recommend it at full price (~20 bucks for base, extra 7 for breakdown).So yeah, for a few bucks, the game was totally worth it.The game can also be modded, which is a plus. I've recently started using a couple of gameplay mods, though small and insignificant in changes (mostly focusing on adding all the missing weapons), they really 'fix' what the developers should have.Though the game has some repetition issues; the gameplay is very samey with little challenge, It is fun to go up against hordes of zombies, and if you're stupid you can get yourself killed easily, but generally speaking the game is a breeze. I usually find myself getting bored if I play it too often on too regular of a basis (put ~30 hours in a month into it), though I still play it in breaks.The game also at times basically holds your hand, whilst other times you're basically holding the ai's hands, because the ai is useless. Other survivors do nothing other than 'get lost' in places recently cleared a walk away, and if you don't recover them they often die. Survivors also, when with you in combat, have a habit of doing exactly what the player doesn't do; let them get surround, or charge at a juggernaught (basically a giant hillbilly L4D 'tank' - picks people up and rips them apart), getting them killed easily. Especially frustrating if you've maxed out their skills, and one of the above happens.The base game also 'progresses' when you're offline. Yep. Don't play for a few days, and stuff happens. Part of the reason I avoided the base story driven game entirely, sticking to the superior breaking point DLC.Anyway, I could write more, but there probably is no need. Get the game on sale if it's your sort of game and stick to break down unless you're up for a short story line filled with repetitive missions. Oh wait, breakdown is filled with them too, but not quite so much.			"

Its zombies, hordes of them, and the Lifeline DLC is way more difficult.But I bought Decay+ break down on sale, and then lifeline on sale, and am very happy with my purchases.If they made another DLC, I'd probably buy that on sale too, if they add some other interesting new twists.

												Do not take notice of the 1 hour playtime, I have worked my xbox to death playing this game. This review will focus on the gamplay and mechanics, story is not as important for this game. Lets start the review!When State of Decay first appeared on my Xbox 360 dashboard I thought of it as another cheap Zombie arcade game, I decided to download the demo and since that day, I have been hooked. This game throws you in the midst of zombie apocolypse and lets you know your only option to survive is to group up with other characters. You then go through the game saving (or leaving) survivors and inducting them into your community which you build up, choose what to build, where to build and what base will be yours. This game takes realism to the extreme, all characters that you can switch between have their own personalities that effect how they react in situations and how their mood is during their stay in your community. They also have their own skills, weaknesses and backstories that let you know what person you want over others and let you feel a connection with these characters. With so many different personalities staying under one roof in such a severe time, problems are bound to happen and sometimes you may need to help calm down a survivor or go take them out and have a chat, maybe someone is scared or upset and needs you to give them reassurance that everything will be alright and this level of realism for what actually would happen in this situation is amazing. One thing you must keep track of is supplies, having a large community may keep it safe from zombies but starvation and illness can hurt large groups. You will need to scavange and set runners to go collect these resources to reimburse the daily supply usage.The best thing about this game is the death, in State of Decay if somone dies, they die. Runners going to get supplies and get caught up by a horde? dead. Survivor is ill and there is no supplies? Dead AND infecting others. This really gives the incentive to stay aware of whats going on and doing your best to keep everyone alive, I let my guard down when I got near the end of the game and ended up with the games first character dead because I left him alone when he needed help. There is nothing more sad than having to go collect your dead friends bag.This game is a must have for any survival lover, 10/10!			"

												I would love to see this game progress or make another one with more features and improvements. This was unlike any other zombie game I have played honestly. Its very simple yet extremely addicting. The AI was rather impressive considering some big time companies cant even get it right. The game has a lot of strategy and progression. I love how every character you meet and encounter is essentially unique and has their own traits. Maintaining a safehaven and upgrading it is a lot of fun. This game had me on it ALL day and night. I was pulled in fast. This review dosent really explain much of the game but I personally think its money well spent. Twenty dollars isnt a lot and I feel you get more bang for your buck personally.I reccommend this game!			"

												It's a great game, and a fair bit different than the rest of the zombie games out there.  They're on to something big with this one.  The only thing that was missing from this was co-op or multiplayer.  It was obviously ported from a console, so the 3rd person takes a bit to get used to.  Still a hell of a game otherwise.  The resource management is great, although the story and questing seems to need a bit of work.			"

												State of Decay...well I'm coming from a background of more action oriented zombie shooters like the current Resident Evil series and Dead Rising. This game was...different. But in a good way :) I'll try an easy to read run-down of what I thought here...The Good:-RPG, RTS, some FPS, and Open World all in one Zombie Survival!-Really beautiful environmental graphics...once you're used to the style-Good attempts at realism, felt like I was playing a long episode of the Walking Dead-Great use of tension: death is permanent and night feels dangerous!The Bad:-Not the most intuitive game, fairly steep learning curve, especially for the RPG type elements -Control scheme doesn't always make sense (but I haven't tried a game controller yet)-Story is sort of hard to follow, doesn't seem to be a point except ""survive/get better weapons/home bases/vehicles"" and no clear endgame goals-A few glitches/bugs that probably should have been worked out/beta testedThe Ugly:-No real save system...well, not one that an be managed in any way. It auto saves and looks like you can manually save when hitting the Escape (Esc) key. But it's all one game and there are no saved states or games to go back to.-Sometimes the game goes too far with the realism. For instance, one of my more useful characters just disappeared with no  trace or explanation...I guess that's realistic but...huh?? -Game sort of has a punishment system for not playing it...? I let the game sit for a few days, launched it back up, and all the parked cars around my base at the time auto exploded. This happened twice. It took time and effort to gather those vehicles and in one instance, gone. Again I say...huh??Overall I would recommend giving it a try. State of Decay does pretty well at mixing all the genres up for a unique and fun survival experience. I haven't played in like a month so I'm afraid of what I'll find when I log back in though...I guess that's part of the game's tension and horror elements :) "

												There are a few good ideas in this game, but that won't save it.Good:-Zombie Survival, with an emphasis on survival (food/supply hunting)-Scouting ahead for camps/points of interest and planning where to go is fun!Bad:-Rough combat. It's just not fun or engaging. Hit zombie with board, board eventually breaks, rinse repeat, nothing new here.-Terrible story (To be fair, I didn't play for very long, but you feel nothing for these characters aside from the feeling that the game will be harder without them)-Pretty bad UI. Like, pre-mod Skyrim on PC with keyboard and mouse bad. I hear it's designed with a controller in mind though, so that may help.-Zombies feel too weak. They only pose a slight threat when there is a group, and even then you can outrun them with ease, or just smack them a few times with no real issue. While in the later game, this may change, but I don't want to stick around and find out.I feel bad because I didn't play too long to get a full feel for the game, but when the start of the game is so cookie-cutter and by-the-books, I'm pretty sure I'm not missing out on the rest. Hopefully a sequel will expand on their good ideas.			"

												Followed it from the early days of development back when they were simply calling it Class3. So, followed it for a couple years.Wasn't disappointed when I finally played it.It's definitely got its problems but it does a ton of things right. Characters die permanently. Loot doesn't respawn, forcing you to go farther and farther from your base to get much needed supplies. And, of course, zambies everywhere.The writing is cheesy, and it's hard to feel any emotional attachment to any of these characters or really care if they die (aside from losing someone who's good at something), but it focuses on something much different from what regular zombie games focus on, and it pulls it off quite well.

												Somewhat buggy game, but truly worth it in my opionion. However, I personally like the Breakdown expasion a bit more than the game itself. Adds to the intensity and allows you to make your own story in a sense. Either way, you should play this game.			"

												This game is a true shocker, The graphics may be lacking but when have graphics ever trumped gameplay ? This game is one of the greatest Open World/Zombie/Survival games I have ever had the pleasure to play there are so many ways you can play this game that increase the amount of time you can put into this game. Run solo with a suppresed pistol and a baseball bat, Or go balls to the wall with a crew of 4 using from the 22' MkII all the way up to the M32 Grenade Launcher.

												If you like open world survival games you must get this one! I feel like im actually in an apocalypse, because  when your survivors die, they die. No respawns or save points to go back to to save them. This is one of the closest things ive played that makes me feel like im in the walking dead tv series besides dayz and telltales walking dead. overall the gameplay gets some getting used to, but i rate this game an 8 out of ten. A must play for any fan of open world games.			"

												State of Decay is so far my favorite Zombie Survival Game.  I will admit, the graphics suck.  And there are quite a few graphical glitches and annoyances in the game (Textures not quite lining up, Zombies glitching and having their bodies half on one side of a door/wall and half on the other, and Zombies spawning right in front of you).  Once you get past the graphical issues with the game, (and the annoying characters), the rest is great.The game starts with you walking to your campsite, after a fishing trip with your buddy.  Only to be attacked by Zombies.  After the initial shock to the characters, they make their way to the ranger station, do a bit of looking around, and the story takes them to a small village.  This is where the game actually begins.  The main part of the game revolves around building up your base, going around scavenging for food, fuel, weapons, ammo, building materials ect.  The game isn't quite open world, as there are only a number of buildings you can create your base in.  You get to choose if you would like to build a sleeping area, infirmary, library, kitchen, garden, workshop, ect.  Then you have to get the materials to build it.  Waves upon waves of zombies will be coming to attack your base, as well as find you no matter where you are in the game.  There are alot of missions where you need to take out zombies in infestation sites, or the number of zombies in the area will increase dramatically.  The storyline of the Vanilla game is livable.  Alot of the characters in it are totally annoying though.   In the game, you aren't a particular ""person"", you are the community.  Each person in your community is like an extra life in the game.   And each character needs to be leveled up, and needs to feel important.  In order to ensure you don't play/level up your favorite character, and leave the rest in the base, they brought the most annoying aspect I have ever come across in a game before.  The longer your players sit in the base, the more agitated they become.  They will start fighting amongst themselves, and start becoming whiny brats, and you will need to do endless ""hand holding"" missions to get them to improve their moods.  If you leave them unchecked, they will start to take your base out from the inside out.  Losing Community Morale with the fighting, smashing things in your base, firing ammo into the air to blow off steam, I have even had one of my characters kill another of my community.   (And all deaths in the game are perma-deaths for that character.)Nothing I dislike more when I am out risking my life to search through zombie filled buildings for food to keep my community alive, then hearing your radio go off that you need to come home quick and take someone out for a walk, to talk about their feelings.I won't try to give away too much of the storyline.  There are 2 DLC's for the game currently as well.  The first DLC is called Breakdown.  It happens in the same community as the original Vanilla game.  The difference is there is no real storyline, and your goal instead of making it through the storyline is to find a Motorhome, fix it up so you can take 6 of your favorite characters with you and leave the area.  The only problem.  When you try leaving your Motorhome dies, leaving you again stranded in a random part of the map, having to build another base, and start from scratch finding a new motorhome and getting it street ready.  Each time you do this, the game gets harder, there are more zombies (And more dangerous ones), and you have less supplies, weapons ect.  The second DLC  is called Lifeline.  This DLC happens on a different map (A city map), and this time instead of playing as the civilians, you play as the military.  So you have more weapons at your disposal, but since you're no longer in a rural countryside or small village, the number of zombies is multiplied.Aside from the many downfalls I have mentioned, the game still is my favorite Zombie type game, and I recommend it to anyone.

												This game is like putting Farcry 3 and The Sims together in a zombie infested world.  For those who haven't played either of those games, Farcry 3 had the notion of an open world with missions that string you along, but also with side missions that became repetitive later on.  The Sims was all about taking care of your people's needs and ultimately having them survive the real world.In State of Decay, you have an open world that you can explore at your leisure, but with missions that string you along a primary path and secondary missions to enhance gameplay, but also become repetitive.  The latter half is all about maintain your home base and securing survivors within your base, and then to maintain their basic needs and emotional outbursts while trying to survive zombie onslaughts.The game is very interesting and simulated.  You don't get big guns and gold from killing zombies, in fact, it's probably best to avoid zombies in most situations, because you gain nothing beyond some skill improvement, but also risk your character for permanent death!  That's right, if you die, it's permanent for that character (as far as I've witnessed thus far), but you can swap between any survivor character in your base once you friended them.  This is nice to break from boredom using just 1 character all the time, and everyone has their own strengths.  Also, other real life simulated aspects come into play, like noise attracting zombies, tension between characters, basic human needs, running out of breath when tired, etc.Great game for a zombie simulation; however, I feel like a lot of it will become repetitive after so many hours of play, just like most open world sandboxes (except Skyrim! lol).

												Marcus. Oh Marcus. How did I let you die?Okay, the thing you should know about State of Decay is that once your player character dies, they're dead for good within the game. There are no reloading previous saves. You can't revive a player character. I didn't know that before doing a mission where numerous zombies and a tank looking one attack a house. My Marcus, he died.The reason this upset me was Marcus is the starting character. So that makes him important in various ways. He has a great skillset. Great leadership skills. Is able to maintain trust. If I had known about this feature before diving into State of Decay, my gameplay style would have been more cautious. Unfortanately, I hadn't known about it.For that reason, I will hold off playing State of Decay any further. Well, that and the fact that the game lags like every f***ing thirty seconds. No, really. You could be playing along at 60 fps and bam! it'll drop down to like 8 fps. What's the first thing you do? Check drivers are up to date. Okay. Lower resolution. Okay. Lower graphics settings. Okay. Same problem. This game has serious lagging. Which is why I'm going to hold off until I'm able to have a better PC.A bit about the game's story and gameplay before I set off: You start as Marcus (who died in my game, god darnit) a young man on a fishing trip with his buddy Ed. The game gets right into the action. Ed is being attacked by zombies and you have to help him. Right off the bat, you meet others at a ranger station. Some stuff happens. And you decide to escape the mountain and head into town. This is where the bulk of the game will be centered. Your home base is a church occupied by some townfolk trying to help survivors.Your role, as any of the player characters that you meet, is to gather supplies, reinforce the churches defense, help others, dive into multiple storylines involving the army, judge, some locals, and stuff. You scavenge homes, radio in for supply runs. Fight zombies. Scavenge warehouses, radio in for supply runs. Fight hordes. Scavenge....okay, you get the point, there's a bit of scavenging involved which is great as it reinforces that this game is an ARPG, not a horror game.So far, I'd give SoD a 7.9/10. (I detracted points because Marcus died and it's laggy as fu.) Otherwise, good game. Good graphics too. I realize I hadn't mentioned that. It runs on one of the Crytek engines, so it has an over abundance of lighting and high res textures.			"

												So uhm, State of Decay. Bit of a funny story regarding this. From what I understand, it started out as an Xbox Live Arcade game , and a very well done one at that.I bought this during the Early Access phase, but I can safely say I'm satisfied with the purchase. It has a rather appopriate pricetag of €19, and it fits the content. You won't find yourself spending a hundred hours with it, but you may return to it a few times.State of Decay is a zombie open world sandbox game. There's really no other way to describe it. There's no protagonist, no overarching plot of ""stopping the big bad"". It's all just surviving. If the character you play dies, you take control of another one. Over time, your group of survivors and the compound/safehouse can grow or shrink, depending on how reckless you are.The world itself is fairly big and allows for a good deal of free roaming. There are cities, open fields, rocky mountains, and pretty much all houses and buildings can be entered. I suppose you could call it the open world game to accompany the Walking Dead.			"

Plus I used a Trainer while playing to make SURE I never needed ammo so if I wasn't running them down in my BIG♥♥♥♥♥Truck I just keep on shooting.

												Death is permanent. You must recruit survivors. Maintain your base. Scavenge and find weapons, guns, medicine, and food.Deal with your ""friends"" and their emotions; deal with them by killing zombies. Stay on good terms with survivors not yet in your community and they might just join you. Collect cars, and keep them working, because if they blow up or stop working they won't spawn again. Endure the night time, where hope is drained almost as fast as the bullets leave your rifle. Run from hordes, or if you are brave enough, and stupid enough, then take them on. Encounter dangerous special infected, ones so dangerous they can literally rip you in two. Set up outposts and make your area zed-free. Your fellow survivors will go on dangerous scavenging runs for you, fight for you, and die for you. Learn their stories, get to know them, and fight with them. You are a survivor. You are a KILLER. You are a savior. There is only one objective: Escape the valley.This is how the game basically goes. I reccomend it 100% because it is amazing. Sure it suffers from some technical issues and such, but its still good.			"

												State of Decay isn't quite as open world as I thought it would be.  It's far more scripted and there is less freedom of choice than I would have preferred.  I also wasn't a huge fan of switching off characters in order to rest stamina and heal.  I think I would have preferred something that was a bit less linear and gave me more freedom in designing and maintaining my base.  Setting down and fortifying walls with different materials, traps, guards, etc.  Still a good buy on sale though.			"

												Would GREATLY benefit from adding a co-op and maybe even a PVP multiplayer element. This is exactly what a zombie game should be. There is a spooky 'walking dead-season 1' feel about it. The game has some great mechanics. Perma-death is really cool and gives the player a sense of urgency when they, or other survivors are being attacked. You think different. You sneak up and crouch because spraying and praying will get you killed. There has never been a zombie game this good before.  Much like in The Last of Us, when you are in menu, perhaps searching through supplies,looking at your map,what have you..you are always vunerable. You can never turn your back too long. I have never felt the adrenaline I get ,like when I play this game.  It was the middle of the night and my group and I needed food...or we would starve.Literally. So Being the hero I thought I was, I went to this diner. I found the food and I was in a bit of a hurry and made too much noise and attracted a few biters and while I was gathering the supplies they ambushed me in the small room. I thought there was no way out, but I hacked and slashed my way out with a machete. But it broke. All I had left was a shotgun. I blasted a few rounds cleared a path and hauled♥♥♥♥♥back to the house we were holed up in for the night. I attracted a small horde by firing the gun. And it goes on from there...This is the perfect combo of strategy and action. It delivers well and makes you feel like there are actual consenquences for your actions. You have to think a plan out..or sometimes just be able to run fast or jump in a car and drive off. Don't stay away from the game too long or you and your group might die off from starvation because of a real time element that takes place behind the scenes when you are not playing.My biggest complaints so far is the walking inside of buildings is a bit clunky and there is NO ONLINE CO-OP OPTION. I can not stress how awesome this would be, even as a whole new game. Go buy it now! (side note for Undead labs...We(pc gamers) have money and are VERY willing to spend it on your product. So make one with a online co-op and even a PVP option please!)			"

												I have spent a good part of 70 hours gaming State of Decay and even though I had some rough minutes getting used to the game starting off – I totally fell in love! This is despite I like to really live the character I play, because in State of Decay you play several characters. They get tired, hurt, die, and when that happens you really need to find someone else to switch to – the dyeing part is obvious though!To me this game is a mix of The Last Stand: Dead Zone and Rebuild and then made into a big third person shooter. Roughly.It has been made so you really feel the realism. Cars break down, but also carry things in its trunk. You need to scavenge food, materials, medic, ammo and fuel, so your base continually keeps running. Because yes, there is a base. You are to decide what to build and where. Save strangers and allies from distress. Fight hordes of zombies – and oh the zombies! They are hilarious. Have you ever gamed The Movies? The way they run, this is how some of the zombies run. I love it!The AI, yeah it could differently be better and even though the game screams coop-multiplayer there are non and there will not be. Also I find it frustrating, that sometimes you sit with the feeling, that nobody but you are the one to really pull the plugs. Even though there are opportunities to get support, they really are only there to help you fight. So don't expect them to help more than that – not even at missions, which I missed a little to make it feel more realistic.But I do look forward to a third State of Decay, meanwhile I warmly recommend this one. It’s worth the full cost if you ask me, despite the downsides.It’s a really good post-apocalyptic game.			"

												Well this sucks. While tha game in its own rights is awesome. I'm now♥♥♥♥♥♥out of luck if I want an updated experience. Yes, I know I could buy the Y1E, but I'm not going to pay 30$(or even less if it was on sale) for a game I already paid 30 for because they don't wanna support my version of the game anymore.So now instead of praising the game for all the good it does(and it does do a lot of good), I have to tell people to not only avoid the game but anything else this developer releases because they can't be trusted to follow through. Which sucks cause I really did love this game, and was actually willing to throw down money for furture titles by Undead Labs. Now, I won't be. Ever. You guys lost a customer here pulling this. I'm sure it doesn't mean anything to the devs, but I really don't care. This is about resoect. Something I have none of for them now.For historical use, my old review:Yes, yes, YES!!!!! I've been waiting for a survival game like this for a long time. It's not perfect by any means, but it's the closest game I've played that fit my zombie survival needs.PROS:-Base building is cool-Going on runs for supplies is fun-The zombies can be a ♥♥♥♥♥, but they can also be easy-Each character has a pretty good back story, and most of them get told(unless you kill them)-If you die, you're dead. Your character is gone and you gain a new one at base, and you lose any story lines that they could produce-special zombies-House movingCONS:-Wish it had personal needs(food and water) that I had to keep up with-So far the games been a tad easy, but I've not done much of the ""main"" missions, and the DLC will fix that too-I'd like better control over a party member if I have one(tellling them to pick up reasores or dropped packs)-And more squad based controls would be fun-You can't send your friends out on the slower/easier missions(like scouting out or getting building marterials) in the same way it works with Assassins creed, that would add more risk/reward to the gameAll in all though the game is still fun and it's so far the best survival game I've found that lets you do all the stuff you can.

												I love this game. It is the closest thing to an open world ""The Walking Dead"" game as we are ever gonna get. It plays like Day Z only slightly more arcade-like and way better looking. I love the feel of scvenging, going and sending people out on runs. I like the RPG-like mechanics and base building as well. While we would all love to see a multiplayer version of this, i like the feel of what this game is. I paid full price for this game and have not regretted it once. I hope the devlopers keep up all the hard work. This game does need some DLC to expand it out a smidge, but all in all a very, solid purchase. I give it a 4.6 out of 5.			"

												Thoroughly enjoyed, both the base game and both DLCs. Breakdown in particular, as its what I thought the game was going to be at launch. The PC interface takes some getting used to, use a controller if you have one.  And not exactly the prettiest game in the world, though I never had a problem with that, I thought the ugly, gritty world was fitting presonally.As I said, Breakdown is very much what I wanted from the game to begin with, mostly; all the cool gameplay, but no story, just ""how long can you last""?  I like the unlockable starting characters, though its not gonna matter too much, you can only do so much with just Marcus/Guy You Start With before they get tired and/or ate.Lifeline is neat too, the new map is kinda meh (not bad but not anywhere near as interesting as the first) but the access to military hardware and artillery is useful, as is the new ability to put stuff in the trunks of cars.

												It's a really good game.  It's both entertaining and addictive.EDIT: So now that I have the time, I'll write a genuine review for this game because it deserves one.Honestly a really intense and amazing zombie game.  Everything is pretty realistic.  The zeds are generally slow and easy to kill until they form hordes.  The special zeds aren't as realistic as the common slow moving, weak zombies, but despite the loss of realism, the ones in State of Decay (SOD) make the game even more fun.  They're annoying when they come around but you honestly feel as though you are the player and need to get away as fast as possible.The first play through, just get used to the storylines and the controls.  Understand what to do and how to stay alive.  Then afterwards, play the game again and again and see just how many people you can save (my many hours can attest to how much I try this).You're bound to lose commmunity members during the first one or two times, but soon you get the hang of what to do and realize just how far you can push your members.All the modes are great; my favorite would have to be Lifeline.  In this mode, (without spoiling much) you play the army evacing VIPs as well as the occassional civilian.  Rather than being the struggling survivor you are in Breakdown and the main story, you get to be well armed soldiers working to save the helpless.In regards to the comments about glitches, I do not find many.  The only annoying glitch would be when a sruvivor chooses not to follow you during a mission, but this happens very rarely, and if it does, it would most likely be the only one in that play through10/10  Buy this game when you get the chance, you won't regret it.I only wish there could be a new game or update where multiplayer or PVP was an option.

												Would GREATLY benefit from adding a co-op and maybe even a PVP multiplayer element. This is exactly what a zombie game should be. There is a spooky 'walking dead-season 1' feel about it. The game has some great mechanics. Perma-death is really cool and gives the player a sense of urgency when they, or other survivors are being attacked. You think different. You sneak up and crouch because spraying and praying will get you killed. There has never been a zombie game this good before.  Much like in The Last of Us, when you are in menu, perhaps searching through supplies,looking at your map,what have you..you are always vunerable. You can never turn your back too long. I have never felt the adrenaline I get ,like when I play this game.  It was the middle of the night and my group and I needed food...or we would starve.Literally. So Being the hero I thought I was, I went to this diner. I found the food and I was in a bit of a hurry and made too much noise and attracted a few biters and while I was gathering the supplies they ambushed me in the small room. I thought there was no way out, but I hacked and slashed my way out with a machete. But it broke. All I had left was a shotgun. I blasted a few rounds cleared a path and hauled♥♥♥♥♥back to the house we were holed up in for the night. I attracted a small horde by firing the gun. And it goes on from there...This is the perfect combo of strategy and action. It delivers well and makes you feel like there are actual consenquences for your actions. You have to think a plan out..or sometimes just be able to run fast or jump in a car and drive off. Don't stay away from the game too long or you and your group might die off from starvation because of a real time element that takes place behind the scenes when you are not playing.My biggest complaints so far is the walking inside of buildings is a bit clunky and there is NO ONLINE CO-OP OPTION. I can not stress how awesome this would be, even as a whole new game. Go buy it now! (side note for Undead labs...We(pc gamers) have money and are VERY willing to spend it on your product. So make one with a online co-op and even a PVP option please!)			"

												So what can one say about ""another"" zombie-surviva-lgame?Well a lot. First the normal storymode is quite bugged ....there are several plotstopper bugs and other issues but that totally doesnt matter... because:Playing it on story mode is nice but not the main thing to do. The DLC is what i will recommend here! The DLC basicly ignores any kind of story (although it might b wise to play the story first to understand everything and get a bit training in the field of ""how to kick undead butts"") and is just about the basics of the genre: kill zombies, survive, loot.The trick why this is actually interesting is the fact, that the game gets harder by every stage with more zombies, new challanges that lead to new playable heroes , random elements (""how the ♥♥♥♥ am i supposed to start from HERE?!"") and !SPOILERALERT! some very nasty surprise like zombies not appearing on the minimap, no more cars, cars and weapons breaking like paper and resources as rare as kryptonite.To wrap it up:If u like challanging zombie-survival-rpg-games then go ahead and get this one BUT buy it WITH dlc!

												Great game done RIGHT! The open-world zombie survival game you really wanted that also has a manageable base with facility upgrades, random misfortunes, and scavenging for stuff. Persistent world feature caught me off guard, but it was still fun knowing the world goes on without you. And a bonus! zombie references everywhere in this world. Have fun finding them c:The only glaring gripe I have for this game is that if you have a partner tagging along with you (from your base, not a story mission), you can't exchange items or anything really while they're standing a foot away from you outside of combat.I would love to see some multiplayer similar to what Left4Dead has done, with friends or something ""taking over"" a random non-storybased character from your base that isn't injured, on an optional  side mission, and/or past a certain community population (like 10 to 16 people or something).Otherwise this is an awesome game, go buy it if DayZ or Nether isn't to your particular taste.

												Reasonably good zombie survival game.  I'd say the most exciting moments in it are not as good as the best moments in Dead Island or Left 4 Dead 2, but the whole base building and team management thing is a great spin on this genre that makes it different from either of those two games.  I had fun playing it, but it does It have some annoyances such as camp members who run off at random times, so even after you rescue and make friends with them they aren't available to switch to most of the time when you want to.  The length of the campaign is about 15-20 hours probably and that seems about right.  I liked Dead Island's action better than this one, but that game's campaign ended up lasting much too long so by the end of the game it was just tedious.			"

												State of Decay is... A pretty bad game. The DLC, however, fixed everything wrong with the base game. So, with that, I'd suggest getting the game with the DLC whilst on sale - I got it for a few bucks and don't regret it, but I wouldn't recommend it at full price (~20 bucks for base, extra 7 for breakdown).So yeah, for a few bucks, the game was totally worth it.The game can also be modded, which is a plus. I've recently started using a couple of gameplay mods, though small and insignificant in changes (mostly focusing on adding all the missing weapons), they really 'fix' what the developers should have.Though the game has some repetition issues; the gameplay is very samey with little challenge, It is fun to go up against hordes of zombies, and if you're stupid you can get yourself killed easily, but generally speaking the game is a breeze. I usually find myself getting bored if I play it too often on too regular of a basis (put ~30 hours in a month into it), though I still play it in breaks.The game also at times basically holds your hand, whilst other times you're basically holding the ai's hands, because the ai is useless. Other survivors do nothing other than 'get lost' in places recently cleared a walk away, and if you don't recover them they often die. Survivors also, when with you in combat, have a habit of doing exactly what the player doesn't do; let them get surround, or charge at a juggernaught (basically a giant hillbilly L4D 'tank' - picks people up and rips them apart), getting them killed easily. Especially frustrating if you've maxed out their skills, and one of the above happens.The base game also 'progresses' when you're offline. Yep. Don't play for a few days, and stuff happens. Part of the reason I avoided the base story driven game entirely, sticking to the superior breaking point DLC.Anyway, I could write more, but there probably is no need. Get the game on sale if it's your sort of game and stick to break down unless you're up for a short story line filled with repetitive missions. Oh wait, breakdown is filled with them too, but not quite so much.			"

Its zombies, hordes of them, and the Lifeline DLC is way more difficult.But I bought Decay+ break down on sale, and then lifeline on sale, and am very happy with my purchases.If they made another DLC, I'd probably buy that on sale too, if they add some other interesting new twists.

												Reasonably good zombie survival game.  I'd say the most exciting moments in it are not as good as the best moments in Dead Island or Left 4 Dead 2, but the whole base building and team management thing is a great spin on this genre that makes it different from either of those two games.  I had fun playing it, but it does It have some annoyances such as camp members who run off at random times, so even after you rescue and make friends with them they aren't available to switch to most of the time when you want to.  The length of the campaign is about 15-20 hours probably and that seems about right.  I liked Dead Island's action better than this one, but that game's campaign ended up lasting much too long so by the end of the game it was just tedious.			"

												So what can one say about ""another"" zombie-surviva-lgame?Well a lot. First the normal storymode is quite bugged ....there are several plotstopper bugs and other issues but that totally doesnt matter... because:Playing it on story mode is nice but not the main thing to do. The DLC is what i will recommend here! The DLC basicly ignores any kind of story (although it might b wise to play the story first to understand everything and get a bit training in the field of ""how to kick undead butts"") and is just about the basics of the genre: kill zombies, survive, loot.The trick why this is actually interesting is the fact, that the game gets harder by every stage with more zombies, new challanges that lead to new playable heroes , random elements (""how the ♥♥♥♥ am i supposed to start from HERE?!"") and !SPOILERALERT! some very nasty surprise like zombies not appearing on the minimap, no more cars, cars and weapons breaking like paper and resources as rare as kryptonite.To wrap it up:If u like challanging zombie-survival-rpg-games then go ahead and get this one BUT buy it WITH dlc!

												Though this game is very fun to play and the way you have to manage resources and survive is unique, there are just too many bugs in the game to enjoy properly, for instance military personell standing around doing nothing while your base is being seiged.  Also the NPC's in this are just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, for instance when they have had enough they will just start running home in the most direct route, even if that is through the middle of a horde and end up getting themselves killed.

												State of Decay...well I'm coming from a background of more action oriented zombie shooters like the current Resident Evil series and Dead Rising. This game was...different. But in a good way :) I'll try an easy to read run-down of what I thought here...The Good:-RPG, RTS, some FPS, and Open World all in one Zombie Survival!-Really beautiful environmental graphics...once you're used to the style-Good attempts at realism, felt like I was playing a long episode of the Walking Dead-Great use of tension: death is permanent and night feels dangerous!The Bad:-Not the most intuitive game, fairly steep learning curve, especially for the RPG type elements -Control scheme doesn't always make sense (but I haven't tried a game controller yet)-Story is sort of hard to follow, doesn't seem to be a point except ""survive/get better weapons/home bases/vehicles"" and no clear endgame goals-A few glitches/bugs that probably should have been worked out/beta testedThe Ugly:-No real save system...well, not one that an be managed in any way. It auto saves and looks like you can manually save when hitting the Escape (Esc) key. But it's all one game and there are no saved states or games to go back to.-Sometimes the game goes too far with the realism. For instance, one of my more useful characters just disappeared with no  trace or explanation...I guess that's realistic but...huh?? -Game sort of has a punishment system for not playing it...? I let the game sit for a few days, launched it back up, and all the parked cars around my base at the time auto exploded. This happened twice. It took time and effort to gather those vehicles and in one instance, gone. Again I say...huh??Overall I would recommend giving it a try. State of Decay does pretty well at mixing all the genres up for a unique and fun survival experience. I haven't played in like a month so I'm afraid of what I'll find when I log back in though...I guess that's part of the game's tension and horror elements :) "

												State of decay is a third person action survival roguelikesque rpg. The game starts with you returning from a fishing trip with your buddy Ed to find the main land over run with zombies. The game combines third person melee and ranged combat with a scavenging resource and community management system.The starting area is fairly easy with sparsely positioned zombies in a camp ground area. You quickly find the rangers station and begin exploring the area and looting for supplies.The combat system is fairly competent as is the driving system, however controls for this game currently are restricted to controller but the developer is working on full keyboard and mouse control so keep this in mind before buying this title.The graphics are decent enough but nothing spectacular, however this is not a AAA title so this is understandable. Music, ambient sound and voice acting are pretty good considering this is not a AAA title. What makes this game really shine is the community management system. You don't play one main character as you need to manage fatigue and people need to rest, so this has you swapping out for other community members as need be, but you will quickly find your favourites and tend to cycle between them.The inventory management system is decent but transfering items between characters is frustrating making you return to base and stash it before switching characters and retrieving the items.All in all this is a great game and definitely a refreshing approach to the zombie survival genre and for $20 or equivalent it is worth your time to pick this up. If you enjoy the zombie genre and looking for something a little different then this may be the game you have been looking for. "

												It's a great game, and a fair bit different than the rest of the zombie games out there.  They're on to something big with this one.  The only thing that was missing from this was co-op or multiplayer.  It was obviously ported from a console, so the 3rd person takes a bit to get used to.  Still a hell of a game otherwise.  The resource management is great, although the story and questing seems to need a bit of work.			"

												When it comes to great story telling and a great post apocalyptic point and click action/adventure game, Telltale's The Walking Dead series beats the rest hands down.  However, when it comes to a third person action game that relies on survival instincts, sim like community building, and hours upon hours of gameplay value, State of Decay is one of the top post apocayptic zombie games out at the moment.  The only thing some may not like about the game is it isn't a multiplayer, and while I actually prefer non multiplayer games, it would have been cool if other communities and neighbors were other actual players. But maybe they'll do that in the sequel? Another big plus in my opinion is the size of the game.  Even with Breakdown installed, the game only takes up about 2-3 gigs of hdd space because it doesn't waste space on pointless FMV's.			"

												  I have found myself getting more indulged with this game than I had originally thought I would. Yeah, it doesn't look like much at first but once you get deeper into things, it all flows smoothly with this game.  Let me start off by saying that this game has some different character development compared to other games. You find survivors and have them join your group where you find out who they were before the apocalypse. Characters have real world personalities and traits such as ""natural born leader"" or ""idol fan"" or ""practiced photography"" and this helps decide who is good at what and good where. Once you lose a survivor, in some morbid gore-tastic way, your ""community"" feels the loss and demands more attention on the home front. This was a really nice spin on the survival genre.  Next, the world itself is always reacting to the things you do or do not do (aside from the main storyline missions). You have to choose between what is vital or what is time pressing. Also, the world keeps going after you've quit the game, so building projects are finished in real time instead of waiting around for it to be done, and your community's morality fluctuates while you are away too along with supplies being gathered and/or side missions being completed.  Oh, and there are plenty of good zombie killing weapons for the taking! Sure, it isn't a Dead Rising sort of diversity, but it is good and diverse for the most part!  Sure, it isn't in first person, but it still gives poetic justice to the survival genre and still gives that personal edge fans desire.   Now for a few of the game's cons:  -The hit reaction is sometimes off at vital points.  -NPC's do not help much when it is really needed and often times get themselves killed.  -The Dialouge is extremely repetitive... every character uses the same sentences as other characters.  -Gameplay can get dull at times.  -PC controls can be frustrating as well.  All in all, this game is an amazing take on the whole ""Zombie, Survival"" genre (that is sadly overdone) and is a great buy for any fans of the genre.8/10			"

												Standing atop a water tower, the survivor scouts out areas that may contain much needed supplies while also making note of where the nearby zombie activity lies. This is Undead Labs’ “State of Decay,” and day to day life inside the zombie title constantly involves the search for materials to survive. It’s not just about getting the goods necessary for living another day as much as the situations gamers encounter while out scavenging for them.“State of Decay” may feel like several other tiles. It’s easy for gamers to look at the title and see that it’s an open-world game with vehicles and think it must be like “Grand Theft Auto.” Others may hear that it involves rescuing survivors from a zombie outbreak and think it might be similar to “Dead Rising,” or that the act of searching for supplies in order to outlive the undead must make the game some kind of single-player “DayZ.”The truth is, even though “State of Decay” may seem like all of these on paper, it all blends together to create a unique experience that gamers can’t find anywhere else.The survivors of Trumbull ValleyPlayers don’t have a single character to control inside “State of Decay.” In order to survive in the safest and most effective way possible, gamers must bring together a community of people. Rather than playing as a single survivor, the player represents an entire group.After earning any character's trust to become their friend, players gain the option to take control of that survivor and thus use them to go out and gather supplies or do missions.In Fact, “State of Decay” requires gamers to switch out which survivor they are playing as doing too much on one person will make them fatigued and much more likely to die. Speaking of death, when a character dies it is permanent. That person is forever removed from the group and loading a previous save isn’t an option as “State of Decay’s” auto-save feature ensures that both risk and choice matter in the game.Basically, gamers should get use to the idea that survivors will die. This is the zombie apocalypse after all.It’s the supplies that keep the group aliveTrumbull Valley features a rural setting that includes small town settlements as they would exist today if an uncontrollable zombie outbreak occurred. As such, the landscape is filled with houses, stores, storage sheds, warehouses, and more to scavenge through.In addition to finding weapons and other items that are for active use on a character, players must find packs of materials that are necessary for the home base. The group needs food, medicine, and fuel for obvious reasons. Ammunition helps keep the survivors at home alive as it gives them the means to defend themselves while the player is away.Another important resource the community requires comes in the form of building materials. These are necessary for the group to make repairs and additions to their home base by building watch towers, sleeping areas, workshops, medical tents, and more.The new structures allow the group to improve their base so that it can provide better protection, house more survivors, repair tools and vehicles, treat the injured, and even grow a daily source of food via outdoor gardens.There’s no place like HomeSince the home base houses all the survivors together, they will occasionally get in fights with one another. This will prompt players to escort these troubled individuals away from the base so that they can have a private talk in hopes of calming the situation down. Occasionally, members of the group will also end up in distress or turn up missing. Gamers are then tasked to come to their aid and help them back to safety.To help everyone out in the field, players may establish outposts away from the home base which provide relative safety while separated from home. Outposts allow missing survivors to find their way back, and create a safe perimeter around the structure which can be expanded by placing traps.This land belongs to the deadThe 16 square kilometer map of “State of Decay” features a couple of small towns, wooded areas, rivers, farms houses complete with fields, and even some lakes. Basically the game’s environments provide all the ingredients for a classic horror setting after scores of the undead are thrown into the mix.The living dead themselves are both varied and plentiful. There are standard shambling zombies, which travel either alone and in large wandering hordes that work as a single unit which can easily overwhelm lone survivors.“State of Decay” also features a few special zombie units that are more of a threat than the average walking corpse. These range from bloated zeds who leave a deadly toxic fume in their wake to armless zombies whose only attack comes in the form of a stunning scream which lets the nearby undead swarm the defenseless survivor.Most of these special units bear a resemblance to a figure that was once believably human with the exception of the lumbering Juggernaut. This behemoth towers as a giant above the other dead and bears the strength to send cars flying with a single swipe that would suggest that they aren’t merely the reanimated corpse of a deceased human being.An enjoyable harmony‘State of Decay” weaves elements of several genres together to create a new gaming recipe for fun. On their own merits, the game’s combat, resource gathering, survivor micro-management, and other systems are decent. When they are put together, however, they become much greater than the sum of their parts. Everything blends together in such a way that players won’t even care about the game’s few minor issues such as graphical tears, clipping, and framerate dips.When looked at as a full-title, “State of Decay” is remarkable. Considering the fact that this is an Xbox Live Arcade game, the results are phenomenal. This is definitely a must buy for any fan of either zombies or sandbox gaming, but this is the kind of experience that every gamer should at least try.			"

												This is a step in the right direction for the genre, but it's not quite there yet. For those who are into zombie survival it's a definite buy, but there are quite a few warts to this game that make it difficult to recommend to people who aren't into the genre.There's always a little too much to do, which is a good thing. It gives you a nice sense that the situation is dire and things are falling apart. Managing your fort, its resources and the people in it is a nice touch. Much like having too much to do the forts don't allow you to build everything which again is good, as it forces you out to scavenge. The combat is a little clunky but it gets the job done.Unfortunately not many graphics options and a lot of the game looks a little too blurred out, like there's an odd bloom effect over everything. Sound pulls off a nice unsettling atmosphere.			"

												A really interesting take on ""zombie survival"", and a nice addition to my library. After the zombie survival genre has been saturated to hell by unintuitive and redundant games such as ""7 Days to Die"", ""The Walking Dead:Survival Instinct"", ""Dead Island"", ""No More Room In Hell"", ""Infestation:Survivor Stories"", and many other games of the sort, it was extremely refreshing to experience a game like State of Decay. At it's heart, yes, it is a zombie game. However, it has been one of the most refreshing entries in the genre in a long time. You are doing more than just killing zombies and scavenging aimlessly. You are managing a whole community, where each and every person has a say, and an effect on your survival. Should you go to get the medicine or the food? Should you kill this infected citizen to end his misery, or let him experience his last days peacefully? These are the kinds of descisions that you will have to make to maintain the integrity of your community.Instead of running around and mindlessly killing zombies, you will be managing your resource stockpiles, constructing upgrades to sustain life at home, and gearing up, training, and delegating activities to your community members. And if they die, they are dead permanently.I would reccomend this game to anyone who has grown tired with the recent ""zombie survival"" games that have been released. It is a game which I overlooked at first, but when I gave it a shot, I understood the hype behind it. The PC port is competent, but suffers from some minor framerate issues and graphical bugs. However, they are small enough to ignore for the most part. If you enjoy micromanagement, roleplaying games, and zombies, there is no doubt that you will enjoy this game.			"

I did that on the fear that this game would be so bad becouse its from 3rd person. Well turns out i coud not imagine it on 1st person view..lol..			"

												I bought the vanilla version of this game, it was decent fun for a while but gets old pretty quick, I don't know if I'd reccomend buying all the extra DLC. Overall I think it's the repetititveness of the tedious ""chores,"" that makes this game seem like a long play, but the actual storyline from start to finish is quite short. The game isn't all bad though it has some interesting features. It focuses more on building a successful group and community rather than on the actual zombie slaughtering. Don't get me wrong though, there's plenty of shooting zombies and mowing down hordes in a vehicle. If you like building forts, leading groups, and scavenging the same places repeatedly then this game is worth buying on sale at least for a once through.			"

												It's essentially an open world survival brawler. The best way to describe it is Sims crossed with Left 4 Dead. Ammo is hard to come by, zombies are easy to fight when there are not many of them, but if they swarm you are essentially screwed. Weapon variety is interesting, with all the subclasses covered. Customization is high, since you can build your own home (which is a very interesting concept). It's singleplayer, but it does eat up a lot of your time. It runs in real time (so building supressors can take 30 real time minutes, for instance). Very fun, very interesting, with decent graphics and load time. The game glitches at times, but it isn't enough to bother me. The camera does take some time to get used to. It's a port from an XBox game, so expect some glitching.			"

												You may be looking at how many hours i have played State of Decay and think 'wow looks like he really enjoyed the game' ... well, you'd have thought wrong.... kind of. I only played that many hours because i thought that i had to, i thought that game was actually deep enough and that all this survival business was the core of the game that keeps it going. Unfortunately though the survival aspect of the game is nothing but a set of chores which only serve to annoy you in the end. I enjoyed the game up until i realized just how shallow it was.As for the graphics... 'Ultra spec' looks a little better than xbox360? They should have just called ultra spec 'little better than xbox 360 spec' instead of insulting us like that. It looked well enough though, but it was more the gameplay and plot and survival i was interested in to be honest so graphics wise wasn't a factor in whether i liked the game or not. However, when i select ultra setting on a game i do so because i want that 'wow look at that' feeling. I'm guessing here, but all one would need to do to complete the game is simply collect all the materials away from your usual beaten paths around your base (and even around the bases you may choose later) and send out the message that you are willing to accept survivors to you camp then once you have enough people and materials to move and set things up you can move to the trucking warehouse and set up shop there. From the trucking warehouse I'd say most of the game is done with and the chore side of the game kicks in big time. I wasted so much time (without knowing it) at the Church when i was still under the belief that i had to play this game to survive and help others to survive. For me the kicker was when i was trying to build a watchtower and progress was halted due to not having HEAVY GLOVES!That was when i realized the game wasn't as 'deep' as i thought it was, then when i started using the 'cook a meal for the camp' option i was notified progress was halted because we needed WOODEN SPOONS!!!Without mumbling on to much, this game is not really forcing you to 'survive' and play that survival role, it instead relies on you role playing (pretending). Then again, what more should we have expected fro a game which was made for the xbox 360? I didn't even know this game existed until the Steam sale. If undead labs want to try this one again but purely for the PC and go all out with the survival aspect hinted at in this version then I'll certainly take a look at that one. However, I'm done with this after i test my theory about how shallow the game is. I'll play this once more and see how little it takes to actually complete the game. UPDATE: I started a new game on a new profile to see how quickly i could beat the game, however i have come to realize the level and depths of 'bugs' this game has, so I'm back to note what i remember: Radio Operater changing gender and race: The radio operator is someone who isn;t a selectable character, yet i returned from a mission with an ally who needed saving (again for 1millionth time) i went into the building to restock at the inventor and noticed someone different sitting at the radio. I opened up the menu to check the 'team page' and sure enough, Lilly Ritter (supposed to be white female) had now been replaced by a black male, her voice still came over the radio, but she was now gone, but i could select the black male called Lilly Ritter... though i didn't just in case it broke the game any more. Inventory being locked: After one of the many repeatable missions like go resuce your friend, or go help kill one of the special zombies or go cause a distraction so one of your firends can escape in the other direction... i came back to the base and tried to restock and no matter which angle of the inventory (which is a refridgerator) it would not let me access the inventory. I tried to change character and still no luck, i tried changing a few characters and it still woudln't let me in. So i quit the game and restarted and finally it let me access it, however, coming back from another mission it happened again and of course it meant that i had to quit them game. I gave it one more chance (3rd time lucky sort of thing) and thankfully it didn't happen again and hasn't happened after several hours gameplay. Friends just stand there: This has happened a lot to me so far and even on my very first playthrough of the game, but it happened in different ways for example, it owuld happen at the end of a mission to help them kill a special zombie so i thought nothing of it and simply move onto something else. However, it finally happened when i was trying to start a mission with someone, they just stood there, i couldn't talk to them at all. I simply left the area and returned and they were still standing there, they would even fight zombies but wouldn't talk or move unless a zombie provoked them into fighting. You can just leave them and allow that mission to fail and eal ith the losses that result such as moral and perhaps that character being hurt... or dead. Side Quests failing even though you completed them: I had this happen a few times and it is very annoying to say the least. Main Story Missions not progressing:Need i say any more about that.... i think we all know that sort of thing sucks. After recognizing all those 'bugs' i went in search of an update, instead of an update  i found MODS!!!The mods i installed were were all from Nexus: MtTannerBridgeREPAIRED-76-1-0 (This fixes the bridge at the start so you can simply drive over and not be bothered with time wasting nonsense) TowTruckV10-60-1-0(Removes all the very annoying car wrecks which are of course placed right in the middle of the roads and at turns, these were simply annoying and pointless and their placement wouldn't have made sense in reality, this mod rids you of their annoy presence)QMJS Extended Functions Mod-V1.4-87-1-4(This mod makes a number of changes, to numerous to list but the changes make more sense than what the developers were able to muster collectively, perhaps the guy who created this mod should be invited to work on a sequel or a full on PC version of this game)Those are the only three mods i installed and wow did they make things MUCH better, some of the bugs i had previously experienced were gone as well. Sadly the inventory being locked persisted and Lilly Ritter still went and had a sex change operation. So in closing... for the last time, i guess we shouldn't expect much from a game that was made for xbox 360, i man, they have to fit everything onto the dvd and that hardware has limitations which our master race PC's don't.I'm hoping this development team does something exclusively for the PC and listens to the community feedback they will no doubt have been getting, i can see why the game is liked and i myself want to like it more than i do, but the limitations are right there whispering your name and driving you crazy!!! We all know that a development team/publisher like Rockstar would do this and do it right first time around.. GTA 5 with zombies done in this sort of survival style? C'mon, you KNOW we want that!... that is all,			"

												I bought this game quite a while ago, on sale at a great discount. I then bought the DLC a short while later at another large discount. I think I payed around $10 all up. At that price, this game is great.However... despite this game having a few odd bugs here and there, and despite the shadows being overly dark that you need to have your headlights and flashlight on during the days, the developers decided to shaft all the original buyers of this game by effectively charging $30 for a graphical update! Even the sale discounts are far less generous today.From what I have read, nothing much has actually changed in the game itself. There is only a small amount of new content, mainly trivial things. The fact that they decided not to update the original game version smacks of greed and is an insult to the original fanbase.Fortunately for me, I have not had any issues running the game since this whole fiasco came to light, but I can see that many have. That is unforgivable, for the devlopers let paying costomers suffer with a broken game, while they push an expensive update as a new game. For shame!It's for these reasons that I connot recommend anyone to purchase ANY game from these immoral, money hungry developers, that do not appreciate the people that supported them through buying the original game and DLCs. If they updated the original game, and created something actually new, then I would have recommended supporting them. In the wake of what they have done, however, I implore averyone to never give these developers a single cent of your money!			"

												State of Decay is a zombie survival simulator (??????)Open world, third person action game where you fight to stay alive and keep people around you safe. You control various characters and do story and side missions just like GTA or games alike. The catch is: if a character dies, he's gone forever, meaning you have to be extra careful on your missions or be ready to find and recruit new survivors.The game has sweet mechanics and you'll have to mange resources to upgrade your base and keep your people happy. You'll go on rescue, trade, killing missions. You'll have to use stealth and improve your characters stats and level them up. You'll have to scavenge a lot and find better places to set you base.Aside from some technical issues and some bugs, the game is great, It really feels like you're in a The Walkind Dead episode. The game wont scare you but there's a tension around making your community thrive in this world.			"

												This is actually a really fun game once you get into it. It's a little confusing at first because they don't do a very good job of teaching you what you're supposed to do next, or even how to do it sometimes, but once you get the hang of the game, it's actually a lot of fun. The only thing missing is co-op play.UPDATE: I have now finished the game, so here's an updated review...I only have 2 main complaints about the game. First, as I said above, it does a pretty bad job of telling you how to do stuff. You have to figure out a lot of things on your own (which I guess could be considered ""realistic"" in a zombie apocalypse).The second is that it's really light on storyline missions. The side missions are pretty much constantly becoming available (kill this, deliver that, save this guy, clear that infestation, etc.), but they get a little repetitive toward the end of the game since the storyline missions are so sparse. As for gameplay, you don't play as a single survivor. You play as all of them, and level up their skills separately. When one gets tired or injured, you can switch to another one. Your survivors can also die, get infected, or freak out and kill themselves (or others), but you can also find new survivors take in around the world.Your home base (which can be moved to other locations if you want) has slots for building various structures like a med center, guard tower, crafting area, kitchen, etc. Each home location has different numbers of building slots, and require a different number of survivors to maintain.Depending on the number of survivors and outposts, your base consumes resources each day (food, meds, ammo, building materials, fuel), so you always have to be on the lookout for more. On top of that you need to keep your survivors stocked with weapons, food, meds and ammo that they use while they're out killing zombies.Overall, it's a really fun game that has a ton of potential. They just didn't quite live up to it with this one. Hopefully State of Decay 2 will be amazing.If you can find it on sale, I do recommend trying this game out.I paid $4.99.			"

												Pretty good, completed the game over the weekend, have yet to try the Lifeline or Breakdown DLC.Speaking critically the game is now unsupported and superseded by the YOSE edition. It's raw and buggy, the bugs were never patched out and bizzarely you can't close the game down without the game engine spitting out an error log. There are vast areas of the map where nothing happens and there's no reason to explore them, the pool of random events are small thus get old fast. The shaders, shadows and saturation of colours look pretty ugly and it's highlighted even more by certain lighting conditions / certain times of the day in-game, it looks like an old console game even maxed at 1080P. In my opinion the story and characters aren't well fleshed out at all, too many fleeting appearances to build up any sort of feelings on the NPC characters outwith your base and the story moves quickly to a conclusion but somehow manages to miss a trick in terms of storytelling, number of missions and variety of scenarios given the scope that the developers had to work with in a post apocalypse zombie infested setting. Where the game sets itself apart however is in creating a persistent world. Play the game for a few hours and come back a week later to find that queued construction works have been completed, survivors have scavaged supplies from adjoining buildings, a band of neighbouring survivors have been wiped out, in your absence zombie hordes are encroaching onto your base, a survivor from your base camp has went missing and worst case scenario if morale of a survivor gets especially low a survivor may kill themself in your absence.It's a nice touch which elevates generic gameplay mechanics, over saturated zombie themes and cliched characters into a dynamic singleplayer experience.

												I have played this game thoroughly and explored as many different aspects to it as I can find. I enjoyed every moment of it and would recommend it to those that are looking for a game in the zombie apocalypse survival genre. The basic premise is that the end of the world has come in the form of a zombie plague. There are a few survivors out there and you have to guide your community through the hostile environment. This is done through a combination of scavenging, base improvement / defence and missions. You have to play more than one character and build them up in different ways so they all contribute differently to the community as a whole.Positives: Easy to pick up and put down. Breakdown DLC provides endless hours of additonal 'surviving'. Easy to use and balanced experience system that is not too deep for this style of game. Permadeath suits this game perfectly. The sandbox environments have been carefully considered. Achievements that are enjoyable to work towards and do not feel like a pointless grind. Good fun!Negtives: Very short main story thread. Occaisional collision glitches that can be frustrating. Very low difficulty.Other Notes: Would have personally liked to have seen some form of crafting system in it, but understand why it isn't there. Contains nothing 'big'. For example, a hospital. Instead, a lot of small buldings placed together. Again, I understand why, but have a preference otherwise. It is not multiplayer enabled, which a lot of the community would like to see. It would be one of the finest co-op games around if it was, though it would need to be made a lot more difficult first.Conclusion:I won't go into the game mechanics too much. A lot of other reviews have already done that. I will say that I am very happy with the purchase I made here, and am keeping a close eye for any further DLC's.			"

The point is escaping the town you are in, but to do that you have to recruit more surivors, scavange for supplies, and survive long enough.   You setup a home base in one of the many locations throughout the city (Warehouse is the best South/West of map in town) and build things in your base like medical labs, sleeping bunks for extra people, storage, machine shops, etc.     The game also has RPG elements, each person has skills they can level up on a scale of 1-8, and you can pick a offensive and sometimes a defensive skill to specialize in.   Breakdown (DLC)While some people think this is a dumb idea, it's actually very entertaining.  The problem with the regular game is that after you get to the end of the campaign the zombies don't really get harder.   Breakdown is like the Walking dead, it goes on endlessly until you die.   Rather than escaping the town, you get to the RV and leave and restart the town with the difficulty level increased.   Each difficulty level provides new challengers/achievements you'll want to get, which unlock survivors from the story line. Lineline (DLC)This steps up the action significantly as you control the military after the events of the campaign inside the actual big city.  Sometimes this DLC frustraits people.   You  have a threat level of 1 - 3, when it goes to 3 zombies will attack your military base and you have to fend them off like any defense/wave type game.   What gets people mad is that they feel you don't have enough time to scavange / loot / complete quests before the threat level gets to 3.   The solution so this is to assign your men to ""thin the herd"" which will delay the increase in threat levels and give you enough time.   You can do this through the base overview section in your options.   This game does have bugs and glitches, none that I found were game breaking, they actually make me laugh so hard I usually end up dying from it.   You can be driving a car with a flat tire and just get lauched staight up into the air for example :)  Always funny.   The glitches are few and far between and definitely don't ruin the game.If you like zombie survival games and you haven't played this one you should already be buying it!   Oh, and on bugs/glitches.  I did mention it has some bugs, but it doesn't have 1,000,000 like the Standalone version of dayz.   "

												Their patches broke this game and offered little to no support.  A lot of potential marred by the fact that no new campaign missions occur.  Because of this, you could not move your home base, which made doing runs for food and ammo harder and harder because you'd have to travel further every time.  Some great ideas in this game, but cannot recommend it due to incompetence.			"

												i'm not a fan of games that: limit what you can do through ""energy"" like resources that force you to switch characters and straight up wait for things to get done in the game (buildings, upgrades), and getting punished for not playing on a daily basis. I didn't play it for maybe a week and when i came back to it people were dead, everything was infested, and supplies were almost empty. No thank you.			"

												You may be looking at how many hours i have played State of Decay and think 'wow looks like he really enjoyed the game' ... well, you'd have thought wrong.... kind of. I only played that many hours because i thought that i had to, i thought that game was actually deep enough and that all this survival business was the core of the game that keeps it going. Unfortunately though the survival aspect of the game is nothing but a set of chores which only serve to annoy you in the end. I enjoyed the game up until i realized just how shallow it was.As for the graphics... 'Ultra spec' looks a little better than xbox360? They should have just called ultra spec 'little better than xbox 360 spec' instead of insulting us like that. It looked well enough though, but it was more the gameplay and plot and survival i was interested in to be honest so graphics wise wasn't a factor in whether i liked the game or not. However, when i select ultra setting on a game i do so because i want that 'wow look at that' feeling. I'm guessing here, but all one would need to do to complete the game is simply collect all the materials away from your usual beaten paths around your base (and even around the bases you may choose later) and send out the message that you are willing to accept survivors to you camp then once you have enough people and materials to move and set things up you can move to the trucking warehouse and set up shop there. From the trucking warehouse I'd say most of the game is done with and the chore side of the game kicks in big time. I wasted so much time (without knowing it) at the Church when i was still under the belief that i had to play this game to survive and help others to survive. For me the kicker was when i was trying to build a watchtower and progress was halted due to not having HEAVY GLOVES!That was when i realized the game wasn't as 'deep' as i thought it was, then when i started using the 'cook a meal for the camp' option i was notified progress was halted because we needed WOODEN SPOONS!!!Without mumbling on to much, this game is not really forcing you to 'survive' and play that survival role, it instead relies on you role playing (pretending). Then again, what more should we have expected fro a game which was made for the xbox 360? I didn't even know this game existed until the Steam sale. If undead labs want to try this one again but purely for the PC and go all out with the survival aspect hinted at in this version then I'll certainly take a look at that one. However, I'm done with this after i test my theory about how shallow the game is. I'll play this once more and see how little it takes to actually complete the game. UPDATE: I started a new game on a new profile to see how quickly i could beat the game, however i have come to realize the level and depths of 'bugs' this game has, so I'm back to note what i remember: Radio Operater changing gender and race: The radio operator is someone who isn;t a selectable character, yet i returned from a mission with an ally who needed saving (again for 1millionth time) i went into the building to restock at the inventor and noticed someone different sitting at the radio. I opened up the menu to check the 'team page' and sure enough, Lilly Ritter (supposed to be white female) had now been replaced by a black male, her voice still came over the radio, but she was now gone, but i could select the black male called Lilly Ritter... though i didn't just in case it broke the game any more. Inventory being locked: After one of the many repeatable missions like go resuce your friend, or go help kill one of the special zombies or go cause a distraction so one of your firends can escape in the other direction... i came back to the base and tried to restock and no matter which angle of the inventory (which is a refridgerator) it would not let me access the inventory. I tried to change character and still no luck, i tried changing a few characters and it still woudln't let me in. So i quit the game and restarted and finally it let me access it, however, coming back from another mission it happened again and of course it meant that i had to quit them game. I gave it one more chance (3rd time lucky sort of thing) and thankfully it didn't happen again and hasn't happened after several hours gameplay. Friends just stand there: This has happened a lot to me so far and even on my very first playthrough of the game, but it happened in different ways for example, it owuld happen at the end of a mission to help them kill a special zombie so i thought nothing of it and simply move onto something else. However, it finally happened when i was trying to start a mission with someone, they just stood there, i couldn't talk to them at all. I simply left the area and returned and they were still standing there, they would even fight zombies but wouldn't talk or move unless a zombie provoked them into fighting. You can just leave them and allow that mission to fail and eal ith the losses that result such as moral and perhaps that character being hurt... or dead. Side Quests failing even though you completed them: I had this happen a few times and it is very annoying to say the least. Main Story Missions not progressing:Need i say any more about that.... i think we all know that sort of thing sucks. After recognizing all those 'bugs' i went in search of an update, instead of an update  i found MODS!!!The mods i installed were were all from Nexus: MtTannerBridgeREPAIRED-76-1-0 (This fixes the bridge at the start so you can simply drive over and not be bothered with time wasting nonsense) TowTruckV10-60-1-0(Removes all the very annoying car wrecks which are of course placed right in the middle of the roads and at turns, these were simply annoying and pointless and their placement wouldn't have made sense in reality, this mod rids you of their annoy presence)QMJS Extended Functions Mod-V1.4-87-1-4(This mod makes a number of changes, to numerous to list but the changes make more sense than what the developers were able to muster collectively, perhaps the guy who created this mod should be invited to work on a sequel or a full on PC version of this game)Those are the only three mods i installed and wow did they make things MUCH better, some of the bugs i had previously experienced were gone as well. Sadly the inventory being locked persisted and Lilly Ritter still went and had a sex change operation. So in closing... for the last time, i guess we shouldn't expect much from a game that was made for xbox 360, i man, they have to fit everything onto the dvd and that hardware has limitations which our master race PC's don't.I'm hoping this development team does something exclusively for the PC and listens to the community feedback they will no doubt have been getting, i can see why the game is liked and i myself want to like it more than i do, but the limitations are right there whispering your name and driving you crazy!!! We all know that a development team/publisher like Rockstar would do this and do it right first time around.. GTA 5 with zombies done in this sort of survival style? C'mon, you KNOW we want that!... that is all,			"

												Fact: Open world games WILL suck your time like no other game. So much to do and so much to see, especially if the world is able to be believed. These days I tend to quit open world games when I realise how much time I'm putting into them and not getting any enjoyment out of the game. State of Decay isn't one of those games, for me at least. Another Zombie game? Yeah but at least it gives you something to work with and the feeling that it is a survival game. How so? Resources are finite, which means that once you loot them and consume them, they are gone. Vehicles are destroyed, they do not respawn. There are chances that your survivors WILL die and not come back, depending on your actions or inactions. I've played nowhere near the amount that other players have but at this stage, I've got to say that I'm willing to delve further into State of decay and invest my time into it, because games are supposed to be fun and with this game, I'm having a blast!Just my quick opinion on graphics and gameplay so far....VISUALSThe graphics are a bit of a mix, one dissapointing thing is the graphics options for PC, there is a slider for low to ultra, the only thing that seems to diminish at lower settings is the quality of shadows and distance of them, the textures stay the same it seems and there is no way to turn off that damn annoying SSAO which I hate so much in games. I would have thought with a game that runs on the Cryengine3 the devs would have given the player a little more power in how they want the game to look. Perhaps the occasional looking muddy textures also but that's my only beef. On the other hand, you have nice looking sunshafts/moonshafts, nice effects from explosions and bullet trails. Man, there's nothing like throwing a firecracker near a propane tank, watching zombies flock to it while you hide away out of distance then BOOM! I could just waste time doing that all day. SOUNDSpeaking of BOOM! The sound isn't half shabby, when you shoot a gun, you damn well feel it. Hard to explain, in some games guns pop and you're left thinking "" wtf?...was that supposed to be a gunshot or explosion?""......in games that have had a bit of money thrown at them or someone who's got a knack for sound design, the guns  sound like they should. Example, guns sounds in Half-life 2 are unforgettable, you get to ""feel"" the sound, if you know what I mean. The music is very fitting if a little repetative at times but it really works. And most of all, my favorite, ambient noise. I think background noise is something thats underappreciated in a lot of games. For this game, you could turn the music off and actually hear what's going on in the world, crickets at night, the sound of a car that's got problems with the engine, distant zombies etc. GAMEPLAYAt first I thought the combat was a little shallow, button mash and you have zombie brains everywhere. You could do that and it's fine if you are one on one with a zombie or perhaps two but there IS somewhat of a technique as things get harder and you level up. You're going to find that if you just stand thare whacking zed in the face, you're going to be overcome by his buddies looking for a snack. Ok, it's not Batman or Sleeping dogs combat where you feel like the ultimate badass doomlord (Though that would be awesome in this game!). However, realistically, you are just a survivor with a weapon or two and combat is just so, realistic. You get certain skills as you level up which do help and as you progress, you start thinking of better ways to take them down.....or you could just run over them with your car...smack em with your car door!Overall, I'm finding this addictive. The last time I actually felt like I was progressing in a game and actually using the open world by missions and discovery was World of Warcraft. Which makes sense now, I read recently that one of WoW's co creators helped make this game. Even at full price, you'll get your moneys worth in my opinion. Highly recommend!			"

												Im going to recommend this game but there are a few things that I need to say. First, its a good all-around game. Its like someone took the GTA engine and made a zombie game. For some reason, it seems very resource heavy for what it is. Especially since it doesnt look that great. (my opinion) Foliage, faces, and other thigns that shouldnt be too blurry, seem to be blurry and colored incorrectly.And when I say its resource-heavy I am basing that on the fact that I can run Crysis 3 maxed out (as well as other resource heavy games). This game seems to be slower and working very hard to process an environment that isnt very complex, detailed, anti-aliased properly, et al. However, graphics dont always make a game. Outside of the visuals in the game the gameply itself is very solid. The controls and variety of actions (and environment reactions) are well thought out and work well in the environment. Plus, you have to take care to manage your camp well along with exploration and battles. So its a nice even balance between everything the game needs you to do to make your survival successful.If this game looked better I think I would play it a little more. That, and the controls are a little quirky for KB+M. I havent tried a controller yet but just by the way the latter performs I can tell a controller would work better. I would give this game a 6/10...but a very strong 6 on the core game only subtracting for controls, visuals, and impact on system resources. I got the game on sale and Im NOT sorry I bought it. With that said, there are other games that kick its♥♥♥♥♥thoroughly.			"

												This has everything I want from a zombie game.Except everything is just barely not good enough.It's heavily consolized, and basically every aspect of the game is just more annoying than fun, making this game hard to play. Time moves just slightly too quickly, controls are just slightly bad, time sensitive things pop up just slightly too often, Combat is inconsistant, melee is clunky and shooting is poor. This game is a chore to play, I couldn't have fun with it. Lack of real modding for it means I never will, again due to consolization. There's a rerelease they expect you to pay for, but I've played that version and it plays no differently, just more content and better graphics.			"

												MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ABOUT THE GAME!!! (You have been warned)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------State of Decay is a very fun game it is a 3rd person view. Very easy to access and use weapons.There are also ""missions"" you can do. Its a story/freeroam game which is nice. You don't have to do the missions if you want expansions/dlc are amazing not going to spoil those for you but back to the game good combat I think the graphics are pretty nice and if you complain about those well GRAHPICS ARE NOT LIFE PEOPLE.There also base building but be advised you CAN NOT build a base anywhere only houses/buildings with wall or fences can only build stuff inside base where there are ""Squares"".Spoilage begins.....      You can also build outposts to kill incomeing hordes. Hordes are a pack of zombies between 7-9 can easily kill hordes with cars ferals are kind of an instant kill with a car/truck/vans. Ferals, Ferals are a mutant zombie that are greenish/pale and are dangerous 1v1.There are also other mutants like. Bloaters, Bloaters are zombies that explode when near humans there ""acid"" brings down the Stamina and Vitality (Health) Note You can increase your Vitality by makeing a infirmary in your base.Juggernauts, Juggernauts are massive zombies that have alot of strength and takes 4-6 hits with a truck to kill them note Juggernauts are VERY DANGEROUS  in hand to hand combat. Screams I think they are called are every where (not that much). Screams have no arms and can not attack the only thing they do is call to other zombies to come and kill you (Must be close to one for it to scream) Screamers are also in ""Infestions"". Infestations are a lot of zombies with (1-3 screamers) usually in a building.Swat/army zombies have armor that protect them against bullets must kill with weapon or car. Well im done writing this BYE :D.			"

												State of Decay is a zombie survival simulator (??????)Open world, third person action game where you fight to stay alive and keep people around you safe. You control various characters and do story and side missions just like GTA or games alike. The catch is: if a character dies, he's gone forever, meaning you have to be extra careful on your missions or be ready to find and recruit new survivors.The game has sweet mechanics and you'll have to mange resources to upgrade your base and keep your people happy. You'll go on rescue, trade, killing missions. You'll have to use stealth and improve your characters stats and level them up. You'll have to scavenge a lot and find better places to set you base.Aside from some technical issues and some bugs, the game is great, It really feels like you're in a The Walkind Dead episode. The game wont scare you but there's a tension around making your community thrive in this world.			"

												This game is as close to ""The Perfect Zombie Game"" as I've played. Base and player management is not something that you always expect to work well within a 3rd Person Shooter, but it definitely adds a level of personal investment into the game.Overall, the game handles every portion of zombie fighting/survival management right: Sounds attract hordes, team mates can generally hold their own, supplies are low but managable, and death is handled excellently. When your player character dies, your group returns to the base and you automatically assume the role of another playable survivor, if one is living. Death means you lose that person FOREVER, but the game continues on (and saves automatically). It makes dying a SERIOUS deal - most modern games make death feel trivial. It is so impactful in this game, you might find yourself actually making consious decisions not to take risks you might take in other games because you don't want to lose all of the skills/items/time you've invested into developing a character.

												This is actually a really fun game once you get into it. It's a little confusing at first because they don't do a very good job of teaching you what you're supposed to do next, or even how to do it sometimes, but once you get the hang of the game, it's actually a lot of fun. The only thing missing is co-op play.UPDATE: I have now finished the game, so here's an updated review...I only have 2 main complaints about the game. First, as I said above, it does a pretty bad job of telling you how to do stuff. You have to figure out a lot of things on your own (which I guess could be considered ""realistic"" in a zombie apocalypse).The second is that it's really light on storyline missions. The side missions are pretty much constantly becoming available (kill this, deliver that, save this guy, clear that infestation, etc.), but they get a little repetitive toward the end of the game since the storyline missions are so sparse. As for gameplay, you don't play as a single survivor. You play as all of them, and level up their skills separately. When one gets tired or injured, you can switch to another one. Your survivors can also die, get infected, or freak out and kill themselves (or others), but you can also find new survivors take in around the world.Your home base (which can be moved to other locations if you want) has slots for building various structures like a med center, guard tower, crafting area, kitchen, etc. Each home location has different numbers of building slots, and require a different number of survivors to maintain.Depending on the number of survivors and outposts, your base consumes resources each day (food, meds, ammo, building materials, fuel), so you always have to be on the lookout for more. On top of that you need to keep your survivors stocked with weapons, food, meds and ammo that they use while they're out killing zombies.Overall, it's a really fun game that has a ton of potential. They just didn't quite live up to it with this one. Hopefully State of Decay 2 will be amazing.If you can find it on sale, I do recommend trying this game out.I paid $4.99.			"

												This game is as close to ""The Perfect Zombie Game"" as I've played. Base and player management is not something that you always expect to work well within a 3rd Person Shooter, but it definitely adds a level of personal investment into the game.Overall, the game handles every portion of zombie fighting/survival management right: Sounds attract hordes, team mates can generally hold their own, supplies are low but managable, and death is handled excellently. When your player character dies, your group returns to the base and you automatically assume the role of another playable survivor, if one is living. Death means you lose that person FOREVER, but the game continues on (and saves automatically). It makes dying a SERIOUS deal - most modern games make death feel trivial. It is so impactful in this game, you might find yourself actually making consious decisions not to take risks you might take in other games because you don't want to lose all of the skills/items/time you've invested into developing a character.

												The game is nice to you. That is, if you be nice to them zombies (sarcasm). Great game with a fair few flaws/bugs. Can be repetitive once you get far in the game. Just be prepared to put in a lot of hours into it, if you want to hunt down them cheavos to 100% the game!			"

												Ever wondered how it is to stand in the middle of the apocolypse with a non stop supply of zombies? That's exactly what this game give you the feeling that you're in a zombie infested world. there's not anything called a clear zone other than those you call home. The zombies WILL respawn and with my gameplay I must say I've been torn in half a couple of times			"

												I have played this game thoroughly and explored as many different aspects to it as I can find. I enjoyed every moment of it and would recommend it to those that are looking for a game in the zombie apocalypse survival genre. The basic premise is that the end of the world has come in the form of a zombie plague. There are a few survivors out there and you have to guide your community through the hostile environment. This is done through a combination of scavenging, base improvement / defence and missions. You have to play more than one character and build them up in different ways so they all contribute differently to the community as a whole.Positives: Easy to pick up and put down. Breakdown DLC provides endless hours of additonal 'surviving'. Easy to use and balanced experience system that is not too deep for this style of game. Permadeath suits this game perfectly. The sandbox environments have been carefully considered. Achievements that are enjoyable to work towards and do not feel like a pointless grind. Good fun!Negtives: Very short main story thread. Occaisional collision glitches that can be frustrating. Very low difficulty.Other Notes: Would have personally liked to have seen some form of crafting system in it, but understand why it isn't there. Contains nothing 'big'. For example, a hospital. Instead, a lot of small buldings placed together. Again, I understand why, but have a preference otherwise. It is not multiplayer enabled, which a lot of the community would like to see. It would be one of the finest co-op games around if it was, though it would need to be made a lot more difficult first.Conclusion:I won't go into the game mechanics too much. A lot of other reviews have already done that. I will say that I am very happy with the purchase I made here, and am keeping a close eye for any further DLC's.			"

												Undead Labs comes out with a fantastic twist on the Zombie genre. State of Decay introduces high level survival involving base establishment, building, resource management, questing, and zombie apocalypse all mixed together. Story:A simple fishing trip in Mt. Tanner goes completely wrong for our starting hero Marcus Campbell and his friend Ed Jones. It doesn’t take long for Trumbell Valley to go down the toilet as the zombie virus spreads throughout the land. With an abundance of cast it is up to whomever you decide to bring the remaining survivors together and figure out what the military is up to in this forsaken valley.Campaign:State of Decay is not like any other game you’ll play. Your characters are completely dynamic in that anyone who dies is lost forever, but the campaign continues as if the person lost never existed to begin with. The campaign is delivered through missions that are randomly assigned based on events on the map and total missions currently in progress. The missions vary from side-missions with a story, the main campaign, and then random filler missions. Although, be careful because the missions can also glitch if you develop too quickly resulting in the campaign never fully deploying. In my person campaign I was unable to actually beat it despite playing 30+ hours because my final missions never deployed as I had too many filler missions blocking the deployment of the final campaign missions. Gameplay:Each person you find has independent experience sets which can be raised to make each character as strong as the last. Selecting from a list of customized traits combined with unique character traits you can fully develop unique characters. I found myself playing different characters just to level them so they would be more competent when running scavenger missions or hunt missions. The stronger you make each of your survivors the more competent they are in battle; sadly they do not level unless you play them. Some traits like wits and cardio are only applicable if you are using the survivor. On the other hand some traits like fighting and special unique traits transfer making them much more useful in combat.  The zombies you fight have various speeds which allow them to be each unique in how you much approach them, but not only are the regulars different they’ve also provided special zombies which include: SWAT, Bloater, Juggernaut, Screamer, and Feral. The SWAT is essentially a regular zombie with armor making them invulnerable to bullets; the bloater is a zombie that upon death releases toxic gas; the juggernaut is a very strong zombie that although in vulnerable to all attacks is not able to be knocked back; the screamer is a zombie that releases you guessed it a mighty scream that attracts other zombies and stuns survivors; finally the feral which the scariest of the lot uses its high speed to pin survivors (similar to a hunter), but with enough work you can get them off. DLC:Breakdown:I haven’t played Breakdown truly, but from the little I did it seems like just the regular game with less base management and more free-roam. The little objectives are made null and instead you focus on character development. I will update this once I figure out more about the game.Lifeline:This is probably one of the best DLC expansions I have ever seen. Lifeline offers a whole new city with new features that make a brilliant campaign. The city although not fully unlocked provides a campaign that can be finished in two ways with a score-card based on your progress through the campaign. For every thirty-forty minutes a siege occurs on your home base where you must hold up against an even greater foe. Each level there are more zombies, hordes, and even infestations. This progressively makes the campaign more difficult to play – of course at the same time each of the survivors becomes more powerful as you train them up. This campaign offers an interesting story with new dynamics and features. Results:State of Decay and its DLC’s are a brilliant set to add to the zombie genre. The permanent death feature is a great addition to the game by making each character the protagonist. This adds a huge amount of depth to the gameplay as well as the story. In fact the Lifeline DLC reminds me of how expansions traditionally used to be, a whole new game that built off the old one rather than just a single unlock. This is a fantastic zombie game with amazing combat, character dynamics, and story. Despite some glitches that may make the campaign unbeatable the game is still definitely a lot of fun. I would recommend this game and its DLCs especially if you can grab it on a sale.Pros:+Permanent death, which means every survivor is the protagonist.+Base building; depending on your gameplay you can either go big or small. You get to play how you want the campaign to flow.+Other survivor camps, they are spread throughout the game and appear randomly to make the world seem more alive.+Character customization, each character although has the same attributes is unique based on how you play them.+Fun combat system, lots of weapons and different play styles that combine with abilities. Cons:-The game may glitch causing you to be unable to complete the campaign.-Lifeline has a spawn glitch, possibly due to the smaller playable area, where zombies spawn randomly even right within range as you are fighting. If you turn the camera and then immediately turn it back around the area will usually be full of zombies again.-The filler missions can be incredibly annoying and repetitive, especially if you have a big camp. Sometimes if you don’t complete them your survivors die. "

												Yet another zombie game in an already really crowded genre and yet this still manages to feel a bit fresh. The real focus in this game is survival. You'll need to set up a base, find supplies, recruit survivors all while defending yourself from zombies. The game has a great open and persistant world. If you see a house or building you can more than likely enter it and search for supplies. When you gather those supplies they won't respawn. So the more you scavenge the less there is and this will make you need to plan things a bit. Will you stay in an area where you have a safe base but you scvenged most of the supplies, or will you uproot and move to a new area which is less safe but has loads of unexplored buildings which may be packed with loot?You also have to manage your survivors carefully. The great thing is that each survivor has their own strengths and weaknessess and their own personality and since you'll be switching between survivors as they get tired or injured as you'll get attached to some and end up disliking others. Once a survivor dies in the game thats it they're gone, which will really make you think about whether to take risks or not.There are a few things that let the game down however. Firstly the graphics look outdated. Also i started playing this game with a m+k and just found it too awkward so switched to a controller which was a massive improvement.. I'd strongly recommend using a controller for this game. Even with the controller i found the combat a bit clunky at times.Also once you've established your base and are living comfortabl enough it starts to get boring. Not helped by the annoying side quests that pop up far too often. Also the near constant stream of reminders you get over the radio about a side quest when your doing something else is irritating to say the least. Unlike the main quests which can be left for as long as you want not doing a side quest will lead to consequences as they seem to have a time limit in which to be completed. Sometimes these consequences can mean you losing a survivor so didn't like this either. The worst side quest is the Besieged ones. It basically has you under siege from zombies in a house with other survivors where you'll board up the windows and fight off the zombies which sounds fun but is anything but. As to beat the mission you have to kill all attacking zombies and as zombies can wander into the area you can end up with a constant stream coming at the house which can make this mission drag out for a good 15-20 minutes.Overall, though this game is still good despite it's flaws. I would recommend giving it a go as for the first 10 or so hours i was hooked on it. It's a 7.5/10 for me. "

Also downloaded the 2 extra DLCs for this which just enhance the game even further but don't do what I did and start with the DLC if you havn't played it before start at the beginning with the in game tutorial.

												Their patches broke this game and offered little to no support.  A lot of potential marred by the fact that no new campaign missions occur.  Because of this, you could not move your home base, which made doing runs for food and ammo harder and harder because you'd have to travel further every time.  Some great ideas in this game, but cannot recommend it due to incompetence.			"

Ive looked for ways to boost FPS but theres basically nothing you can do. For some reason theres to bars on the side of my screen because the game doesnt fit it even with my aspect ratio on the highest and resoulution on high. The game needs more optimization options to help make the game run better. Like the only option that might give you an FPS boost in Vsync on or off. I'm pretty sure im not the only one haveing troubles playing this game either, ive seen alot of videos on how bad and laggy the game runs.

												At first it was fun, with a storyline starter equal to walking dead or last of us then, after the first death. There was no response, i mean it just changed to another montonous character with little to no emotion. This truely killed the game for me, afterward the missions just became repetition a pure zombie gta in the end. The story? What story you can go anywhere, allies are useless, ammo reloads take too long and stamina recharge is a joke, cleared areas turn into bloody fights for your life for no apparent reason rather your quiet or not, the depth of characters is realized to be flat after the first death. There is no main character just random players who you can play as after your 'friends'. No restart you continue or you restart the game completely. Clearing the area never seems to work even when you put outposts sourrounding your base. You will get hit by 6 hordes a second for no apparent reason, and the lady on the radio wont shut up if her life depended on it, GTA 4 with online dating blimp, it was rediculious. I had hopes in the first 10 hrs till someone died, then i realized all the flaws afterward. A frustrating, repetitive game without any real depth.			"

												While I do think this is a decent game (I'll probably continue to play it from time to time) I have some gripes. First, the pacing is terrible. There is always too much to do and it's hard to tell what is the most important task at the moment. Second, there is no fast travel in a game with a wide open map so each time you do a task you're going to be driving past the same things again and again (pretty boring). Lastly, I have no idea what the objective is - I mean survival is obvious, but is there anything else? It doesn't seem that you can actually work the zombie population down and the relationships with people are inconsequential. What's the big goal I'm working toward!?If these complaints sound like ones you would care about, don't buy. If you just like hopping in vehicles and running over zombies for hours then this is right up your alley.			"

												This game tries to do a lot of things, but doesn't succeed at any one of them well enough to recommend it. Combat is often sluggish, there's a lot of micro-managing busywork, and the story has little going for it. There are a huge number of player characters, and you can swap between them at will. Any of them are able to die, meaning they all have to be fairly generic stand-ins for the most part, so the story can continue unimpeeded by a death. It also uses a few annoying casual gaming tricks, like long timed events (some buildings take many real-world hours to construct), and a realtime resource system that punishes the player for not playing regularly. It's also worth noting that you can't save. The game saves automatically, so any screwups are permanent.It's an open-world game with a huge list of things to do, most of them irrelevent to the story, and you won't have time to get to most of it if you plan on scavenging resources for your group. I feel like this could have benefited greatly from an RTS-type primary interface, with the option to zoom down to individual level at will. But as it stands, you'll find yourself choosing between keeping your group allive and happy, and taking care of more important story business. It would be a much better game if it allowed you to send other people out to do the busywork.Overall, it's still fairly unique and interesting, and arguably worth a look for that alone. But I can't recommend it in anything more than a $5 sale.			"

												In a nutshell, this is a case of not quite.The game tries to implement a survivor community that can be built up and protected. It has some nice features, albeit unpolished and half-thought. Easily the worst feature of the game is the horrendous graphics, and low resolution. I can forgive a game not having next-gen graphics, but this is so bad you literally seem to be viewing the game with tunnel vision. It is a third person viewpoint that has about the peripherals you would expect in a first person viewpoint. The colors bleed into each other so badly it makes you want to cringe. Combat is the next worst feature. It's clunky, it's unrefined, and it's annoying. Zombies laying on the ground will do some sort of disco dance trying to get up at you. They will spin around, perform whatever was supposed to pass for animation, and is now biting your neck. Attacking is simply a LMB mashfest, and everything feels so unrealistic and fake, that you simply don't feel like you're even involved in the fighting. There seems to be no way to toggle crouching or running. Nope, they make you hold the button. Because that's fun. Hurray for console ports.... Weapon durability on the game is hilariously low. You'll be breaking things as soon as you find them. And with such a limited inventory for items, you'll just love using it up for multiple weapons to switch to, because somehow that metal wrench keeps breaking in half. Item durability to this degree is a cheap means of implying resource scarcity, because the devs didn't have the creativity to think of something less annoying to convey that thought. The world is small. I mean, it's small. Small town? More like a studio backdrop. You can stand on a roof and pretty much see everything you're working with. And it's all a block or two away. All in all, for a cheap indie game I give them a thumbs up for trying. But this isn't the survivor sandbox they make it out to be. Items do not respawn because it's not realistic....oh, but those zombies respawning in the same locations doing the same things they were doing the last 10 times you killed them, that's realistic! The survivor missions are tedious and boring, and it feels like you're playing The Sims, trying to get all of their little need bars filled up, rather than a zombie survival game. Pass on it. Trust me. This isn't the game you've been waiting for. "

												The game looked very impressive on the store page and it looked like it'd make for a great buy, and at first, I thought I was right. After a few hours however I noticed the game really didn't have much in the way of content and was more of a loosely guided sandbox game, which wasn't too bad except that after a total of maybe three hours I discovered it was incredibly repeditive and grindy.It's an okay game but I can't reccomend it as it stands right now, generic story line, generic characters (You'll notice there's only four voices in the game) and incredibly poor mechanics to the game itself.

												Very poor physics and gameplay. I am a big fan of zombie games and while the idea is fantastic there is very little to be happy about when it comes to gameplay. The sneaking ability is clumsy, the zombies go from lying to standing up in a single frame and the camera and zombies keep moving through walls. The game tries to promote free exploration, but hardly allows for any sort of free form movement. Gameplay 10 years behind its time! 1/10			"

												3rd Person Single Player DAY Z inspired by the Walking Dead.This is a very good game if you can get past the random bugs and glitches.   The game without the DLC is a basic campaign/story mode where you control a group of survivors.   The point is escaping the town you are in, but to do that you have to recruit more surivors, scavange for supplies, and survive long enough.   You setup a home base in one of the many locations throughout the city (Warehouse is the best South/West of map in town) and build things in your base like medical labs, sleeping bunks for extra people, storage, machine shops, etc.     The game also has RPG elements, each person has skills they can level up on a scale of 1-8, and you can pick a offensive and sometimes a defensive skill to specialize in.   Breakdown (DLC)While some people think this is a dumb idea, it's actually very entertaining.  The problem with the regular game is that after you get to the end of the campaign the zombies don't really get harder.   Breakdown is like the Walking dead, it goes on endlessly until you die.   Rather than escaping the town, you get to the RV and leave and restart the town with the difficulty level increased.   Each difficulty level provides new challengers/achievements you'll want to get, which unlock survivors from the story line. Lineline (DLC)This steps up the action significantly as you control the military after the events of the campaign inside the actual big city.  Sometimes this DLC frustraits people.   You  have a threat level of 1 - 3, when it goes to 3 zombies will attack your military base and you have to fend them off like any defense/wave type game.   What gets people mad is that they feel you don't have enough time to scavange / loot / complete quests before the threat level gets to 3.   The solution so this is to assign your men to ""thin the herd"" which will delay the increase in threat levels and give you enough time.   You can do this through the base overview section in your options.   This game does have bugs and glitches, none that I found were game breaking, they actually make me laugh so hard I usually end up dying from it.   You can be driving a car with a flat tire and just get lauched staight up into the air for example :)  Always funny.   The glitches are few and far between and definitely don't ruin the game.If you like zombie survival games and you haven't played this one you should already be buying it!   Oh, and on bugs/glitches.  I did mention it has some bugs, but it doesn't have 1,000,000 like the Standalone version of dayz.   "

												This game is a bomb!The game features many, many things. Looting, crafting, shooting and melee and so much more like driving stealthing and saving survivors and much more. The game is has horrible colors, and by horrible i mean so bad its like they used crayon to color the green grass with brown collor, but the game is only made by 22 or 21 developers so I wouldnt blame them on such colors and the game is worth more than $20. zombies are great and so many zombie types.As much as the game updates I still see some bugs and crashes and sometimes it starts losing framerate from 60 to 30 and I have better than the recommended specs thats probably because the game has the same port as the Xbox 360 version which is really bad since we will have to put us with console power, I mean we are The PC Gaming Master Race, for God's sake give us more framerate on 1080p!!!  So about the story isnt much of a deal and has no sense in it, well its because its not important at all i mean its only first couple of missions and the rest of the game is about you finding a way to survive. I have some issues with the ending, the bugs and the colors, so i give it an 8.8/10. recomended for survivors,			"

												Pretty good, completed the game over the weekend, have yet to try the Lifeline or Breakdown DLC.Speaking critically the game is now unsupported and superseded by the YOSE edition. It's raw and buggy, the bugs were never patched out and bizzarely you can't close the game down without the game engine spitting out an error log. There are vast areas of the map where nothing happens and there's no reason to explore them, the pool of random events are small thus get old fast. The shaders, shadows and saturation of colours look pretty ugly and it's highlighted even more by certain lighting conditions / certain times of the day in-game, it looks like an old console game even maxed at 1080P. In my opinion the story and characters aren't well fleshed out at all, too many fleeting appearances to build up any sort of feelings on the NPC characters outwith your base and the story moves quickly to a conclusion but somehow manages to miss a trick in terms of storytelling, number of missions and variety of scenarios given the scope that the developers had to work with in a post apocalypse zombie infested setting. Where the game sets itself apart however is in creating a persistent world. Play the game for a few hours and come back a week later to find that queued construction works have been completed, survivors have scavaged supplies from adjoining buildings, a band of neighbouring survivors have been wiped out, in your absence zombie hordes are encroaching onto your base, a survivor from your base camp has went missing and worst case scenario if morale of a survivor gets especially low a survivor may kill themself in your absence.It's a nice touch which elevates generic gameplay mechanics, over saturated zombie themes and cliched characters into a dynamic singleplayer experience.

												Probably the most relastic zombie game going. If you kill a zombie it doesn't drop anything and you don't gain anything by it apart from safety if it attacking obviously. you have to scavange all the time for food, fuel, building materials and weapons once a place has been searched thats it nothing respawns! that includes people and vehicles! Also downloaded the 2 extra DLCs for this which just enhance the game even further but don't do what I did and start with the DLC if you havn't played it before start at the beginning with the in game tutorial.

												It's quite interesting, it focuses on survival more than most zombie games. Ammo is scarce but not too scarce as to make guns useless... The hordes can be problematic, and Character Permadeath is always a good motivation to take it slow.Don't buy the DLC if you're expecting randomly generated maps, I was and it may well be my fault for not reading the DLC carefully. It's still enjoyable but feels less urgent than the story line. Another gripe I have with the DLC is the lack of player creation. If I'm going to forge my own story, why can't I forge my own survivor based on what I'd like? Before you unlock other more useful survivors, the chances of getting a useful survivor to play as are slim, a fair portion of recruited survivors, and NPCs in a home base you select will be drunken losers.SoD definately made me enjoy it, I had fun with it, and I still pick it up from time to time, but I don't end up investing nearly as much time into it as when I first bought it.

If your just screwing around and start exploding things, or shooting the place up the zombies can rain down on you in a hurry.  This game also comes in with a base building, micro management sorta game play, Plus a decent story. There is an ending but once that is seen you can continue in a sandbox mode. I enjoyed it.			"

												Great idea..... poor exectution.Its tough and exciting at first, however once you get the swing of things its very easy. The game has alot of things going for it.-The story is pretty cliche.... not much to it.- I couldn't really get into the characters. When someone died it was always a ""so what""?? (for me anyway)-Open world which seemed nice at first glance, but don't be fooled....... there is a small crappy village ( you will spend an hour or so in)a midsize town which is meh.....and a huge town which is really cool.....But sadly this is it unless you want to count the miles of farms and barns (which is forgettable and not worth your time)-The base bulding is okay, but kind of a joke. Theres only two large bases in the game. One large base is by the important missions, loot, etc and the other is in bum f*** no where. So its pretty obvious were everyone is gunna post up at near end game. Base building would of been cool if they made it more customizable. (Once again... Good idea, Bad execution)- Finally the gameplay is fun till you descover cars and your character gets OP. Seriously cars in a zombie survival game ruin it. Everyone knows if you're ever in deep s*** to drive back and forth killing all the aggro zeds. Also hordes of zeds begin there march towards your base which seems cool till you realize the sandbox is covered with cars that make great zombie lawn mowers. Overall its a meh game. If you buy it, it will keep ya busy for a day or two... maybe 3?? But thats about it "

												State of Decay provides a well made, open world Zombie Suvival experince, of quality and brilliance that few ""Zombie Survival"" games tend to offer. The Mix of Action RPG, Base building, and over all open world survival gameplay gives an ambitious quota to fill. Though State of Decay even only From the Vanilla Story mode succeds in most if not all these aspects. With only minor complaints with some, confusing side missions, bugs, and annoying reptitive voiceovers.""State Of Decay's"" story takes place in Turnbull Valley, TX (I assumed a psudeonym for a real area.) In which you are thrust into the lives of several surviors who must interact with local squatters, the military, police forces and so on. The story is not specfic in said overall arch, but more events and minor charecter devlopments. The goal is to survive and escape the valley with whatever help you can suffice from the locals and supplies from descarted areas. Turnbull valley is full of interesting and unique landmarks and locations that help it stay interesting over your trek through the game. It really feels like a proper country area of the United States fairly untouched by city life. With mid 50's styles local attractions set up like the Bronto Gas Station.  Set up wise Turbull Valley reminds me of the county in Swery's Deadly Premontion. In fact I really often get reminded of Deadly Premontion when driving around out collecting things, due to their similar gameplay.The gameplay varies in several different ways:The Action RPG elements come from combat gained skills in a sort of beat'em up/ third person shooter ala Resident Evil Shooting. The combat can get very crowded and it's very easy to get over whelmed if not with an ally or if you are ill experinced. Stealth can be employed while on foot, and weapons vary from melee, guns, and items. All Acuired throught yor adventureBase building and mangement involves building new faciilities for supplies and food and shelter. Such as Workshops, Farms, Bunkhouses,etc. Supplies are collected and traded with supply chests and outposts to protect and keep watch of an overall area. Giving base building and making sure you have enough outposts a important major goal next to most other priorities.The Open world exploration is involves scouring buidlings and lookign for vantage points to survey the lay of the land for buidlings, zombies and other curiosties. Surveying helps clear up whats in the are so exploration is slightly easier, and outposts can be set up. The Last and minor gameplay mechanic would be driving, Driving works fine for what it is, but you can easily ran into things and often wreck up your car easily if you are not careful.Oddly enough and it's most likley intentional Vehicular Combat is the best way to dispatch Undead foes in SOD (except for the largest vareity of zombies Juggernauts) As it almsot always kills them immeditaly. I found my self constantly finishing missions and escaping by hopping in a car and going maximum overdrive on the hordes. Good or bad driving is sorta clunky.Missions:Missions consist of several types.Helping a ally, Hunting a Zombie, trading, clearing infestations, and story missions. All of these have minor variations. Most missions will get reptitive after a few times, but story missions help mix things up to add more depth to the gameplay. While It'd be nice if there was more minor story missions or overally different types the Storymode Delivers.Overall the gameplay is very fun and slightly clunky in soem areas, but imagine GTA with Zombies Aesthetics. Now onto the video and sound. If you're not a fan of bloom effects and heavy shadows like me you might dislike the graphics. Though the game does look amazing in of it's self and has an overall sepia tone to the game and purpleish hues at night. It's very atmospheric and feels bizzare and creepy. The feeling of not knowing whats ahead really emiantes at night. The Graphics are great, but not for people who dislike bloom.Audio, The Soundtrack consists of several differnt event themes such as for horde attacks and Home base music.As well as road music and so on. It's a vey nice mix of slow guitar that gives a melocholy down on the ranch feel.The voice actings good with some only minor complaints with the infamous line ""you know, some stuff"" when supplies are delivered to home base. Good all around.ControlsSOD was orgianlly made for consoles and this shows, with it's driving and running. It's not easy to learn at first and as i used keyboard things felt clunky due to some of the keybindings used. The worst thing to ever happen to me was having a charecter fall to their dead from a cell tower since i moved to fast to the ladder. I was really bugged by it, but later learned later to move slower near ladders. The controls are dfeinatly a minor but needed hurdle, but it plays like most openworld games overall in it's controls; just in third person.Who will like this:If you love The Walking Dead, Survival Games, Resident Evil, GTA, or you want a refined take on the Zombies survival.In ConclusionState of Decay shines for it's Gameplay and exploration features, It's not really a signle genre it's more like a Role Playing game made proper into a video game. It's a mix of minor mechanics from different genres and turns them into an awesome smoothie of gaming.I really enjoyed iState of Decay and felt wanting more as I finished the game in a day, I've only thus far played the orgrinal story mode so I have yet more to come. I'm eager to knwo what happens next!!I can't wait to play the DLC and hope that it improves upon the already addictive and awesome gameplay.			"

												Excellent zombie game with a sandbox style (and a bit of base management), State of Decay is a good title for zombie lovers. The graphics are pretty decent, the worldmap is big enough and the story keeps you interested throughout your journey. The gameplay itself might take a while to get used to, the melee system could be improved but the animations for the kills are pretty awesome.This isnt just some brainless game where you go out and kill every zombie without worrying about health, when you consider that you can play as multiple characters and they actually die if you arent careful and try to face more than you should. The DLCs also add new features and an infinite sandbox mode, plus a new city and different playable characters so it isnt a waste of money if you get those aswell.TL;DR Buy the game.7,9/10 "

												I'm going to start out and say that I like this game. That being said, I felt like the emphasis on managing all your people really got in the way of my enjoyment. I turned the game off with the morale of my home being pretty high and came back a few days later with people missing, morale low, and someone dead. This game feels more like a management game which leaves a sour taste in my mouth. I feel like i'm being forced to please the home area rather than do stuff I want to do. The core game is solid though. While fairly basic, the combat is pretty sastifying. Everything has a crunchy sound which makes hits feel impactful. The stealth is so-so. It boils down to crouching behind zombies in the end. Searching for materials, finding survivors, finding new homes (that you can upgrade), and exploring are all really interesting. I wish the game focused more on that rather than morale and managing people.The voice-acting at times feels really lame. Some moments that should have left you caring a little more missed their mark. I would recommend this game to anyone interested because for the price it's very good.			"

												IMMERSIVE & UNIQUEThe best games know the difference between a movie and a video-game, State of Decay is one of those few. SoD is a framework of interlocking systems that determines the fate of a handful of survivors that you control. You choose a place to build your base, scavenge for supplies to keep it going, run over zombies with cars and trade with and help other surviving communities.Everything is finite; from resources and vehicles to ammo and indeed the survivors themselves; the AI is intelligent and reacts to events believably; treat someone badly or overwork them, and they may leave your roof, losing a well loved survivor to the zombies demoralizes the rest (and you too). Vehicles are powerful tools to kill massive hordes of zombies with, but if they get destroyed, you may soon find yourself at the mercy of the hordes.Sound also plays an important role in your affairs in zombieville; running is more dangerous than walking, sneaking is the safest and slowest; speeding along the road in a car brings out all the zombies from their hidey holes, cruising slowly is safer, but not ideal when you are enroute to save someone. Weapons break in the middle of fights; ammo runs out all too soon and dodging and shoving away the undead is as important as slicing their arms off and bashing their brainless heads against the closest wall.While the main game does have a story that explains the mechanics; its the DLC Breakdown that is the 'Real' SoD for me; in Breakdown; once you start finding the game too easy (or run out of resources on the map); you can choose to refresh the map, this comes at a cost though; each time the map is refreshed, the game becomes harder, throwing more zombies at you, more hordes and more specials. An important fact to note is that the game has a small but dedicated modding community with quite a few mods that enhance the gameplay and visuals. Its no Skyrim, but its something.State of Decay is not a storytelling benchmark, its not a polished title from a well known studio, neither is it a graphical beast that will bring your computer to its knees; its much more than those trivial things.

												State of Decay is a zombie simulation game from Undead Labs. REMEMBER Coop isn't in the future they already stated that they will not be adding it. From all the characters to the many hours of fun you can have in this game i totally think it worth it. When you are fighting off massive heards of zombies and you get ripped in half... that to me makes it fun, this is a hardcore zombie survival sim so if 1 character dies you cannot play as them unless you make a new game, and they have auto-save so you cannot scam them C:. Overall State of Decay is amazing I would reccomend your purchase it on Steam more than XBLA because of the graphic improvments and you can use a Xbox 360 controller with it anyway.This game is so fun you need to buy it now... Get ready for the zombie apocolyspe it is coming and you need to get ready!			"

												Zombie lovers and open world type of gamers. Not bad if your a boring person like me to play single player games all the way. Theres just too many missions to go through and sometimes you dnt know which one to go to. Locations are far from each other, taking a car is better and when it gets dark seriously just stay at the ""home"" seriously no use to come out fighting unless your not a scardy-cat like me. Not really one of the best zombie games but Hey! i bought it on sale and no its not boring once you get into the game.			"

AudioThe audio content in State of Decay is somewhat lacking. Combat and general music is generally the same, looping over and over at times with brief pauses of silence which from a survival perspective the sometimes quiet and eerie really goes hand-in-hand with the world around you, its mood and feel.Verdict: 6/10.ContentWhen I first got into the world of State of Decay I thought, wow, this is going to be a MASSIVE romp around the map. Sadly, I was let down, just a tad bit. What would seem like a massive open-world map is really just an illusion, the world itself is quite small and the content offered equally so. Half if not three quarters of the map is simply open ground with no content whatsoever, which really makes the entire worldspace feel quiet empty, and owing to the fact that zombies spawn in tiny groups here and there (minus the hordes) adds on to the “lifeless” feel, not in a good way though.Verdict: 8/10.ControlsThe first thing I have to bring up is that this was a direct port from the Xbox, that being said without a controller you may feel the controls are a bit clunky compared to actual PC games. Though things have gotten substantially better through all the patches from the developers I still can’t help but feel that movement isn’t quite fluid yet, jumping around and onto objects feel awkward, camera movement and aiming also feels a bit off, but nothing truly gamebreaking. But hook up an Xbox controller and these problems cease to appear. If you do have one, I would thoroughly recommend making use of it as it just plays much better than on a keyboard and mouse.The controls DO work however; they are responsive and do what you need them to do. From opening doors to getting into vehicles to busting a zombies jaw wide open they get the job done and that is all that matters here.Verdict: 8/10.EnvironmentTrumbull Valley is the region that the player is thrust into, a region typical of a western settlement in the USA. Canyons here and there, rivers flowing through, industrial areas and residential ones, all dotted across the map. It’s got a great feel for the type of game it is and just makes it that much more believable.You can really tell that a lot of time went into creating all the areas that the player can explore since it feels natural. Groups of houses together in an urban environment, you have the local store down the road, the bar which opposite it is the post office and of course you have the garage down the road. It just feels well thought out and not just randomly placed.Verdict: 9/10.FunGive a person an assortment of weapons to take on a never-ending amount of zombies and a great time will be had given all the variety in weaponry but too much of a good thing doesn’t last, though luckily there’s always something to be done in State of Decay and our beloved Lily makes sure of that!The biggest downfall of State of Decay is its grind factor. In the beginning “materials” is your highest priority resource which is used for constructing and upgrading your various buildings. To acquire materials one needs to scout out possible locations and search them. Usually a simple task can be the downfall of your survivor if you’re not prepared (especially in the beginning of the game) to take on zombies who lurk most of these places. Once you’ve cleared up the location (and hope more zombies aren’t attracted to the noise you’ve made) the task of searching the place for “containers” by holding “E” can begin! In the beginning this was quite exhilarating but when you need several hundred materials for your various tasks amidst all the other things that crop up (like saving other survivors) it becomes a boring choir which I would have at least thought one could construct a building that would provide income for ALL resources and not just food which funnily enough is the most abundant resource out there. There’s a ton of environment objects, furniture, fridges, cars etc yet one cannot break them down into materials?!Verdict: 4/10.GameplayGameplay revolves around scavenging enough supplies to survive the random zombie outbreaks that will directly affect your survivor community. You’ll find that unless you have a silencer attached to your guns you’re better off fighting hand-to-hand or with melee weapons so as not to attract the zombies in the area that will come running (if they’re not spawned in first that is).In a traditional third person perspective you will hack and slash through zombies to complete objectives and make supply runs. Later on you should have an abundance of ammo and silencers to make full use of your ranged arsenal which makes a big difference and where the game really shines.Verdict: 6/10.GraphicsSurprisingly for a port the graphics are actually quite attractive and crisp, and given the fact that you can further tweak them as per CryEngine specs make it all the more enjoyable.Verdict: 7/10.ImmersionFor the first couple of hours I really felt like I was a survivor just trying to survive this outbreak. I took to the shadows, sneaked past countless zombies just to scavenge from the nearby house some food and medical supplies along with my first melee weapon; an axe! But as the grind slowly reared its ugly head I got thrown out of the immersion completely and just treated the game as a shoot-em up as by then I was already over-powered with all the weapons I had.Verdict: 5/10.QualityI personally waited over 6 months AFTER the game was released from its early access state just because of the fact of how broken the game was back then. Since then countless patches were released that pretty much re-shaped the entire game into completely playable.Verdict: 8/10.StoryYou start out with one of your buddies being attacked by a group of zombies at a fishing camp. After making swift work of them you spot a ranger station and decide to head towards it. From there the game eases into explaining its various combat and gameplay mechanics and before you know it you’re off to your very first community of survivors which will introduce quite a few ups and downs before you’re fully ready to take charge of getting everyone and everything organized.Verdict: 6/10.Pro’s*Large variety of weaponry, both melee and ranged.*Satisfying exploration feeling.*Detailed environments.*Great sounding weapons.*Easy to get into.Con’s*Can be quite a grind.*Very short story.*Breaks immersion too often.*Poor voice acting.*Largely empty/unused worldspace.SummaryState of Decay had a lot of potential but tried too hard to be a fighter-type action game and didn’t quite finish polishing up the survival aspect of the game, coupled with the fact that it was a direct port from the Xbox and they were limited to a 2GB filesize imposed by XBLA. Taking that into consideration, the gameplay and variety of weaponry is outstanding and with a beautiful and believable environment and graphics one could easily have a great time in Trumbull Valley.

(I made a Walking Dead character pack for it, since it's THAT awesome) It has it all you could wish for in a TRUE zombie survival game: loot, atmosphere, story, lots of playable characters & all kinds of events.Do yourselves a nice favour, and buy it now. I always loved zombie games, but this one is just really worth playing & buying, especially for the price that it's out now.Personal score: 9.0/10Best regards,Dukhat			"

Finish quests and follow the story line or try to survive as long as possible. (There are not infinite ressources, cars etc, so be careful). If your character gets tired, no problem! Just switch with another character of your community and play him then. Be careful and don't overextend with new characters because they are not skilled at all.Don't die, don't make unnecessary sounds, don't waste ammunition, don't destroy all the cars.And enjoy the game.

												This is the best zombie apocalypse, survival-type base management game to be seen ever. This is the most enjoyable replay-able video game I have ever played in over 40 years of personal video gaming. The main mechanic of the game is 'group survivor management'. It's you the player, controlling and taking part in the life and story of initially two friends who find themselves in the midst of a 'plague driven' apocalypse. The story progresses and you inevitably meet up with other survivors. Though you can choose to not follow the storyline to it's culmination, days or weeks of playtime later, it's well worth immersing oneself into the apocalypse and the story that unfolds.You cannot lose in this game, on many levels it's about learning and having mostly mature fun. In this game you will learn to adapt and overcome in challenging gameplay. You will see some horror that may make you jump or avert your eyes and you will possibly unearth some pop culture references which should make you smile. There's plenty of humor though when interacting with survivors.If a survivor dies, which is generally the fault of the player making a bad strategic or tactical or 'controller skill-based' decision, you still do not lose. This game is enriching on so many levels, but primarily it will pose a question to you when you first experience a significant 'loss to the community'. State of Decay is simply a  brilliant concept that many fans have desired to experience in a game, and thankfully we have a game company that listens to it's fans and gives them what they asked for and more of what they didn't, but are better off for experiencing.The DLC's are some of the coolest game additions I have seen from any game developer, almost like complete separate games with more of what you didnt know you wanted. You really get your money's worth and replay-ability from Undead Labs.			"

												While it lacks online multiplayer capabilities, State of Decay is fairly good, and, for a port from consoles, runs fairly well on PC, with few slow-downs, and PC-specific controls and keybindings, and even modding support. For a first-time PC release for this company, it's a fairly good sign.Plays like a third person shooter/action adventure game, against zombies, stressing stealth and survival(or getting in a car and just ramming them until they're all gone). You can control multiple characters, and once they're dead, they're dead. The game feels very dynamic, zombie hordes change, move, attack your bases while you're away or even there, survivors get in trouble, need help, and act on their own. Unlike Day Z, people cooperate, much like Left 4 Dead, which makes it a shame it's not online co-op capable. That said, it's a good singleplayer experience, and highly recommended now that it's down to $19.99, support this!			"

												I usually enjoy very immersive, sandbox-survival games for their realistic attributes. State of Decay is NOT meant to feel immersive and actually plays more like a strategy game in the way it looks and operates. Often you're less concerned with the character you're controlling and rather the community as a whole. You have to worry about sustaining the base's daily needs and seeing what you build to better accommodate and fortify your community. Additionally, there is only a third person. Overall, don't expect to feel any immersion similar to DayZ, 7 Days to Die, etc. My biggest peeve by far though is the HUD. It's in the way, it's huge, and potentially blocks the view of approaching zombies. The icon's for certain locations show up everywhere when scouting and walking around.The game claims it's open world and you can do whatever you want but often the people within your base either talk to you about current missions or don't talk at all. You're often steered very strongly into the missions rather than doing your own wandering. The game does have a linear plot for the most part but it doesn't feel like I have any real freedom. I think if I went back and treated it like a strategy / city building simulation I would appreciate it more.			"

												Wow, did I ever have it wrong. Initially when I saw State of Decay, I gave it a pass. Recently, steam put it up on sale and I picked it up just because I was bored, and OH WOW do I ever wish I'd picked it up sooner. This game is wonderful, in a way I've seen very few games be wonderful in the past.Initially I was unimpressed, as the number of zombie games out there is getting pretty saturating, and when I first started I was getting precisely what I expected. Very basic fare in a game that wasn't doing anything well... And then I finished the tutorial and made it to the church....This game is a HUGE world where you have to fight zombies, gather supplies, go stealth, get along with neighbors, investigate things, actually use survival skills and even build up a home base. There have been few GOOD zombie games out there, and this is one of the EXCELLENT ones. Once the tutorial was done, as I mentioned above, s**t got real, as they say, and I found myself pouring through corpse infested houses for food, building materials and medical supplies. I'll admit, the graphics aren't perfect, but there are very few graphical ERRORS in the game, and once you get used to them, they're rather immersive. There's a couple of minor issues with the game, like bridge jumps, but don't think about it in terms of success and failure. This is a role playing game in that you can fail at something, but not have a true failure state. ""OH, you messed up that run? No worries, man. We're not going to tell you that you've failed and make sure that you do it over again until you get it the way we want it... Though... There is a herd coming. You -might- want to book it, bro."" I haven't felt this immersed in the ROLE of a game in a LONG time.A fantastic atmosphere, fear inducing, there's a learning curve, and once you get used it, you're solid.I hear there's already a sequel in the works, and as far as that goes, well.. Shut up and take my money. My only real gripe at this point is that there's no Co-op of any kind. I would TOTALLY play with friends, and chase them with a stick until they got this game if there was Co-op. Something to consider, if you weren't already.Hats off, Undead Labs, you've made an addict out of me, and I'm not quite ten hours in.			"

AudioThe audio content in State of Decay is somewhat lacking. Combat and general music is generally the same, looping over and over at times with brief pauses of silence which from a survival perspective the sometimes quiet and eerie really goes hand-in-hand with the world around you, its mood and feel.Verdict: 6/10.ContentWhen I first got into the world of State of Decay I thought, wow, this is going to be a MASSIVE romp around the map. Sadly, I was let down, just a tad bit. What would seem like a massive open-world map is really just an illusion, the world itself is quite small and the content offered equally so. Half if not three quarters of the map is simply open ground with no content whatsoever, which really makes the entire worldspace feel quiet empty, and owing to the fact that zombies spawn in tiny groups here and there (minus the hordes) adds on to the “lifeless” feel, not in a good way though.Verdict: 8/10.ControlsThe first thing I have to bring up is that this was a direct port from the Xbox, that being said without a controller you may feel the controls are a bit clunky compared to actual PC games. Though things have gotten substantially better through all the patches from the developers I still can’t help but feel that movement isn’t quite fluid yet, jumping around and onto objects feel awkward, camera movement and aiming also feels a bit off, but nothing truly gamebreaking. But hook up an Xbox controller and these problems cease to appear. If you do have one, I would thoroughly recommend making use of it as it just plays much better than on a keyboard and mouse.The controls DO work however; they are responsive and do what you need them to do. From opening doors to getting into vehicles to busting a zombies jaw wide open they get the job done and that is all that matters here.Verdict: 8/10.EnvironmentTrumbull Valley is the region that the player is thrust into, a region typical of a western settlement in the USA. Canyons here and there, rivers flowing through, industrial areas and residential ones, all dotted across the map. It’s got a great feel for the type of game it is and just makes it that much more believable.You can really tell that a lot of time went into creating all the areas that the player can explore since it feels natural. Groups of houses together in an urban environment, you have the local store down the road, the bar which opposite it is the post office and of course you have the garage down the road. It just feels well thought out and not just randomly placed.Verdict: 9/10.FunGive a person an assortment of weapons to take on a never-ending amount of zombies and a great time will be had given all the variety in weaponry but too much of a good thing doesn’t last, though luckily there’s always something to be done in State of Decay and our beloved Lily makes sure of that!The biggest downfall of State of Decay is its grind factor. In the beginning “materials” is your highest priority resource which is used for constructing and upgrading your various buildings. To acquire materials one needs to scout out possible locations and search them. Usually a simple task can be the downfall of your survivor if you’re not prepared (especially in the beginning of the game) to take on zombies who lurk most of these places. Once you’ve cleared up the location (and hope more zombies aren’t attracted to the noise you’ve made) the task of searching the place for “containers” by holding “E” can begin! In the beginning this was quite exhilarating but when you need several hundred materials for your various tasks amidst all the other things that crop up (like saving other survivors) it becomes a boring choir which I would have at least thought one could construct a building that would provide income for ALL resources and not just food which funnily enough is the most abundant resource out there. There’s a ton of environment objects, furniture, fridges, cars etc yet one cannot break them down into materials?!Verdict: 4/10.GameplayGameplay revolves around scavenging enough supplies to survive the random zombie outbreaks that will directly affect your survivor community.

												Simply terrible in every way.  Technically incompetent (you have never seen Cryengine look or run this bad), poorly designed jank fest.  I can put up with all kinds of jank in a game - Stalker fan for life!  But this is something else.  I so wanted this to be good, and it had an excellent rep from people who played it on the 360 when it came out, but it's just not the zombie game you've been waiting for.Other than the basic technical issues - which other than the frame rate include things like pop-in so serious that entire buildings pop in on top of you while you're walking around - there's a one-two punch to the setup and gameplay that really kills this game's hopes.  Firstly, they impose all sorts of weird ""hardcore"" gameplay systems.  That person you spent half an hour rescuing last time you played? Oh, uh, they died while you weren't playing the game - this is not a joke, difficulty is imposed by a system that makes ""poochie died on his way to his home planet"" look BAFTA-worthy.  Secondly, the dark and serious narrative vibe is undermined by just about every other design element.  None of it is ever acknowledged in the game, either.  Enemies teleport around and ignore level geometry - just about nothing you do fortification wise makes the slightest actual difference, which, given that this fortification is what you spend a huge amount of time in the game doing, is ever so slightly silly.  Cars are the zombies worst nightmare, ""balanced"" by various bugs to do with the game's collision meshes and driving physics.  Hand to hand combat looks like the world's worst dance party, and friendly AIs will happily ignore pitched battles going on in front of their face.  There has never been a game that took itself so seriously that looked so totally ridiculous in action. "

When this happens, you gotta wait for the rescue mission to save them. If you leave the game before complete the mission, that person will die.I don't like games that punish you for not playing.

												How to turn a good game rotten... it doesn't like a difficult task doesn't it?Well despite the many many bugs and issues with state of decay a loyal community of modders made it a game worth playing. We continued to get some bug fixes from the developers so were happy to support the studio with continued dlc, working on mods and generally saying nice things about the game.Fast forward a year and to tie in with the 'next gen' consoles they make a re-release of the game with some very supperficial changes and invite those who already bought the original (and dlc) the 'oppotunity' to re-buy the same game. Sounds like a no-brainer right... stick with the original? well they figured you would do that so continued maintance and patching of the 'new version' and completely abandoned any support at all for the original.They also seem to have the cheek to put the dlc for the original on sale to try and milk extra cash out of those who held off buying the dlc earlier.Undead labs destroyed the credibility they had built up with the community and frankly made even the most ardent supports question whether they would be foolish to ever buy another product make by undead.

												Simply the best game of its kind out right now, and a lot of fun for the hours you'll spend in it. The main storyline is quite short, but you can hold off doing much of the quests until you're ready. Diverse cast of characters to recruit and control, and a handful of places you can convert into large enclaves to survive and thrive in, makes it an entertaining games and highly promising for future development of games by the studio.

												This game runs absolutely fine:  i7 3770, GTX 980  -- and on i7 2600 with Radeon 7970  on Windows 7 Ultimate x64. This is the origional version of the game. It seems very likely that some people have issues with this older version of the game on newer operating systems - probably windows 10.  The older version isn't being patched anymore, and fixes are going to the newer year one edition.  It's pretty bug free though.   There are always a limited number of people who will have problem wih running a game, regardless.  If you are a new buyer, you just have to buy the newer version. It has improved graphics anyway. The game is quite good, and one of the best replayable single player zombie games out there. "

												Takes a good couple hours to get into the gameplay, but so far is a nice free roam-ish zombie slayer game. It handles like dead rising majorly, but there is a nice distinction being that it feels alot less cartoon-y. After about an hour or so of gameplay, my main character was getting low on health while in a church trying to rescue someone, then got pinned on the ground by two zombies, and they both ripped apart his torso. I was waiting for a respawn, but little did I know, I killed the character disallowing him to continue with zombie infected society. The game switched me to an alternate character that I saved just a while earlier, and I continued back out on my journey. Everyone in the safehouse was mourning for my, now dead character, but at least I know he's not coming back as a zombie! Maybe a half-zombie.			"

												Great, lots of fun to be had here. I enjoyed the base game very much with many hours spent searching for materials and food and have replayed Breakdown a couple of times which is a good DLC. The story is interesting, the worldspace is nice to explore and the mechanics are well balanced. Getting into a zombie fight is tense and un-nerving but tending to the needs of your home base makes these scenarios almost unavoidable at some point in your struggle to survive. But with distractions available, traps and good old cars to mow Z's down, whether you take a stealthy approach or go in hard, it all comes together to make for a great game.I'm not a huge fan of action zombie survival games but took a chance on this one and it has proven to be one of my favorite games in recent years. Not least because it ran on my godawful PC. But it's also just a solid game, some action, some simulation, some stealth, some driving...and zombies...nice mix :)+ Engaging story, interesting State (of decay)+ Mix of stealth, action, home base building & survival blend well together+ Sandbox works pretty nicely- Can get repetitive after a while- Home base modifications somewhat limited (would've been nice to be able to build more than 1 type of guard tower)8/10			"

												State of Decay is a great open world survivor zombie game.  With RPG and straegy elements it makes the game more interesting.  Watch zombies get smash in anyway you can think of.  The world is open to savage materials or rescues other survivals to take back to base.  Can upgrade bases by adding facility if enough resources are in stock.  Use strategic spots to make choke points with outpost to reduce the zombies hordes.  Drivable vehicles to move to point A to point B or use it to run over zombies.  (Though the cars will get damage to the point that it can explode).  Story is funny, touching, and exciting.  On the con side.  No multiplayer, quest logs need organization, and the story is short.  Once the resources are depleted on the map, the game is pretty much over.  If you're bored and want to play a quick zombie game for the week, try out State of Decay.  You won't regret it.			"

I personally have been on the fence about buying this game for a very long time, the reason being it had  confusing trailer that did not say very much at all about the game and the reviews for both good and bad seemed pretty convincing.Sow for what you actually do: this game is unlike other zombie survival games or even zombie games in general, you play in a third person perspective and you can switch between multiple characters. In this game there is a lot to think about; there are missions which you must complete (if you leave them too long then you will fail them), which can gain you trust and reputation from by completing, or loose it by leaving important tasks to decay, reputation and trust can also be effected by random events and doing stupid things like trying to run over your friends with cars, once you have enough repututation you can play as other characters or request them to join you for missions. Now for more gameplay related elements, the combat system isn't entirely great but still fun, you generally bash up zombies with melee weapons (which will eventually break) or use guns (which require ammo) combat is a big part of this game, and luckily it isn't a one bit/scratch kill, for you, in combat, zombies are pretty much just like normal people trying to kill you (execpt with zombie-like methods like biting and scratching), you have a health bar that will decrease and can be restored by taking meds such as painkillers, or by switching to another character and letting the wounded character rest. You also have a stamina bar which will deplete by sprinting, jumping and attacking, your combat bar will automatically replenish when you are not doing any of these things but grows smaller the longer it has been since you rested. Another big element of this game is vehicles, or just cars, they are a very effective method or taking out zombies and distracting them but will be damaged by ramming into things (zombies included), to my knowledge cars don't run out of fuel but they won't last long enough to find out with all the wear they go through.Now then, the zonbies, there are several types of zombies in this game, starting with basic zombies, some can be outran while others cannot because as you run so will they, there are also juggernauts, who are basically fat zombies that are difficult to kill and can throw you around which can be very damaging, espcially with other zombies around (how my first character to die was ended actually, poor Marcus :( RIP) there are also ferals, which are probably the biggest single threat, they will run up to you on their hands (which are exztremly muscular) and pummel you while you are down, you must struggle to get back up and then shoot them before they can get you down again. There are also screamers, armless zombies that amit a high pitched squeeling noise, your character will stagger when they hear it and is vulnerable to attacks during this time. Screamers are no threat by themeselves though.One last thing you should know about this gme is that you cannot load saves, when a charater dies the stay dead, when you stuff up by blowing up an awesome sports car, it stay's blown up. This make the game, in my opinion, far more enjoyable as the stakes are always much higherFor my verdict I will give it 9.5/10It has brilliant voice acting, missions, combat and or course soulfullness, the scavenging, high stakes at all times, reputation and general feel of the game are an extreme delight and though I never buy games at full price paying $20 you would definitly get your moneys worth.Feel free to comment and critic on my review.

												This game is how a zombie game should be. It doesn't need cheap scares to be good. A great zombie game should impress upon you the utter hopelessness of trying to survive. Showing how ragtag survivors can band together to havea fighting chance, while keeping in a dynamic open world that changes as you play. It's great...it's fun...but it's not perfectto be perfect...it would need co-op features. :D			"

												For the gamers who are into RPGs, resource management, and base building of sorts, this game might be up your alley.Whiel the visuals aren't SUPERMEGAFANTASTIC, they are good enough that they immerse you into the world fairly well, and as far as controlling characters are concerned, you don't control one specific character, it is best to switch to different characters to level up, and with the fatigue mechanic in this game, you kinda have to if you don't want to constantly run out of breath while swinging that crowbar.As for base building, there are multiple site locations that provide different bonuses and drawbacks depending on which site you pick.  Some may have all the space to build every single facility, but be so far out of town that travel time doesn't really make things worth it.   To be honest though I've only found really one or two sites that really are worth the rtesources to relocate your survivors, the rest seem like a poor man's choice, but with enough resource management it's not impossible to afford.The game that I have played seems to illustrate the scarcity of resources, which is great for being a primary driver of pushing you out of your starting town and into exploring different areas of the map.  Once your town's buildings are searched, the resources don't regenerate, so you'll have to make do with what you have and move on to the next town.  As a plot engine for the sparse storyline and as a gameplay mechanic, it works fairly well.Now, if you're sick and tired of the zombie genres, there's only one thing I want to say to pique your interest in this game, and that is this; VEHICULAR MELEE COMBAT.  Being able to use your driver-side door as a melee weapon while driving in this game, is sheer genius, and very reminiscent of ZombieLand.  There's just something viscerally satisfying about opening your vehicle door at full speed and clocking a horde of zombies with your door.			"

												This is frustratingly close to being an epically great game. The zombies are great. The resources management, driving, combat, and storyline are fine. Unfortunately it relies on a broken ""it keeps playing even when you quit!"" mechanism to build tension, and an unusably awful character/base management system to build a sense of competing priorities.Yes, you can download mods to ""fix"" some of these issues, but the game is never more than briefly entertaining with acres of frustration in between. Such a shame!			"

												I can't recommend this game as it stands now. It has a great amount of potential but executes it mechanics horribly. The in game tutorial focuses on combat and does not tell you how to build up your camp. I only found out how to build stations by pure accident because I dropped my controller and it hit the d-pad. In addition events occur while your are NOT playing the game. This normally wouldn't be a problem and might have been an interesting mechanic if it weren't for the fact that the events are randomized and will occur despite how much time has passed. for example the game crashed on me and I went to restart it only to find out that my survivor population had dropped by three and half my morale was gone. What's worse is that the infestations I had previously cleared out had respawned around my camp.In the course of two minutes about an hours worth of work up and vanished. This offline event mechanic needs serious rebalancing as it discourages me from even trying to build up a camp or make progress.  Wait for the finished product.			"

												Great, lots of fun to be had here. I enjoyed the base game very much with many hours spent searching for materials and food and have replayed Breakdown a couple of times which is a good DLC. The story is interesting, the worldspace is nice to explore and the mechanics are well balanced. Getting into a zombie fight is tense and un-nerving but tending to the needs of your home base makes these scenarios almost unavoidable at some point in your struggle to survive. But with distractions available, traps and good old cars to mow Z's down, whether you take a stealthy approach or go in hard, it all comes together to make for a great game.I'm not a huge fan of action zombie survival games but took a chance on this one and it has proven to be one of my favorite games in recent years. Not least because it ran on my godawful PC. But it's also just a solid game, some action, some simulation, some stealth, some driving...and zombies...nice mix :)+ Engaging story, interesting State (of decay)+ Mix of stealth, action, home base building & survival blend well together+ Sandbox works pretty nicely- Can get repetitive after a while- Home base modifications somewhat limited (would've been nice to be able to build more than 1 type of guard tower)8/10			"

												Mediocre at best, State of Decay is beset by a number of problems. Combat is pretty bare bones, with one button for attacking, one for dodging, and one for finishers or shoves. The map is rather unevenly spaced out, with a lot of nothing in between points of interest. Sometimes the zombies bunch up into a horde. Sometimes you'll run into special zombies that mix up combat a bit. Feels like everything you would expect from an open world zombie game, played completely straight.But then the little annoying things start showing up. Like how when you search a container it loses its ""searchable"" indicator, making it hard to re-find it in case your inventory is full. Or how you can't swap items with objects in a container. Or that items can't be dropped, only destroyed. How about the fact that you can't cancel any mission or task that you are on, even if it's one that's hoisted on you just by being around a certain area? Then there's your fellow survivors, which basically act as a glorified distraction while you actually kill the zombies. Despite its simplicity, combat itself is clunky at times. I found myself smacking a zombie on the ground instead of attacking the threats in front of me. There's also design decisions like how it's only possible to have one watchtower in your base despite the possiblity that it might be large and warrant having more since all the sides can't be covered. The little things just keep piling up.But that's not even the worst of it. There's numerous glitches too. Like stopping a car next to the sidewalk will cause you to not be able to walk from the road onto the sidewalk unless you jump. Or movement keys suddenly becoming unresponsive. Or improvements to your base not actually functioning as they say, such as vehicle repair. Or how about times when your watchtower has no sentry, despite having the numbers and guns to have one? Combined with the shortcomings of the game in the previous paragraph, these things really drag the game down from being okay to being kind of a stinker.The first DLC, Breakdown, is basically the base game minus the (remarkably short) story. This pretty much means that you'll be doing the same tasks over and over again, as the missions feel designed to fill time between doing the story. There are multiple difficulty levels that you have to unlock by completing the same objective for each level. Even at level one, the game is more difficult than the base game, which is welcome as State of Decay is rather easy. One fo the major downsides of this DLC is that base-making feels repetitive, since there are so few possible base locations, which is limited by your community size. It was tolerable in the base game since the story was so short, but advancing in this mode means starting over from almost nothing, it gets boring fast. Incidentally, I don't believe there's anything stopping a player from just ignoring the story missions and treating the game like a sandbox.Finally, there's the Lifeline DLC, which takes place on a different map with a different story, involving the military finding and extracting certain people from the city. The map at first looks huge but most of it is completely inaccessible. The player is limited to a highway circling the city and small areas off of it. The missions can be frustrating given the ai's inclination towards stupidity, resulting in their deaths. I also encountered several terrible glitches, such as rescuable survivors and other objective indicators appearing in areas that are inaccessible. On one occassion a story-related survivor indicator simply vanished a few minutes after appearing, no explanation, and the game treated it as an objective failure much later. After one mandatory cutscene a character I was supposed to escort spawned underneath the road, with no way to come back up. Overall, this game and its dlc seems like it had some good ideas, but feels rushed, incomplete, and buggy.  I understand that this is the first game released by the developers, but perhaps a less ambitious project than an open world zombie survival game would have felt like less of a let-down. I would not go so far as to say it's a bad game, but even if the bugs were worked out, the best I could say for it is that it's average			"

												Game is very dull. There is zero interactions with AIs. Even though you are technically alone when playing a single player game, at least some games give AIs big personalities and interaction with. This game has none, it feels like you are the only survivor in the game, since the story line (if this game even has one) is pretty bland and very weak. You can't hang out with AIs or have an option to talk to them. The game looks horriable, this was made for the purpose of being sold on a console. The graphics are an eye sore, and the controls are wonky as hell.This game not only fails for PC standards, but it also fails as a game.....did i forget to mention some progress moves on while you don't play? Meaning if you have a stronghold/hideout, and don't play the game for a week, and than play it right now, your home would had run out of resources. Like ammo, food, and etc. So basicly this game is nothing but constantly stocking up on resources. This feels more like a repetivite game, than a hardcore survival game.Even when this game is on sale, do not buy it. It is awful.			"

Combat was not bad at all, I just felt over burdened with people needing help and supplies half way across the map, then by the time I get there they're dead or the mission is gone. Exploring and foraging for food was really cool and added a survival aspect, but gathering for the survivors was a bit of a annoyance to me. Left me doing too much for the Stronghold and not enough for myself. Felt like I couldn't enjoy the game and was forced to gather way too much. Some may enjoy this game but I didn't enjoy it alot.

												State of Decay Assassin's Creed came out in 2013 and  it still looks good for its age and badly optimized engine. I got the first game with full price and the rest on sale, it was definitely worth it. But if you are considering buying this game, buy YOSE edition, it will have better graphics and a few fixes.  I will be giving a review for State of decay itself and its DLCs.

So lets move on to where is the fun of this game in general.  It is 3D zombie survival simulator with elements of RPG. You get yourself and your team, who have random characteristics and skills. You get to do almost everything you can imagine you would actually do in the situation of being a human in zombie apocalypse.  Scavenging, saving people, exploring and so on. The fun comes with all of it combined together in a single game. Controls. This game was ported from xbox I believe, so the controls are a bit weird, but its totally cool. You just need to remember what to push when things happen. It gets weird thou when you have to use special skills or combos.

While playing this game you don't often notice the sound effects and the music, but I can tell that it plays its part in delivering the whole picture very well. Its nothing impressive, but what is important that it does not spoil the experience and only enchants it. Although I have not tried, but I can see myself actually playing some other music while running around the city. I bought the game in 2013 and sadly my PC couldnt run it on the good settings. Sadly as I find out now, the graphics difference is very small. So playing on min settings wont bother you that much. Graphics themselves are pretty good. They deliver what you need to experience very good. I would encourage more fog though just so that you cant see that clearly. Also there is only fine weather, meaning you wont get any rain. Even though the game has a day and night cycle so its not too bad. And the bads, lets see, there are plenty of bugs, I only got to see a few of them, but they are moldy annoying. There are no fixes, so you get what you get. There is also not enough interaction with other members of your group. Missions are very limited by the script. Glitchy as it is,  the game is still good and worth playing and paying for. The story is not the only thing you can do in this game even if you dont purchase the DLCs. But I do encourage you that you buy them nonetheless. The story itself is kinda crap. It pretty much just lets you know what is going on in the world.

The second DLC Breakdown is an infinite survival game (unless you die) with every level of it much harder. This is what I am mostly playing. Once you level up you start from the scratch ( but you get a team and resources) . Very fun and challenging, which I like a lot. The game will make you think if you want to do a loud move because in doing so you may actually get absolutely destroyed. And the last DLC Lifeline tells you a story of the Army in the city. It has special missions, new characters and other stuff, but I didnt find it as entertaining. Re-playability is very high in my opinion, because you can do so many things in a different ways that you just want to keep trying until you figure out the perfect combo for everything.So in overall, I think the developers made a externally good game even though it has a couple of DLCs and a remade version of it. I would recommend this game to pretty much anybody. If you spend 6 hours into the game then you have used the money in the right way.			"

												I've been playing this game since it first appeared on Steam and I still find myself returning to it on a regular basis. State of Decay is a game in a very over-saturated genre. We live in the age of the zombie and everywhere you look there are zombie films, TV shows and games. However, SoD is not just another survival horror game, in fact... it's not really survival horror at all. I would classify this game as an ""action, zombie-apocalypse simulation"" game. What do I mean by simulation? Well, in this game you are given the task of joining a group of survivors in the early days of a zombie outbreak and it is up to you to ensure their survival. To that end you have to establish a home-base, contact survivors to join your group and scavenge for food, medicine and other vital supplies. You can build facilities at your base such as a workshop to craft useful items, a medical lab to care for your sick and injured survivors and a library to research new survival techniques. But it's not all home-on-the-prairie, you will have to complete missions ranging from clearing out zombie infestations to trading goods with other survivors. Zombies abound in this game, the streets are filled with undead heads to bash in, but the zombies while numerous, are no push-overs. Get surrounded and you are in real danger and there are times when it's better to err on the side of caution and run away, or find a big bush to hide in. The recent DLC adds a lot of replayability to the game, meaning that after you've finished the main story, you can dive into a mode where the game progressively becomes harder and harder, as if it wasn't hard enough.There are some downsides to this game however. It would benefit enormously from a multiplayer component. Playing alongside a friend would create all kinds of fun gameplay moments and it is a mystery why Undead Labs didn't find a way to accomodate this. Especially in today's gaming environment where almost every game has at least some multiplayer aspect. Also, the one map, while large and detailed, will eventually feel stale if you play the game for longer than a couple of weeks. I have reached the point now where I can almost navigate the game-area blindfolded.So in summary, if you're looking for a fun, visceral, zombie-filled escape, then look no further. State of Decay stands out in an over-saturated genre and I can't wait for more from the developers. There's definitely room to improve, but what is there is very satisfying.			"

												At the present time ( december 2013 ) the game is way to buggy: quest broken, storyline broken, awkward car physics.Gameplay wise is nice, albeit sometimes annoying (eg the mission because one of the survivors is sad/uspet/frightened that keeps up).Visuals are nice but a bit heavy even on high end system, survivors are a bit on the low poly side.Fighting is not bad at all and the progression system is ok, even sometimes it feels not so much under your control. House system is ok and funny.Quest system is time based, which probably lead to all the bugs stated. A simple progression ( Complete a quest? New quest here it comes!!! ) would be simplier to code and more enjoyable.If undead labs will be able to fix all techincal stuff, the game will be ok. But now it's not worth playing 14 hours and getting stuck.			"

												on first sight you think the game is good but you dont get enough time to do your missions let alone to have some fun exploring and enjoying the fighting. i spent the whole time running round like a headless chicken trying to get a second home. but as i was trying to look for a home and save people before they die and stop people fighting and get supplies to build the second home the house got surounded by infestations and then 2 people died(1 was part of the story) then i didnt have enough people to move. soon as you go to the second town to do anything. the first town has an emergency so i spent half my time just going back and forth trying to get there before they died.would be good if all the missions werent so rushed and if you didnt get stuck in the first house if just 1 person dies.ill probably have a look in a few months to see if they have improved it otherwise im not gonna bother anymore i spent 12 hours doing exactly what they all said trying to be the good guy saving everyone and my save game is still messed up.i do not recomend this, i like a game that i can actualy have time to enjoy. having to do exactly what the game wants me to do when it wants me to do it or it gets too ruined thats just not fun.

												It's a good game, but it has a few issues. (free of spoilers)1) Storyline interference from regular gameplay.2) No local saves make choices TOO permanent.3) Story seems to go from slow to over.4) It definitely has upsides if you enjoy killing zombies like Raid kills roaches...1) One big problem with this game is that they keep sending you on missions to find/help/bail out people from your survivor group while you should be doing storyline missions. This causes a problem in certain parts because people can be killed if you don't bail them out, but your storyline could be affected as well. I get that this is what adds a bit of realism and difficulty to the game, but on my first time through, I didn't know this, and had to start over after about 8 hours of gameplay!!!2) Oh, and the reason I had to start over is due to cloud-based game saves. There is very little experimentation you can do with your characters and story unless you plan to play through at least a second time. If your main character dies, oh well. They stick you with one of the other survivors. If you want to try guns for awhile and think that a specialization might help, but find out you hate it, oh well! It just makes the game a bit more frustrating, because you can get overrun in a heartbeat if you aren't 100% focused on every detail when you play. Oh, and don't stay away for too long or your group can all get sick and die!3) There is a chance it was the way I played through it. I just know that you have to meet up with a group of survivors. You have to nurture them, because you become their leader in a matter of, well you just are. When you first start, you only have a couple people, so at some point you might have to stop if everyone is tired or hurt. Later. if you're good at swapping back and forth when they do get hurt or tired and use them all to round characters out, you take them from being a rag-tag bunch of malcontents to a well oiled machine in nothing flat. Now the problem with this is that you start getting to the point of efficiency. This means you can run around and collects supplies WHILE doing story mission. So when you get to this point you start blowing through missions like they didn't even affect you. And next thing you know, you're doing 4 story missions in an hour and well... Done. Sure, that's where DLC comes in, but I told myself ""oh, lets do one more mission."" And the game said ""here's your final mission."" At least I was right.4) However, they have roaming zombie hoards wandering the streets. Hotwire the nearest car and run them down! Need to take out frustrations? Baseball bat to the zombieskull works wonders! Oh, and when you finally get far enough to get an assault rifle? DONE. Sure you can break weapons and cars, and run out of ammo for guns... But then you just go wander and raid for some more and start the zombiecide all over again!			"

Has longevity and it's fun to run over a zombie horde using the door of your car :D  Only downfall of  it is there are some issues with Geforce 600 series graphics cards but the upside to that is the Devs do respond to you after trying to find a solution.  I will gladly buy from Undead Labs in the future.			"

												cool zombie survival sandbox gameYou have to keep your inventories upright (food, drugs, ammunition, building materials and gasoline), plus you have countless buildings that they can plunder.You can ""expand"" your base (Watchtower build, set up trainings area, build cooking area, library to research various things...)Characters can advance skill levels and acquire skills (not many)Characters can die.With controller better playable, but the aim with firearms is with mouse much much better).I have a Soundbug soon as I hear something on the radio (it makes brrrrzrrrzrzzzzzr ... terribly X.x)There is only ONE QuestIn between, there are side missions (save allies, kill special infected, find survivors ...)There are also ""neighbors"" for which one can make a few questsGame time ~ 40h (I have ALL the buildings looted you can plunderand ?everyone? Side missions)------------------------------------------------------DLC Breakdown:The same game only in endless mode, try to survive as long as you can.The mission is a ""mobile home"" to repair and thus escape...Then you start at the same map again but with more zombies ... many zombies .. omg so many zombies .... again and again, until all are dead (:------------------------------------------------------DLC Lifeline:New Map wuhu ! but this DLC is very short ): ..The same principle, another story other venue ..Help to save valuable target persons for the army (and zivis).Defend your base when it is besieged by zombies and...maybe you can save the city (:-------------------------------------------------------Conclusion: even if the DLCs are nothing exciting, they are still recommended (if they are cheaper (; )O and .. that game NEEDS a COOP than it is perfect (a coop no muliplayer shiti♥♥♥♥ like dayZ)			"

												Best zombie game so far! I have played a lot of zombie games, most hack and slash BUT, they aren't open world like this. This game has more of the long term aspects instead of ""Oh lets just shoot 'em up!"" In this game you must survive by getting food, gas, weapons, and medicine. One of the coolest things about this game is that if a character dies, they are gone. No loading saves, no restarts, no bring them back. This makes the gameplay very risky, you always have to make sure your health is up and so is your energy. The game gets boring after the story. So if you do buy it, make sure to buy breakdown too!

												Ok this is a tough one, There is so much positive about this game (concept, gameplay, conbat system, in-game stories  yes stories) but frankly speaking its a buggy mess. There are bugs everywhere, after 12 hours of gameplay now the game engine has gone wild. Just an example , if i try to use a weapon my charactor starts punching zombies until i reload the game couple of times. That is not all, there are tons of other bugs.My gameplay upto 10 hours was fun and i was sure i could easily spend hours and hours on this but then it just started throwing tons of bugs at me. I am hoping they will fix all these bugs in upcoming ""state of decay remastered"" which is releasing 28 of April this year. Although this game is extremely fun (even just being a single player game) and it got heaps of stuff going on at the same time (Which is probobly one of the reason of its being buggy)""NOTE: I am recommending this to those who dont mind buggy gameplay if the game is fun"""" If you are not that person then dont play it.If you ask if i will keep playing this game, the answer is YES, untill State of Decay remastered comes out. This is a lovely game, you should give it a try but there will be bugs all over the place.			"

												If you like zombie survival games then you will like this. There are some areas where this game is an obvious console to pc port but if you can look past those issues then there is fun to be had. I'm not sure it's quite worth the full price but when on sale it's definately worth it. You can blast through the main story line fairly quickly but if you do side quests and try and build up your characters then you're looking at probably 20hrs of gameplay.			"

												I got State of Decay with both DLC packs when it was on sale over a month ago and I must say, it is a great game considering it was made by a smaller game studio. I loved several things about this game, but also hated some parts of it. Review below!THINGS I LOVE:1. The Open World. There is a linear storyline but you aren't forced into playing it. Almost every building you encounter is explorable and has cabinets and such that have to be searched in order to obtain supplies.2. Bases. Your home base is where you'll return supplies you've scavenged. You can build your base to include commodities such as more sleeping space, a garden for more food upkeep, a library, a workshop, etc. Certain combinations of things you build in your base will be beneficial to you ingame. For example, you can upgrade your garden to a greenhouse and if you have a survivor who is good at farming, you will have more rations of food per day. This concept is probably one of my most favorite of the game because you can clearly see how much thought was put into it. You can also move home bases, which you will end up doing as you progress through the story. 3. Weapons. There are a variety of melee weapons and guns in the game that can be obtained and used by your survivors. You'll see early on that melee weapons are the best way to go because guns make noise even if there is a silencer on them, and noise will attract zombies. Weapons, if overused, will break, which I think was a pretty cool mechanic that the Devs put in to encourage players to play other survivors. Also, to add to that, if you play a survivor for too long, he/she will get tired and will receive penalties to their max stamina. Again, a way to encourage players to play other survivors. 4. Outposts. Outposts are essentially a small safe zone where you can resupply if needed. They save A LOT of time and are a life saver if you're in need of supplies such as meds to keep your health and stamina alive and well. They also are equipped with traps that destroy passing hordes of zombies. If you use your outposts wisely, you can create a shield of protection from zombie hordes that will make your life much easier. 5. Zombies. In my honest opinion, the game is at perfect difficulty for me, although that will differ depending on how you like to play your games. Normal zombies are easy to defeat with melee weapons or guns. However, it is easy to get overwhelmed by them if you are by yourself. There are other types of zombies, called ""freaks"", similar to special zombies in the L4D series. They are much harder to defeat and require a certain degree of strategy in order to defeat them. I learned early on not to mess with juggernaut zombies in melee combat... Besides types of zombies, a cool mechanic that I enjoyed in the game was the fact that zombies get attracted to noise. This means that it's difficult to really go anywhere in a car without having to fight zombies. Whenever you break through a door, a window, fire a gun, etc. zombies will show up. THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:1. Glitches. Although this game was a lot of fun, it is quite glitchy at times. Don't expect it to be a highly polished game if that's what you're in to.2. AI. I really hope AI gets improved with this game eventually. It is terrible. Both zombies and survivors. Just horrendous.3. Repetitive buildings. Despite almost every building being explorable, it does get repetitive after a while. Searchable cabinets, cupboards, desks, etc. become predictable. The items you recover also become predictable. Kinda wish they would switch things up a bit somehow. 4. Car handling. This is more of a personal preference. The car handling in this game is really arcade-like, which I don't really like. But like I said, it's preference. When I first started playing, I could barely handle a car without veering off the road and hitting something.5. Repetitive events. After a while, random events that Lily brings up over the radio get boring because you know exactly how to complete them. Sure, the first time you play these random events will be loads of fun and a new experience, but again, they just get boring. And there you have it. My pros and cons list of State of Decay. Overall, I think it's a great game with LOADS of potential. Undead Labs has announced that they see a bright future for the game, so I'm not too worried about Devs not improving it. In conclusion, It's definitely a fun game with loads of features, but will unfortunately get repetitive at times.			"

												Very good premise. Well done game for an indie, even though the gameplay gets stale after quite some time. The ending for the original game and base customization could have been better. They even added storage at the backs of vehicles with the Lifeline DLC. Though I think the Lifeline DLC is heaps better than the original game, it was buggy as hell. I keep on getting stuck into walls while trying to save survivors or soldiers, the mission campaigns get stalled (with the original game as well, though already fixed it. But it was still pretty bad that I've to wait for months for them to fix the bug), etc. Would recommend to surival-zombie enthusiasts, though the bugs are really cringe-worthy and game-dropping. Could have it been more polished, I'd give it an 8.6; otherwise, a 5.			"

												As close as I've got to my ideal Zombie apocalypse sim. It can get somewhat repetitive, and the criticisms of the world being too small are somewhat warranted, but those things are easy to let slide once you've played it for a while.Rescuing survivors, preventing infighting in your group, maintaining your base, hunting for resources, character personality traits adding subtle nuances to NPC behaviour,there's a lot of really good stuff in here. And it even does a nice offline simulation thing, telling you what happened while you were away from the game!Thoroughly enjoyable and highly recommended.Some great voice acting from an unknown cast as well. It's so refreshing to play a game and NOT hear Steve Blum, Nolan North or any of the others that seem to have become standard features of every game released these days.			"

												8/10 Get it you dirty zombie lover you.Background: The game is a single player FPS/base simulation/light RPG. There are some novelty ideas here. Characters progress based on the play style. You don't have direct control over what skills to upgrade. Action portion is a pretty standard affair. Zombie smashing feels satisfying. NPC behave in a way that you would expect. They are actually very helpful. Base management system is robust with plenty options; yet, it's not overly complicated. Survivors interact in very basic ways. Supply runs take a lot of time and effort. Completing missions becomes secondary to building up your base. Missions are varied and interesting. The story is decent. It doesn't feel too restricting. Graphics: graphics are decent, but won't wow anyone. Sound: the atmosphere is creepy, and sounds play big role in that.			"

												Why did it take this long to make this game? If you break down its mechanics, it's Oregon Trail with zombies. You collect supplies, kill zombies, make choices, kill zombies, and build outposts. It's fun. The story is meh, the voice acting is meh, but the fun of going out on your own and killing a million zombies for the good of your digital group/family, is YEAH! It's made even more fun with a permadeath system. You can play as a bunch of different people with different boosts and nerfs, but you dye, you're dead. You can now longer play as Mel. You got her killed. You have to play as Dan now, who kinda sucks. It's ok though because you can build up his stats and make him a badass. Like this game.8/10			"

												State of Decay, mäng mis esijalgselt oli ainult Xboxil. PC-le, Steami tuli Early Access juba 3 kuud hiljem ehk 20 september 2013. Ametlik väljalaskekuupäev on 5 november 2013. Mängu arendatakse/parandatakse siiamaani. Zanriks on märgitud Open World Zombie Survival, endapoolt lisaksin veel Adventure ja Leadership. Leadership just sellepärast, et selles mängus oled sina suure hulga ellujäänute inimeste boss, saad palju valikud teha enda baasi arendamisel jne. Räägin miinustest... Esimene asi mis torkas on kohe autode juhitavus, autod nagu ujuks teepeal. Samas autode võimsused ja füüsika polnud ka kiita. Pärast mõnda zombist ülesõitu oli juba mootor tossu täis ja polnud enam nii kiire kui võiks. Lahe oli küll küljeuksega zombiet peksta. Kui veel sõitmisest rääkida, siis eramajade aed, mis oli puidust, oli kivikõva. Mitte ühegi autoga sealt läbi ei saanud. Tee äärtesse oli pandud mingid suvakad kivimürakad, mida polnud hästi näha. Kui sinna autoga sisse sõita, siis käis räige kolakas ning auto jälle katki. Hoolimata sellest jamast, harjusin autoga sõitma üsna kiiresti. Mängus pole ühtegi cutscene, väga imelik. Kõik missioonid olid nii, et sina pidid midagi mängus tegema, storyt anti väga vähe edasi. Ei näinud sa ühtegi videot, kus keegi teine teeks midagi kasulikku. Aga nüüd positiivsest. Graafika on minu arvates päris ilus. Ilusam kui Steami piltidel. Väga meeldis lootimine. Enda majja/baasi sai tuua 5 erinevat looti: toit, ravimeid/meditsiini, kuule, materjali ning kütust. Kodu uuendamine oli enda kätes, said valida, kas ehitad inimestele voodeid juurde, või ehitad eraldi sektsiooni haigetele inimestele või ehitad hoopis aiamaa, kus aedvilju kasvatada. Muidugi kulus kodu uuendamiseks palju materjali, mida pidi üle kaardi kokku kraapima. Kaart oli suht väike, ütleks, et paras - 3 linna. Tegin mängu läbi 16 tunniga, mis on natuke vähevõitu. Vahepeal viskasid sidemissioonid kopa ette, pidevalt pidi samu asju tegema. Liht ootasin, et keegi annaks mulle main missiooni ette, et storyga rohkem tutvuda. Mängus saad kõikide sinu majas elavate inimestega mängida ja missioone teha (väljaarvatud paar tähtsat tegelast). Point on aga selles, et kui sa kellegiga ära sured, siis ta ei spawni! Just, nii ongi, kui kellegiga ära sured, siis pead vahetama karakterit ja surnud inimeste loodi tagasi koju tooma. Esmalt ma süsteemist aru ei saanud, olnud mänginud 2h, otsustasin storyga uuesti alsutada ja tegin story nimona läbi, et minu kätes keegi surma ei saanud. Ise ostsin mängu 4 euroga, arvan, et seda see mäng ka väärt on. Ei soovita päris 20 euro eest osta. Siiski tegemist on parima open world single player zombie zanri mänguga mis hetkel väljas on! 6/10			"

												It is definitely a right step of open world zombie management game, micromanaging the room setting of your base, establishing outpost, and collecting resources according to your base need and consumption rate, they are all that I hope for as a post apocalyptic game. However, the game is not without flaws, starting with technical problems such as see through the ground to ""whiteness"", zombies sunk into the porch of houses when I defend them, the strange ked setting for different moves (although I cannot think of any solution either but to let it become keyboard version assassin creed), not to mention many problem raised in the forum. Hope that the developer will continue support and optimize the game to bring a better experience.Another thing is the lack of depth of the game mechanic, too few room choices and available spots for them (especially when you walk into empty rooms in the base when every slots were filled), having injured and tired status is good addition of the game but the lack of human resource management is kind of a downside for the game, like commanding who cook, who maintain weapons in the workshop, who be the doctor and who keep watch. This lower the incentive for player the keep or increase the number of the survivor in his/her base (the base requirement did help a bit but not much). The resources management is acceptable but can use much more work, cars that don't use gas, ammo box only count as trading parts and upgrade resources but not useable for individual character, building facilities were over simply (only gather ""building materials"" rather that collecting planks, wooden beams, tires, tents, 2x4, hammers, drills, saws and all type of furniture. Also, the existing human resource management is not so great, you can switch to any characters within your camp if you make friend with them (by helping them), although it is useful in times how the odd is to leave your character in the middle of no where or the town flooded with zombie and switch to another person expecting he/she will auto come back safely? The game allow small group to form up and gather resources but for some reason only one person can carry the base resources even I got a 2-4 man team. More control of the group is also needed, such as choosing a leader for the survivors or overthrowing one, sending groups out to doing scavenger run or setting activities for people in base.Well the game still has it's upside, the ability to switch to different characters are awesome and the possibility to let a survivor dying on your hand (with all the powers and traits lost) are the good points of this game. Also, the list of weapons melee and firearms are amazing (ammo type also). Although I mentioned a lot of points that the game can improved but State of Decay is a right step (probably the first right step) toward an open world zombie management game that not flooding you with ammo and supplies, or focusing on killing zombie or escaping them, but rather learning to survive with them, how to get through the post apocalyptic condition. For those who like managing base and supplies, fighting zombie and building a survivor group and base, this is the game for you- get it now (if you make it to this line and still not quitted already, GET IT NOW, this is the game for you)P.S the difficulty is too easy (at least for base defend), the lack of combination and ""re-invention"" (like electricity) and the story is so boring (no tension within survivor groups should put this one off a bit to 7-7.5/10.

												So I just recently finally got to playing State of Decay after I really got into the zombie survival style of games, and I really love that this game has me focusing more on getting my entire group the food and supplies it needs, rather than on me finding a new sniper or assault rifle.It falls really short however, in my opinion, on how a lot of the gameplay mechanics work.In the first 10 minutes or so of the game, it has you sneaking around and avoiding contact with the zombies, as your character attempts to figure out what is going on and why they are trying to kill you. This leads the player to the belief that the game is going to be pretty serious, and that contact with zombies spells almost certain death. That's not how the game ends up playing out, and this leads me to believe that they really wanted this game to be taken seriously, as there are a lot more aspects of the game that reflect that idea.Here are some of them Sneaking - As it stands, sneaking in the game is very half-baked, even though it's the first mechanic the game actively teaches you. Sneaking is painfully slow and almost never worth the advantage of using the mechanic. Had they made the sneaking mechanic more fleshed out, with a slow crouch and a fast crouch, and made it a more viable option to avoid zombies against just swinging away at them, it would have added a new level of play to the game. Weapon Degrading - It almost feels very out of place in this game, as it doesn't really seem to affect how you go at a group of zombies. There's always a new weapon waiting around a corner somewhere, in a dresser, pretty much anything you can loot will have a blunt object in it to swing at zombies heads, so weapons degrading feels pointless, but seems like it was meant to instill the idea of ""Okay, so there are 10 zeds over there, but my weapon is weak, so i need to find another way around them"" But it just doesn't. Character Debuffs - One of my favorite aspects of the game is the character debuffs. Basically, after you have been out with one character for awhile, that character begins to get tired faster, and has less maximum health, which is fixed by taking that character back to home base and swapping them with another playable character. It adds a cool level of the game where you have one character who is super high level, but you have to switch them out with another survivor because they are too tired to be as effective, so it pays to keep all your survivors trained and leveled up so you're never at a disadvantage.   Zombie Hordes - Seeing a zombie horde on the map for the first time is terrifying. You are concerned about the number and what getting spotted will do. Until you get a car and find out that running all of them over is safe, easy, and takes about 10 seconds to kill all of them. One easy fix would be making it so that an entire zombie horde hitting your car always disabled it, and made it unusable, but driving around them is still just as good an option as any. This is really just an issue with the cars in the game, but zombie hordes are a cool idea, that not many games take advantage of, that are just not scary in this game.These things and many other smaller factors lead me to believe that this game wanted to be more realistic, or at least more tense than it ended up being. I still enjoy this game, and it is very good in it's own right, but what it really has done is made me want a game like it, but one that takes itself more seriously. I have few real issues with this game, and most of them are really ""I would rather the did this"" than they are problems, as the game clearly isn't meant to be taken seriously, but I'll list them here real fast anyways.  Cars - Cars are not hard to find, there are like 20 in each town in the game, and they are all perfectly fit to drive. Lowering the number of cars, or making it so that you had to make a car work before you could drive it, and adding car maintenance to the game would have helped big time in making this game feel more serious than it is. Cars are the ultimate tool in this game, for running over hordes of zombies, carrying all your♥♥♥♥♥♥ and getting you everywhere (they're way to fast) i'd say half my time spent in this game has been spent in a car. Combat - Combat consists of hitting one button over and over until a zombie falls, then using a finisher. It's very rinse repeat style combat that get's stale extremely fast, and I'd say it's the only issue I have with the game that I think is just bad mechanically. There's no diversity, all zombies are taken down the same way, even the special infected, they could have done better to flesh this out a lot more, and made alternate approaches to combat more viable. It's too easy to kill zombies, so sneaking past them is never a concern.  Sneaking - It's in the game. It's slow. It's pointless. The advantage to sneaking in the game isn't worth it when the zombies aren't scary. It makes so much more sense just to mash a single button at them and take them down, than to take the extra 5 minutes or more to sneak past. Not only does the mechanic not make sense, it's also just not well done at all, there is one stance for sneaking, that being crouch, and it's so painfully slow that even if it was viable it would be way to boring to consider. Adding a dynamic cover system, along with sprint-sneaking and regular sneaking. And fleshing out the enemy detection system would make sneaking past hordes of zombies much more tense and viable.Third-Person  - Not so much a flaw, as it is an opinion that I disagree with, but I think third-person is the bane of all survival games existence. It's removes the idea of immersion almost entirely, and it takes any level of seriousness this game had away.  Not only can I see over any wall and instantly know whether or not it's safe, but I also don't feel like i'm stepping into the characters shoes so much as I am watching them do things. However this one is entirely just my opinion and certainly not a make or break deal for me.  Speed of Gameplay - This game plays way to fast. Battles against hordes last no longer than 30 seconds and getting from one city to another takes maybe a minute. Now I am not saying I want a game that takes half an hour to get from one place to the next, but 3 - 5 minutes travel time from one place to another with landmarks and such on the way and mini-loot spots would be much better for pacing and making the game feel less arcadey. These are all my main issues, and as you can tell by reading them, I don't think hardly any of them are ""bad"" by any means, and I don't think the game is bad, but it would serve future development of Zombies survival games great benefit to make a game similar to this, but tweaking those game mechanics in such a way as to create a realistic, tense, and scary zombie survival game that actually gives you something to care about like State of Decay does so well (that being the community you end up building and the characters.)

												Zombie apocalypse survival game that's trying to mesh a lot of genres. Looting goods for your base, building/upgrading your base, listening to your survivors whine about their emotional issues, and killing a lot of zombies about sums up the basic gameplay. Your characters permantly die, your badass fully lvled character will still get his♥♥♥♥♥kicked, and everyone in the world needs your help.My main complaint is the rough finished product; zombies clipping through walls is common, the same ground textures disappear if you look at them wrong, community missions happen way too frequently, and game crashes are to be expected. Nothing game breaking though, so if you can get around all of that you'll have fun.If the developers had spent more time polishing the game, I would easily recommend it's pricetag. But for now, I would wait until it's on sale.			"

												Excellent sandbox game!The graphics are generally good, however without a great PC it is hard sometimes to obtain an adequate framerate. The environment is well designed, and the sensation of... decay and fear that a zombie apocalypse should cause is always present. Gosh, how I hate to be surprised by a sneaking zombie while scavenging.The story is ok, the voice acting could be better, but it's ok. It would be great to have a wider variety of phrases instead of... you know... stuff.So, what is it to like? The freedom to explore and decide where you want to put your survivors, the missions are mostly interesting and the hard ones can sometimes catch you by surprise. The perma-death adds a sense of sadness in this post-apocalyptic scenario and it is really devastating when you grow attached to your characters. The day-night cycle is interesting, it's a shame that there are not ways to spend the night besides keep going outside.My only complaint is the existence of freak zeds. It seems unnecessary, it is like the game is trying to emulate left4dead with this variety... the real threat should be the sheer numbers of brainless undead, not special zed with insta-kill-like powers. This universe could be a lot better if it were more like The Walking Dead.Nevertheless, it is a must for any lover of the zombie genre. Entertaining, challenging and interesting, what else could you ask for in a sandbox game?			"

												Pros:- Great variety of guns/melee weapons/explosives/medical items to find and manufacture.- Not a large map but reasonably sized for the duration from start to endgame- Permanant death due to lack of manual saves makes for more careful usage of your characters. This might be a negative depending upon how this is personally viewed upon but this can be easily bypassed by making a manual backup of the savegame.- Additional upgradable facilities can be built for your base ala X-Com depending on your needs with other members boosting the efficiency if a related skill is present. For example, a survivor with medical skills will boost the healing chance of the medic bay.-Resource management and scavenging makes the world seem more realistic as resources are finite in a world of zombies and you will have to be careful in how you use them.- RPG and skill elements makes for an interesting choice in decisions to include or exclude other survivors from your enclave. There is also interplay in relationships between the members of your enclave. Do you keep the survivor with chef and blunt weapon skills but with really abusive attitude which lowers the morale of the whole camp or decide to select him to go on a ""suicide"" mission? The choice is yours.-The atmosphere and art direction of this game is excellent and evokes a real sense of isolation and terror of an small american rural town over run by undead.Cons:- Graphics are servicable but ""level loading"" prone to lag especially when a new area comes into range. Shadows are not really well done and the lighting at night is really too dark so you'll have to adjust the gamma manually to suit your tastes.- The randomly generated daily missions do get stale after the 30th time you are called out to rescue a missing party member or lift a siege of zombies on a house of NPCs. There needs to be more variety in the random missions. - There isn't much interaction with other survivors other than to constantly assist them with various tasks like finding someone missing or helping them with a zombie attack until they trust you enough to want to join your enclave. They could be more dynamic, eg. patrolling the area around their home, helping you out when you are attacked in the area or even robbing you or attacking your base if they are hostile.- Outposts are over-powered in the sense that once you get a group of them surrounding your home base and activate the flame mines, no zombie horde could get thru which somehow diminishes the sense of fear and urgency in a world over run by zombies.Summary: 8/10Overall this is a great open world zombie game especially when considering the price. I have gotten more enjoyment from this game then some other full price AAA titles. Of course the game is not perfect but i'm hoping a sequel or a full on expansion DLC (not the DLC breakdown which only made the game run without a storyline and limits and with a few new weapons and characters) would improve upon those shortcomings.

												Yes... It's like a live action Walking Dead game but better because there is a deep immersion level. You can build up one character and have it die and not lose the game. So build a glorious army of zombie slayers.Super fun			"

												This game is actually pretty decent, it's different from other zombie genre games. However, this game is lacking one feature.  Multiplayer.  Although there are NPCs throughout the game that you need to help, it gets boring sometimes when you just want to roam around and scavenge for supplies without any friend helping you. I actually remembered there was a rumour that SoD was gonna get a multiplayer but it got cancelled. Would give this a 9/10 if it had multiplayer but I'd rather give it a 7/10 for being only a single player game.			"

												I've been playing this game since it first appeared on Steam and I still find myself returning to it on a regular basis. State of Decay is a game in a very over-saturated genre. We live in the age of the zombie and everywhere you look there are zombie films, TV shows and games. However, SoD is not just another survival horror game, in fact... it's not really survival horror at all. I would classify this game as an ""action, zombie-apocalypse simulation"" game. What do I mean by simulation? Well, in this game you are given the task of joining a group of survivors in the early days of a zombie outbreak and it is up to you to ensure their survival. To that end you have to establish a home-base, contact survivors to join your group and scavenge for food, medicine and other vital supplies. You can build facilities at your base such as a workshop to craft useful items, a medical lab to care for your sick and injured survivors and a library to research new survival techniques. But it's not all home-on-the-prairie, you will have to complete missions ranging from clearing out zombie infestations to trading goods with other survivors. Zombies abound in this game, the streets are filled with undead heads to bash in, but the zombies while numerous, are no push-overs. Get surrounded and you are in real danger and there are times when it's better to err on the side of caution and run away, or find a big bush to hide in. The recent DLC adds a lot of replayability to the game, meaning that after you've finished the main story, you can dive into a mode where the game progressively becomes harder and harder, as if it wasn't hard enough.There are some downsides to this game however. It would benefit enormously from a multiplayer component. Playing alongside a friend would create all kinds of fun gameplay moments and it is a mystery why Undead Labs didn't find a way to accomodate this. Especially in today's gaming environment where almost every game has at least some multiplayer aspect. Also, the one map, while large and detailed, will eventually feel stale if you play the game for longer than a couple of weeks. I have reached the point now where I can almost navigate the game-area blindfolded.So in summary, if you're looking for a fun, visceral, zombie-filled escape, then look no further. State of Decay stands out in an over-saturated genre and I can't wait for more from the developers. There's definitely room to improve, but what is there is very satisfying.			"

												You want a Zombie game?You want a resource managment game?You want to club things in the face with a chair leg while someone moans at you for not having enough beds at the end of the world? THEN LOOK NO FURTHER!!State of Decay, thats the game you need and thats the game I reckon you should throw your hard earned coins at!The main game is rather easy be warned and can be completed on a first run through in less than 20 hours...the DLC however....well...if you enjoy a fair but merciless game that rewards the thinkers and brave, but brings despair and failure to the fools and greedy ( im looking at you Pastor, for god sake stop attacking hordes just because you need some damn cheetos ) then this is the game for you!

Has longevity and it's fun to run over a zombie horde using the door of your car :D  Only downfall of  it is there are some issues with Geforce 600 series graphics cards but the upside to that is the Devs do respond to you after trying to find a solution.  I will gladly buy from Undead Labs in the future.			"

												An amazing zombie survival Action-RPG that gets most of the important or even crucial aspects of zombie survival absolutely right and delivers them in a captivating and satisfying way. Those being:-Building and managing your base (you can change between several different locations ,attract survivors,build stuff,create outposts...)-scavenging for supplies while avoiding to get overrun by too many zeds or tiring out your characters-keeping your ""crew"" in check (essentially the people who live in your base,different personalities which can often clash and require you to take actions...) -dealing with all sorts of  problems and randomly generated missions and infestations-Permadeath. (no,this doesn't mean you'll have to restart if one of your survivors dies,stop whining! :3) Wounds may take ages to heal and if your survivors get some,it's because you screwed up. This is essential for zombie survival games and has nothing to do with ""roguelike"". You can recover from mistakes and find more survivors,but if you screw up too often and charge into too difficult situations you will probably have to restart. This is good. Also,playthroughs won't be the same,because:-Random generation of all sorts of things: quests,survivors,personalities,locations of loot,loot tables,zombie hordes,infestations... -Visceral,brutal combat: It's satisfying to smack the brains out of zeds,and that's what you'll be doing. Finishing moves that are absolutely devastating, each blow has a weight to it that can knock zeds around and down and stagger them or blow their bodyparts to pieces (detachable bodyparts similar to Dead Island). you can ""combo"" up different swings,grapple,kick and shove zeds around and unlock moves like legsweeps. -RPG elements that don't feel too ""magical"". You'll improve cardio,weapon skills with different weapon types,leadership skills and so on as you play and unlock moves and ""traits"" that don't feel out of place. (you won't be getting fireballs and lmgs that don't use up ammo every 3rd shot or something stupid like that,but moves and traits that actually make sense)-Different breakable,non-respawning vehicles. If you waste too many cars you won't have any more cars. Driving over zeds also feels as satisfying as the melee combat,they can grapple on to your car and will try to get in and eat your brains out,so a car isn't a safezone or tank. There's so much more that I could talk about here,but what it boils down to is: this is an amazing zombie survival game for a ridiculously low price for the amount of content and quality you'll be getting. If you like zombie survival, get this game. It's good. really good.			"

												State of Decay is a very good, and exclusively cheap. The game has very unique features, but some downsides as well.One good thing I liked is the ability to manage your home site, you can upgrade buildings or build new ones, things like a garage, a workshop, a sleeping house and much more, and it actually shows up in your area. Of course, it takes time to build or upgrade buildings and it requires you to have a decent amount of materials, which is a great realistic aspect of the game.If you quit the game, time progresses even when you are not playing, this means your camp will consume the food you've collected while you were playing and you will need to restock, else people will die or get sick. You have 4 main resources in the game: Food, medicine, materials and ammo.Food - as I said, it's the most basic and common thing to have. It isn't hard at all to scavenge for food, it's almost everywhere and you should have it before you quit the game if you want your camp to stay at good state, shape, etc.Medicine - People can get sick, people will get sick. If you wound while using one character and another, and log off, it will surely consume some medicine to fix the injuries, you can even find medicine resource in pharmacies or vet-houses and bring them to your homesite.Materials - These are used to build or upgrade buildings in your homesite, for example, in some stage in the game you will have a bigger population on your camp so you will need more beds for everyone to sleep. Then, you will need to build a sleeping house which can be upgraded to a bunkhouse and will provide beds for everyone, increasing their stamina and they will regenerate energy faster. Ammo - Mostly used for the watch tower you will most likely have in your camp. The watcher will use his weapon to eliminate zombies off the perimeter and it will consume your ammo resources once in a while, if you want a safer perimeter, you want ammo.One downside is the repetitive survivor quests, sometimes people in your camp will get angry or afraid. Your mission is to take them on a walk and eliminate some zombies while having a chatter. It's repetitive all the time, same lines and etc. I think it needs some new features.Overall this is a great game, but you will need to spend a lot of time managing your resources especiall before you logoff, making sure your people can stay safe while you are not in game.  It's amazingly cheap (20$) and I would recommend anyone to try this game! Also check out the new upcoming DLC which brings new content to the game. "

												STATE OF DECAY - REVIEWFirst off, if you would rather watch a video on my review. 


YouTube™ Video: Welcome to... State of Decay PC - Review 

			Views: 5,699		

			A review of the new upcoming zombie sandbox game for PC, State of Decay. This is my first review of a game, I hope you enjoy.		

What is going on guys, my name is Marksman. I was privileged enough to get my hands on an early review copy of State of Decay for PC from the developers at Undead Labs. State of Decay, selling over 500 Thousands copies on XBLA and holding records for fastest selling game on XBLA hold up on the PC platform or will fall short to PC’s gamers around?• Gameplay:Gameplay is very solid for a $15 Arcade game, not so much if it was AAA title, but solid none the less. The game offers so much! From a large open sandbox world, to exploring old abandoned houses that have been destroyed from the apocalypse. State of Decay will keep making you want more! Though at the same time, the ability to clean out certain areas from all infected in the area, made me wishing for more.• Story:Brief Story: You begin the game as Marcus, a nobody camping with his buddy Ed. From the very beginning you are dropped right into the action. Your camp gets ambushed by a herd of crazy people, as Ed puts it. As your player progress he ends up meeting more survivors, bases, and ZOMBIES. Strength in numbers right?• Combat:Combat is super satisfying! Taking a 2x4 to a zombies brain never gets old! Possibly 2x4 aren’t your thing, why not try a Sword, Bat, or even a car door! State of decay also offer a wide range of firearms! from rifles to .44 pistols! Maybe you're not the run and gun zombie killer, maybe you want to sneak in and sneak out undetected! Have no fear State of Decay offers you just that! Though at times it can be a bit frustrating to be sneaking around, when for some reason the AI just snaps and chases after you, but we’ll get into that later. Overall the combat is epic and done right with some bumps here and there.• HUD/UI/Inv: Oh my god. If there is one thing about this game that drives me nuts is the over ported console UI/Inventory system on a PC. You can tell that State of Decay was a console game at some point. The Inventory system was built for a controller, making you feel like you are using a controller when really you are using a mouse and keyboard. Though don’t get me wrong, it works great, I just wish they could have put a little more effort into making more for the PC audience.• AI: Oh my the AI! Don’t even get me started the AI is so bad! I feel like my companions got me killed more times than the zombies did! I would just be sneaky into a house WHEN SUDDENLY Marcus decides that its his time to shine and bomb rushes the herd of zombies!Overall the zombie AI is great, aside from the them having some derpy moments.• Fun Factor:This game is so much fun! I can’t stress enough how much fun it is. Its so casual that you will be able to hop in for a half hour and have fun! But if you have more time, you can dedicate time to building up your stronghold, clearing out massive zombie infected areas, or going on a drive to explore!• Overall: This is a fantastic game for only $15 I would recommend this game to all of you! I will have to give this game a 8/10 due to the AI and porting issues that I came across.Thank you so much for reading.See you all next time,-Marksman			"

												This is a great game, probably one of the best survival zombie games i've ever played. There is always something to do, however it does get repetitive after a while and the main story line is rather short. You can complete it in 4-5 hours of game play if you want to. I've played it for 15 hours before deciding to finish this game. The only downside in this game is that the zombies don't exactly play a big role in the game. They aren't as big of a treath they should be. still a great game nontheless.			"

												I bought this game on the initial Early Access release and have to say this is everything I've been waiting for in a zombie survival game. You have to survive with a group who have internal issues and emotional states as well as managing sickness in the camp, as well as manage supplies by scavenging from abandoned homes, police stations etc The visuals are good for a downloadable title at this price point and there is so much replayability in here, especially with the new sandbox DLC ""Breakdown"" which is an endless game mode with increasingly zombie dense versions of the map every time you level up. The dev team have done a great job of updating the game and the problems it had (initially no keyboard controls, poor optimisation etc) and now I believe the mouse control has been patched too. Bindable keys are in as well as full controller support and resolution support. Great game though and easily the best zombie survival game out there. 9/10			"

												It's alright I guess.. It's a lot of Go from point A to B, make a sideway to C in order to get some items at D and then bring the lot to point E. That's a bit of a letdown, what I do like is that you don't have to grind XP, or kill zombies at all for that matter. Your weapons break down when killing zombies so it's the smarter thing to walk/drive around if you have that option.Edit - Played about 8 hour now, there is indeed no griding for XP, but it's grinding missions...After 8 hour I've played maybe 4 different missions, the rest is just getting re-used and repeated, waste of money unless you want to do the same thing for hours and hours and hours.

												A true flawed game.  Whilst there are technical hitches, personally these are mostly AI based, the concept and atmosphere of the game itself is solid.  Indeed, it could be said that the world itself, a large valley in small-town America, is the real star of the show:  The world feels authentic and lived-in, with Marie-Celeste-like scenes playing out in the myriad houses, shops and industrial sites that can be scavenged.  The levelling mechanics, whilst simple, help to make each character distinct, and the loss of a highly skilled marksman or doctor can seriously impact the group's survivability.  Character death is permanent:  There are no essential characters, even those with story-relevant content are fair-game, adding to the general tension when leaving your home base.  Whilst the home base mechanics are simple, there is enough variety to aim for a variety of builds with a range of different abilities (why a dining area costs the same amount of resources as a munitions lab, however, eludes me).Overall an extremely fun game, I recommend that you also pick up the Breakdown and Lifeline dlcs for sandbox mode and an alternate storyline from an ""Antagonistic"" perspective.

If you are looking for a good zombie survival/base management sim, this is as close to perfect as you can get. Could do with a larger map and coop but I am not complaining if neither is ever added in.EDIT 11/27/13- I remember reading a few months back that the upcoming sandbox mode would be a free addon to this game. Recently I learned of a paid DLC that adds this sandbox mode. I am very unhappy about this and will not be buying it at this time.			"

												As close as I've got to my ideal Zombie apocalypse sim. It can get somewhat repetitive, and the criticisms of the world being too small are somewhat warranted, but those things are easy to let slide once you've played it for a while.Rescuing survivors, preventing infighting in your group, maintaining your base, hunting for resources, character personality traits adding subtle nuances to NPC behaviour,there's a lot of really good stuff in here. And it even does a nice offline simulation thing, telling you what happened while you were away from the game!Thoroughly enjoyable and highly recommended.Some great voice acting from an unknown cast as well. It's so refreshing to play a game and NOT hear Steve Blum, Nolan North or any of the others that seem to have become standard features of every game released these days.			"

												State of Decay is the mutant offspring of The Walking Dead and Animal Crossing, in other words you need to make life or death choices that will affect the lives of a group of survivors, but you also need to do your chores and get along with your neighbors. While not all that smooth yet, the patches keep on coming and it becomes more of a PC game every day. Ultimately it can be a bit repetitive, but I find it comforting given just how wildly unpredictable certain aspects of the game are. Two playthroughs are very similar but also entirely different, since you never know who will become ill, or worse yet who will be torn in half by a large mutant zombie.			"

												Only 2 elements are missing with this game - coop and ability to execute other survivors BEFORE relationship with them will produce some enormous pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ The rest is great - open world (some sort of a small state of USA), at least 3 villages and one big-ish city. You have group of survivors which is your pool of survivors. You have to take good care of them, since most of them are your playable characters. Visuals are um... ok. A lot of bright bloom at day time. Night is extremely... night-y :( You're going to upgrade your safehouse, find better place for it, organize outposts, upgrade stuff, find supplies, find cars, fix cars, blow up cars, clear infestations, kill hordes, hoping that you're going to survive another night... so bottom line - highly recommend this game! But go with gamepad.			"

												20 minutes. Thats right. 20. 5 minutes first, to vomit at the default graphics (and total lack of options), 90 minutes out of game to research ways to edit the config with various tools and mods, and 15 more minutes to realize that even with those tools, this game is totally unable to run without looking like complete garbage. Forcing HDR/SSAO/BLOOM on people, especially when it it makes all indoor areas way too dark, and things like lights, super bright, is just a no go for me. Added to the fact that even at 1920 res, the game seems to be 720p, the end result is this is a horrible port from the xbox. PC gamers shouldnt stand to have games that give them 3 options for video settings. There is no excuse for it. Cant even say if the gameplay is that good because I cant stand looking at it (and its visually hard to look at too).This game looks like someone spilled a big can of beans and chili on 50,000 candle power tactical flashlight "

												One of the best games I've played this year. Although there's a definite console feel to it, partly owing to the third-person perspective, State of Decay has a lot more depth to it than you might expect. In fact, I pretty much wasted my first run at it, by missing out on the higher-level features. Killing zombies is not the goal here, it's just a constant obstacle to building your colony of survivors.The game has a pretty good tutorial intro for basic mechanics, but you will need to peruse an FAQ two if you hope to optimize your resource collection. For instance, when setting up an Outpost, you need to leave one bundle of supplies un-collected; that determines what resource the Outpost will generate. There's no indication of this in-game, and it's not something you're likely to figure out on your own.Another minor concern is that once you start to fall behind the curve - too little resources, too many of your higher-level characters turned to zombie-chow - the game turns into a real hard slog. The obvious alternative would be to have it just end if your 'heroes' die, but that's a pretty stale cliche. In State of Decay, you're free to battle your way back up from the dregs. The lack of a user-save system leaves you with no other choices - just keep trying, or start over. Which is fair enough. It's great to see a game that doesn't compromise.Combat is definitely simplified, console-style. It's not easy to be precise with melee weapons, and a bit too easy to get stuck behind a door or other obstacle. But the difficulty level is about right. You really need to think about your tactics, and avoid foolish risks.I'm on my second play through Dead Island, and would still pick that as the best zombie shooter so far. But State of Decay gets some important things right that DI misses - most notably the base-building meta-game. It's great to have a positive objective for once, instead of the all-too-common ""just survive"" (as in DayZ, for instance). I'd put State of Decay high on my Must Play list for 2013.			"

It is only after playing long that it gets repetitive (same missions everytime, rescue this person, that person has morale issues --> do sth about it, etc.)Still you can have many hours of fun with it and when your favorite character dies because of a mistake you made, tears will be shed. 10/10 would kill Jacob again			"

												This game is symply awesome, addicting, and cool. You must get this game if u love zombies, open world, and driving. This is a must get game for those who loves zombie games alot or surviival games.Score: 8/10 I love this game so far even if the game has some issues.Pros: Chracter controlling, fast automatic saving, very addicting, good driving (Much more better than Watch Dogs driving mechanics), Pretty big open world. I like the fighting and zombies in State of Decay, Cons: Not that good graphics 7/10, controlling the character movement while sprinting is hard, Missions are repetative, Need more variaty of cars and needs motorcycle, I hate how the game continues even if u are not in the game, sometimes there are annoying gliches like some zombies just go under the floor and cant get up and so its also impossible to shoot them through the floor.         Steam said my PC specs should fit in recomended list as I saw the system requirements. But it actually isn't at all.This is my Computer Specs that I have right now: Windows 8.1 (64bit) GPU(graphic card): Nvidia Geforce GT 620 1GB (not a gaming graphic card and not GTX graphic card) CPU: Intel core I5-3470 3.20 GHz 12GB of memory Resolution:1920 times 1080 2TB hard drive			"

												Do you like Zombies game with Open-World elements? Then this is the game for you! Here's a short review:This game is a must-buy when it's on sale. I highly recommend buying it, it's very cheap when on sale! It has several bugs here and there but nothing major in experience. The story is okay but it's not that bad. A lot of weapons are available in this game - firearms and melee weps. You can recruit new survivors into your community. The game still progress even when you're not playing it. I find this feature very interesting but somehow it isn't well executed. The graphic is pretty amazing at certain parts but overall it's nice but nothing amazing. Next, ah, the zombies. They're easy when they're alone but when in groups, running away is usually the best option. You can kill them quite easily with a car though, just run over them.  "

												Survival / Horror / Third Person*Minor BugsOverall 3 out of 5Complexity 3Graphics 2Immersive 3Inovative 3Game Pace 3This game is very enjoyable at the beggining, you play and develop a group of survivors and the base, which is an interesting aproach to the gender. The survivers will have different habilities and you'll probably want to specialise them in diferent weapons (for instance), to better use the available resources.You'll need to scavenge to build reservers, and move and upgrade the camp to improve your sustainability... all really cool at some point, but it have far more potential then the game realise.You have always side missions on top of the history mission, but doing the side missions become very boring as they are really repetitive and reset quickly after one is done. If you do not do it, then the time expire and you may loose a survivor, relationship with others, resources, etc. It has a really strong feeling of chasing a carrot in a fishing pool.If that was all, it would be fine, but there are other problems like a ""small map"", reseting resources when logging, and some other anoying things.All in all it's enjoyable for a time, but soon it gets old. So if it's in a sale with 75% discount it's a good call, otherwise there are better investments.			"

This is a great game, and it's worth it even when it's sale sometimes. Find survivors, scavenge for resources, and build your home. Do campaign missions or do side-missions given by the survivors. Takes time to do many things, but the repetitive system never gets boring. It's like you want to keep on going. Upgrades, attachments, unique cars, and more! Yet another awesome game.			"

												This game is actually pretty decent, it's different from other zombie genre games. However, this game is lacking one feature.  Multiplayer.  Although there are NPCs throughout the game that you need to help, it gets boring sometimes when you just want to roam around and scavenge for supplies without any friend helping you. I actually remembered there was a rumour that SoD was gonna get a multiplayer but it got cancelled. Would give this a 9/10 if it had multiplayer but I'd rather give it a 7/10 for being only a single player game.			"

												I had high, high hopes for this game.First let me start of with this though.the permadeath is fun, it adds a point worth to missions and minor tasks, do you dare risk the lives of these people to go out for minor things?is that twinkie really worth johansson and his possible demise?the build your own base is good and fun as well as establishing safe spots and being able to defend themthe open world is amazing as well, along with nice features like stealth, getting followers, constant updates and the fact that it puts a time on everything (want to save that person? well you better do it before they die because, you know, they are in trouble and have been asking for help for the past five days)Now, with this said you think it would be amazing, well, its not. Unfortunetly I can maybe only stomach playing this game in short bursts over a few monthsfrom clipping, to the physics, to the driving, to the combat to everything really just seems flawed.Walking between two cars? have plenty of space, but for some reason your character stops like your running him/her into a brick wall. Gets swarmed, diesDriving? Going 20 mph seems to make your car hop after hitting every decline on hills, couple this with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ airborne jet physics (get airborne and turn either left or right in air and you will see) and cars become a massive hinderance.  If you hit a bump while turning, may god have mercy on your players virtual soul because this game wont. It seems to forcefully eject you from the spinning car (because you know, hitting pavement at terminal velocity is a far better choice to the AI then waiting and carefully crawling out of the wreck. If you manage not to fall a large distance (either from flnging you off a bridge or in my case a highway) or somehow make it out alive, good luck getting all those things roger mcfirsttodie collected, because anytime, no matter what the circumstance, the car detonates with the fury of a thousand latinos.Speaking of roger mcfirsttodie, this game makes it hard as all hell to actually go off on your own, which is cool, it is hard, it should be hard. so you grab an AI guy. now, this AI does all of the following.Gets stuck on invisible wallsmoves sometimesswings a toothpickdies horribly.they cant carry rucksacks, they cant drive (dear god that would be a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ anyway). they cant seem to do anything on their own (in base they would be as skilled as the offspring of rambo, mcgyver and james bond) but as soon as they need to step five feet outside to pick something up. They die, so anytime you get the ability to call in for a pick up, dont, just make it easier on yourself and your AI brethren and put a bullet in them.Also, I know this was a big thing when I first played (I could only put up with an hour of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on the main game and only played lifeline, although everything except for one problem still exsisted) was that stuff would happen while your offline.Meaning you could build this amazing base with the best people, and the ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥hat of a sherif could execute every. single. person. just because he sneezed. Or in my case, send out eight people on a scavanger run and have them all die, then send more out to collect the stuff from the dead allies just to have them die more.Now, with the combat, the worst thing about this game, is that whenever you seem to be attacked. the camera decides that you need to see what nostril is stuffed up the most and not the zombie that made slight contact with you and now has teleported behind you, putting you in a master lock chokehold.  Melee and meh, its only good if its just 1v1, which will never happen, so guns, guns and ammo, and how you procure comes to ANOTHER PROBLEMinfluence, because ♥♥♥♥ you and your hard work.whats that? you found a metric ♥♥♥♥ ton of weapons and ammo for the base, too bad you will never use it because influence is a spending thing (sort of like currency but harder to get, harder to maintain, and worth less) whats that? you saved that guys life and now need him for a mission? too bad son that will cost you about 200 influence.  Whats that? need ammo because guns are really the only thing that can save you (besides stealth but just wait, there is stuff on that_) thats going to be about 5 influence per bullet. Doesnt sound too bad, untill you realize how much you get for missions. or general supply drop offs, because after doing 10 or 15, you have the choice of refilling your ammo, or getting a follower. The twist? you need both to live.But why use bullets when there is stealth?because all the missions require boots on the ground zombie asskicking.as for the free roam stealth it up, unless you need to enter a buildingmove mass quantities of stuffmove far distances.really move at all.now, lifeline, I like it, it puts the ""military is at its end we are only people but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ are we not giving up"" feel.the good? it made influence more managable. granted the air supplies you order is ♥♥♥♥ing redundant because you need to pay influence to get it, then even more to use the items, but eh, its cheaper then the main game and it actually gives you chances to get good amounts of influence.the cons of lifeline.every. ♥♥♥♥ing. thing. and more.the reasons listed are the reasons why I cant play this game, because I cant actually play it, When the game is so flawed to where you cannot do the basic things needed for simple objectives (ie. move to this spot, but wait, your character got stuck in a five foot space between cars) Its not a game, its just a POS that takes money.I still hope that eventually they will fix these listed flaws and if we are all lucky, like extremely lucky, like jesus came down to earth and defended all of the christains, christain lucky, all the other non listed flaws, this game would be a gem.

												this is a sadistic/toxic game where the designers were clearly out to waste your time and punish you for playing.the gameplay is that you go out and search for resources and bring them back to your base. to draw this out, game gives you a backpack with no more than 10 inventory slots and limits your carrying capacity to the point where you become overburdened from carrying basic weapons, 10 uses of aspirin, some candy bars and a pack of firecrackers. On top of this you can't even clear a path to/from or around your gathering areas because the zombies (infinitely) respawn.After my first 2 hours of play, one of my characters got killed and I discovered that to undo this, I had to restart the game including replaying the unskippable tutorial because there are no save games. A game this buggy and it has no save games.  "

												This game was fun for a while but after the 2-4 hour ""New Game"" feel wore off the game-play seemed to get repetitive, tedious and relatively unfun. The game-play in the beginning of the game constantly evolved as you discovered new features but unfortunately it reached a plateau rather quickly. The game itself has much potential, I'm afraid in its current state (of Decay) its not all that great. If the world was much-much larger and/or randomly generated things might be different. If the late game doesn't turn into a dash around the map saving people and grabbing resources things might be different but alas..the game gets boring pretty quickly. 6/10			"

												Arguably the most complete zombie survival game yet in existence - with an emphasis on actual survival. Like a swarm of vermin aboard a sinking ship, one's party hopes to get while the going is good. Only problem is that this requires a bunch of steps along the way - shambles, if you'll allow me - which invite death. That first statement is something of a pickle though, because my understanding is that this is the first module of a series of modules that scale complexity and sheer size of this apocalyptic world toward the end of a large or massively multiplayer zombie survival game. This isn't the most lethal game, but when characters do die, they're done for. No spells of resurrection or other deus ex machina linger at the fringes of this virtual world to allow characters another shot at hacking it out in a world gone awry. Of course, the player always has another shot, because characters also suffer from exhaustion and medical ailments which can hinder their performance substantially. The player is therefore allowed the substantial ability of hopping between characters in one's group. The game is optimized for the current level of lethality if one wants a moderately difficult rather than ball-crushing and punishingly difficult experience. There are mods which make characters die easier, and while these add some realism, player be warned: it will likely suck the player into a sort of quasi-stealth tedium where one spends most of their time crouched and scurrying from brush to obstacle to hide from the sight of intermittent random hordes and stragglers and running for dear life or immediately resorting to expending all on-hand ammunition if one's cover is blown. Melee combat is slow and sloppy, which means that more lethal zombies which retain the same pace as the default zombies are impossible to engage in groups larger than two. In the default game, as a seasoned player it's likely that one takes occasional damage while dispatching small groups of zombies by means of melee weapons. Imagine the horror if those zombies can now effectively kill your character in three swipes.Generally decent graphics and animations with some collision detection issues. Some of the textures are relatively good while others are essentially garbage, but they're generally handled well, where the garbage textures are those the player is least likely to see. Keep in mind that this is a slightly enhanced version of the XBox Live Arcade version of the game as well, so its limitations are that of the console it was designed for. The particle effects, blood, and gore are all handled well without bogging down resources or approaching a cartoonish level. Managing one's group of virtual survivors is a relatively simply if repetitive affair, as one might expect. It involves copious amounts of resource scavenging and occasional errands for the sake of plot or characters. Random events cause illness or low morale to spread. As of the last time I played this, AI characters go out on random missions to deal with troublesome zombies but you cannot remotely order them around on scavenging runs. They did add carrying capacity to some (most?) vehicles, allowing a player on a long scavenging run to offload gear and supplies into the vehicle and then return to base, vastly improving amount a player can do on a single run. The AI are not completely useless, however, and serve some utility as companions recruited for influence (the 'currency' one uses) or as stalwart defenders of the homestead. Item variety is pretty damned good in terms of accessories, firearms, and melee weapons. Ammunition types are understandably simplified and it would be best if going forward they keep the complexity along the current lines rather than expanding it a terrible lot. This is not, after all, a simulation-style game, and it should not try to uphold the pretenses thereof.The soundtrack seems somewhat short, but that's an afterthought to me. I prefer actual music to video game music. Otherwise, the sounds are generally satisfactory but not particularly memorable or amazing (their budgetary priorities probably lie elsewhere, considering the sums one can dump in high quality audio). At the least, heads are smashed with decent squishiness and gunshots do not suffer pop gun syndrome so common in games and other media developed by people unaccustomed to the real phenomenon of gun fire which involves loud percussive waves. If one wants a zombie survival game, for now look no further than this. As of 2014, this is the pinnacle of survival qua survival.			"

												So I have been reading a lot of comments of people I have owned this game from day one, never played to much but recently I felt hey lets give it another go, started up fine and the game runs perfectly smooth to me. All this BS about it not working, you need to check your♥♥♥♥♥♥before you ♥♥♥♥♥ about something! So far I have loved every minute of the game and have no clue why I did not play it much sooner.			"

												Ok this is a tough one, There is so much positive about this game (concept, gameplay, conbat system, in-game stories  yes stories) but frankly speaking its a buggy mess. There are bugs everywhere, after 12 hours of gameplay now the game engine has gone wild. Just an example , if i try to use a weapon my charactor starts punching zombies until i reload the game couple of times. That is not all, there are tons of other bugs.My gameplay upto 10 hours was fun and i was sure i could easily spend hours and hours on this but then it just started throwing tons of bugs at me. I am hoping they will fix all these bugs in upcoming ""state of decay remastered"" which is releasing 28 of April this year. Although this game is extremely fun (even just being a single player game) and it got heaps of stuff going on at the same time (Which is probobly one of the reason of its being buggy)""NOTE: I am recommending this to those who dont mind buggy gameplay if the game is fun"""" If you are not that person then dont play it.If you ask if i will keep playing this game, the answer is YES, untill State of Decay remastered comes out. This is a lovely game, you should give it a try but there will be bugs all over the place.			"

												a fantastic zombie game. you get the real sense of accomplishment from securing an area, and perma-death of characters adds to the difficulty. Just don't rage quit when one of the people you like dies.			"

												First attempt to play this game was a failure until I decided to use my Dualshock 3 controller with this game and then *boom*Got it right in the whole! This Game is designed for controller and not m&k , well too bad from the developers. Since for playing this with controller is fun, I recommend. Plot: If you will use a controller, sure hell buy this game But if you will use m&k, sure hell you are doing a mistake buying this.			"

												Why did it take this long to make this game? If you break down its mechanics, it's Oregon Trail with zombies. You collect supplies, kill zombies, make choices, kill zombies, and build outposts. It's fun. The story is meh, the voice acting is meh, but the fun of going out on your own and killing a million zombies for the good of your digital group/family, is YEAH! It's made even more fun with a permadeath system. You can play as a bunch of different people with different boosts and nerfs, but you dye, you're dead. You can now longer play as Mel. You got her killed. You have to play as Dan now, who kinda sucks. It's ok though because you can build up his stats and make him a badass. Like this game.8/10			"

												on first sight you think the game is good but you dont get enough time to do your missions let alone to have some fun exploring and enjoying the fighting. i spent the whole time running round like a headless chicken trying to get a second home. but as i was trying to look for a home and save people before they die and stop people fighting and get supplies to build the second home the house got surounded by infestations and then 2 people died(1 was part of the story) then i didnt have enough people to move. soon as you go to the second town to do anything. the first town has an emergency so i spent half my time just going back and forth trying to get there before they died.would be good if all the missions werent so rushed and if you didnt get stuck in the first house if just 1 person dies.ill probably have a look in a few months to see if they have improved it otherwise im not gonna bother anymore i spent 12 hours doing exactly what they all said trying to be the good guy saving everyone and my save game is still messed up.i do not recomend this, i like a game that i can actualy have time to enjoy. having to do exactly what the game wants me to do when it wants me to do it or it gets too ruined thats just not fun.

												It is a fantastic game as far as a zombie survival rpg goes, combat is fluid and leveling up fighting is easy, cardio not so much, just searching the places you enter helps raise your wits which helps you search faster and more quietly which is a big plus.pros:Graphics are decent, gameplay is good, controls are good (controller is a must for this title) music is good, the main game should take you about 20-25 hours assuming your working well on trying to beef up your main base (Synder Trucking Company is by far the best choice due to its location, how close it is to places that you can scavenge, & the fact it has 6 spots for you to set up facilities on your base) You have to constantly get supplies as you would in real life if a zombie apocalypse were to happen, and you need to be mindful of what missions you do in what order (if they tell you to assist a fellow group of survivors or go save someone unless your on a supply run and right by your base go and save them otherwise you run a good risk of them dying on you)cons:camera can be a ♥♥♥♥♥ at times, if your surrounded by zombies its sometimes difficult to escape and if your trying to use items mid fight you have to pretty much remove yourself from all the zombies, characters that you can recruit if you don't assist them fast enough WILL DIE, & if you save and quit missions that were availible will disappear depending on how long you were gone (1 game day as far as taking away rescources is about 4 hours)Overall rating: 9/10It is however a much better zombie survival game than either Dayz mod for arma 2 or the dayz standalone (THIS IS MY PERSONAL OPINION as i prefer the feel of the rpg and survival aspects of State of Decay rather than the FPS aspects of the dayz games) also if you can get the dlc for it Breakdown, do so its a good add on and it allows you to get an infinite mode that allows you to play as different characters and enjoy the game pretty much however you feel like. Well worth the price normally but if you can get it on sale, by all means pick it, Breakdown , & Lifeline up, you will be doing yourself a very large favor.			"
