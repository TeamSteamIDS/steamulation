												What can I say about this game?...  Well, it’s fun.  It’s frustrating.  It’s simple.  It’s small.  Did I mention it’s fun?  That said, it's not worth $10, and I'll tell you why;Roller Coaster Rampage is pretty different from every other roller coaster game I’ve played.  The coasters in this game are virtually “created” as you ride them.  Trust me, it’s a very unique experience, and often that is where a lot of frustration comes from.There are 2 modes you can currently play in Roller Coaster Rampage.  There’s the Campaign mode where you basically try to collect as many gems as you can while linking your on-the-fly track with already pre-constructed pieces of track.  Then there’s the Free Ride mode, in which you just make a coaster any way you like.  You'll find yourself spending most of your time in Free Ride, as the Campaign mode is rather easy and only has about 30-ish challenges to finish.I found quite a few things dissapointing about this game.  One disappointment with this game was the content seemed to be drastically lacking.  It’s virtually impossible to build the same coaster, but you only have one location so the scenery all around you is always the same.  The location is rather small as well, leaving you struggling to build any ride that lasts longer than a minute or two.  The coaster itself was also always the same.  You couldn’t change to a wooden one, or a hanging one, or any other coaster than the standard metal one.  The starting station was always the same, however in Campain Mode it was sometimes rotated a bit to make your launching and landing directions different.Element impacts (crashing into objects) were random as well.  Some things like the coaster track legs would get out of your way as you crossed them and other times you would ram into them and your hard work would come to an immediate and very violent end.  Occasionally when legs did move they would interfere with a part of the track you already built, leaving you to sloppily go right through a track leg when you went back and rode the coaster after it's built.  It was impossible to know if it’s safe to cross under another track or not.  This made most of my coasters climb as they progressed and then dive back into the station at the end, instead of having a large hill at the very beginning.  It also kept me from doing several cool maneuvers, like having a loop run through the center of another loop.  Scenery was also touch-and-go as well.  It was hard to tell what you could safely pass through and what you couldn’t.  On occasion, sometimes an object would be deadly to your coaster one pass and safe the next.  It was a mix that made it hard to do the quick decision making that the game requires you to make.Another thing that brought frustrations was the control layout.  I found the controls really awkward, especially since you have to really think fast while playing.  Your acceleration/breaking and “roll” was controlled by the WASD keys while the arrow keys controlled left/right and up/down movement.  You also had the numbers 1-3 for “stunts” like left/right corkscrews and looping.  It probably would have been a much better setup with Q and E for the corkscrews and maybe R or F for looping.  That would be more common, and easier, for those who are practiced in FPS games.It’s not all bad though.  I really enjoy this game as a simple time waster.  It’s fast to load and you can quickly get yourself into the “Free Mode”.  Even if you’ve only got 10 minutes to waste you can get a few rides in before you have to shut it down.  I often find myself firing up this game in those few minutes before leaving for work, just because I know it’s a game that you can be satisfied with only playing it 5 minutes.The purchase price of $9.99 is very high, and it's the main reason I'm not giving my recommendation for this game.  There's just too much lacking.  A lack of content makes it nothing more than a quick time waster.  The controls are frustrating.  The unchanging scenery is just lazy game designers.  It's not worth $10.I bought the game as part of a 4-game bundle for $5.99 which makes my purchase worth it.  If you can buy it like that, or on sale for no more than $2, then go for it.  Otherwise you're just paying Cadillac prices to own a Ford.			"

												If you're tired of those Tycoon games with the boring coasters; this game is for you! If you dislike games with very clunky controls that makes it impossible to play; you'll hate this game. The utter freedom in creating any coaster design you want is great; even if you create physically impossible coasters that would rip it's riders apart; and the fast action makes it addictive. But, still, those controls. They make absolutely no sense; they're hard to get to when you need them and you'll find yourself spending more time crashing your coaster becuase you weren't able to get turned quick enough. It's a fun game, it's a *really* fun game; but the controls aren't suited for the kind of fast paced action this game throws at you. They're clunky, they're cumbersome, and they're just in no way suited for this game. If you find it on sale; it's worth about 2 bucks; but I wouldn't give any more for this game. It's a game you'll play; you'll probably never actually advance.			"

One of the worst rollercoaster simulator games ever.[/b]
Now don't hate this review because I played the game for 16 minutes...
Please sit back and easily read my comment.

Don't get me wrong, I like simulator/tycoon games, especially rollercoaster,waterpark.
But this one is just a no. At first I was suprisingly amazed by the screenshots of the game and wanned to buy it, but now I saw it in a bundle, on bundlestars. Got the bundle... 
And I was suprised...
Its actually alot worse than I though.
Don't let the screenshots fool you.
Its hard to explain this thing by text, and hard for you to understand why you shouldn't get this game.
So let me explain this easier - heres cons and pros.

Pros:
+ Graphics,textures.
+ Doesn't take alot of space.
+ Good animations.
+ Controller support. (I haven't tried it.)
+ Workshop??!? (? - I'm not sure about this, they said they have one tho it doesn't show up here. But yeah I guess its coming soon feature.)
Cons:
- Bad menu.
- Only 1 track color.
- Only 1 coaster design.
- Boring after first half hour - hour.
- No new coaster parts.

Anyways, its a no from me. "

												DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS IT IS ON SALEI know that sounds harsh but it's something that has to be said.A lot of people aren't recommending this game.I see why. Roller Coaster Rampage is simply a game about Roller Coasters. That's it.However, This game delivers everything that it promises. (I haven't seen much destruction in my playtime though.) The graphics for this game look 2007-ish, and not up to modern specs. The Coaster Creation is an innovative idea, although it takes a bit of getting used to. Most players would feel more comfortable playing this with a controller. The campaign (as it's called in game) is merely a set of simple challenges that can be completed quite easily, and they seem very repetitive. There is only 1 park available in Roller Coaster Rampage, and it gets small and boring, fast. If you could walk around the park and visit other attractions, the game could be reasonably fun. However, you cannot.Free-Play mode is where the game shines. The track can be easily created and then you can ride the insane monstrosity you've created (But I couldn't find a save button). It's pretty neat, but construction can get messy with lots of rails and support beams everywhere. When you hit high speeds the track seems to get choppy (even though the game renders at a nice 60 fps), and the railcars seem unable to follow physics.Workshop support is 'Coming Soon!', but I have no idea how long that's been there.But why do I recommend this game? It's simply a fun little time killer. I bought it for $2.50 during the Holiday Sale, and that's as much as this game is worth. If you're thinking about dropping $10 on this, wait for it to go on sale for $2 or less.tl;drGraphics: 7/10 - looks cartoony, but a little on the low-def side.Overall Gameplay: 6/10 Needs fine tuning, and a controller greatly helps.Campaign: 5/10 - Average challenges that add little to mechanics and design.Free-Play: 8/10 - Fun, but you cannot save tracks. Physics and Construction seem a bit wonky.Overall Score - 6/10. Average, but definitely not worth $10. Wait for a sale.			"

												Wow, that's all I can say to be honest. This is really not the sort of game I would normally play, while it is a pretty terrible game, I strangly found my self laughing and actually having a good time. I will probably never open this game ever again but still. The aim is to build a roller coaster in real time as you are riding it. This can lead to some pretty hilarious sitations. The amount of times my cart went flying across the map using some weird rag doll effect and cracked me up was too many to count. Need cheering up? You'll find a barrel of laughs right here...			"

												This game has a nice change of pace concept for a coaster sim.  Its not a theme park came, but very much a build as you ride coaster generator. The concept is nice and create an easy pick up and play format. However, I find there is one main flaw in this game and that is the lack of a rewind feature.  It is quite frustrating to build a really long coaster and have it crash right at the end and have to start all over.  Either restarting 10 seconds before the crash or just a simple rewind feature to be able to go back to any point in your build and deviate from your original plan.  I would invest a lot more time in this game if this was the case. Otherwise, I see myself playing it seldomly.			"

												This plays kind of like a magic carpet ride.  Wasnt sure what I was expecting from a 3d roller coaster, but in this game you just kind of move around and it lays track as you go.  You dont plan it out as in other tycoon type games.  In this game you need to collect gems adn do stunts.  The controller support is ok but the game is very picky if a jump says 50 mph, and your at 51 or 49 you crash.  Crashing would be more fun if people were on the roller coaster screaming, but the game is mostly silent minus a muted background track.  Meh, woulda been more fun to build a wild ride like Mr.Bones but there is no real building in this game just as you go.  Kind of like stearing a plane but it lays roller coaster track.Rating:  2/10  Value:  $1.99			"

												Roller Coaster Rampage is an interesting twist on roller coaster building.  Don't expect to build amazing, realistic coasters because that is hard to do, but collecting gems and smashing through objects is a lot of fun.  It's definitely a lot better using a controller.  I use my xbox one controller and plug it into my PC and it works great.  The graphics and scenery look pretty cool too.			"

The graphics are alright and its nice to build a coaster so high that you can barely see the ground, but just watch out where you place your tracks. This is not a tycoon game, nowhere near it.

												Literally the worst game I have ever played. It's broken, it's buggy, the controls are horrific. It presents itself as a roller coaster ""game""... but it's more of an awkward physics-less flight sim that draws a roller coaster track behind you... poorly... as you go.Every time I think about that I gave this developer money, I cringe and get irrationally angry. It is a complete disgrace of a game, and a shameless money grab.

												Though the story can be vague at times from what I can tell, Roller Coaster Rampage is a funfilled game about a roller coaster that is possed by some sort of demon. Powerd by blood, the rollercoaster builds itself as it rides whilst feeding on its RAMPAGING destruction. Though beware! A lone monk has randomly blessed some nondestinct objects making them indestrucble, but which ones? Thats for you to find out! All in all, one big thrill ride of non consquential faffing about featuring both reflection and refraction.3/10			"

												This game is dire beyond measure. Avoid. Really avoid.I can see what they were trying to do. Visually the game looks at first glance like an improved version of Rollercoaster Tycoon 3, and some care and attention has gone into creating a single park and a single design of coaster. Do not be decived by these superficial similarities.You build the track by piloting the first car through the air like a flight simulator, aiming for the next section of pre-built track, and hitting the space bar in a kind of quicktime event to try to connect to it.This is NOT a rollercoaster building game, it is not a park management game, I'm not sure what exactly it is if I'm honest. The closest thing I can compare it to is something like Temple Run, only with rollercoasters and a first person perspective.Each level, you are given a few segments of rollercoaster pre-built. Your job is to link them together, in the pre-set (but not shown) order, and that is it. You are asked to add various elements such as barel rolls or corkscrews in between each element, and there are gems to collect which basically show you exactly where your track should go (except not every section has gems, and then you're left circling round looking for the next segment of track). This all sounds quite fun so far, and would be a good game mechanic in a game like Rollercoaster Tycoon any of its rivals. But this game doesn't share any of those games mechanics.You cannot place track with any kind of sensible interface. You cannot undo your track except by restarting the level. You cannot see your ride from any perspective other than first person, riding in the front seat. I don't just mean when riding it, I mean all the time. You build the track by piloting the first car through the air like a flight simulator, aiming for the next section of pre-built track, and hitting the space bar in a kind of quicktime event to try to connect to it. This really isn't much fun at all, and leads to hilariously awful coasters with curves that would be impossible in real life and really not fun. Then by the time you get to level three, the game starts to feature pre-built segments that involve jumps and you realise that not even it takes itself seriously any more.Couple this awful gameplay and lack of realism with a terrible interface, bad colision detection (most of the time if your track collides with things the cars fly through the air and disintegrate, but sometimes they don't, and then you can have coasters going right through trees, buildings, and other bits of track), and you end up with a truely awful game.Run, run far away from this awful thing and never look back.

												Great game! I love it!Would reccomend adding more features about the customization of your track, but other than that, 9/10.Worth every penny.			"

												I got this for the 3d vision experience. Its a lot of fun but after awhile I decided to move on. Awesome 1st person perspective for the 3d though.			"

												I wouldn't recommend this game at first. This game would be good if it's bought on a sale (at least half price) and it's a cheap concept of No Limits and Roller Coaster Tycoon 3. Most of the times if you were going to ride the workshop coasters and then the game crashes. You'll have to use a controller in order to play this game, you build coasters with it. For I now I wouldn't recommend this but whatever I say in this review will change.			"

												This game. I has its moments. To be honest, it really isn't the best. The trailer is one of the reasons I bought this game (And it was half off). It really overhypes the gameplay. There is only one map, and some limitation to what you can do (I initally thought you could crash and destroy EVERYTHING from the ground to trees and certain buildlings). I haven't played all the levels and havent done much free mode so maybe I can't post a real review, but this is what I have experienced so far.I would reccomend it if it was on sale and you needed a quick little game to pass time or have some fun with something different (Just like buying DLC Quest).(Another quick thing is that it doesn't full screen at its start menu but changes when ingame. It can be a bit of a hassle at times :P)			"

												Really lame game.  If you're looking for a rollercoaster simulation game where you get to painstakingly create and ride an awesome rollercoaster, this is not the game for you.  You play it in first person and ""build"" the roller coaster as you ride it.  It's awkward to control and frustrating to try to make a neat coaster without running into something and being forced to start over again.			"

												I just did a Let's Play of this game. Let me sum it up for you:-Awful controls (Which are defaulted so they can't be changed)-No Edit Mode-Meh Graphics-Takes a long time to load (My system is brand-spanking new)-Boring gameplay (HOW CAN YOU MAKE A GAME ABOUT ROLLER COASTERS SMASHING THINGS BORING?)Summarised: Unless you're a Let's Player who wants a game to rage about, skip it. Buy No Limits 2 instead.			"

												I just had a great time playing this game. There are fixed ""joints"" around the park, but you basically build the track in real time as you are collecting diamonds and trying to do corkscrews etc.Very arcadey, and loads of fun. There are a few bugs which are especially noticable when you go back to ride the track you just made, but ultimately they're forgivable. The option to play in 3d just adds to it. Rollercoasters + 3d are a winning combination. It's cheap and well worth a look if you can overlook some of the bugs.			"
