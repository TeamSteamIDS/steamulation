												Banished is what many city/village building games wish they could be when they grow up. No barbarians screaming at the gates, not a zombie in sight, just good solid building with intelligent villagers, clever mechanics, and thoughtful details. It's easy, it's relaxing, it's soothing. Until the realities of colony life bite you in the backside! Banished is addictive. :D			"

												Banished is the best city builder I've ever played (and I've played a lot, having been a fan of the genre since the original Sim City and the old Sierra historical builder games). The game is deceptively simple, you start with a few settlers and minimal supplies and you build a thriving settlement. Sounds easy enough, but it's probably one of the most challenging games I've played.There are a variety of crops, animals, and natural resources. Your setttlers will plant and gather and use these to build a rustic town. Steel tools and stone houses represent the pinnacle of your settlement's technological advancement. You can barter goods with a few visiting tradesmen and some nomads may periodically ask to join your settlement, but that's the limit of your outside contact. Peace reigns, you won't need any military (or even police) here. The only hostile forces you will encounter in Banished are tornadoes, fires, diseases, starvation, and cold. And you will encounter them, a lot.Although the game is relaxing to play, it can at times be incredibly difficult. Your settlement might be going along nicely for 100 years, with plenty of food and lots of citizens available to fill all the jobs that need to be done, and suddenly everyone has cholera and you're closing down the schoolhouse to free up some child laborers to expand your cemetary. Banished is brutal that way. But it's also beautiful. The music and graphics and effects are really appealing, and the immersion factor is high. It's definitely one of those games you can sit down to in the early afternoon and play for hours and hours and then be surprised to find your stomach growling and oh hey when did it get so dark outside?The developer is very active and involved in the community, and new features are added often. Now the game offers modding capability and Steam Workshop. So far the community has responded with some amazing tweaks and additions which only make the game even better (also a little easier, if you find the challenge a bit much). I can't wait to see how Banished continues to evolve, which it seems to do in much the same way that my tiny settlements grow and evolve, with all of the little details coming together to make something really satisfying and enjoyable.

												Banished is an amazingly fun and intense game. Some people have described it as being ""zen"" to which I disagree to a point. It gives the illusion of being peaceful, until it stabs you in the back. The game is stressful, the game is hard, the game will make you laugh and it will make you cry. You will build up a large, bustling, seemingly succesfull town only for a small disaster to bring your whole population to it's knees. But when you do succeed, it is oh so satisfying.This is the city builder you've been waiting for.An example of what can easily happen:

												You start with the minimal needed to begin your soon-to-be expansive town.  The basics are pretty simple to grasp -- keep your people warm and fed, give them a place to live, and make sure they have tools to survive.  It's much harder and more challenging than it sounds, but it is also extremely rewarding once you've got a thriving town.  Don't think it will last long though!  There's a population to grow, more land to settle, the occasional disaster, a trading-post to manage, and the ever-present feeling that you could be doing better if you just did one or two things differently an hour ago... but that's what the next game is for... and then there's the *hard* difficulty.And yes, I helped test the game (for almost 40 hours), but I had so much fun that I will be playing at least 40 more.  Luke did an amazing job with Banished!  Congrats! "

												After everyone else in my city starved to death, only Nesto was left. I followed him for several more years as he lived off what others had left behind; moving from house to house to find food and firewood. Nesto spent half his entire life completely alone in a post-apocalyptic city, finally succumbing to the cold one late winter day at the age of 60. When Nesto died, the overall happiness of the city increased. This is the best game I have ever played.			"

												Was doing great. The little town of Aviono, 20k food, 78 adults, around 12 children, and 15 years in. When the 16th year came around, it all went to hell. A fire started, burning one of the three storage barns stocked with food. I tried to get my little people to fight the fire with the wells nearby. They failed miserably and the other two barns caught fire, (this is about the time I realized putting all my food storages close together was a mistake). The fire started to spread to the wooden houses nearby, so I paused the game and looked up how to fight the damn fire. I figured out prioritizing the fire would help, so I did it and it did the trick. After the fire was put out, I checked out the damage. All my food gone and 5-6 houses destroyed. I knew my first priority should be to get my food back up to support my ever growing population of little people. This is where I realised I had made another mistake. Over 70% of my food was coming from potato farms, and guess what? All of my farms were right next to each other and an infestation started. Farm after farm were getting infected and loosing crops and I had no idea how to stop it. (I'm not one to go back and load and earlier save) So I paused it and looked it up, I couldn't find out how to stop it this time and I let it run it's course. Now the starvation began, and the graveyard began to fill up with little people's grave stones. It was too late to plant crops to get enough food to feed them all, so I basically gave up and watched everyone die a horrible death. I closed my eyes, mourning the loss of the little people that I had led around for so long. Then...I opened my eyes. I had three people still living! One 19 year old male and one 22 year old mother with her 6 year old male child. I had another chance to fix the broken city and save Aviono. This female was my last hope, unless I could get her with a female child, all was lost. So I set them to work tearing down the now unoccupied houses of the original Aviono, since I was almost completely out of materials.  I got them to live close to eachother and waited paitently untill....success! A female child was born. Life was good again. I set my new couple to tearing down everything not needed for materials and the future growth or Aviono. In the end, I had two stone houses, one of every type of resource production buildings, a town hall, and a cemetery (to remind me of the past mistakes). I got my population back up to 16 little people, and I sat back and sighed with relief. I had saved a town.Then I realised that the new towns folk were all inbred children from the three survivors....			"

												I love this game, it's a city builder game made by only one guy.Even though there are no wars or attackers there are several ways to die, mostly to starvation or them freezing to death.The creator (Luke) said he would take a day or two off and then on to bugfixing and work on a modkit to the game, making users able to mod the game, and the possibilities are endless. Things NOT to expect.It's NOT an action game, it's casual and slow going (you can speed it up).It's NOT a multiplayer game (And probably never will be, he made the engine for the game himself, with singleplayer in mind).It's NOT a triple A game (that being said it's worth the money if you like good indie games).Now thats over i can say i love the game, and gonna put alot of time in it im sure.Update to this: It's been a week now and i just made 100% Achievements in this game and i STILL love it.There is i must say some bugs, and it's a little laggy once you got the town to big, it's easy to see if you scroll around the map with the time on 10x with a population of 1k+.Also once you get a big town there are some problems with people dieing of starvation even with more then 150k food in storage, simply because they can't get back to the house they live in fast enuff to eat and won't eat on the way in other houses, or marketplaces or anywhere.Im sure thats gonna be fixed, but he's one guy so might take some time.But even with those bugs it's well worth it to get the game, i would have paid 30$ for the game and still not feel screwed..

												This is for me, the best game ever made. It exactly reach all I want in a game. It's a city builder, there's math, there's production chains, there's inventory maintenance, there's beautiful graphics, endless scenarios, tough achievements, the game constantly has updates from a mod called Colonial charter, which is the only mod you need and it makes the game 3 times as big and fun. This is without a doubt, a must-game in any game collection. The best 20$ I've ever spent in my life for the amount of hours of fun it gave me in return.I nominated this game in 2016 for the Steam awards.			"

												Banished is a distillation of what a lot of city-building fans missed from newer SimCity games.  It’s a smart, fun twist on the concept -- instead of ruling over a metropolis through a mayor’s lens, you play a more intricate role in the development of a small colony.  Every citizen is somebody you can see and control (though not directly), and your role is to see that your citizens are well-fed, happy, and warm through the long winters.  The result is a more nuanced and satisfying game than the EA flagship franchise which inspired it.Every Banished game starts on a randomly generated map, where you control a small band of settlers (about 10 adults and 10 children) who have ostensibly been banished from wherever they came from.  You have nothing but the minimal supplies they carried with them, and the resources of the land around you.  Your first objective is to survive the coming winter, which you can do by building houses, creating a source of food (a fishing dock or gatherer’s hut would do), and a source of heat for winter (firewood).  All of these things require resources such as lumber, stone, and iron, which your citizens can scrounge from the land around them.  After the first winter, your options explode.  The basic idea is to increase the population of your town by building homes, while balancing the basic needs of the citizens with the resources required for those needs.  Every citizen in your town is a resource as well; the player personally assigns jobs to accomplish every task, and must make sure their labor force is well balanced and not spread too thin.  Should the population dip and you no longer have enough farmers, for instance, the consequences can be dire.All of this may sound a little daunting, and it can be, but Banished provides a helpful tutorial at the outset to ease the difficulty curve a bit.  I was able to get rolling with my city and survive my first winter with its help.  The mechanics are satisfying and relatively deep, although after 20 hours or so I found myself finding a groove and more or less following a formula for increasing the population of my town.  It was still fun to see my town sprawl across the map (which can be sizeable), but the gameplay got a bit tired.Banished does come with robust mod support and for those who find themselves growing tired of the gameplay, there is an extensive library of mods which breathe new life into the game.  Colonial Charter is a large mod which adds an incredible amount of new content and greatly extends the life of Banished.  It’s great to see mod support for a game like this, and it’s a shining example of why we should see more mod support for games going forward.Overall, I’d recommend Banished to anyone pursuing that city simulation itch, but finding themselves disappointed with recent EA offerings.  Populations of your city won’t rocket into the millions, but the level of control and visibility into the workings of the simulation is very satisfying.  It’s a game which, while probably inspired by games like SimCity, does plenty to establish itself in this genre with new ideas.			"

												So I got vis game in the hope that I would be able to build a balanced city and survive at least one winter, how wrong I was, I died like 16 times in a row, then I discovered plums, I traded everything I had for one plumb seed and the plumb boom began. I found that if I devoted my entire town to be a plumb nation so to speak, nothing could stop me. I dedicated all my time to plumb manufacturing. I set up a trading post and traded my vast abundance of plumbs for clothing and materials. After my brief time on this game I really feel I discovered the true value of plumbs in todays society and will never take them for granted again.     For example for 10 years in a row I found my population to be stagnant and it hovered around the 66 citisen mark (not including children) for these 10 years. My solution to this was simple, I set up plumb farms all across the coast, from what I can gather with my basic understanding of immigration, traders come into my city on canoes and see the plumbs, they then return to their families after trading their iron and coal for my nations plumbs, they tell their families tales of he great plumb nation, then they tell friends and co-workers. This all led to the great population inflation of 18AD.   After 10 years of 66 citisens I grew to 88, many historians argue this was due to a better education system and advancements in stone houses and such. But these people are heretics and should be shakled and plumbed to death. Of course the real reason was due to plumb based immigration. Unfortunately the great mine collapse of 18AD saw the death of 15 good miners, so this countered the growth, I decided to close all mines and quarries and focus solely on plumbs and the occasional gatherer for berries. All in all I would give plumb simulator 2014 a 9/10 would deffo play again.			"

												My entire village burned down, leaving two teenage boys alive and no-one else. I had a very successful economy so they survived on their own for many years in the burnt out husk of what was once a thriving merchant town by living off my extensive stockpile of most resources. Unable to have children for obvious reasons, they slowly grew old, and in late winter of Year 108, they both died at the ripe old ages of 72 and 73 respectively. 11/10 would play again.			"

												After over 100 hours of playing it is definitely time that I write a review for this game.I bought Banished on a whim during the summer sales, I played lots of Sim City 2000 during my childhood and I was after another game like that but of course at the time Cities Skylines was out of my budget, so after a bit of YouTube research I added this to my games collection.When I started my first village I was completely lost, in fact my first four or five villages were complete failures. This game had a lot to balance up, a constant battle for resources that I always seemed to lose, it was very frustrating at first and I almost abandoned the game with about five hours playtime. I took to YouTube again and learnt the basics of making it through winter and keeping up with farming and eventually I made it past the usual three year mark and got a village that was actually growing and moving forward. With the town in full swing I was able to expand further and further, making smaller communities that would join with marketplaces and eventually with trading ports to bring animals, all leading up to the town hall which is great for prediciting resource consumption, housing needs and allowing the entry of nomads.At this point I was spending almost entire days just tending to my village, I built a huge bridge spanning across a lake to connect up two distant communities and made both self reliant, with each year adding more houses, schools, forester lodges and so on. The problem is that if you don't maintain just one element of your village, the collapse is VERY sudden. One year my sheep got sick and this affected the whole herd, meaning I had to kill them all; in tern this meant that my tailor couldn't make the highest quality coats and since I didn't change the settings to a lower material, I had no coats stockpiled for winter, leading to many of my villagers freezing to death.My newest village is going strong with around 280 citizens but everything lies in the balance, the further you get the more you have to keep track of, but it feels very rewarding to make it through a year without someone starving to death. I have to juggle my farmers around so that once a harvest is finished they are then pushed into the mines and quarries to retrieve resources until spring comes again, if I forget to change that option in time then that causes a huge drop in my food production, so yeah you need to stay on top of everything. My screen is usually covered with all my building objectives that need to be filled and the town hall stats that will show where to put my labourers.That all being said, Banished isn't going to be a game you will return to every week, I could play for days on end at first but now its a bit intimidating returning to my town, that could be because of the stress of it all. The music can get quite repetitive but overall I did really enjoy the soundtrack, very appropriate for the theme of the game, but when you hear the music on start up everytime it can just get you out of the mood of playing, i'd put a playlist of your own on standby if you're going to play for more than two or so hours. I have been lucky to avoid most of the in game disasters unlike other players but that can be toggled to your preference. I agree with some players that there could have been a few more build options on top of what there is, more types of housing is something I would have enjoyed, but i've been playing without any mods so far and haven't felt the need (yet) to go in search for them.Once you get your first successful town, the game is very cosy and its great to have the different map seeds with flat land or valleys to spice things up. You are going to need patience at first that is for sure, look up guides if you get caught in the lag of the first few years and that will help move things forward. The art style is quite detailed for such a small game and the camera feature that lets you cut back and forth to far apart settlements is so useful, in fact many of the shortcuts available make management of the game a lot less stressful as you go along.Banished is a game I would definitely recommend to anyone I know. While it has difficulty options available to you, I would say this game is for people in that middle zone with it being a bit challenging for casual players and maybe lacking that complexity a more hardcore simulator player would prefer. Go watch some videos and add it to your wishlist! "

												 Thinking of buying this game? Well let me help you out with that. First take the time to look at these two youtubers, Start with TotalBiscuit's WTF is ... Banished, still interested? Now take the time to watch quill18's ""Let's play : Banished"" it has 18 videos of game play for you to sink your mind into.  Now that you've taken the time to watch the video's take this into consideration. This game was devoloped by a one man show , Luke Hordorowicz. (Shining Rock Software) He started making this game in Aug. 2011 and in 3 years has made something I have been really enjoying. This game isn't really a city/town builder as it is a survival game. There is no invading hordes, ninja's, bandits or jabba-walkies, but to me it's not needed. Micro managing your town is plenty, for now. There is going to be mod support for this and with the talent I've seen out there I'm sure new buildings and other things you might miss will surely be added.  The game itsself does start at a slow pace like most building games. (there is the ability to increase the speed x2, x5, x10) but that can change pretty fast. My first two towns ended up ghost towns from thinking I could afk for 10 mins. Lesson learned. Starvation, disease, fire, etc. will make short work of your town if not ready for it and it willl happen. There is no money in this game, more of a barter system once you set up your trader. Exchanging items your town has crafted for new crop seeds, live stock and other supplies. Finding the balance in your town is key which can be tricky, placing a bunch of houses down and not having food for your new rapid growing town will end poorly.  This game isn't meant to be rushed, take time to pause the game and look at your map and plan ahead. There is no winning in Banished only failing. You either find the right groove and keep getting bigger or watch your little towns people turn into compost. Three dificulty levels, I find medium or hard a lot more fun. Random map generator which is nice to see. 3 different map sizes, plus a choice of valleys or mountains. Weather and seasons, and plenty more.  In closing I'd like to say the game is worth 19.99$ and honestly I find any game I can spend hours playing on the first day well worth my money. I've bought 60$ games from the big AAA companies and either have them beat in 5-6 hours or lose interest in 30 minutes. This game is going on my favorites list for sure. Thanks for reading, cheers!

												My friend had a Banished game with a man named Garther in his town. He was among the first settlers. Garthar was educated and handsome, but never took a wife or had children - much to the dismay of the town. Instead, Garther took the tough jobs. The hunting jobs - slogging through deer innards to butcher and skin wilderness animals to feed the lesser peons of his civilization. Garther did this for many brutal winters before finally retiring to a small house near the edge of town due to old age. But this didn't stop Garther.Oh, no. Garther took it upon himself to then educate the new generation of town inhabitants as their new teacher. In his late 80s. The rugged, elderly mountain man taught them all how to hunt and fend for themselves - and most importantly - how to not be ♥♥♥♥♥es. The town still stands to this day, all thanks to Garthar. Rest in peace, sweet prince. 10/10. Would relive the saga.			"

												Everything seems fine. Winter rolls around. Food stocks are well beyond surplus, everyone... Okay, most people are wearing clothes, people all seem healthy. A group of nomads come to your town hall upon seeing your vast reserves of resources and food. You allow them to join your settlement, what could be the harm in adding some more workers?A little bit rolls by seemingly fine, but suddenly you have no food reserves and the planting of new crops have just started! People are starving in the streets. Nobody has any food in their homes. Then you notice that fuel reserves have dwindled while you were trying to solve your food shortage problem! People are now huddling in their homes with their families freezing to death and you can't stop it! Then an outbreak of Influenza comes through, your town's only physician died of starvation not too long ago. All hell has broken loose and your citizens are dieing too rapidly for you to do anything about it.You watch in horror.Everything you knew has crumbled before you. A sprawling settlement is suddenly eerily empty after only about a year or two of commotion. Everyone is dead. You didn't get the 0 population nomads mod.You turn off your computer and go weep in the corner of the room after the mass extinction that just happened due to your negligence.12/10. I love this game.			"

												Banished strips the complexities of the city-building genre to their essentials. Shining Rock Software has rolled the genre back to the middle ages. There's no sewer system to manage, no power grid to maintain. Just a group of settlers pushing into the wilderness, and a wilderness that pushes back.This simplicity creates a focused game in Banished. It starts as an intimate simulation and grows to be a taut, strategic experience.Banished feels more like a survival simulation than a traditional city builder. I was plopped into the middle of the wilderness with a dozen people and some supplies, which they immediately began consuming. The race was on to clear enough land to plant crops and build houses before winter.Each step in this arduous process is shown off by delicate animations that give life to the individual tasks. And each of those animations has a one-to-one relation to the city's production. Ask a citizen to fell a tree, and watch as they chop it down, carry back and deposit a single wood resource into the town's storage. Banished's towns look like a busy little ant colonies from afar, but all the activity is something more. The game rewards careful study, and those rewards made me begin to care about my little citizens.At the expense of making laborers anonymous, Banished provides an enormous amount of control over their virtual lives. The game's mechanics are closely tied to the cycle of the seasons, so in the spring and early summer I shifted everyone into the fields for planting. In the autumn I pulled laborers out of the mines to bring in the harvest. With such high-level strategy driving my decisions, I felt like a leader, not just a deity pushing at abstracted levers. While I couldn't get to know my citizens as individuals, I had control over their lives. This worked perfectly until the mid-game, where the simulation gets tedious. Once I pushed the population over 50 workers it became less about dictating the free time of each individual and more about the careful accounting of performance of the population as a whole. But at this level of gameplay, Banished struggles with giving players solid feedback on their actions. For instance, a gatherer will roam the area around town and carry back little baskets of roots and berries. But when the forest has been picked clean they just mutely wander. You have to zoom in, below the trees, and check to see if their hands are full. When you're tracking a small population of workers on a one-to-one basis, this is fine. When the population has ballooned, it becomes a major frustration.The struggle for information makes Banished especially difficult at points. As I swung wildly from feast to famine and back again, lots of people were left cold and hungry. Entire towns died off before I had an understanding of how to cycle through methods of generating food in order to reliably collect enough to make it through each winter. And even then it was more guesswork than fact; let's try hunting more this year, fishing more the next. While future towns benefitted from my experience, Banished put me through an emotional wringer to earn any pride I felt for my little ant farm.My only comfort during these tough times was to zoom into the gorgeous fully 3D world. Banished looks phenomenal, and it ran without a hitch at maximum settings, even in the late game when my town of nearly 200 began to sprawl across several screens. At such a large scale Banished resembles a little clockwork machine with hundreds of tiny parts. And as the movement began to slow, the complexity of the simulation allowed me to easily pull off the gears and reassemble them in clever ways. When a disaster, say an infestation of insects, began to attack the crops, I pulled workers from the quarry to quickly bring in the harvest. At the same time I repositioned workers from the coal mine to clear more land for fast-growing, alternative crops. It was a joy to find that sometimes my improvised solutions even worked.Banished demands your attention. It's a game that shows instead of tells, and at times I wish it had told me more. I failed over and over again as I got my bearings. But the grand scale of those failures just made my improvements feel all the more genuine. Past the steep learning curve and trial-and-error gameplay of Banished lies a methodically crafted labor of love that is as precise as it is thrilling.			"

												A good city builder is often the kind of game you can relax with. It's like an ant farm or a fish tank, you have a certain level of input, but from there you just watch nature take its course. Banished is a deceptively relaxing game, with its pastoral themes and gentle, lilting soundtrack. Beneath the inviting exterior however is a persistent test of your planning abilities, one that can have you sweating before you know it.""Banished"" refers to the tiny group of country folk you start the game with, a group of exiles in a wild, untamed land. From a humble start you help them assemble food, shelter, and comfort for themselves against the harsh winters. This is a personal-level game, similar to Tropico or Children of the Nile, where you can follow each individual resident from their house to their work and back. You'll also find elements of the Anno games, with each home and structure having its own inventory of goods that must be balanced against the consumption of the ever-growing population.This is where the game can make you panic, because I wasn't kidding about the harsh winters. Your people need food, firewood, clothes, tools, medicine, and other goods and services to survive and prosper, and their needs change by season. When winter comes you'll see a run on the food and firewood stores that can quickly leave people starving and freezing if you haven't adequately prepared. Shortfalls can be extremely hard to recover from, because farms are planted and harvested by seasons, orchards take years to grow from saplings, and your livestock ages as your residents do.Once you master the balance of goods for your populace, the rest of the challenge is up to you. Banished gives you access to all the buildings right up front, only gating them behind required quantities of the basic building materials. You can have your people farming, fishing, herding, hunting, gathering, brewing, trading, and so on in just a few years, and then aside from the seeds and livestock you have to trade for, you'll have seen everything. From that point on the challenge is entirely in balancing your resources as your village expands indefinitely. The margins get thinner and thinner and curveballs like nomads joining your community en masse can throw off your plans, but the basic rules of expansion do not change.The magic of the game is that you'll play for a few hours, set up a perfectly functional town with all the buildings and services, put it down... and then find yourself coming back to expand again and again. The quaint graphics and simple mechanics make it a delight to simply keep building out further and further. There are no scenarios or campaigns, just you and the random maps to fill, and even without anything pushing you forward to fill them you might find yourself inclined to do just that. Banished ended up being one of the more addictive city builders I've played, making up for simplicity with more than enough charm.			"

												So, I now have about 100 hours in to this game. I've played multiple games, with my best reaching a population of approx 900 people before the wheels fell off. I've played easy, medium and hard. I've read all of the guides  on the wiki, the forums, and even Reddit. I really, really wanted to love this game. I waited for it to come out for what felt like *ages*, stalking this guy's FB page for update info. And I am just so sad that I can't love it.Why? The inconsistencies. I am a creature of habit. I place all my buildings  in a predictable pattern, and I'm a hoarder by nature so I'm very careful about pathing to ensure maximum efficiency of the workers. And yet, despite my consistency in behavior and detail, there is no consistency in output. In one game, 2 woodcutters will provide enough firewood for a population of 120 with firewood to spare. In another game, 14 woodcutters cannot keep the same population afloat, despite over 4k backlog in wood. Woodcutters placed directly beside stockpile containing 2k logs. Woodcutter (A) will cut 42 logs in a season, while Woodcutter (B) will cut 298 logs in the same season, and Woodcutter (C) might cut 3 logs that season. All three are educated, and are situated in homes very close by. Their food is supplied by the gatherer and hunter that are always paired with foresters on my maps. They want for nothing, but they do not work. This is a problem that I find repeatedly throughout the game. You want a field of about 40x40 cleared, so you free up  100 or so laborers, prioritize that field and wait for them to get to work! And you wait.... and you wait.... and you wait. You re-prioritize the field. You de-select everything else on the map for clearing. You wait..... 8 seasons have passed, and your field is not cleared. 8 seasons of 100 laborers that could have been doing any number of other things. This is a randomly occurring problem within the game. You could go 50 seasons without a hitch, before you get a spike of random unproductiveness. Whole fields can produce less than 50 food per year, woodcutters that just dont show up for work, miners that idle the entire season away in the Cemetary. Oh! And for funsies, when you get a disease outbreak, and the diseased persons refuse to go to any of your multiple, fully staffed hospitals for treatment! They just wander the map, going about their business like Typhoid Mary from Hell. Every town center I make gets a hospital, and the sick folks generally find their way to them in short order. However, every now and then, you will get a Typhoid Mary who will inflict their disease on 100+ of your population before they finally die. Yeah, inconsistent.  "

												Banished is a city-building game with a heavy focus on survival. From humble beginnings - just a few families exiled from their past lives and a handful of supplies - you will have the opportunity to build up a thriving community.While Banished has all the footprints of a typical city-building game, it sets itself apart from the rest by including a diverse pool of resources to manage, each with impacts on your villagers’ happiness, health, and productivity. Each citizen adds to your total consumption, meaning you cannot afford to be complacent; you must always be planning ahead lest famine or disease wipe out most of your population. You must also manage your labor force (working adults), and should do so as efficiently as possible in order to minimize their struggle to survive. The setting and the art-style compliment the survival theme quite well. There is never any doubt that you are building a barebones medieval-era town - all the buildings are made from wood and stone and the whole thing feels very quaint. The seasons change, which has both a visual effect as well as creating a growth cycle for plants and crops (can’t farm during the winter!). As the years progress, your population ages, has children, and eventually passes away leaving the newer generations to repeat the circle of life... that is if they haven’t suffered any misfortunes along the way. Merchants will periodically visit and trade crop seeds, farm animals, and all kinds of goods once you’ve built a trading post. Wandering nomads may choose to settle in your town if you allow them. There is a healthy variety of crops and buildings, and there is also Workshop/mod support. Although the modkit for Banished is only fresh out of beta, there is already a significant amount of additional content that improves the base game immensely. For example, the Colonial Charter mod provides a complete overhaul of the game with tons of new resources, buildings, and production chains.If city-building games are something you enjoy, I cannot recommend Banished enough. This was one of my most anticipated releases of 2014 and it has definitely lived up to my expectations (and then some). A word of caution though, there are many hardships ahead; this is in no way an ""easy"" game.

												After accidentally closing my eyes to blink while tasking my first batch of villagers, I opened them to find everyone dead from starvation except five children. Thankfully there were enough cabbages in storage for them to survive for two years until they grew up. After tasking them as fishermen on a nearby river I learned fishermen can consistently fish about three fish a year, enough to sustain almost 0.000001% of my population. As my village began to grow once more I felt the shattered fragments of my soul beginning to piece themselves back together. However, six fishermen in a village of seven people was not enough, and I quickly learned this as I watched all my young adults starve once more. I still had two people left. As they progressively had more and more sex and my incestual village was for the third time repopulated I knew what I had to do. Farms were the only way out. Now I have a monopoly on the cabbage industry, and even now my 4000 cabbages each harvest is not enough to sustain my village of twenty people. As I watch those I love slowly starve, I can't help but remind myself through the many tears that flood my room what a great game banished is. 10/10 would starve the incestual children again.			"

												I really love this game, the whole experience was very enjoyable while playing, and it actually proved to be quite a challenge, however....... I've played for 10 hours and I've basically seen everything this game has to offer, I've maintained a population of around 190 people, built all the buildings in the game, expanded a far distance across a large map, and kept my whole population 4.5/5 happy and healthy for the entire duration of my playtime, the only thing left me to do is just build more houses.... in turn building more food->wood->woodcutter infrastructures to help maintain this. While I really enjoyed this game, the graphics, the design, the art, the mechanics, the game is extremely short and lacking in more... I don't know stuff. I know that it is only a 1 man team, and for that He's done something amazing. I just can't help but feel this game could be one of the best city-building games out there, if there were more things to do, maybe an advancement in technology (not like, pewpew-lazers), or perhaps the option to build larger houses, or more entertainment facilities, or just more buildings in general. Basically the game turned into the same, repeat infrastructure too fast and to soon in, where-as similiar games had a lot more longevity to them, such as Anno 2070 just to put as an example.In closing, I would say this game was really fun to play, I am just saddened that it has nothing left to offer me after only 10 hours of play, I really want to play more, but there is literally nothing to do, just build more wood gatherers, and more food... and then more woodcutters to supply the demand, thats it........ It's too easy to keep your people happy/healthy and in turn disaters came few and far between, and once you get into the big population numbers random deaths don't have any impact when your playing around with a standing work force of 15-20 larbourers at any given time.Regards "

												If you want to see how we, as a population, might fare into the future, then take a look ""back"" at Banished. Set in the era of middle ages/horse and cart/pilgrims this is a very pretty game with a very simple to learn playstyle. There are no goals except for achievements and it's what makes this fascinating.A plodding ""city"" builder with a balancing act like no other. The skills, the knowledge and the subtle finesse needed to make a city survive past a few hundred is nothing short of a miracle on some maps. Errors in planning are usually not detected until well into a game and are usually the result of something you did a long time ago. You will then either suffer ""Aha"" moments or pound your keyboard in frustration when you realise what you were *supposed* to do. From hero to zero in minutes. The balance in this is superb. Everything suffers cause and effect. Too many sheep creating too much wool that fills the barns that prevents the harvest that causes the people to starve is just one example. SO just build more barns yeah? Then wood becomes scarce and the toolmaker runs out. So no tools are made and you run out and nobody can do anything. Including the toolmaker! Scrambling around grabbing every bit of iron and wood to make tools so you can harvest so the people don't starve. Or freeze to death!A wicked dev made this and he's a clever one. I've spent a long time looking for those little exploits that circumvents game logic and give me an ""I win"" button but I can't find one. Even the data that might give you clues to what is going wrong (or right) is cleverly hidden despite appearing to have lots of data at your disposal.  After many hours of losing your perfect cities, again and again, you will understand what I mean here. Not that it matters. There is an evil monster lurking in the background of every game. Meet ""The Cascade"". It's that horrible nagging doubt in the back of your mind that the map you've just spent hours, even days on,  is doomed. Death for all is inevitable.  You *know* something is not right and you try to overcompensate but you cause supply problems elsewhere and create even more problems.And your whole town dies. Quickly.As your cemetary fills up, you madly juggle the myriad of tasks each citizen must undertake until... NO... he/she died too!!  After the cascade crash of most of population, you may be left with enough to regrow but be careful now. You need to make the corrections to prevent it happening again. Can you? Will you?You won't.  You will reseed another map and start all over again, ever the wiser. ""I'll put the farms over there and the fishing huts here and the market here and the mine there and the church here and.... and.... and.....""You'll die anyway. It's unavoidable. It's inevitable.  Unsustainable growth will kill you. Every time. A lesson for us all perhaps?gg9/10PS: A few more hours after writing this review I finally pulled the 900 citizens achievement. As a pundit who cried foul and ""it's full of bugs"" the first few days of playing, take heart all who play her. She can be ""beaten"" but she's a tough queen to satiate.			"

												This is my dream strategy citybuilder, with the mods. Alone, it is pretty great still, but there is a huge community that adds so much more to the game, and is encouraged by the creators of the game! The developers of the game even give example mods for you to download, use and examine so that you can make your own mods for the game! On it's own, howerver, the game is still great. I recommend learning to play it first without the mods so you can see what sort of mods would suit you best. Personally, I have found the aging mods the most useful, and the ""pick me up"" mods for the fields, so that when the farmers work the fields, they make a quick first pass to put the produce into containers, then a slower second pass to put the foodstock into storage. It has saved whole fields from suddenly harsh winters! Pointers for starting out: First build a gathering hut, then within circle distance, place a forester shack. Then place one more gathering hut on the opposite side of the forester's shack, as far from the original gathering hut as you can, but within the circle of the forester's shack. Two workers per hut, and one forester. This will take care of food, and firewood/building supplies. (the forester will cut down and replant trees that shelter the food that gatherers pick up) Then build the woodcutter and put in one worker. This should keep you in good with food and firewood for a bit, but be sure to build them a place to live in, either a Boarding House or no more than two to three houses. Once you feel a bit more stable again with food, build a school, because the more educated your workers are, the more they can gather and produce. Also DON'T go too long without a blacksmith and tailor, so that your people can continue to work and be protected from the elements. A herbalist should also come early, so that the herbs can keep your people healthy.Fields for crops should only come after you are short on land and space for gatherers and fishers, since they need to be a distance away from each other. Farming should not be bothered with early in the game; it consumes a great number of workers, and it can all be for naught if your field suddenly dies in an early winter or from a sudden disease that ruins your crop.As for iron, coal, and stone; gather all you can around your little village. Once your people have to travel too far to gather more however, it is time to build mines and stone pits. If your people have ""Warm Coats"" and are plentiful on food, they can travel a larger distance with little risk to their health. In any case, this is the Strategy Citybuilding game I have always dreamed of. Get it and enjoy!			"

												Finally decided to write a review for this game as it's on sale. The developer deserves all the praises he can get.AAA quality game under 300 mb. Reminds of good ol' days of PC gaming when hardcore coders not artists / modders used to make games. Yes its true that 'reinventing the wheel' is waste of resources. But it doesn't mean to forcefully fit the same wheel on every cart/car regardless of its purpose and size. When game are made from scratch with less reliance on generic ready made engines or recycled tools and more under the hood coding, they require less resources and run blazingly fast even on old hardware.And that is the first thing you will notice with Banished. You can feel the engine underneath while playing. It feels like you just need to press a hidden button to see everything in code Matrix style. It reminds me of the days playing Quake 3 Arena.  Very raw yet very crispy.Banished is developed by a lone coder so it doesn't have detailed tutorials, introductory videos and all other sorts of  babysitting that gamers of today have gotten used to. But for someone like me that just adds to its appeal of truly open ended sandbox game. The difficulty I had to stop letting my village starved to death was the best part of the game. And I think that is how the game should be played. Stop reading guides and experiment on your own. Because that is what the game is all about. There is no specific objectives in the game. How city building games should be. The way they are meant to be played.Having said that, the game doesn't have a huge scope like that of Total War or Civilization games. So without multiplayer, it's not a game that you can keep on playing forever. So don't rush it. Enjoy the game and try different things.This game will appeal to you if you are a gamer who likes to explore, experiment, decorate and set your own objectives. But if you are someone who likes hand holding, being told what to do while following scripted sequences one after another with specific objectives to accomplish than look elsewhere.Highly recommended!

												I was quite interested when I got the game on sale, and my hopes were dashed fairly quickly, even after playing as much as I did on it, hoping it would get better, or something would kick in and start working right.Graphics are fairly decent (on a decent system it's quite lovly to look at)The game mechanics to play it are fair (simple enough, click here drag there, collect resources, click on building sellector, and make them build the structure)As a city builder, it lacks in content in so many ways, upgrade wooded to stone houses. watch the people run around aimlessly. build a city hall to get nice graphs and charts that are supposed to deal with the city. No real upgrades for the buildings, and even the stone houses burn to a cinder, costing lots of resources to even build it.The Ai never amounted to anything, as the people moved in and out of buildings often times leaving an age 10 by themselves, or an age 60, even tho there are more than enough spaces to support 15 people. And they won't let anyone join them. The long house actually prevents the people from having children, tho in the Nordic times, The Vikings only lived in longhouses, raised the children as a community.Wells on every corner, when a fire breaks out, and no one bothers to draw water and even try to put the fires out.No in game rewards for accomplishing anything at all, make the people happy, keep them happy, eventually they all starve to death, cause they can't do anything after building on your city for so long.Farmers/hunter/gathers all starve cause they refuse to eat the food they are carriing when hungry, rather they go to the storage bin, unload, walk around and starve before going back to grab food to take home.Even after forcing specific people into particular homes close to where they are supposed to work and store food, after a short time, they had moved, and their job description changes on it's own.schools in the game are pointless, as they are supposed to be educated, yet they do not act like they are.Hospitals in game are useless, sickness happens, and they all refuse to go see the doctor.Up till those points the game is relaxing and lazy for the most part, tho leaves lots open. Sure, your people have been bannished, from where, and why? Why does the incomming trader always insist on charging exortionist prices for an item? And why does the trader always come in on a boat? Where is the caravan traders? How does my chicken farmer get trampled to death? (must of just laid down with a bucket of grain on the other side, then as the chickens past, must of molted and dropped feathers in their mouth, but then that would be suffocation, not trampling... meh) Where are the wild animals that randomly attack the villagers that stray too far away? Or the child that wanders too close to the stream that drowns, cause the parents don't teach their child to swim? Passing down of knowlage from elder to child, as in the days of old? You were born and taught a craft by your parents in the eura the game is supposed to be set in.At $5.00 this base game would be worth getting, for it's simplistic laziness, more than that, I would consider to be a waist of time and money. After waiting a year and a half for some sort of steam update, (to fix the bugs) and none happening, I finally removed it from my system. For the listed price, it is not worth paying for, even on sale it's not that great.If you want true fixes, you have to turn to the modding community. Where their hard work and effort makes the game more enjoyable. (not even going to bother, as the maker of the game didn't even try do it themself)Knowing my post is negative, chances are it will be voted unhelpfull into oblivion... Would mention other games that the dev(s) are actually updating their product through steam even long after actual release dates.			"

												Honestly as someone who has sunk WAY too many hours in to this game my honest opinion is that if you're looking for as realistic a simulation of a built from scratch city builder than this it the game. The fact that instead of the generic cookie cutter city builder type game which largely revolves around money as the sole resource and currency of the game, the element of having to make sure you produce actual resources to support a community instead of just cash is one of my favorite features of the game.They've put a lot of work in to this game since I initially bought it many moons ago when getting the Tenure achievement was nigh on impossible due to either A) crashing and losing your save on a semi regular basis after a certain point B) horrific priority designation on villagers who would always die to starvation every year because they lived on the complete other side of the map and despite passing barns and markets a plenty did not stop for food (I think I went hoarse once actually screaming at them because I lost like 60 in one winter alone) or C) you got blocked by resource production and trade capability in the tools area since after a certain point it's easier just to trade for tools rather than produce them and the trading posts were severly undercapped from where they needed to be and are now. Now all those things have been fixed and I just need to sit down and get the last couple achievments....Negatives I would have to say are the fact that population growth can be a royal pain and a half. Either you've for villagers not popping out babies fast enough and suddenly you've got only about 40 students when you've been operating for the last two hours with twelve fully loaded school houses. Or you can so easily overcompensate and just mass spam houses to the point where not long from then you've got a baby boom on your hands and whereas you once had over 100K food in every category you're now frantically trading with every merchant you can to just simply bulk up food reserves to survive again. It's a tricky balance to maintain as it's easy to forget until it's too late, but if you can master it then you'll thrive.Overall a game well worth the price and the time spent playing it.			"

												Banished is what many city/village building games wish they could be when they grow up. No barbarians screaming at the gates, not a zombie in sight, just good solid building. Remember when you paid $60 for Simcity and EA kicked you in the junk? This is the exact opposite of that.It's an amazingly fun and intense game. Some people have described it as being ""zen"" to which I disagree to a point. It gives the illusion of being peaceful, until it stabs you in the back. The game is stressful, the game is hard, the game will make you laugh and it will make you cry. You will build up a large, bustling, seemingly succesfull town only for a small disaster to bring your whole population to it's knees. But when you do succeed, it is oh so satisfying.This is the city builder you've been waiting for.			"

												It's a city building game mixed with survival.In Banished just getting your town/village up to around 100 people and making sure no one is dying from some sort of plague or hunger is an achievement in it self.Every wrong thing you do, the game will punish you ; expand to fast, your people will die from hunger, expand to slowly , your people will die out from old age, focuse to much on mining and certain materials, suddenly you're lacking everything else and die, oh you're doing good ? Well here have a tornado that will kill half of your people, it's a game that keeps kicking you in the balls but instead of complaining you just ask for more.It's addictive , it's fun, it's challenging,it's hard and it's the best city building game iv'e played and it was all made by a single guy.Pick this straight up if you like city building games, don't even wait for a sale, just get it now.

												So according to the sychophants on the forum, this game is now ""complete"". Let me tell you what you do in it:-Get banished from the kingdom of ?????? because you and the rest of the inhabitants did ????????-Grow crops-Dig giant holes in the ground-Dig giant implied holes in the side of a mountain-Have a family of two hog the first and only house in the village so far while everyone else freezes outside-Occasionally have a trader row (just row. there's no land trade to speak of so even if you're in a relatively flat area where you'd expect caravans you just get one ♥♥♥♥ in a row boat) and try to barter some beans with you-Make a church so the already insanely happy people are even happier-Make a tavern so the already insanely happy people are even happier, and drunk-Make a hospital so everyone doesn't die from the chicken pox or something-Make a town hall so you can get pretty graphs and detailed accounts on how many potatoes Joe Blow has stuffed in his kitchen cupboardAnd, well, that's pretty much it. Nothing wrong with that. It's a great start and I do enjoy what little there is. My issue comes with the ""completed"" status and the fact I've seen maybe one update since I bought the game several months ago (which as far as I can tell was mostly just bugfixes). There's simply not enough game here.Like I said, it's fun. I won't deny I enjoy watching my little lemming men run around, chop trees, and build roads so straight and villages so organized it'd send the Romans into a fit of envy. I'm just left wondering ""what about all the other stuff?"" Where are the wild animals that tear lonely loggers to shreds if they venture too far from town? The bandits and barbarians who threaten to raze the city if they don't get a tribute of food? As far as I can tell getting banished from ?????? for ?????? (It really doesn't fill you in on any of this. I'm sure someone will pass it off as ""leaving it up to the player"" but anyone with any idea of how to write things can tell you that's lazy writing) was more of a blessing than a curse, because if you don't make outright stupid decisions your village will be flourishing in a matter of years, and there's just not enough to threaten that prosperity. The winters mean less and less as your wooden buildings are turned to stone and your leather coats are lined with the wool from the sheep you traded six trillion beans for. Outbreaks are handled quickly and efficiently by the magical witch doctor that just rubs some plants on the afflicted's face until they're suddenly better. The only thing that will eventually theoretically threaten your village (assuming you play this long before getting bored) is running out of room for graveyards from all the people that eventually die from old age, and I'm sure even that could be avoided by keeping everyone happy enough they don't care Old Man Jenkins's carcass was thrown into the woods for the nonexistent wolves to tear apart.I'm not really angry. I'm just disappointed. There's too little game here where there should be, and I'm finding myself questioning the legitimacy of its ""completedness"". I'm sure I'll be Not Helpfulled into oblivion by the raving drones that insist it was money well spent and can't take a lick of criticism, but all I can say is welcome to the reviews section, kids.

												Firstly, Banished is amazing. It blends city building and survival well... a little too well. Well enough for any goal to merge into one. This makes long playthroughs boring for there are barely any goals to achieve beyond building up your population, feeding your population, surviving a disaster or two, rinse, repeat. If the game were to have a larger array of feature then it'd be even better. So I give it a 75/100.My ideas on how the game can be improved--add another entity other than yourself in the world. It's a good single player game but it gets a little lonely. Maybe add various NPCs to the game. -NPC houses, towns, settlements etc. Places where the player has to connect a path to so that an exchange can be made. Maybe have specialastions varying from a farming town (sells crops over a period of a year for tools), mining town (sells iron and stone for food and other items) and a lumber town (sells wood and firewood for tools and food).-NPC raiders or equal threat. A disaster event: a group of hostiles temporarily take over your town, slowly draining 50% of your food. To get rid of you must build a police station of sorts and train militia to protect your town. After they have been defeated they have a lower percentage of coming back to your town, until the threat equals 0.-Multiplayer- build a seperate towns in seperate areas of a MASSIVE map. To trade, you either must build a trade port and assign people to be merchants and fill boats with materials, or build a road to their town and assign people to be caravans to begin trade. Caravans should have a chance of being raided so (from earlier) the police should be able to protect it.Those are my ideas, if anyone thinks this should be in the game then why not send messeges to the creater to get this in.

												It's fun for about the first 10 hours of gameplay. If you think the price is fine for that then go ahead and buy it!Said that the problem is there not much replayability. After you learn how to keep growing in a sustainable way without starving to death, it's all the same and if you start over it's basically repeating the same techniques. That's where it gets boring, once you get there there is not much else to do, that's it's only mechanic.Other than that sometimes a villager is an idiot that decides to take a 3 month journey to collect some wood and ends up dying in the cold, and there's nothing you can do about it.

												I was lucky enough to be able to help Luke out by testing Banished quite a bit over the last couple of months.  Full disclosure I used to work with Luke.That being said, Banished is a lot of fun.  It's a tremendous balancing act, managing your town's growth while harvesting resources and not getting yourself stretched too thin.  As other reviewers have seen, you can cross the tipping point quickly and go from thriving town to ghost town in a matter of minutes.  In every game I played I always felt like I was on the razor's edge between success and failure and that my every action meaningfully tipped the scales.  It's fun theorizing about different strategies, from being heavily into farming or trying for one of the very difficult achievements.  The many layers to the game kept me coming back.  I find myself wanting to see if I can progress any further with my next town, or if I'm doomed to make the same mistakes that have brought my previous towns down.  Congrats Luke for making an oustanding game.  I'm happy I've gotten to see your vision here and I'm unbelievably impressed with what you were able to accomplish.			"

												I played this game for hundreds of hours on GOG before getting it on Steam as well.Still one of the best horror survival building games. Your villagers will die of smallpox, starve to death, freeze to death, get crushed by rocks and become homeless after half the village has burned down. However once you learn the basic formula of the game, it actually becomes rather easy. and you can get a bit more creative with mods and design/decoration. However you always need to pay attention since anything from a tool crisis to a baby boom can send your village into a death spiral. There are tons of mods for this game, but I'd recommend playing it through without mods at least a couple of times first.No new features are being added to this game, so it's pretty much ""done"" at this point, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. What you see is what you get.			"

												Banished is one of those games that you constantly think about.  After an unsuccessful foray into the world you only think about how you could have improved the civilization further.  I prefer to play my games slowly, at my own pace and this allowed me to watch and observe my banished people. Eventually, I built a family tree, working from the Adam & Eve setting, learning that the people of banished are not afraid of incest.  They grew into an enormous community, watching as they developed, became smarter and eventually operated with little help from me, this was very rewarding.  This game is exactly how I like my simulations, slow, steady and incestuous.			"

												I made an early review of this game and once I put a lot of hours in, it got really boring. I wish there was a Maybe recommend button, but for now I feel it just needs more substance.  The game is hard and unforgiving. Its not a bad thing at all, once you fail a lot you start to learn it and eventually it just becomes: I need more houses, now I need more food, now I need more firewood, now I need more schools, now I need more storage, now I need a new mine, now I need more house rinse and repeat. It doesn't take long to build everything possible, have a trade market full of extra goods and you have bought all the livestock and seed types and have no reason to trade anymore. In the description it boasts of no ""tech trees"" ect, but its really what it needs. Something to work towards.  A way to upgrade buildings, research new things, just some sort of driving force other than sitting there watching people spit out babies and build more of the same building to accommodate your growing population.  the game is a really cool idea, but doesn't have enough depth.  I understand one guy made this and that is more so why I bought it than anything, he deserves it for all the hard work, but I hope in the future there becomes more to do in the game.			"

												Like it, but to be honest, once the mechanic is understood and you take the necesary actions to support the population, there is nothing else to do but to replicate what you already have to have more. This game needs to have any sort of advance, progression, right now, there is none. Mods just add more color to the game, but won't change the dinamic. Very nice concept, lovely music, fastest speed isn't fast enough to my taste, but very limited. After 2 hours (when you grasped the mechanics) you will find yourself thinking ""now what?""			"

												Banished is a city-building strategy game developed and published by Shining Rock Software LLC. It was released in February 2014. In Banished, you control a group of individuals that want to start a new life by developing a new city. You develop your city by increasing your population, gathering resources, and constructing buildings. The game embraces simplicity as trade is the primary currency and not money. This review will cover the gameplay, the integrated Steam Workshop, and the performance and graphics. Banished presents strong and complex gameplay as game mechanics heavily alter the game. You will learn some mechanics as you play the game whereas other mechanics such as average health and average happiness are presented on the UI. For instance, average health represents an average of all your citizens health. The worse health your city has the less productive they are and the higher chance they have of dying. Furthermore, couple worse average health with the dynamic weather seasons and expect them not to be productive in Winter. As you continuously learn the game you will learn how to strategise and manage your city while incorporating the various game mechanics and the weather seasons, which all seasons have an effect on your city. Other mechanics have long-term implications. For instance, when children turn 10 they can enrol into a school until they turn 17. If they don't enrol you can use them as workers. If they enrol, you cannot use them as workers, but educated citizens will be much more productive long-term compared to uneducated workers. So by and large, these game mechanics emphasis strategy and they showcase the challenging nature of Banished because it is a very difficult game. Also on gameplay, the game incorporates randomly generated maps that have different amounts of water, hills, and so forth. These affect your plans for your city, but there is a very useful and very informative UI that is customisable. It allows you to add different data to your screen which constantly updates. Specifically, if you want to keep your storage house information box on the screen, you can move it to the top left corner. Overall, the game teaches you about strategy, understanding the mechanics and their consequences, and to assist you allows you to customise your screen with informative UI to help you manage. Banished uses Steam Workshop. Briefly, Steam Workshop allows individuals that own the game to tweak it, improve it, and mod it. I will admit for the majority of my play time I used Banished Plus, a large mod that provides more balance to the game by tweaking mechanics to reduce the fast-paced length of the game and increase realism. There are an abundance of other mods that once you download the game will inform you of any compatibility issues, which is a nice and handy tool. I use Banished Plus because I think the vanilla game is basic and fast-paced because there are not many buildings in the game are citizens can be very stupid and lazy. Furthermore, add these with the lack of long-term objectives showcase the need for mods to help improve the behaviour of your citizens and expand the amount of content. Therefore, using mods drastically improved my experience of the game. And as a side note, I generally think the developers should have made DLC to expand the content to give more replayability.  Technically, Shining Rock have excellently optimised this game. I can play it on max settings and achieve a constant 60FPS on x10 speed. Features like the weather system and the large amounts of population usually would hit the game in performance, but for the most part I did not experience that. At 110 population on x10 speed I stayed at 60FPS. At 220 population, I was managing a solid 50FPS with the drop due to a larger city and more population. It is evident the six patches in Banished helped improve the performance of it. Graphically, the game is gorgeous. Buildings and citizens are very detailed and the weather system adds a layer of realism to it.   Conclusion  Banished is a very good game. I love the complex gameplay through the variety of game mechanics and their effects on other mechanics. I absolutely adore the beautiful graphics as the buildings are incredibly detailed, the seasons are highly realistic and the scenery is just superb. Banished has excellent performance as I managed to sustain 60FPS for the majority of my play through. It was only at 200+ population I started to see a small dip in FPS and performance. At USD$19.99, I recommend purchasing Banished because overall, it has high replayability.   Rating  8.5/10  Pros  	- Steam workshop.	- Complex gameplay through the various game mechanics.	- Beautiful graphics.	- Excellent performance.	- Weather system. 	- UI.  Cons  	- Lack of content.	- No long-term objective.	- The disappointing fundamentals in the vanilla game.If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

												My first expirence in the game:CockValley, Winter, Year 9It was winter, worse than anyone had witnessed since their exile.  The townsfolk of CockValley were freezing in their homes, shivering to what little warmth that dwindled in the flames, its embers slowly fading.  Food storages were running low fast, eventually the fishermen had to abandon their posts.  While there was much to do, as per usual, the denizens were powerless against the elements and began to soccum to their weariness.  Suddenly Aris fell, everyone suspected little considering her ripe old age.  Than another fell, and another, and another.  Eventually the children began to die out as well.The bewildering diety was powerless against the sudden infliction.  All he could hear was the constant echoes of his worshiper's dying breaths, than, nothing.  In the silence the diety scurried through the homes, hoping to find survivers.  He exhaled a sigh of relief, he found two survivors.  He was hoping that, by some miracle, he may at least be able to repopulate the desolate village.  But to his horror, he became paralyzed by a terrible truth.  The last two survivors were 20 year old men.  Powerless, he admited defeat and surrendered himself to fate.  He dubbed them Adam and Steve, and watched as they spent their final days in isolation.10/10			"

												I think that it may be difficult to play initially since there is a lot to consider if you dont want your entire population to die of and it is fun to try and work this out. But one you get to a point where you figure out how to manage your resources and anticipate food shortage, disease and so on, it is a little repetitive and making your city bigger is really not a problem. There are expansion mods that will revive the game until you get a hold of that too. It does take a lot of hours to get to that point, so it will entertain you for quite a while - and in general with building games, this feeling of repetitive action is normal  once you know how to do it ""right"". But that being said it is still one of my favorite building games and I think by now I have tried most of them. I tend to like the games were warfare plays a very small part best, and if you do too, and are a fan of builing and resource strategy, you will like it.			"

												I wish there was an option between thumbs up and thumbs down, because this game hit the middle ground ""eh, it's alright"" for me. Banished is an ok game, but it really doesn't feel finished! Once you get over the hump of mid-game and dedicate 90% of your workforce to collecting food, there's not much else to see. I played my first few games slow and steady and didn't have much trouble amassing a decent number of people, building all the available buildings, setting up my neighborhoods and work districts... and then I would get bored halfway through upgrading the houses to stone, because that's all that was left for me to do. I tried playing a little faster (and looser with the food) and it just dragged the experience out, but didn't actually add any more ""fun"" to the experience. If there was some sort of combat mechanics, or if there were threats other than weather and starvation, maybe my final opinion would be different. As it is, Banished is a decent town building simulator that can hold your attention for 20-30 hours. After that, you've seen and done it all. There's just not enough different options!			"

This game is simultaneously extremely engaging, intense, yet calming. It's the best way to wind down for me. And for $20 you'd be crazy not to buy this game.			"

 First sorry for my english.     Sotto la recensione in italiano. Banished is a indie city builder title , developed by one person in C ++, which the goal is to survive your people as much as possible and the only enemy is nature; no military part so essential is the control of resources and everything is accessible from the beginning.Pros Support's BanishedKit mod and steam workshopExtremely reasonable system requirementsAffordable priceAmateur translation in many languagesGood achievementsLightweight downloadRelaxingCured in the sounds and in the interfaceAcceptable loading timesSufficiently comprehensive optionsOriginal approachNice graphicsDurable enough for fansFree of major bugsAtmosphere that capturesDisasters and your decisions affect the life or deathSandbox elements excellentCons They have stopped adding contentLack's steam cardsNo cloud savingNo in-depth tutorialToo much micromanagementMusic limitedWith no mod feels the lack of contentIt gives the impression that he had not expressed a 100% of potentiality of the gameGameplay doesn't have long-term goalsLack realism in  in mechanic'sNo missions or campaignsCan be frustrating (game has hardcore approach)No demo or trialNotes  Some crashes (when adding mod)Mac and Linux support coming soonNo multiplayerThere is a DRM free version on other platformsIn conclusion banished is a City Builder with fantastic atmosphere, it easily captures, but it is difficult to master; the mods help a lot to fill the gaps; you have to dedicate time and attention and in return pays you back with good fun. The only flaw is that the mechanics are limited. It would been perfect with the addition of a military component and increasing the realism, but that's another story ...I would absolutely recommend, but lacks the X factor to make it perfect.It's a game that request initially attempts and experience, not recommended for casual players. My advice: search on internet information before you buy it,the micro-management is not always good; It requires many hours for be fun.Finally to be noted that when the population reaches a high number you notice slowdowns and optimization problems.graphic 7sound 7longevity 8gameplay 7.5Vote 7.5 / 10 with mod rating 8/10Purchase price recommended under $ 5Mod recommended:""DC: New Frontier"" (always check the latest version because they constantly change name as the mod of the ""DC"" series, the game improves in all main areas, adding new buildings and resources).FANTARMA COMMUNITY

												Fun for the first 5 hours, but beyond that point it's mostly just a frustrating slog - build a town, figure out that you forgot to do something and it has doomed everybody, watch them all die, then start again from scratch, over and over until you learn how to keep these lemmings from killing themselves. The most frustrating part by far is your citizens' obsession with firewood - it's so easy to run out of it, and if you do run out,  it sends you into a death spiral. People start buring coal instead, which means you're no longer able to make Steel Tools, then everybody's productivity gets cut in half because there's a shortage of tools, then a bunch of people die from starvation, but because there are now so many empty houses, the survivors breed like rabbits and your city is flooded with hungry children that can't work.The worst part is that there's no way to stop them from switching to coal. People will starve without the slightest objection even if they're currently tending an orchard full of fruit, but if they get a little cold, they'll happily destroy your entire supply chain and doom your civilization just for a few extra minutes of warmth.

												Banished is a strange game. It has a great aesthetic - especially in the winter - that is compelling enough to keep you coming back for more. There's nothing quite like the sight of your little village covered in a blanket of snow, smoke billowing  out of every chimney. Aesthetic, however, isn't really enough to hold your focus for too long. Other reviews go into great detail about what you need to do to succeed but it can be summed up in two parts - gather resources and breed. At first this can be a fun balancing act to play out. Too much breeding and you're resources will start to dry up fast, too little and you'll struggle to get those resources quick enough to sustain your population much less grow it. Once you find the happy medium that works for your village you can plug along fairly well, at least for a while. Banished is big on throwing natural disasters at you - or at least it was for me. In three consecutive playthroughs I had things moving along wonderfully when a tornado would touch down and level my town. My population was decimated and despite my best efforts all three towns eventually died out. Overall, that's the issue with Banished. It's not so much a city builder so much as it's a city survival game. The AI doesn't help, either, as citizens of your town can be frustratingly foolish. More than once I watched a citizen wander into the forest looking for food only to starve to death out in the wilderness when there was a surplus of food sitting in the barn for them. An even worse example for you: I once had a town starve to death despite it being flushed with productive farms. Over half of my population were farmers, herdsman, and fishermen and they still somehow found a way to starve to death, all of them. There's nothing more bleak and yet ironic than watching a farmer harvest his crops, the only person residing in a town of once over 50, slowly starving to death. And rest assured, the farmer died just like all of his friends and family, starving to death in the middle of his field.Throw a tornado or fire in on top of that, leveling a perfectly good town in its prime, and the game can become painfully frustrating. Banished is not a bad game but like most of the reviews on here, I'll tell you the truth - there's not a lot to it. You can build a sprawling metropolis if you want but there's nothing to do with it. There's no end-game, nothing to strive for beyond trying to surive as long as possible. You can't go out and get revenge on the town that kicked out your founders or even interact with other villages. Your only contact to the outside world are solitary traders, the only evidence of life outside of your village. This game could be easily be cast as settling another planet for the first time, it's that empty. If you can get it on sale for cheap, buy it. It is fun at first and, like I said, can be beautiful in a quaint, colonial kind of way. Just understand that after a while it will lose its spice.			"

												Banished is a fantastic game, a city-building type focused primarily on survival. Your main goal is to expand your town and grow your population and most of the challenge is based on when and how to do it. There are no battles, your only enemies are natural disasters and diseases. One of the things that is great about Banished is that its AI works on individual levels. Every person in your town is an entity on its own. They are born, grow up, get married, grow old and die, in a very convincing simulated life. There are about 20 professions the townspeople can be assigned to and every one of them is important to the town as a whole. On the downside, there aren't much to do in the endgame but community mods can keep things fresh for a new run.			"

												Banished is a game that was good as a base game.  It's challenging and there is a lot of different strategies that you can try to help your settlement live.  Where the game really shines is some of the mods that people have created for the game.  Colonial Charter has made in-depth mods that add a TON of content to the game.  As of right now, I'm building a nearly 100% over water dock town.  I have almost 200 citizens in it and everyone is happy. If you enjoy building strategy games, I highly suggest this game to you.  Once you get a hang of the base game, head over to the workshop to add some mods to it.  It's almost like playing a whole new game. "

												tl;dr - Banished is a decently fun city builder/simulator that's held back by random bugs and shoddy AI. Getting the game for ~$6 (USD) off a trader, I felt I got my money's worth at the ten hour mark, but I can tell right now that this isn't something I can come back to time after time, or even in a few months when something else will have my attention. Just about everything in this game screams mediocrity, but it's a new(ish) game in a somewhat dead genre so, if this is something you find appealing but are on the fence, I say grab it at a steep discount (ten dollars is too much). You'll have some fun and for a few bucks you just can't go wrong. The reason I don't recommend the game is, when faced with the full asking price, the game's issues are too glaring for me to conscionably recommend. At the current ten dollar sale price as of me writing this review, I say you're far better off grabbing one of the Impressions Games classics off GOG. I first bought Pharoah with money I got for Christmas when I was nine years old, and I still boot that game up from time to time. It's disappointing to see issues present in Banished that weren't present in a game released 15 years ago and weighing in at 490 MB (with a content-packed expansion/spin-off game). The inability to give instructions to a specific villager was beyond frustrating in a modern game, and the random idling is off the charts. All of these games have citizen idling, but I've never seen it to such an extent, even on the easy setting, clueing you in that it's an issue with the design. It's terrible to be expanding your population, with your food supply being constrained as a result, only to have people starve because your workers suddenly decide that they've had enough of harvesting, leaving upwards of 25% of your crop to rot. What's more is the remarkable inconsistence with food output, particularly if you don't mouse over a particular area for a little while. I'm decently positive the game simulates items not in view at a different speed than the one you've set, causing obvious issues if you don't constantly observe your entire city. But oftentimes, there's simply nothing to be done, your villagers plant a pumpkin patch, one of the quickest farms in the game and one that often is harvested before even the start of autumn, only this time for them to never finish planting the field for some unknown reason. Compounding this is the fact they may or may not get the crops in time before winter, regardless of what you do, where the storage buildings are located, or when harvest begins.As I said, I enjoy this game, but I simply can't believe the developers would decide such a bare-bones (only two map styles!), buggy and downright flawed game was ready for release. Do yourself the favor and skip this unless there's a heavy discount and you're unwilling to play games from the 90s.			"

												Banished is quite a feat for one person to make. The controls are intuitive, the tutorials are thorough enough to get a solid grasp of the mechanics in a very short time, and the game world is quite pretty. There isn't, to my knowledge, anything else like this on the market. The game is worth the money and I do not regret purchasing it. I will continue to play it and hope that the development does not stop here -  that Shining Rock Software continues to improve on and build on the game.However, all of that being said, I am not going to recommend this game to the public overall, nor to my friends. It is very finicky and unforgiving, far too difficult even on the 'easy' setting, repetitive and frustrating. There are no indicators or popups other than 'low storage' messages when something goes very wrong with the economy. You are forced to build up very quickly. If you do not have at least 6 more families by the time year 15-20 rolls around your elders will die off and your population will not be salvagable because you will no longer bring in a fraction of the resources. I found no difference between the three climate settings. Don't get me wrong, I love high difficulty in a game and prefer to play most RTS/survival games on high difficulty for a challenge - but in those cases the enjoyment typically comes after I've finished a long map and have achieved something. There is none of that in Banished because of the mechanics of the priority system and the havoc it wreaks on resource management.At this point I've played around ten maps and I'll give you an example of what I'm talking about; The furthest I got any of them was year 24. I had a stable economy, 6k food to spare, and plenty of resources. My population at that point was around 100. I squared off an area for people to harvest resources from - and my fishermen, farmers and most importantly my blacksmith left their posts to attend to it. Tools, for a short period of time, were not created. It resulted in a drop in productivity, which resulted in less food being gained. When that sort of spiral starts, there is no way to stop it - within five minutes my population had starved itself down to 5.Some more examples:- If you build a building that costs iron and you do not have an excess, you will not be able to make as many/any tools and your people will starve. - Your fishermen will starve even as they fish food for the village, and even if they are the only ones left alive they will refuse to eat the food they are harvesting. I saw this on a hard-valley map; Suffice it to say that it was over by year 3 when all but one villager had starved to death. The last four villagers to die were all fishermen, and these died on the docks gathering fish.- People carrying food to the food barn will starve to death.- Disease will end your population in the span of a few minutes even with stacks of herbs and a hospital.- In order to trade for seeds you need to sell thousands of things in one go. The problem with this is that surpluses are very difficult to get and every resource in the game is useful - sell too much of your iron stockpile and you will have the tool issue. Sell too much of your clothing and you will have people freezing. Sell wood and you have no firewood. Don't even think about selling your food.  Without seeds you lose access to the most dependable way of bringing in food.These are not, in my opinion, elements of difficulty. Difficulty would be better attributed to colder/longer winters, harder soil to farm in, and more harsh starting conditions (less resources). Difficulty should not come in the form of a poor priority system that will send your fisherman out to gather wood instead of a less-needed role (labourer or woodcutter, for example) or in the form of a slight error (ie. building a trading post which uses some of your iron) that destroys an hours-long stable economy to where it can not be recovered. Overall, I give the game 6/10. It has amazing promise and potential, but in my opinion the mechanics are not allowing the game to deliver.			"

Reviews for the Deaf and Hard of HearingFor deaf/hoh gamers, I give this title 8/10!Overall GameplayBanished is a challenging civilization-building/survival game.  Rough around its edges, this game takes some getting used to before going right in to it.  Without looking at a guide to help get started, you will fail a few times before you incrementally start finding success.  I strongly encourage new players to go through the tutorials to grasp the basic mechanics of the game.In truth, the formula for winning this game is relatively simple once you have it down, and it becomes a balancing act of population and resources.  If played right, it is not a significantly active, demanding game, but can be a fun way to pass the time.The information windows are essential for playing this game effectively, but must be enabled when you start playing.  I'm not sure why that is except to provide a clean GUI for a new gamer.  It's a bit of a hassle to enable all of those windows each time you start a new game.It's a simultaneously challenging and easy game, which can turn quickly to frustrate you or plod along predictably.  I rate gameplay a 7/10.General AccessibilityThe game is a top-down style with great control over the camera.  Interaction with the game is in the form of WASD (pan), Q/E (rotate), Page Up/Down (tilt), and Insert/Delete (zoom).  Each function has a mouse alternative.In order to build the facilities your banished people need to survive, you make use of menus on the bottom right of the screen via F1-F9.  Each F key brings up a corresponding sub-menu, where options are selected with the number keys 1-0.  Buildings can be rotated with R and T to fit surrounding areas and to align with roads.All buttons are remappable for mobility-related issues.Subtitles & CaptionsSound options in the game are rather limited.  You can only alter the UI sounds, music, effects, and ambient volume with slider bars.  The absence of subtitles suggests this game has no spoken audio and the absence of captions suggests there are no particular audio cues indicative of emergency situations for you to take care of.Whether there are sounds associated with things or not, there are small popup notifications near your toolbar in the bottom right corner that let you know if a villager has died or people are going hungry/cold.  While these are helpful, I would suggest regularly checking your resource output vs resource consumption and ensuring that you either have sources established for each village or are able to redistribute resources across the entire habitated area.Because I have encountered no situations where I am confused by events in the game (indicating audio-only warnings), I assume there are no major audio-only events.  For that, I give it a 10/10.Chatting/CommunicatingBanished is single-player.No rating. "

												How do I feel about the game Banished? Well let me tell you, I purchased the game during the Steam Summer Sale because I was already curious about this game.   Basically when I started the game I blinked and it was 9 hours later. No lie.  I became addicted instantly.  There are 3 different modes you can play on, easy, medium, hard.  I started out on Easy just so I can get the grasp of the game.   It's not as easy as you would think.   It's a game of survival, in which you have to make sure your citizens are warm, fed, and happy.  I love how buildings and other structures are not instantly built with a click of the button.  You actually have to watch your citizens gather the materials, then start the construction.  I highly recommend this game for the casual player.   Also there are several mods that are available for this game, be sure to check them out.  PS. Pro-tip: I recommend getting your food sources down asap for you citizens, if not your people will go hungry and they will die sadly.			"

												If you're an expert in city builders and comparative games, to build the city just for the sake of building the city (e.g. Factorio) , this might be the perfect relaxation game for you. If you're more in need of a goal and a sense of a reason to why you're building this city, then maybe try something else. Because there is no campaign; no story, or otherwise tale for you to test your city building skills in. There is only the ""New Game"" where the game creates its own seed for you to try your skills at..I started playing this game without this knowledge, and played it as I would any other game - but without any other purpose than to survive as long as I could, the game turned out to be a test to my knowledge within the game even though I had never played the game.. .. It's a great game, as long as you're aware of what game you're pulling yourself into.It's not my kind of game.			"

												The Typical Villager> Make Farm> Plant Orchards> 3 months later, food is scarce> Harvesting crop before village starves> Starves while harvesting, ripe apples all over the place> Whole town Ded10/10Edit: Game just blew up, suddenly popular? Time for a real review.So Banished suddenly got popular, the reason I wrote that ""troll"" review up there is because I browsed /r/banishedmeme a bit too much. Anyway Banished is honestly a extremely great game I love it. To me, it's really worth the buy. The game is now Steam Workshop compatible so now everyone can experiment the community's additions to the game, like for example; the creamery/dairy add on and the fish farm, or decorative tiles, etc. The add-ons from just the Steam Workshop make it a hell of a lot fun then what it was before, and believe me banished is fun. I even got 2 out of 3 of my friends who didn't even know this game to buy it, both stating that its really fun. So, yes, yes it is  worth  the buy!			"

												What a beautiful game! 9/10 would cooperate to survive the winter.There are many reviews for this game already but I felt like writing one because it deserves it. Its well-made tutorial is probably worth the current £4.5 (~$6) price tag by itself.Oh, the apprehension when the ground first turns white and the relief of surviving each of the first few winters. The feeling of hope and comfort when the first merchant boat arrives and you feel you're not isolated from the outside world any more. This game is beautiful and it invites beautiful emotions and feelings when you play it. Amazing.Cons:This is a (very) positive review but there are so many positive reviews out there I'll start with the cons just to contrast (in order of importance):  Not that challenging for the veterans of the genre.   A bit repetitive once your town has enough resources to keep going.  A few very small interface quirks.        Like not having proper diagonal roads or not being able to expand crops/orchards/stockpiles/etc. without removing and rebuilding, or even the possibility of non-rectangular buildings of these types.  Sounds can get annoying (try to keep your camera next to a quarry/mine/blacksmith for a while and a headache is likely).  Information about some mechanics could be more clear.        What comes to mind now is the number of houses needed (do I have people who want a new house?) or which elements impact on the number of babies that are generated. But overall the amount of information is great, see ""pros"" below.Really, that's it. Despite what people say though, this is not really a very challenging game. It's just not very forgiving either, which are different things. It's fairly easy to not screw up completely if you think about what you are doing but the consequences of a screw-up can be harsh.For reference, I'm fairly used to tycoon games and to playing the likes of OpenTTD in very stringent economic settings. After the tutorial I've started my first Banished town with all on Medium difficulty (I thought it'd be a challenge). All went well and smooth, no hiccups, the town is packed with resources and only growing. I can't wait for a hard game but I fear it won't be really hard.Pros:On the other hand, the pros are many and quite convincing:  Beautiful and believable story line.        You can sympathize with your people.  Very pleasant graphics.         Only quirk is from very up close people ""skate/moonwalk"" a bit on the surface but nothing that impairs enjoyment. Lots of details on buildings and environment, seasons and weather look and sound great.  Believable and well-balanced ""disasters"".         From crops' diseases to people's diseases it all mends well with the environment. I didn't even get annoyed went they stroke.  Management without excess of micro management. A very good balance.   Sounds are very life-like.        From chickens to cows to market mumble it sounds really great. Only caveat is that some sounds can get annoying over time, as said in the ""cons"" above.  Mod-able.        I haven't had time to try them out yet but some of them look more like true expansion packs. And I feel there's only more coming so it sure looks promising for re-playability.  Good amount of available information about the game.        The tutorials are quite good and the wiki is somewhat complete so you don't need to wonder too much about what this or that does. There are only a couple of things missing, already mentioned in the cons above.  Very small download size.        At only a couple hundred Mb! Very well optimized. You'll be playing in no-time and the footprint on your HD/SSD is minimal.  Path-finding is rather good.        Path-finding is the kind of thing that can break and kill a game like this. Thankfully your people will do a great job at finding good routes to carry on with their daily business. Very very rarely you'll end up wondering why the hell did this dude chose to carry this basket of fish through the woods into nowhere.  Many hours of good fun!        This is the type of game you'll load up and get so entertained you'll wonder where did the time go when 2 or 3 hours have passed.Final words:An absolute must-have. If there's any chance you might like the genre and you haven't gotten this game yet, get it. Right now. The 9/10 score is solely because of the lack of a proper challenge in the long run. Things I'd like to see are more consequences for the lack of a balanced diet (there's not that much incentive for diversification as it is), or things like a super harsh winter every 5 or 10 years that may get you off-guard, that kind of thing. Anything to get you off-guard, to throw you a curve ball to deal with every once in a while. Maybe the classic citizens becoming unhappy if the town is too big, or if they need to walk too much to stock their households (beyond the lower productivity ""penalty""), I don't know. Just more mechanics to make the game interesting and challenging in the long run instead of ""if you're producing a little more than you consume your are safe forever"" current mechanic, which is a bit too easy to beat and a bit too stable/predictable.

												TL;DR: Like the Sims plus Civ.Never in my life have I yelled, ""MAKE BABIES, YOU STUPID PEOPLE!"" with such passion until I played this game.The game on it's own is a good and sufficiently challenging city builder (although the level of technology doesn't advance much past medieval), and there are quite a few good mods that help make the game feel just that bit more immersive and realistic. It's got the same kind of ""one more turn"" addictiveness that the Civ games are known for, without the megalomania. You start with a bunch of villagers. If you started on Easy, you'll have a good amount of people with a storage barn, houses, crops and orchard seeds. Pick Hard and you'll have a smaller pool of people, no barn, no houses, no crops to plant, and no seeds. If your village spawns in a decent area where they can scrounge/hunt for food until they get traders coming in with seeds/livestock, they'll likely survive, albeit not very happily. If you spawn in some ♥♥♥♥ ass dip valley surrounded by mountains and only a tiny stream running nearby... well, good luck. Why were these people banished? No reason is given, make your own. I like to think it's because they can potentially muddy the gene pool with stupidity.The villagers have the same level of intelligence as Sims in Sims 2 - as in, they'll do the job you give them, but not necessarily in the best way (they'll take the longest route to get tools and deliver raw materials, for example). Sometimes they'll go hungry even as they're carrying crates of fruit to the barn, or freeze to death because they didn't pick up a new coat. If you leave your computer with this game running while you go do Real Life things, you might come back to DEATH.My record so far is 4 deaths by starvation and 3 by dysentery in the time it takes to get myself some coffee. 10/10 best coffee I've ever had.

												First and foremost, don't let my time played on Steam fool you, since I got the game on here only recently. I've been playing the non-Steam Version on and off since its release however. Also, if you prefer the short version of this review, feel free to skip down to my summary. With that out of the way, let's talk the game.The Gameplay:Banished is a classical city builder sprinkled with survival elements. You build up your town, meet the needs of your citizens - mainly for food, firewood and health through food variety and herbs - and mine for classic resources like stone and iron. While this may sound simple at first glance, like many things in Banished, it is only in theory and much can go wrong. Grow your town too fast and you will run out of workers, but build too many houses at once to get new workers and you won't be able to feed them all, leading to starvation and yes, in Banished, that means the actualy death of your population and maybe your entire town.In the same vein natural disasters add another form of challenge. Entirely optional - as you can opt to disable them at game start - catastrophes such a spreading fire or a Tornado suddenly whirling through a carefully build up district can easily bring down a vital part of your economy, dooming your poor little town. And while you can arm yourself against some things, building a well in every district for example might be expensive but it also allows your citizens to put out fires before they can spread, you can only wait out others, like the Tornado and hope for the best.While this may sound like a flaw to some, it is to me one of Banished greatest strength, as it is this mechanic that allows your towns to never feel ""quite the same"". Different things happen to them. Maybe you won't expirience a Tornado. Maybe it will be there in your second year, when there's not much to be destroyed- or in Year 50 when you've just gotten to a good place. You might opt not to spend all this stone for wells on your next run and maybe your city can survive ""the great fire"".. Maybe all of these happen and produce a food crisis to boot. But which ever way, it will be part of your towns history, making every one feel unique and memorable.The Technical Side:Banished is a solo project, developed by Luke Hodorowicz, with nothing but its soundtrack produced by another person. For that it is a fantastic achievement. It also comes with a few quirks, which I notice are a big part of the more negative reviews on here - and partly unwarrented - which is why I'm going to touch on them quickly.Variety / ContentAs mentioned, Banished is a one person project, its content in its Vanilla form is therefor limited and you won't find the building variety or production chain complexity you see in triple A titles. There is no two ways about that. What people tend to forget, however, is that Banished was actually developed with the intention of the modding community providing additional content. And they have. From total conversion to dozens of buildings that perfectly tie into the Vanilla ""feeling"" of Banished. There is, as a matter of fact, more quality content on the workshop and the Banished forums than you could ever run in a single game.AIIn short, from my personal feeling, the AI is not half as bad as it's made out to be. Especially in comparison to similiar games, even those coming from big publishers. There are some minor flukes such as laborers tending to dilly-dally around while you're waiting for them to finish a project, but then, there's been a fix on the workshop for that as well since 2014. This issue might also come from the fact that, behold, Banished actually did what Sim City promised and couldn't pull off: actual, uniquely calculated AI. Every single one of your citizens has his or her own life. Their schedule, their family, their habits, their priorities. They are their own person. This becomes especially apparent if you enter ""follow"" mode and just observe a day in the life of one of your people. You will notice that what they actually do does make sense for them and that maybe the builder you're desperatly waiting on for your new project is busy collecting firewood and food from the Market to care for his/her family and that's why they're not showing up.Summary:Banished might not be a perfect game in its Vanilla form, but what it does set out to do, it does amazingly well. Wether it actually warrants its price tag or you'd rather wait for a sale is for you to decide, but keep in mind that there is a heap of free, high quality content to be had on the Workshop and if you're willing to utilize that, this game can provide you with hundreds of hours of fun, long after that first ""vanilla achievement run"". It is also a memorable expirience. I tend to play this genre a lot and for me Banished is easily one of my favorite games within there. In large part due to the fact that - through its survival elements and disaster mechanic - it does not suffer from the classical city builder problem of ""once you know what to do, it's always the same"". Every town is unique, every town has its own struggles to deal with and eventually its own history.			"

												Dude, this game is not easy. You think OK I can keep a bunch of little pixel people alive. Yeah it’s harder than it looks. Banished is a delicate balance between population control and food production and it takes time to master. Don’t be upset if your first few settlements go up in smoke (sometimes literally), this game is about what have you learned. You don’t fail with your settlements you learn new ways of what works and what doesn’t. There are some helpful guides out there that give you some great tips on making your life and the lives of your pixel people better. Here are some of mine.~ Be mindful how many houses you build. But just enough to house your people but not enough to let them breed out of control.~ FOOD! Food is your number one enemy in this game.~Firewood, you don’t need it much in the summer. But don’t let your little people freeze in the winter. ~ If you have people die, take workers off things like mining, timber cutting and blacksmithing (if you have a stock pile of tools) and move them to food. ~ Trade, trading is a key backbone to this game.~Chickens are your best friends. Cows and sheep take forever to grow but chickens are a good and quick food sorce.~ AOE players, throw out everything you know from AOE it DOES NOT APPLY HERE. "

												Before I get slammed for not recommending the game, it's worth saying that this is due to the oversimplicity of Steam's review system. Banished is a town building game similar to the Anno and SimCity series. What differiates the game from these titles is the real possibility of failure. Whereas in Anno, your economy may stall or crash which would require rebuilding a more sustainable city, in Banished, if you find yourself low on food, clothing, shelter or firewood, your citizens will rapidly die resulting in failure. This is an interesting change to what you may be used to in other city building games. Some other good stuff:Graphically the game is fairly low fidelity, but it has it's own kind of beauty. The environments feel alive and the visual changes across seasons result in some very aesthetically pleasing effects.The way you can customise the user interface is great. If you dislike being overwhelmed by information, you can choose to only have certain information windows open at once. If you enjoy a deluge of info, then have them all open (you will need to lower the interface size - something the options provides). However, here are some of the problems. The first problem is down time. The game requires as awful amount of waiting, either for your citizens to build stuff or for your children to turn into adults. Even at 10x speed, it can feel like an age just waiting for that extra labourer. If you build a school, this down time becomes even longer. And it is down time. You have absolutely nothing to do. To make a comparison, Anno 2070 included all kinds of missions and projects you could do while waiting for populations to grow. There is nothing of the sort here, and you may quickly become frustrated, even at the highest speed, at staring at very little going on.Second, but related problem: the lack of direction. In other city builder games there is either an overall victory state, or a set of tasks that can be achieved that act as kind of mini-win states. There is nothing like that here. So while staring at the screen with nothing to do, you may frequently find yourself asking ""why bother?"" Doing nothing in a game isn't fun full stop, never mind when it is a long time to go nowhere. There are achievements for the game but, if like me, you find achievement hunting rather pointless, then the existential nausea will quickly seep in. The final problem, and one that isn't the single developers fault, is the way that other gamers have marketed the title - in particular to do with difficulty. The game may be more difficult than SimCity, but overall it is not a wholly challenging game. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this (the idea that games need to be hard to be good or better than their counterparts is a myth perpetuated by those who can find no other outlet for an inferiority complex) but don't buy the game if you are expecting a super challenge. Once you have grasped the basic mechanics of the game and gained some understanding of efficiently using the game mechanics, you can play the game on hard and within two or three hours can happily leave the game on 10x, grab a cup of tea and watch some T.V. while maybe having to do some minimum micromanagment. It's still early days for Banished and with some adjustments made by the (single!!!) developer and/or with the introduction of some good mods, the game could be far better. For now I'd only recommend to die hard city builder fans who want to try something a little different. If you are any less than a die hard fan, I'd wait it out for a while.Edit: Some spelling and grammar mistakes cleaned up.			"

It also is quite challenging and has some interesting mechanics. Most of the time it does not screw up but when it does it screws up real bad.untill some major updates occur this game just dosent cut it.

												Most city building games have some sort of achievements that make you want to keep playing. The era advances, you get new buildings, there are nifty things to try and unlock.... Not so with Banished! A few hours in and once you have it generally figured out you are done. I keep trying to go back and play some more but find myself bored in 5 min. Plus something feels wrong when you are forced to play the game on 10 times fast forward just so things get done. I would recommend if its under $5			"

												First few attempts, my folks died to the cold in this game. That's bloody harsh, man. Finally though, I started getting it right. It's working!""Villager is hungry!"" ""Villager is hungry!"" ""Villager is hungry!"" ""Villager is hungry!"" ""Villager is hungry!"" ""Villager is hungry!"" OH LORD WHERE DID THE FOOD GO. And there's 3/5ths of your village gone.Sigh. Okay. Let's play this carefully. Let's get this done RIGHT! Keep tabs on firewood. Keep the houses solidly built. Make sure there's enough food to go around... and keep an eye on the population.""Villager has died from old age!"" Well, ♥♥♥♥. Okay, that's a thing. ""Villager has died from old age!"" ""Villager has died from old age!"" ""Villager has died from old age!"" OH GOD NO.This game is harsh. It's gonna smack you upside the head over and over with horrible deaths that are entirely your fault, with a few that are completely random, like the poor guy who died in the quarry from a rock falling on him.But I've got to say, as frustrating as it was, it felt very rewarding and satisfying to build my own medieval village, and really progress through the many attempts and reboots I had in this game. Playing the line as you slowly try and keep the village going at a good rate. Keeping the new blood coming in. Making sure there's enough to go around for everyone. It's good.All in all, this game is good. Remember to enable the UI elements, but from there on in you're on your own. Learn it. That's half the game right there, and it's more fun than it probably should be. Poor villagers, they've no idea what they got themselves into.			"

												I'm mixed on this game. While it is quite enjoyable, in my opinion, there's a fundamental design flaw. At its core, Banished is a fun, yet simple builder, survival game only made difficult by the ""flaw"". Toward the bottom of Maslow's heirarchy of needs are the physiological and safey needs of self. Yet, Banished violates this premise with its breeding model; the citizens will breed until all open houses are filled. This one, simple fact, makes it nearly impossible to recover from late game mistakes or natural disasters, making the game too finicky.Anectdotally (populatation graph in profile), in my fourth Banished game, this flaw occurred again. A tornado destroyed part of my town, nearly 500 strong. Even though the damage was small, it caused a chain reaction--a tool shortage, led to resource shortage (food and raw materials for tools and clothing), which led to 320 people dying before it recovered. Important note: the town had housing for 500+ people.Food stores slowly began to recover, all the while the adults were still breeding, never slowing. With a 500-citizen occupancy on housing, they kept procreating, but the resources didn't exist and after reaching 400 citizens (270 adults), the population crashes again down to one, lone hunter.TL;DR. The breeding model is flawed, which is an exercise in frustration instead of an enjoyable challenge.  I can't recommend it at this time; I'll revist my review if a patch is released.			"

												Banished is very unique in its play-style. I'm a huge fan of city-builder and strategy games, and so to find a game that really breaks the mold was very refreshing. No tech trees or restrictions is a nice touch, and the idea of being a challenging survival game blended with the usual city builder element is really great. I want to love this game. I want to say its the best city builder game to come out since Sim City 4, but there's a few crucial issues I have with the game.The most significant issue in Banished is that I find myself staring at numbers and messages more than anything else. It's a constant game of moving around my profession numbers. What's worse is that for being such an interface-heavy game design, the UI itself is actually not very well-designed or thought out. The micromanagement in the game suffers from a serious lack of depth. Once you've planned out your city, which is a matter of ensuring your people don't have to walk too far to drop off supplies or get to their homes, you begin your journey of tediously shuffling around professions endlessly while staring at the event log, professions and resource tabs. You're watching a number (Like food or fuel) slowly go down while you frantically try keep that number up by doing anything you can  but a lot of the time I feel like there's nothing I can do. If my people start dying from starvation, it's nearly impossible to fix it without losing a huge chunk of my population, because when people die the replacements take a long time to get settled into their new home and begin work. Relateable Games:• Sim City• City Skylines• StrongholdAll and all. If you like delicate city building simulations. This game is for you.9/10 From Me: Sweep "

												I would have recommended this game before it became $20.00. I think the asking price is a bit much for a game that gets boring very soon after you have played about 20 hours. For a city builder, it's unique in that you have to manage a wide array of basic resources to survive. However, it's also very short for a city builder. Once you attain a population of about 300 or more, there simply is no reason to play the game any longer. There needs to be a 'next-level' for players, after they've built past the survival stage, where grander buildings, regional conflicts (perhaps building an army for defense), or new villager specialist professions become available.I've been waiting for almost a year for updates in this game that would bring it to the next level, and offer a fuller building experience. I've held off writing my review in lieu of the developer's promise to improve the game. Yet, alas, it seems those promises were false. If one has money to spend, and wants to try something different for a small amount of time, they maybe will feel ok spending the $20.00 on this game. However, If you want a more enjoyable long-lasting game, buy Sim City 4. It's also only around $20.00 and is far superior to this game.			"

												This game is kinda like the city-builder version of Dark Souls. In the beginning, you die. You die a lot. And then you learn some, and maybe get farther, only to die. It's so infuriating that you NEED to play the game! Because you can't let a stupid game beat you!			"

												It's like Age of Empires, but you don't need enemy factions to kill your people, when the weather, natural disasters, or their own AI will happily do that for them.- Expand city- Not enough wood to build another barn next to new farmland- Winter falls- People go back to their homes- Several people die of starvation along the way- Every one of them had food in their inventory10/10 would forbid people from eating what they're carrying again.I've yet to try the game with mods, though I imagine I'd never see the sunlight again when I do.

												After purchasing the game I watched a 20 minute lets play video of it online and then dived right in. It was very entertaining i expanded my village made farms and gathering huts, built bridges and houses. Keeping everyone well fed and warm was a challenge. My village was struck by a devestating famine due to my inexperience and poor city planning. My population was decimated and i was having a blast the whole time deeply immeresed in trying to pull my village out of the hole it was in. That first game lasted 20 hours and it was a pleasure. I then started a second game. I decided that the optimal strategy would be to build a large amount of farms and at all times (apart from winter of course) have roughly half my citizens working those farms. My population grew at a rapid rate and within 5 hours i had a relatively large bustling city and virtually no one had died from anything other than old age. When city builder games get to this point there in trouble, they have to have a way to keep you immersed and the immersion begins to fall apart when a simple strategy of having half your citizens working farms completely removes all challenge in the game. The situation got worse when i worked out that firewood was the optimal trading currency and that i could exchange it with the traders that came relatively often for pretty much anything. My city prospered and grew, constant exchanges of firewood for food with the traders and half of my citizen working the farms caused my food stockpiles to grow at a ridiculous rate and i eventually needed literally hundreds of barns to store it all. At this point one thing could of saved this game.RISKS AND DANGERS AND PROBLEMS EVERYWHEREEE!!!- where are those wild animals lurking in the forests ready to devour your citizens and the invasions of barbarians ready to wreck even the most prosperous villages. The disaster mechanic in banished could of served this purpose and made the game riveting . But they did nothing. In my 30 hours of play time i didnt see a single tornado, one or two fires sprouted up but they were quickly quenched by the 3 or 4 wells i had scattered around. The first time that a popup appeared telling me one of my farms was infested with crop ruining bugs i merely deleted said farm and built a new one. And the tiny loss of food meant nothing because of my ridiculous stockpiles of food. I got so excited when the popup saying two of my citizens were infected with some kind of disease appeared. But nothing happened they just went to one of my two hospitals and were cured. I got bored and moved on. If you look at the reviews for this game youl find that over 75 percent of them have less than 50 hours play time. This game will entertain you for one or two short games before you work out that having half your citizens working farms will solve alll your villages problems.In summary the graphics are nice, the interface is smooth and it has that one more turn addictive feel you get from civ games. This game could easily have become my number no.1 most played steam title. So it is with a heavy heart that i rate this game unfinished and broken at the core. However if the game is on sale for 75 percent off then by all means buy it for that first glorious game. BUT ONLY IF YOU CAN HANDLE IT BREAKING YOUR HEART !!!			"

												Anyways here goesThe game doesn't really have any story or anything, its a city building sandbox, to build a village and prosper. Very interesting game, supports dx11 but atm crashes, theres some bugs here and there but this game is very very fun if you are into city builders.Very nice tutorial and easy to learn. Graphics are ok quite decent, Music is relaxing, and the interface is very nice and easy to use. The controls are easy to understand usually hotkeys are f1-f9 and 1-9 so theres no confusion here,  and the gameplay is just very easy to understand and manage. One small wrong move and you'll end up being a homeless village, or can mean the destruction of your village. So Assign people through one of your professions correctly, and get your village going, get those people multiplying and prepare to prosper because it'll be a challenge!ChecklistAre you out of food? - YOU FAIL!Is your town not happy enough and breeding? - FAIL!Tornado hits your ♥♥♥? - FAIL!Disease and no medication? - FAILnot enough fire log? - FAILeveryone dieing? - FAIL!Out of tools to work? - Get ready to fail!the list goes on+Impressive game made by one guy ONE GUY, CRAZY+Good Interface + keys are easy to understand+Music is catchy, very peaceful+Disasters!+Not an Early Release/Alpha+Addictive Gameplay+Runs real well and includes DX11+Beats the crap outta sim city for an indie title.+Good amount of buildings to make a nice vilage, you got your blacksmiths, herbalist, foresters etc+Managing your village at a large level will get intense, REALLY INTENSE+- the negatives are understandable and forgiveable due to the fact the game was created by one guy-Sandbox game, so no single player included no real story of any kind, you just build and survive.-Can be massively improved!- The only goal is to survive, no real force to kill you of any sort except disaster and missmanagement.-Once you mess up its almost a garunteed game over unless you can fix it, and just one disaster can completely destroy your hours of work, may be tough for the faint of heart.-Since the game doesn't evolve, if you built a village and it becomes self sustainable in a way, thats it. Theres nothing really else to do except make it bigger.- No real replayability besides the map seeding which changes how you will make a new village.			"

												This game is like building a house of cards. Not too hard to begin, you think you're doing well. Nearly 200 population, full happiness. Then some un-noticed event occurs, maybe a little low on logs, iron, coal. Maybe running low on labour causing things to stack up.Suddenly, you have no tools, work is down to 50% but your population is the same.But not for much longer, as without tools you run out of logs (so firewood), coal, coats, food, everything. Poeple are dying left and right.Now you have under 30 populatioon trying to run everything!Fun, fun game, but trickier than it looks!			"

												Banished is an indie town building simulation from Shining Rock Software. Banished is one of the best simulation games out there.In Banished you play to manage some people who were banished from their homeland because of something, it doesn't really matter because what you need to do is to do everything in your power to make sure these outcast can survive and build a new society of their own. Something like that I think. Either you become a great mayor of a great town, or you just simply build a small ghost town.Banished gameplay are so great, I can say it is quite so realistic as simulation games can get. You still can't do everything, but when you start playing Banished you're gonna realize that not everybody can be a Mayor. The citizen in Banished will age, they will grow old and die so expanding and balancing the population is important. Citizen can also die because of acccident too, for example a miner can die because of cave in or crushed by a rock, I even encounter one event where one of my citizen is murdered! Damn! Anyway, resources gathering in Banished is quite complex, there is no skill trees but production chains, and it is important to manage those production chains well or all hell break loose. To gather food we can build farms or pastures, do hunting or gathering some berries or roots in the forest, and even fishing. You can even replant the forest so you will never run out of woods. There is also trade, where you get most of your crop seeds and new pasture breeds. Then there's also disasters, a disease breakout (people will not turn into zombies however), or your own disasters because your people are starving or freezing to death. Lots can happen so keep on your toes.In terms of graphics, Banished doesn't have very advanced graphics, but it's beautiful enough. The graphics is sufficient enough for you to enjoy Banished and forgot to check on the clock. Performances are also good, just keep in mind if you want to build a big-♥♥♥ town, you better have more RAM, just like any other simulation games.Banished also has a workshop support for mods. Yes MODS! There are couple of mods that adds even more production chains to Banished, even more building and even more resources to gather. Some even has decoration thing for your town. The best mod for Banished currently is the Colonial Charter mods, which add almost everything to Banished that sometimes it feels like an expansion pack. You can also make your own mods that fits your gameplay.Overall, Banished is a great simulation. If only they add at least a little combat gameplay it could be great, It doesn't have to be a war but something like repelling bandits attack, pirates, looters or something. But that's just my thought. I really recommend Banished for you all simulation gamers.Rating 10/10			"

												I really enjoyed this game, but it's definitely not for everyone. The game thrives off of you failing. It's a game of trial and error. Cities get harder and harder to manage as the population climbs. If you're not comfortable spending hours on a city only to watch it crumble after a plague, this game may not be for you. The way I think the game was designed to be played was for you to build it up to the point of your society collapsing so that you can say ""okay, here were my mistakes, this is why it was unstable; I won't do that next time."" In this sense, the game is immensely rewarding as you're constantly able to learn from your mistakes and get farther each time. That being said, this can make the game more frustrating than rewarding for some people. You're constantly faced with small and large failures that can make the game seem impossible. But, when losing is part of the game, you're not really losing. Anyway, if you want a city-building sim and you like them to challenging, complex, and deep, this is a great game and you'll probably spend a lot more hours on it than I did.			"

												Literally the best building people person SIM game ever. Was wondering about purchasing myself. My village seemed to prosper the whole time while not having much food, I paid no attention. Everybody froze to death but my dear Stellamae. A beautiful sheila at the fresh age of 27, she work with her colleague, Kavia the stoneminer. Kavia died at 33, however Stellamae continued to persevere with her life, although it may have seemed bleak. With a mildly established infastructure to store her reapings, Stellamae continued with her daily routine for 50 years. At this time I had grown fond of her, and wished to counsel her for her trauma a half decade ago. We lived, we loved, we prospered. Years had gone by where we were what you could call ""a thing"", however, the lack of progress with the counseling failed to please me and eventually grew me ill towards the once beautiful Stellamae. At the ripe age of 73, I abondoned Stellamae in any form of love. Stellamae, a trooper, continued to persist. Alas, an exceptionally harsh winter storm froze the hardened Stellamae to death where I was then, in that moment, free to beseach the touch of another.			"

												Normani was a simple man. He graduated from his class with less-than average grades. But he got his work done in a timely fashion and was never tardy. He took a job in simple labor; Normani had no big aspirations; moving good to and from places was good enough for him.It happened one fateful winter. Normani was going about his business-- collecting lumber, moving stones, the usual. However, tradgety struck. Normani somehow found himself trapped behind a wall of houses, his back to the open river. What was he to do? His tool had broken, and he still had to collect the mutton some fool had left in front of the third storage barn! But this barricade of houses proved to be too daunting a task for dear old Normani, who, sadly, perished from starvation in the bitter winter cold, even though his salvation was right around the literal corner.Sweet dreams, my prince.10/10			"

												Recently i spent quite some time in this game to form some opinion. For a long time i was looking for a city-building game what is closest to Travian. If you are familiar with this browser game, you are awesome. If you are not, dont worry just check it out, to get some sense what i am going to talk about. In Travian you start with main building, some resources, you have couple citizens and you try to build and grow your city. Banished is in some sense just like that. Yes i know you can´t build army here and be victorious in this way, but me personally i didn´t care about armies in Travian. My biggest pleasure was build my city, take care of my people, to trade and stuff. I can do this in Banished, with higher level of survivability, where my decision what to build and when to build matter more. I have to take bigger care about my people. Not only i have to be sure they have enough food, they need to be warm in winter, they need suitable living conditions and so on. You also need to pay attention to age of your citizens and you need to make sure you have replacement for them when they die, so you wont end up with a ghost town.Resource management is also big plus for me, as well as current diversity in buildings.I adore tone and theme of this game and so far it was nothing but fun for me.I am aware of a fact that in some point i can get bored, and that replayability might not be case of this game when you fully master all mechanics, and when you find some solid path to build your hamlet to magnificent town.I dont have really much bad things to say if any.I love it, and i will for some time.Grade: A "

												Here's the short - This is a city builder survival game. Keep your banished townsfolk alive and build a town in spite of your harshest enemy - the environment. Sounds simple, but just buy this game. Full price or not, it is worth it, though it will frequently go on sale for $4.99.Something about the balance of keeping everyone fed and designing a town is just glorious. Then, when you get into mods that offer up various buildings and asthetic elements... my goodness can you design gorgeous cities with beautiful plotted out crops and medieval neighborhoods. The guy that made this game created something very special here. I pray to the gaming gods that one day he will create a sequel to this game (as the source code doesn't allow for a lot of things one might hope)P.S. Avoid the mods that make things easier. The point of many of those is for playing on a smaller map, and having those mods makes big maps much too easy to be fun. There's something special about building a nice town/city in spite of all the cold and starvation.Please hear me Luke Hodorowicz... Make me something else I can love <3 (as much as you)			"

My townspeople have an exceptional surfeit of food; I haven't eaten in hours. I should sleep, but I just need to see them through this winter - if I can get that forestry lodge finished maybe I can resolve the firewood crisis... then I can build more houses and get the population back on track for growth again... before I know it five more years have passed. I don't know what time it is, only that I need to build a new pasture, since I finally got some sheep from a trader, and who am I going to reassign to be the herdsman?On the one hand, this is a fantastically engrossing game that will easily give you your money's worth.On the other hand, if you want a productive real life, you should beware of the time sink it can so easily become!

												Damn, I wanted to like this game... I really did.  As a big fan of both RTS and city-building games, the idea of survival being your primary obstacle really seemed like a fresh idea for both genres.  Unfortunately I cannot in good faith recommend anyone buy this game.  The problems are myriad, and I hardly know where to begin.  I guess I'll start by covering the good, since it's by far the shortest list.PROS Cool gameplay concept Looks cool for an indie releaseCONS It would be overly charitable to call the UI ""clunky.""  If you intend to have all of the relevant info tabs open (and you really should if you want to survive longer than ten minutes) anticipate them eating more than a third of your screen.  It really detracts from any visual enjoyment you might otherwise get from the game. The learning curve is exceptionally steep.  At less than 100 total population the slightest change in resource allocation throws your entire village into chaos.  While I appreciate that a fine balance is necessary for a survival game, this game really misses the mark.  Convert a fisherman to a forester?  Everybody starves.  Have three births over the winter versus last season's two?  Everybody starves.  Admit two nomads into your village?  Everybody starves.  They should have just called the game 'Everybody Starves' as that's about the only achievable outcome short of OCD-like micromanagement of every single in-game metric. There is nothing intuitive about the mechanics of this game.  There are tooltips, but they are vague and unhelpful, especially when taken in combination with the ultra-touchy resource allocation system.  I have played dozens of RTS titles and have never run up against a game that was so cagey about telling you what the ♥♥♥♥ it was doing (ie. how the game elements affect one another). AI in this game is a joke, and player control is nonexistent.  Sure, you can assign villagers to one of several dozen different job categories, but in some cases that seems entirely futile as they pretty much do whatever they want once assigned.  And of course, since you have no direct control over individual villagers, you're basically forced to watch them as they wile away the hours.  I've watched farmers nonchalantly gather wood during planting season, fail to make it to their assigned farm until halfway through summer, then wander off through the entirety of harvest time because they were cold.  If you lived alongside people like this in an actual subsistence village, you'd flog these farmers to death for constantly putting the lives of the entire town in jeopardy. AI is so garbage it deserves a second bullet point.  Builders cannot prioritize multiple tasks.  While there is a system in place to manage build priorities, it flat does not work.  I have consistently had buildings with zero assigned builders finish well before buildings which had my entire building crew assigned to them, because again: villagers do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ they please, occasionally popping in to do 14 seconds of work at their ""job"" before wandering off because they're cold or hungry.  Why these morons can't dress and feed themselves before leaving the house for work is beyond me, but that's apparently how the developer intended for things to work.  The last thing I will say on the subject; because of their failure to prioritize the buildings you select, it's time-wasting and endlessly frustrating to queue more than maybe two buildings at a time.  Doing so causes the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI to split your resources among all future building sites (even ones without assigned builders), ensuring you don't have enough resources to start building *any* of your projects.  It's one of the stupidest designs I've ever seen in a civilization builder-type game.  This also makes planning for the future of your settlement nearly impossible.  As a bonus, when food reserves are running low, people forget how to eat.  I've seen dozens of villagers die rather than make the trek across the street to the market (where there is food).  This is another ♥♥♥♥-poor piece of AI programming.  Apparently, villagers like to shop like they're at Costco.  If they can't obtain a six month supply of food in a single market visit, they refuse to eat at all.  They will, however, attempt to cross the entirety of the map trying to find food somewhere else, even if it's miles away from their workplace and home.  Spoiler alert: they starve.Given what I've seen in my first couple dozen hours of play, I cannot see how this game would scale up in a fun and meaningful way.  I currently haven't made it much past ~100 villagers, at which point the game seemingly already requires autistic levels of attention.  Based on that, I can only imagine that a larger town would become an immediate and tedious grind.In summary, I think this game concept had a ton of potential that was just impossible for a first-time developer to fully realize.  If you can get it for $2 and pile so many mods on top of it that it effectively becomes a different game, there might be some (fun) replay value there.  I've heard great things about the Colonial Charter mod, and am keeping my fingers crossed that it can save this game.  However, if you're expecting $20 worth of ""fun"" from the vanilla game, I believe you'll be sorely disappointed.  I'm sad to say I couldn't recommend this game at anything other than bargain basement prices.			"

												I have played for only 30 minutes and already it's one of my favorite games of all time. Banished is simple, user-friendly, beautiful and challenging. It's what city-builders should be. No arbitrary limits, overpriced airships, unlocking conditions or even money. Banished makes sense.			"

												An excellent city builder, Banished keeps things interesting in a dying genre.  Most city builders allow you to build freely with money, in Banished you must gather the resources to build.  While building can be repetitive, mod support offers tons of new options for buildings and game features.			"

												*edited to update after 2 years of playing*BANISHED is a city-builder that will make you question everything you think you know about survival, life, and humanity. It will take you on an emotional journey and force you to confront the idea of meaning in the face of an indifferent universe. The game is deceptively calming and Zen-like, with its peaceful music and pretty landscapes. But you can't play the game with a casual mindset, because things can go horribly wrong, horribly quickly. Starvation, fires, disease, and lack of resources are ever-present dangers. Things can be perfect for 50 years, and then collapse in a matter of weeks. Every time I play, I undergo a drastic change in mentality. At first, I'm very emotionally attached to my villagers, watching them live their lives and raise their families. As my village grows, I become detached and cool -- I no longer know my villagers by name, and I no longer become concerned when one (or two, or twenty) are homeless or starving. ""This must be what a god feels like,"" I think to myself as I roll my eyes at the death of a villager apparently too stupid to walk ten feet and grab some firewood from the marketplace.As you can tell by the number of hours I've played BANISHED, I absolutely love this game. I'll go a few months without playing, and then find myself missing it and open it up to start a new game. Every time I do, it's the same lovely, immersive, sometimes frustrating but always satisfying experience. BANISHED scratches some sort of existential itch in my soul, and I know it's a game I will continue to turn to for years and years. As far as mechanics go, I absolutely love that the villagers of BANISHED are ""smart"" enough to perform routine tasks without being told. If you want to build a house in a forest, you don't have to tell them to clear the forest, gather resources, and then build the house -- they will perform the necessary steps to achieve your ultimate goal. This alone makes the gameplay superb to most city-builders. I also enjoy playing this game with some of the many mods that other players have made. I love the new content and how easily it integrates into the basic game. But I think I'll always prefer to play it un-modded, because its very spareness is part of what makes it so real and so addictive.			"

												Banished is very unique in its play-style. I'm a huge fan of city-builder and strategy games, and so to find a game that really breaks the mold was very refreshing. No tech trees or restrictions is a nice touch, and the idea of being a challenging survival game blended with the usual city builder element is really great. I want to love this game. I want to say its the best city builder game to come out since Sim City 4, but there's a few crucial issues I have with the game.For the record, I've only ever tried Hard difficulty setting.The most significant issue in Banished is that I find myself staring at numbers and messages more than anything else. It's a constant game of moving around my profession numbers. What's worse is that for being such an interface-heavy game design, the UI itself is actually not very well-designed or thought out. The micromanagement in the game suffers from a serious lack of depth. Once you've planned out your city, which is a matter of ensuring your people don't have to walk too far to drop off supplies or get to their homes, you begin your journey of tediously shuffling around professions endlessly while staring at the event log, professions and resource tabs. You're watching a number (Like food or fuel) slowly go down while you frantically try keep that number up by doing anything you can -- but a lot of the time I feel like there's nothing I can do. If my people start dying from starvation, it's nearly impossible to fix it without losing a huge chunk of my population, because when people die -- the replacements take a long time to get settled into their new home and begin work. The game is very punishing when you do something wrong. There's no wiggle room, no room for error. If I make one too many mistakes then I'm going to suffer a major consequence - hundreds will die. This doesn't make the game challenging, it just means that due to a simple mistake I now have to wait even longer to see my city become large and prosperous. The game feels like a tedious chore more often than a strategic city-planner. The only way to prevent a few mistakes from causing all your people to die is to wait a very long time while your city stockpiles resources (especially food). It's kind of like grinding in an RPG game; it guarantees that you'll be able to progress without issues, but its boring and totally kills the fun of risky advancements.And even when you are doing really well the game does not reward you. At the height of your success all you've managed to do was keep that illogical, arbitrary number afloat. There are no milestones in Banished. There's nothing to aspire to, nothing to accomplish except see your numbers slowly rise and build more of the same. Every building I make is just another bland-looking brown or grey construct and all it does is help the numbers move along in some way or another. Brewery improves happiness numbers. Chapel increases happiness numbers. It's a game of seemingly-meaningless numbers going up and down forever. There also seems to be a surprising lack of information pertaining to what these numbers actually represent. What exactly does 100 firewood equate to? I never feel like I'm actually planning things out, telling myself I need X amount of Y, but instead just trying to make sure I have a surplus of every resource for when that 1 extra civilian is the straw that breaks the camel's back and my economy is thrown out of balance.If updated, Banished has potential to be amazing. Despite all of the drawbacks, I really enjoy the game, especially for its unusual survival/city-builder hybrid play-style. It was definitely worth my $20 bucks. Rating: B+			"

												This game will crush you, eat you, spit you out, burn your corpse, and pee on your grave.  And you'll love every second of it.There is no combat, no money, no infinite resources unless by trade boat...This ain't your momma's city builder, and the name of the game is survival.  People will freeze in the winter, use up firewood for their homes, break their tools, get sick, etc.  Every npc is precious, and even has a name, gender, a job you assign them (teacher, doctor, farmer, miner...) and a home they return to each day to warm up and eat and sleep.  It's like SIm City 1066.  Hard to imagine this was all made by a single developer, and I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a hefty challenge in a city builder/survival sim.			"

												Banished is a city builder with a heavy emphasis on survival. There are no tech trees, the goal is not to be the next big megacorporate empire or prosperous city, and also no combat. You simply survive. It's stressful and theres little in the way of reward so if this sounds not your thing, avoid it. This game has forced me to shutdown a school building so the little kiddies can work the field some more, after a horrible harvest. A tornado has destroyed 4 hours work. And I loved it.			"

												Few people are aware of my crippling video game addiction (mostly because I spent too much time playing therefore I have no social life) so today I’m outing myself and putting this problem to good use.Banished is the indie game brainchild of one man, Luke Hodorowicz, the founder of Shining Rock Software.  There isn’t a specific back story to the game; all you know is that you were banished (for an unknown reason) to a remote area and it is up to you to plan the city and keep your villagers alive.  It’s like a hybrid of Starcraft, SimCity, and the Civilization series.I've spent roughly 48 hours playing this game.  The first thing I noticed is how effing difficult this game is.  I started playing on medium difficulty, fair weather, and disasters enabled.  After a quick and painful death about 20 minutes into my adventure I had to switch to easy with mild weather.  I left disasters enabled because I couldn’t 100% cheat.Strategy is absolutely key in this game.  Villagers need to have enough food and firewood to make it through the winter.  Some clothes would be nice but my villagers quickly realized they can’t always get what they want.  Without depleting my resources too badly I was able to set up a woodcutter, fields, livestock pens, fishing dock, hunting lodge, and a house for people gathering materials (food, herbs, etc) in the woods.  Boom!  Everyone had a job and the town made it through the harsh winter with enough food and firewood.It was about this time I realized the game also mocks you.  I was celebrating my victory over winter by looking for a place to build a marketplace and a trading post when I suddenly got alarms that villagers were dying.  First three villagers, then ten…What the ♥♥♥♥?  My boyfriend would dub this episode “The Spring of Death.”  It all started with the tornado that killed all but five villagers.  They started to rebuild their houses and stockpiles and just when it looked like they might bounce back…they ran out of food and died.Overall, the range of play is great.  The maps are large and plentiful.  Each map (I’ve only played three but there are many more) has a water supply for fishing docks and trading posts.  Some locations are easier to play than others.  The location where all my villagers were wiped out was particularly difficult because it was surrounded by water and trees with little room for movement immediately.  Hence the total destruction of everyone living within three feet of each other.Unlike many strategy games players have everything they need right from the start.  All players really need to be concerned with is hunting down raw materials like wood, iron, stone, and coal.  Otherwise all buildings, skills, occupations, livestock, seeds, etc. are immediately available for construction and use.  This may be off-putting for some gamers but I didn’t mind as it just made me think a bit more about strategy: Do I want a schoolhouse to teach children to be more efficient laborers or do I want the church to keep up village moral (unhappy villagers are not useful laborers)?There is no story line which is great because I hate to play a plot based game.   Also it doesn’t appear to have a finish line either which is new to me. There is no way to “win”.  The whole purpose of the game is simply to survive and grow your town into a thriving medieval metropolis.  Occasionally things pop up where villagers might steal food and you have to decide how to handle that but there is no central plot based play.I loved this game.  Hardcore.  Even when I knew I wasn’t going to be able to survive a particular map I still gave it my all (I got a little involved) for the sake of the villagers.  I think that’s the thrill of the game: knowing that I could lose at any moment made the little victories that much sweeter.  Well worth the frustration and the money.			"

												Tried to claim the achievement for a 300 villager society without schools, using only hunting and gathering.Now my townstead, built along a river bank and surrounded by small hunting/gathering campsites, has such an immense production of food that a lot of it goes straight to the trading post.We just bought a massive supply of tools, clothes, and iron, with venison. Every trading post has at least 2000 pounds of venison in stock.I've made a society where venison is the official currency.10/10 would keep playing.			"

												Some families banished to the harsh wilderness. They own nothing but their coats, two dozen tools, a pile of firewood and potatoes that will last half a year. It is my responsibility to create a new society for them.""Banished"" is an indie developed strategy game, a sort of hybrid between the simulator ""Sim City"" and ""Settlers"". Here it is neither about building a metropolis or to defend the village against hostile tribes. Here you have to get the little people to survive by allowing it to live in symbiosis with nature.In ""Banished"" it's the village's inhabitants which is the greatest asset. They are the workers, and assigning them different kinds of jobs for the community to flourish. Collecting raw materials like stone and iron are essential, but equally important is to expand the food supply . Woodcutter shed and planting trees, but you need a wood-cutter to produce firewood. Fishermen, hunters and farmers in turn produces food. The commercial harbor, the only gateway to the rest of the world, offers the only opportunity to trade for seeds and livestock.At the same time one has to take into account residents' most basic needs - like giving people shelter. Otherwise, the population does not grow and during the winter they will freeze to death.Death is also ever-present . Residents dies sooner or later, and everytime someone dies, it is a huge blow to the community. Building a cemetery can actually make the villagers happier, because then they have a place to mourn their loved ones. It is both interesting and striking how well the population mortality integrated into the game.The basis of the game mechanics are simple but cleverly designed. The challenge of ""Banished"" is to try to balance the needs of residents with society's expansion - resources and raw materials must always be in phase with each other or else the village will encounter an massive starvation. There will be a reward in itself to construct new buildings, plant new seeds or build infrastructure because it takes time and hard work to gather the raw materials for the proposed projects.The clear and helpful tutorial makes the game easy to understand and engaging. The interface is excellent designed: informative without being overwhelming, with movable and dynamic windows. ""Banished"" looks very plain and lack the artistic variety, but it is an unusually accommodating strategy game.Despite it's ruthless thematics. ""Banished"" is rarely awfully difficult. Although uphill may be long on the highest difficulty level -  it becomes relatively easy when the population passed the hundred.But it is a challenging and entertaining strategy - at least as long as there is something to fight for. My involvement decreases abruptly once I managed to construct any building, buy all the seeds and obtain any livestock. Then there is simply no more to strive for.Strategic basis is brilliant and well thought out, and while there are still things to build, it is difficult to tear oneself away from the screen. ""Banished"" has the potential to be even better, and I hope that the developer will continue adding content. It was after all, a long time ago that a citybuilding game as captivating as this one was released.			"

												Banished is a game about a group of people who were banished from their home (for an unknown reason) with just enough food and tools to start a new life in the wilderness.In the game description, this is said to be a ""city-building strategy game"". Well, I think it is only 20% city-building. In my humble opinion, this is a ""strategic survival of a town against nature"". Things like collecting resources, building structures just the right way so your villagers can use the optimum route to their destination, planning village growth according to terrain, are what this game is all about. If you buy this game expecting a ""city-building game"", you will not like it. Actually half of the bad reviews are based on expectation of a ""city-building game"".Game's complexity is fair. It does not have hundreds of buildings, tools etc. There is only one ""tool"" which villagers use to collect resources and build structures. There are also a handful of structures each with a different purpose, from producing fuel to keeping villagers happy. Its complexity comes from learning what works best how and with what.Game does not have an end game goal. This may be a good thing or a bad thing depending on people's perspective. After you start a game and get the hang on basics, you put your own goal. For example mine was to grow to 600 citizens and got the achievement. It is not actually a sandbox game, but some people put some restrictions on themselves, like not building certain buildings. Some of these restrictions are also encouraged by achievements if you are into it.Pros:+ Good graphics: Structures are very detailed, villagers are distinguishable, trees and nature look good enough.+ Excellent simulation: Every villager has a status based on their hunger, clothing etc. and distance between their house and work place makes real difference.+ Nice tutorial: Tutorial teaches the basics but doesn't give too much detail. For a survival game, learning optimum ways is part of the game.+ Works great: My system is considered high end, but should work great on medium level systems because its recommended system requirements are currently considered very low end.+ Workshop supportCons:+ Slow paced: This is not necessarily a bad thing but it may make some people bored quickly.+ Wrong classification: Well, this game is about survival but classified as city-building strategy game. It makes expectations of new players different and most bad reviews are based on this.Verdict:I don't regret having this game and recommend it without a second thought. I hope developer (yes singular. afaik, it is developed by one person) considers making a sequel in the future.P.S: As a rule, I won't comment on price tag. Everyone has a different opinion on whether it is worth the price tag or not. So it is up to you to decide.Edit: Fixed some typos and formatting "

												After 10 hours I've pretty much seen everything there is to see. Amusing but over-priced for what could be considered a tech-demo. Nothing to unlock, nothing to beat and nothing to learn. Every game you play will be exactly like the one before that, the only question is whether or not you'll make it through the first winter. The modding community seems to mainly revolve around making the game even easier. Don't get me wrong, I don't regret buying it (at a huge discount, of course) but I wouldn't recommend this to any one. There just isn't enough content to justify a purchase and there's no new content on the horizon either. You also have to wonder why this game needs to be played at 10 times the speed it was meant to be played at it for it to give you a feeling of progression.Missed opportunity, really.

My freaking villagers should stop working and go get some freaking food, which is available in four different storage buildings, instead of working to death in some freaking forest.

												A very simple ""City Sim"" that is extremely hard to master.  You start this game out as a small town just building from scratch, a couple houses (on easy setting) a storage barn and some settlers.  The goal is to build a thriving town that can sustain the needs of all its habitants.  They need to eat, rest, and be healthy.  Sounds easy on paper however the developers have designed the game is keep you on your toes the entire time.  You have to balance your population growth just perfectly to enable your new production buildings to have enough employees, however not too quickly that they run out of food during their first winter.There are a decent amount of buildings in this game, from various vegetable farms, to fruit tree orchards, to live stock pens.  You can have stone quarries, and iron mines, hunter lodges and herb gatherers.  You also must build schools to teach your citizens how to be more productive at their jobs, and churches to provide happiness as well as graveyards so villagers can mourn the loss of loved ones.The maps are very well done, and easily thousands and thousands of variations, some having large lakes which can make your town more focused on fishing, or large forested areas where hunters do the majority of food gathering.  Overall this game is well worth the money.  As of right now I have over 20 hours played and still have not made a successful town that I am happy with.  However, each time I start a new one I get a bit further and closer to perfecting it.Very fun game, can't wait until more items and features are added. "

Keeping track of population growth and seeing your village expand into a small town is great and very scenic. Having to keep track of everything makes this game never boring. And the maps are random, so every time you start over the map is different (unless you use the same seed agian). The music and ambient sounds are also very well done. Although I do not like the sound of the rain/storms very much. But besides that, the game is very well made and addictive.			"

												Before I launch into the review, let me make clear - I love this game, I love this game dearly, it's going to eat my life, in big horrible chunks, I can see it beating Dungeons of Dredmor for time played with *Ease*. Recommending it is easy enough, but recommending it to all and sundry is a different matter, this is a game for a specific audience, allow me to explain :Banished calls itself a city building strategy game....Right. That's akin to calling Dark Souls a light and cheerful romp through some ruins whilst a few slightly less than alive fellows duel you with rusty metal objects and you meet some not quite all there people on a quest of JOLLY CO-OPERATION.Whoever came up with the store description is clearly a master of either understatement or satire. I tip my hat to them, I do. Banished is superficially about building a village, yes, but that's merely the outer layer of this rather hefty onion of a game, and it's made of many interlocking layers that are all simulated. Each citizen is simulated properly, they go to their workplace, they get hungry, they get cold, they get old, they die. They may have children, they may end up marrying someone half their age (oh, and by the way, I had a family who's father was the tender age of eleven, the poor kid's voice hadn't broke and already he was a dad, awesome!). These are people where you can see the interlocking mechanisms take place all the time, you can see them work, you can see them travel to and from, you can see them interact with the world around them.The simulation doesn't stop at people, it simulates wildlife and nature, you cannot just plop down a forester and assume that's the end to your lumber woes, it doesn't work that way in the real world, it won't work that way in banished. It takes time for trees to grow and mature, time for your foresters to build up an efficient cycle of logging, planting, and treetending, and as a result, much like everything else within Banished, every change you make is rarely immediate in it's effect, but it -has- an effect, and it's cumulative in nature. If you ever wanted a perfect exemplar of ""the butterfly effect"", this game can teach you far better than many textbooks.As a result this game requires a level of planning, thinking and pondering which extends far past most normal city builders, it puts it more on the plane of games like Gnomoria, and perhaps it could be seen as an intro to things like Dwarf Fortress (it's a lot less impenetrable than DF thank Armok), but make no mistake, much like such games, it's very capable of whipping around in the blink of an eye and sabotaging several hours of work if you do not take due dilligence when you plan out changes to your village (a single scuffed up plan of mine utterly wrecked what was a solid village of mine, back to the drawing board once more, but from that failure I learned).In the world of banished, the changes -matter-, treat the village with a genuine level of respect and plan your changes with a slow, methodical hand, and the game will reward you with perhaps one of the most intricate and engaging simulations outside of the aforementioned DF. Play it like a straight city builder and you will fail, and then you'll wonder why. Read the manual, do the tutorials, do your research, this game deserves that much out of you if you purchase it.With that, I recommend this game to those who are willing.			"

												I've played city building games since the original Sim City and I'm a big fan of survival/sandbox/crafting games, so this seemed like it'd be the kind of game I'd love.Sadly, Banished has the bare bones feel of an early access game that has been abandoned. In most games of this type, I usually feel like I've barely scratched the surface of what's on offer after 20 hours or so. In Banished, I felt I'd experienced everything after an hour and the novelty was already wearing off. I had already constructed every building type possible. There is no building progression apart from upgrading wooden houses to stone ones. All that was left was to unlock different crops and animals at the randomised trader who visits once per year, which didn't seem compelling enough to keep me going.I am OK with simplicity as long as a game remains fun, but beyond the initial colony construction there's just too little of interest to do in Banished. There is no possibility of cultural or technological advance, no politics, no contact or conflict with other groups, nothing to aim for besides building more of the same stuff and increasing your population. If this was an early access game I'd say the scope for development was huge, but it's not and as things stand it's shallow compared to the competition. You can pick up an older classic like Anno 1404 - with rich diplomacy, upgrades, trade, seafaring etc - for almost nothing these days.My biggest issue given the relatively intimate scale of the game was that I felt no emotional investment. It seems like a wasted opportunity, given how fascinating the intrigue of interpersonal relationships in a new community like this could be. Play Rimworld to experience a masterclass in this. In Banished, I felt no connection to or compassion for my colonists. They're crude identikit stick figures with no personality and little to set them apart or make you care. They all switch jobs constantly depending on who lives closest, with only a basic 'education' stat affecting their efficiency at anything from teaching to stonecutting - good in terms of optimal pathing I suppose, but totally immersion breaking. The colonist AI is woeful, by the way.I have recently had a blast with games like the aforementioned Rimworld and This War Of Mine, in which characters are full of personality and incredible and varied interpersonal stories constantly unfold that really draw you in and made you care. Losing one of my people in either of those games elicited a genuine emotional response. By comparison, Banished felt incredibly hollow. Yet another stonecutter has been crushed by a rock? No worries, another interchangeable faceless drone has automatically taken their place in the pit!The graphics are what I'd expect from a small indie developer. Sadly, Banished has a very clunky modular UI that deviates needlessly from established genre conventions. For example, speeding up and slowing the passage of time - which are easy to locate, always visible and quickly altered with single keystrokes in similar games - are in submenus here, requiring extra clicks or 2 hotkeys to get to. I could live with this if the game was perfect otherwise, but it's symptomatic of deeper issues.Other reviews complain that starvation is too hard to counter, but I found I had no problem as it was easy to feed the colony through the winter by assigning plenty of colonists to fishing.I can see how some people could get into a relaxed, zenlike state whilst playing this and might appreciate its simplicity and lack of progression. However, I feel like I already have plenty of other better games in my library which accomplish that. I'd say if you love building games and want any kind of depth or incentive to persevere, look elsewhere. Or do what I do and try it on sale - it's only a 300Mb download, so it's quick to give it a shot.			"

												Welcome to the future of knights and merchants, without the fighting. Some may like the fact it doesn't have battles while some prefer it. If your looking for a game where NPC's look after themselves, this is it. If you're looking for that but with a little war involved, I suggest you go look at Knights and Merchants (for a relatively low on-sale price)!What is the goal? The goal is to keep your civilians alive as long as you can and expand your village as best as you can. Banished is a game in which you organize the village and the NPC's do as you say. They do not follow your orders directly as they cannot be selected (only for viewing/status purposes). As you head the village, you call the shots on who does what. Say you want to build a house. You will have civilians at your disposal to complete such a task. The trick is choosing the right amount of laborers to be trained civilians. This means you don't want to have all 12 of your competent laborers to be builders. Why? Well, the more of one particular class means less potential for others. I usually hover around having one or two builders at my disposal while very rarely having any free laborers. Other professions include farmer, herdsmen, gatherer, fisherman, hunter, woodcutter (for fire wood), forester, herbalist, blacksmith, brewer, tailor, vendor, trader, miner (for iron), stone cutter (for stone), teacher, physician and cleric. The trick is to properly balance out the professions of each individual. The number one thing to focus on though is food and firewood. If you run out of either you'll start seeing civilians die quickly. Stone and iron can sort of be a rare commodity given how much you build. Your population will start to grow slowly and can sort of be pushed by building new houses. Problem is though, have too big of a population and watch your reserves drift away quite quickly. Before you know it, you'll have messages popping in at the bottom saying your civs are dying. There is a notification system in place by the tool bar (to the bottom right) that indicates if your full or have a shortage of supply. Some of these notifications also include a merchant, a disease or even nomads. Given you have built a trading post along the water, a merchant will appear every so often. New merchants will pop up offering different goods. You can choose to order every time this certain merchant comes to town, once or never. There is a bug in the game where if you kill off all your livestock, it's quite difficult to get them back again. I haven't quite grasped how to get more but I know there is one specialty merchant that will sell livestock to you. There are times instead of taking the livestock to the fields, they will be taken in for raw meat. I'm not sure if this is a bug or a lack of laborers but I wanted to make my reader cognizant of the fact. Merchants also sell seeds and product (such as pears or ale). To combat a disease, one must have a physician and a hospital in the village. Nomads will occasionally show up to your village asking for asylum which is great if your population is low. Again, beware taking in more population as your reserves can deplete quickly. A graveyard can also be built to accommodate the dead and a church to gain followers. There is a catch to getting civilians become skilled tradesmen. You will need to build a school to educate your population. Additions to the game include dirt and stone roads, a town hall that tells you the status of your village and a marketplace. A marketplace evenly distributes reserves (from food to supplies) to your village. Without one, you may have a few needy villagers take most of the supply. Building is relatively easy in game and provides you with a decent amount of options (buildings can also be rotated as needed). You may upgrade wooden buildings to a stone building. Beware though, don't do it all at once. You may leave some citizens homeless!The visuals tend to resemble city skylines almost identically at times. What you see is what you get. The animations themselves are relatively good and you may need to zoom in to see properly. You can get in pretty close and rotate the camera as you please. They're between a cross of realistic and cartoon graphics. The sounds are suitable to the environment. Not exactly diverse but good enough. The music is pretty good and sets the mood and setting appropriately. This is a game where easily you can spend a few hours in without knowing the time. Overall, it's a pretty good game and provides a bit of a challenge trying to keep your citizens alive and well. On the other hand, there are a lot of other unexposed perks that could have been put into the game such as invaders.RATING : 7.3/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign N/A Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability B- Overall  B-ScreenShots :The start of something amazing Arrows indicate that the production has reached it's limit whereas the octagon indicates no work is being done at that location  The merchants in town When nomads arrive, their fate is in your hands My best yet  Luckily, no one got really sick in my village "

												Banished is a spectacular game. I do admit that initially I went in thinking it to be a city builder and thats how I treated it. I bit me back very hard and I was very displeased. But then I really thought about how I was playing. I cahnged it to a more ""initally i'm screwed so husband your resources and educate your folks (so they do things more efficiently)"", and once I started my games with that mentality the game itself became a true challenge and a blast. This is a very well done SURVIVAL game. The Bad....If you get a huge batch of nomads, it can throw you into a death spiral with food or plague (once of my nomad requests brought in almost 50 people, within 5 minutes those 50 added such a strain on my food that half of my city died to starvation). You need to play very methodically. Build here, watch and see if it stabilizes, fix if it doesnt or leave it alone if it does. Rinse and repeat. Growing your population. Holy christ this one can hurt. You basically need to be in a constant state of building new homes (which is rough because that adds more strain on your initially reduced resources). Thats the only way to populate the village/town/city.Sometimes ya just get bad luck. The randomly generated map sometimes just gets ya in a stupid spot. The GreatDamn, this is a fun game. There is always something to fix, tweak or build to make your village/town/city more efficient.Plenty to build, plenty of ways to influence how your city looks and grows (with a forrester you can essentially make ""parks"". Great mods. I recommend the terrains plus and the Banished plus. They both add difficulties and streamline the overall gameplay.Tough as nails. This game was a great challenge to husband your resources and grow in a stable and healthy manner for your folks. ConclusionIf you like to build vast cities off the bat with no challenge, dont buy it.If you want to build a small village, work up to a bustling town, and finally grow to a massive city. But during each step of the way you encounter a good logistical struggle for stability. Buy this game. I cant tell you how much fun this was for me. Great job Shining Rock!			"

												I will not recommend this game, though, it's fun. Reason is, you cannot build a ""stable city"". You have to expand the city as you play the game. Or citizen in you city will get old and die. I don't know why the reproduction of people in this game is so poor.1 house can be occupied by 5 people. But, when the time past, people die. And another family member won't reproduce until you build a new house. So they will move in and start to reproduce 1 or maybe 2 kids.			"

												This game is good, flwaless in fact with the things it does, it's the things that this game does not do that is where the problem lies, as a stright up villiage builder its great but there are many aspects to the game that you need to know before blowing $20 on it,1, all the F**kING VILLIAGERS ARE GLUTTONS, i had a reaaly nice town with 1,000 potatos, plums, and venison and by winter its all gone. how is a poplulation of 80 people eat 1,000 of those items EACH.2. Crops, some grow in winter and some grow in spring, not in this game all crops even pumpkins only grow in the start of SPRING, like no thought went into this, apples grow in Fall right? not here only in spring, so you have to make sure that you have a huge surplus of food or people die left and right.3, as the game progresses it feels as if your people get lazy i hade 50 laborers cut down a small segment of trees, rocks, and iron and it took them 4 seasons to cut a ♥♥♥♥ing 20x20 set of land, why?4, trade costs, these things are outragous to grow your community and have a tavern to sell beer and keep your people happy you'll need new seed depending on the random roll you got when you started the game, some merchants you can buy seeds off of but you need 3,000 units of your items to apparently buy 1 pack of wheat seed to make beer with, now that would not be a problem but not all merchants take every item so your trading post could be 50% full of the wrong ♥♥♥♥ing things and you would have no idea.lastly some buildings you just don't build like a school house or an herbalist, i went through a game with a pop of 900 on hard mode, no one ever got sick, there was never a tornado, its as if the games selling point on being ready for ♥♥♥♥ to hit the fan seems to be broken and or just gone on some map seeds, and the school house, that bonus where it make your villiagers work better and produce more is all just a dice roll some of my wood cutters and stone cutters produce alot of stone and wood being uneducated ive also had the same thing happen with stone and woodcutters being educated, the game is just too damn inconsistant, when i do a thing the first time i expect that same thing to happen again on a different map seed			"

												Very little variety in gameplay. Aside from terrain differences, no town is really any different/harder than another.City grows and expands, but 100 years in the future and you still have the exact same, terribly insulated houses that you did when you started, for example.Yes, it's a one-person dev team, but expecting over $20 for this at normal price is way too high for the content. Oh, and the AI is atrocious. Fires are the most dangerous thing ever, not because they burn down your buildings, but because the majority of your villagers don't try to put them out, even when idle and with a well nearby, not starving, happy, and educated. It's a mystery.			"

												This game caught me a bit by surprise, with my purchase entirely decided by an intense longing to play Settlers 2 again, and that it looked very pretty. It's about making Medieval civilization in the wilderness, starting with a group of twenty hardened fiends who have been BANISHED (the game doesn't say what for but I think murders), and seeing how big you can get. There's no external military threats, it's just a question of if you can balance your expansion, production, transportation and all that other stuff that makes a town tick, without everyone dying. Pure sandbox, no aim in mind beyond what you want to set yourself.My first few settlements predictably toppled over, when we ran out of food/firewood/clothes/all of the above, but eventually I settled into a nice, soothing rhythm of building and consolidating. Stuff takes time to happen, so you can't charge around building farms and smithies and whatnot, you get there gradually, and with planning. Secure basic food, fuel and shelter in the first year, scavenge materials, plant trees, open a smithy a few years in, maybe barter for some chickens, a few more houses, a bridge over a stream...seasons tick by at a leisurely pace while you think about what you want to do in the next decade, or how you're going to create enough food to support the next twenty people.It's not frantic, and once you know what you're doing there's not much that can surprise you, but sometimes you just want to do that, build up your little decorative fishtank of farmers and quarrymen. I think what it sets out to do, it accomplishes excellently, but the lack of surprise and novelty will (I think) stop me playing in the long run. There's nothing grandiose to shoot for, like Pharaoh's monuments, there's no pressing reason to keep expanding. Beyond occasional gimmicky disasters, you're mostly going to be staring at the streets, weighing up whether a tunnel would be a good use of stone, and adjusting the worker distribution to pump out a few more iron tools.It's relaxing, it's reasonably deep, it's pretty, just don't expect too much in the way of an epic saga and you won't be disappointed.

												While the game does a lot of things right, there are many plain awful things about the game. The most important one is that when you've ""cracked"" the code on how to survive, there's not much challenge, except some random things thrown at you which you have no control over. Many bugs are still in the game, but most of them are simply annoyances. All in all you can get a few hours fun from this game, but once you get the hang of it, there's really not much to see.			"

												I bought it on sale for 6$, and for that price it was an enjoyable enough game. But, after a while it stopped really having much to do. You do the same things over and over and over again working slowly -- emphasis on the slowly -- to expand your settlement. If you expand to fast you die; if you expand too slow you also die. Leaving you with this middle ground of ""just right"" expansion speed that really makes the game incrediably dull. It takes forever to do much of anything, and for large chuncks of the game I was waiting on the merchant to bring me animals. I gave up after 10 years with out a single merchant bringing animals. I did have the same guy turn up six times in a row selling the same single type of fruit I had started with. That really sums up the game you can be doing everything right and end up screwed over because the AI is just awful. I'm sure other reviewers have mentioned the issue where people starve because the farmers  won't go harvest their crops -- that happened. But even worse than that was the total illogical issue where the game seems to struggle with allocating materials in logical ways.Even with low caps set on EVERYTHING that used wood were still freezing to death because EVERY SINGLE OTHER THING that needed wood got it before the woodcutter. It's so frustrating to have to micromange things that the AI should be smart enough to figure out.			"

												If you think you're good at management sims, you should step up and try Banished. It will humble you. Unless you do everything right and provide for about 17 different needs for all your people at all times without fail or delay, people are going to die. A lot of people. The game's resource generation vs consumption is incredibly tilted against you. Unless you have fully educated villagers using the best tools and wearing the warmest clothing and in exactly just the right amount of houses (not too few, not too many), it's a long slow slide into starvation and desperation. My village has been going about 43 years, but because villagers apparently age at 4 times the normal rate (I started off with 10 villagers in their 20s, and within 5 years the oldest ones in the village were in their 40s easy) there have been generations of turnover, especially due to all the starvation. You can't farm enough. You can't forage enough. You can't mine enough, you can't quarry or herd or smith or log enough, fast enough. At my peak, my village boasted almost 100 residents. After about a 20 year recession that worsened into depression (not helped by the frequently completely useless merchants that came to call, no I don't want to buy your stupid pumpkin seeds, I already grow my own, why the hell didn't you bring iron), I'm back under 30 residents, mostly from starvation. The game plays very similar to Tropico or Gnomoria in that instead of controlling individual villagers you simply order the places for them to live and work built, and manage as a taskmaster/city planner. It starts off kind of easy because a new map will have abundant resources just lying on the ground around you... but once you use that up, it's much slower and more expensive to mine it/cultivate it/quarry it. There are no goblin attacks, no rebels, no hurricanes or zombies... just your silent mental wail as you watch people under your charge wither and die because your skills at management were a single iota less than divinely perfect.

												Let me just say right off the bat that if Banished were a game of SimCity's scale, it would definitely land into my ""top five favorite city-builders"" list. And maybe it will, once mod support is finally added. If it's actually added. Dear god, please just add it. It's going to lead to amazing things, I know it.So what are we dealing with here? You've probably seen the words ""city-builder"", ""survival"" and ""strategy"" words getting tossed around. Imagine SimCity set in medieval times, but on a much lesser scale. Remember Stronghold 1? Take the economic aspect out of that. Add Children of the Nile to the mix, minus all the monkeys. Splice those suckers together. Bam! You get Banished.If that sounds exciting to you, then by all means, go nab the game. But first be aware that:- There are no quests, no war, no enemies, no money, no research. It's pure and simple ""build"" and ""survive"", or ""build to survive"" in this case. Also trade weed for chickens! Exciting.- There are randomly occuring disasters to spice up the gameplay, but the rate at which they happen remains a complete mystery to  me. My last hard game had none occur during the 50 years span. My normal game before that had two tornadoes in a row. Ho hum.- All in all, this game doesn't have much to offer: if you're familiar/experienced with the genre, there's a good chance that it'll only take you a few playthroughs to figure out the game's mechanics and grow a large town, at which point it becomes a very tedious experience... Until you start anew.- Finally, there's no end and no goal. If you really MUST have that sense of ""accomplishment"", you're gonna have to resort to achievement hunting, or set your own goals.BUT!- There's STILL a considerable amount of depth in this game. The only way to truly succeed is through careful management, strong infrastructure and a wee bit of luck. Do you enjoy bossing tiny pixel people around? Then boy oh boy, is this the game for you.- It is ridiculously addicting, so you better get some coffee before tapping that play button. Don't say I didn't warn you.- The lack of a goal is not necessarily a bad thing. While it may sound off-putting, that's where your imagination comes to play. There's not much room for roleplaying here, but planning your village's layout and dealing with terrain obstacles on each newly generated map is fun and exciting, like in any sandbox game.- IT WAS MADE BY ONE PERSON, FOR GOD'S SAKE, so mad props for that!My verdict? I certainly got my money's worth here. Good city sims are a rare sight nowadays, and the (hopefully) upcoming mod kit just might improve the game tenfold with the help of community. So good luck, and full speed ahead.			"

												Banished has a lot of potential but it really fails to live up to this, as a result of poor AI and obsure mechanics. I have fond memories of playing it when it first came out for many hours, but always the same frustrations arise.The game is challenging, but for the wrong reasons. Not because it is designed well, but because it is designed poorly. You are often forced to deal with chain reactions as a result of a 'bottleneck of stupidity,' usually a villager hording a material for no reason or not building a vital construction despite it being prioritised. Eventually, the town will become large enough so that any challenge (read: AI stupidity) is made irrelevant so you just keep expanding and expanding with the same buildings again and again.I have a number of questions concerning the game.Why do villagers keep idling for no apparent reason?Why does health gradually decline despite all needs to stabilise it being met?Why does one household decide to horde the entire harvest of a particular crop, plunging the village into starvation?Is there an answer to these? Probably. But no answer is surrendered by the game; very rarely do I have the feeling that I am fully aware of what is going on.I greatly admire the ability of one man to create this game, but really, it is more like an alpha after being released for over two years.I really *don't* want to give this game a negative review because really, it can be enjoyable. But I don't feel that I can give it a positive one.			"

												I never buy games at release, but after looking at reviews and videos, some of which were not entirely positive, I thought I saw something I liked in it, and decided to pick it up. After spending 11 hours (so far) playing it, this is not a decision I regret.I'm not saying I that I haven't found things in it that could be improved, but there's nothing so far that NEEDS to be improved or fixed in it. Nor have I encountered any bugs, large or small - and my entire play time so far has been in a single session.So, if you're into city building games with a bit of challenge, I think you would not want to miss out on this one.

												A never ending fun game, with it's mod it makes them even more playable also enjoyable. I got this on sale though.There's a few things you NEED to know, *the mods disable achievements* (If you're an achiev hunter)It's a good city builder, not many bugs. worth buying at sale, good for spending timeat work or just losing time,Pros: + Awesome tutorial+ Good realism+ Awesome weather and disasters effects+ Replayability after you learn the game+ Good mapsCons:- Not very good sound sometimes- Gets easy- Not as colorful as I'd like but you can mod it- They starve outta the nowhere8,5/10 "

												Banished is possibly the most challenging city sim. That i have ever played. The game is extremely punishing to those who go in there thinking ""Oh it's just like Sim City"" lol. No, it isn't. This game is very detailed in almost every aspect to how your town is from the overall health of your citizens, happiness, and, how many jobs are there avaiable as well as citizens. I mean seriously this game has a graph to keep track of progress of every little thing from resources, to population, to supplies. This game is very well informative. Plus the tutorials are also a big help. The developers really put a lot of hard work into the game. Just make sure you keep your citizens happy and use critical thinking skills in applying to the needs of your citizens and you should be fine :)Plus this game has a modding community behind it. To make the game better or slightly easier for newcomers to the game.The only downside to this game is the overall ""disasters"" In this game it's either natural (tornadoes, fires) or medicial (diseases, and such). With that being said, The game doesn't have any bandits, wolf attacks, or neighboring towns for you to take over. Lol, yes i know what your thinking ""But um this is a building city simulation. Not some sort of RTS conquest"" and yes i get that. However the disasters happen rarely. Sometimes not at all. This game is a great time killer. But that is actually the problem. Lol, i want to be more active with my village. Maybe trade it with other villages that I have created, or defending my town from bandits and wolves, or take over other towns that are randomly generated on the map. Perphaps share the world space with a friend who has the game as well?If the developers are going to make a second Banished game. I sincerely hope they add more ""disasters"" in the game. It's a great start, plus the game overall should keep you busy. Not everyone will like this game because of these elements or lack of certain elements. But hey who knows maybe a modder will make something like this in the near future? So don't get your hopes upAll and all. If you like delicate city building simulations. This game is for you. "

												Banished might be the perfect metaphor for humanity. Once you’ve mastered an expanding economy (which takes some doing), you will continue to grow, filling the space that has been provided to you. Eventually you will run out of most natural resources. You will desolate every inch of the wilderness in your quest for preservation. Soon you will have too many mouths to feed and not enough jobs to go around. Despite this, your people will continue to breed relentlessly until starvation makes them unable to work, collapsing the economy until every last man, woman and child is dead.That’s the game. "

												If you like Anno, think Sim City could have been better and love a challenge, Banished is the game for you! Great simulation (each person has a family, job, home, needs) that you can observe and influence, randomly generated maps, wide range of difficulty settings, no set goals. Very intriguing food system that you have to tune to keep your people alive. The only issue I have is that you can not individually lock / unlock your storage barns for certain materials and that people tend to starve during ""the long walk"" passing filled markets.Recommendation: Buy this game!

												Also known as Kino's Journey Simulator 2014.Don't Let The Idiots Live, Ever.Banished! You and your sect of friends, family, feeble, and rabble have been banished from your home kingdom/city-state/fuedal village for whatever closed-minded reason, and have decided to settle your own hamlet/city/empire.Now, Banished is an attractive, medeival-looking city building game where you construct a small town out of the landscape around you, and then watch it wither away into dust as the idiots fail to harvest their own fields stay in that simple stage until the Netherworld (read:hell) freezes over.Sounds a bit boring, right? If not, go back to watchin' that paint dry.If it does sound slightly... bland, that's because you've not heard the terrors provided by nature. Remember the Oregan Trail? Dysentery is going to look like gold once you're done being Banished.The cold kills, diseases kill, idiots can't harvest enough crops to feed themselves, nomads will flood your town, the mines and quarries kill, mothers die in childbirth, there's a stabbing at the market! A fire!Hope you built a hospital to quell that plague, or some wells to keep your wooden shacks from burning like the Cleveland river. The stabbings can't be helped, people are just evil, sometimes.That's all just the general layout, too. Really, anything could kill the villagers - even themselves.But, the game also gives you all sorts of chances and options to thrive. Most basic needs are easy to access, and come in that wonderfully stepped system of mine, build, die horribly, profit. And people are resilient and happy if they're given the right help, so build that school! Learn 'em up!And now, my personal experience with Banished:Had the luck to spawn on a large lake where a river emptied out, so fishing was a quick way to grab food. Forests all around, and not many mountains, so plenty of supplies at the ready for my town. Soon, was running a village of happy, healthy people and managed to have it grow beyond the lake and into the wilderness, with nearly sixty educated people.Seeing a large, flat stretch of land close by, I set farmland out and began growing a crop of pumpkin. Life was good.For atleast five years, that system worked. Until, one day after building a long-awaited chapel and town hall, everything hit the fan with the full force of an atmoic detonation. I made the horrible, awful, absolutely terrible decision to close the school, believing it would benefit me for the time to produce faster rather than in larger yields.Bad, bad move.The now-moronic people of The Land of Equals couldn't create tools nearly as efficiently or quickly as their past relatives, and even with full fields from good weather, would not harvest enough to feed the nearly-120 person population. And the great decline into starvation began, until a decade later, when there were only 17 survivors who'd managed to stay alive and get through schooling.And, as I type, the educated remnants of that Banished pilgrimage are rebuilding with stunning succes thanks to their teaching. But the town hall's charts will forever show the great decline into Idiocy, and the impact it had upon The Land of Equals.So, TL;DR short, Banished is amazing. It can be calming, or stressful. It can give you a warm feeling of care, or a cold feeling of despair. If you take the challenge, be prepared for anything. AND NOW THERE'S MODS! =D9.1247/10			"

												I would recommend this game to everyone, despite what sort of gamer you are, it's an overall amazing game, i have only just bought the game myself, i have been meaning to buy it for a while, but was a little concerned if it would run on my system, so today i decided to finally buy it, and well, it works completely perfectly, no issues at all.This game personally is the BEST game i have bought in a long time, i look forward to many future amazing updates for this game, it's an easyish game to get into to start with, i have a bad habbit of starting the game on hardest difficulty all the time when i start a new game for the first time, difficulty wise, i belive this game only offers a starting difficulty, and after that the game is at it is, by this i mean, if you start on easy, you get a nice little set up, then meduim you get less, and hard you get nothing pretty much, which i started on and them all my people died of stavation sadly..... then my next lot of people died again... and then again.... but i'm slowly getting better :P, hopfully soon i can finally get myself sorted food wise to avoid my people dieing.Overall, this game is a MUST BUY, if you like building type games, ect: then this game is for you, gather resources, build you're settlement up, watch you're settlement grow and grow, or watch it crumble and have you're people die from starvation or in a terrible disaster. 5 star!

												I want to recommend this game, I really love it. But there's one game mechanic which just ruins everything . . . starvation. When you build a house and it becomes occupied, the people who move in will take whatever they need from your reserves of food and fuel and they will never ever share it.So picture this, a house with a 75 year old person in it, fully stocked with firewood, coal and food. The house next door has a family of 6 and they freeze to death, the family next door to them has a family of 4 and they starve to death. With this game mechanic you will lose lots of people, over and over again when it is not necessary, and there is no mod to correct it.			"

												I will start off with saying I put in over 160 hours into the game, according to steam. So with that in mind, I love the balance that the game provides. There is survival, there is city building, there is economy, and death. There is not much of a story to the game, so dont come in expecting to be thrown into a story while you build, you wont find that here. This game is a sandbox. Great modding community though. But its still a sandbox. And what keeps you going after you get the hang of the game is achievement hunting. So many failed towns, so many lives lost in the hunt. Let's take a moment of silence for all the abandoned towns that have perished trying to achieve the ultimate achievements. Alright. Thank you. Anyways.. Its a fun little game that if you love hunting them achievements, this game will keep you interested for a while, or if you love playing around with mods, this is also a thing that kept me hooked for the slow hours of the game. Personally, I love the concuction of the balance of the game, and in fact, I'm going to go play it a little bit more now, still hunting that one ""have a town of 300 people"" achievement. Keep running out of food for my people. Anyways, even with no multiplayer or Co-op I still reccomend the hell out of this game. Goes great with listening to podcasts! =D			"

												When I saw that a game like this was published, I really enjoyed the thought of having the possibility to play an Anno again. Building a town, furfilling the needs of my population, trading etc. After playing a few hours I just felt betrayed. There is no real enemy but the AI. Villagers do basicly what they want, even if you give them another order, people die of ridiculous reasons (my chicken sheperd got trampled to death...), plagues or tornados nearly have no effect on my population and even on the highest difficulty the game bored me. Why? Here are some reasons:- Most of the time I waited for the children to grow up, time I was forced to do nothing but watch the poorly animated people- There is absolutly no progress. Yes, your town grows. But unlocking technology through building schools? Nope. Getting better buildings because your builders get more experienced or receiving a better education? Nope. - Any competition against another AI? Nope. You are absolutly alone. Without any threat. So what's the point in building and enhancing your city? - It is too easy. Even without any alien danger, there could have been something. Maybe an economy you have to keep going (things like a currency for payments, work time, trading special rescources for happyness etc)  or citizens leaving your town to form a own community. There is enough potential in this game to furfill those things...These are my main reasons why I don't recommend buying this game. If you are looking for a challenge, don't buy this game. If you just want to build a town without any difficulty, without any point and just wait for things to happen, then this game is really a thing.			"

												I like this game, but I can't recommend it at full price. There just isn't enough there. On the whole, Banished is an exceptionally slow game. This isn't necessarily a bad thing; it gives you far more control over your village, but the player grows past the speed pretty fast, and then you're stuck staring at the screen waiting for the glacier to move.  Population is the biggest thing, as it crawls up so slowly creating new, necessary jobs to keep your town alive is difficult. Seasons pass without much fuss or difference. I never had a problem with starvation or disease or... well, anything, and I was playing on medium. It felt like easy. I went 20+ years in game time without a single disaster, although I had it turned on. If you're going to have a disaster system, you should have a disaster system. The trading system takes about five years to start even after you build your dock, and then they only trickle in once every two to three years if you're lucky, and they only ever bring one or two items. Better hope it's what you want. Ordering my sheep took well over ten after the traders started coming, although I was very excited when I finally got them. Excited over buying sheep- the citybuilder life. Citizens seem to constantly swap jobs around with no rhyme or reason. They almost basically refuse to move outside the town's radius to harvest resources, and as of such you find yourself running out. You can't prioritise what business gets the resources first, so it ends up being grabbed by whoever wants it over the business that actually needs it (logs & the woodcutter). The hunter AI is absolutely moronic- I watched one stroll casually through a herd of deer, then wander off, still apparently working. This was not an isolated incident. The tiny size of the hunter's radius is another big no- I would've expected it to be a great deal larger because surprise, animals move around the map. I liked they didn't hunt them to extinction though. Coupled with the hunter's terribad abilities is the lack of leather, which creates hide coats, which is a main trading chip along with firewood and iron tools. They also keep your citizens warm, but whatever, they're worth a lot at the trading post. #priorities The music is beautiful, the graphics are nice, and I love the trees when they're mid way through growing (pine trees, but tiny. it's adorable). It's a charming game, and a decently relaxing one too (I do say this as someone who has never had a disaster, though. I imagine that raises the stress level). The controls are lovely, although in a game with micromanagement there needs to be... an easier way to do a couple of things? For instance, I should be able to stockpile items I don't want the town to use, I would've also liked the ability to move things from a storage unit to another- think Pharaoh, and 'accept all/get maximum'. (to those of you who have never played Pharaoh, do so ASAP. it's my favourite city builder by a longshot, and holds up extremely well despite how old it is... but set speed at 90%, not 100%). So, in short. I guess I like Banished, It's enjoyable, but it's mind-numbingly slow, even for a citybuilder, which aren't exactly known for their high action gameplay. I think it's worth $5, but it's not worth $20, so buy it on sale and give it a go if you like games that are slow paced.			"

												I have played just about every single kind of strategy game. all the way from the Civilization series to Divinity Dragon Commander. with Civilization being the world builder and divinity being the combat game. But i have never ever been able to find a game where i could just build. just expand my civilization. without dragons comming and ♥♥♥♥ing everything up. but now i have finally found it, and its name is Banished. Banished is a fantastic game, i cant even praise it enough, the graphics and crisp and beautiful, with the nature feeling basically alive. the music is relaxing as all hell. and the ai is suprisingly fantastic. compared to games like Castle Story where the AI basically is a can of ♥♥♥♥ the ai in Banished moves as they should, they do as they should. basically it all just comes together to form one hell of an awesome strategy game that will keep you entertained for hours. you want proof? this rigth here is me playing through some of it

												Addictive, fun, yet boring.This is a city building game which starts off as just pure survial and keeping your people alive, then slowly turns into a city management game.  The first part being somewhat more engaging.  Also a fire, followed by a tornano, followed by a fire followed by a shark attack (OK maybe I imagined the sharks eating my last 50 citizens) while at first seems ridiculus and game ending at first.  It was actually quite a bit of fun to try and come back from.  WHile the game does offer acheivements to earn it seems quite a bit open as to what the goals are, there's no progression per say since you can build any type of building from the start (other than aquiring all the crop types and livestock types).  This actually i think is a good thing.  Theres also tons of mods for this game which is cool too, in fact while in game you can look at mods to get.  I found this game fun to play as long as I was playing for fun, if you take my meaning.			"

												So, having logged 104 hours into the game and completed roughly 75% of the achievements, I figured I would sit down and write a review/recommendation for Banished.  Overall, this game is amazing.  It's got multiple (and I mean multiple) elements to consider in order for the player to achieve a healthy, happy, thriving community.  However, the basic mechanics are pretty easy to learn and the tutorials, while being somewhat bare minimum, are enough to at least get the player happily started on his own dreams of popuation building domination.  As I've played the game I've noticed: - Having auto-pause on tabbing out is wonderful.  Some people may be annoyed by this, but since the player's population can go from happily frolicking through fields full of plums and cherries to attempting to cut down trees or mine rocks with their bare hands, puking their guts out and then trying madly to find the nearest hospital while shivering from the cold... all in a few moments on 10x speed... yeah.  Hurray for auto-pause so the population doesn't die while the player decides to load up youtube and watch a 2 minute video.- Merchants in ships do not seem to use their spyglasses to look for supplies when deteriming which trading post to visit. When given the choice between a trading post full of workers and materials vs. a trading post with two lonely workers struggling to load 10 barrels of apples into an empty warehouse, guess which one the merchant picks fifty percent of the time? That's right!  He visits the seedy looking trading post with a few apples and completely bypasses the ten workers in the supply-laden trading post waving welcome signs and cheering. Sigh.- One basket of produce left in a farmer's field over the winter somehow magically prevents that farmer from planting seeds or harvesting crops from any of the rest of his field the next planting season.  I realize the basket probably does take up five feet of space, but Mr. Farmer, honestly, you can just walk around it. I promise. Or better yet, take it to the storehouse so it is actually useable.- All hunters in this game should be provided with a gps and a gun safety manual.  Hunters can produce an amazing amount of leather and venison in just one season.  Left to themselves, even alone in that huge mansion of a hunting lodge they get, one hunter can produce enough to feed a small army IF they are smart enough to find the deer standing outside the front door and not walk past them to aimlessly search for deer three miles away.  When they do eventually find a herd of deer, hunters seem to throw caution to the wind and take out as many of the cervine as they can, eventually hunting them to extinction and leaving no animals for the following several years.- Actions taken by the populace of each city give the player a sense of a helpful, industrious community bent on serving others and helping with daily tasks.  This is awesome and probably would be the ideal scenario for any group of people who were banished to a remote location and forced to rely on one another to survive.  I love that farmers will help carry supplies to build houses, miners will sacrifice time and energy to carry logs from the storage area to a build site, and the local brewmaster will even leave the pub to help someone down the road carry his basket of fish to the storehouse as soon as he has extra time.  However, this is hell when the player's wonderful generous workers decide to help the person waaaay on the other side of the map, or to help clear a group of trees approximately nine hundred miles away, leaving their own jobs to stagnate and become unproductive.  Upon realizing that nine hundred miles was probably slightly too far to walk in one season, they then try to return to their homes and jobs, only to become famished and cold since they apparently left without coats or a lunchbox...or a tractor trailer loaded with all the stuff they'd need to not die before they got back to town.- As it stands now, when building fields, orchards, and pastures, the player is unable to see how many workers will be required to serve at these locations once they are actually built.  While somewhat amusing, it is also pretty frustrating since this results in juggling workers back and forth unless the player has the size-to-worker ratio already memorized.- WTB: the ability to toggle trees, stone, iron, and other terrain features on and off in order to be able to see what is being built where, to be able to plan roads that actually go in a straight line, and to have better city planning ability in general.- Grats to the developer on coming up with some character names that made me laugh out loud several times.  I personally got kicks and giggles out of having three versions of the name ""Orill"" pairing up with ""Colon"" in the stone house I built for them and then surviving happily ever after presumably meeting each others needs quite well until their eighties.- Every once in a while, even the most robust woodcutter needs to see the herbalist for a remedy.  This works quite well, until the player realizes that their woodcutter should have gone much earlier, because even though his information tells the player that he is visiting the herbalist, he is hallucinating since the herbalist hut has not been built yet and said herbalist will not exist for the next two years.So, in conclusion, after a very long commentary and review, there are quite a few small tweaks to gameplay that need to be ironed out, but for a 1.0 release this game is incredible and impressive not only graphically but in its ability to release (for the most part) without a hitch.  I look forward to Banished 1.0.1 and beyond!			"

												City Builder just doesn't capture what Banished it. Call it a ""civilization builder"" and you're closer to it, because you don't just have to build them a place to live, provide them with resource and protect them from disasters, you also have to protect from themselves.You're in control of some kind of communist-anarchist utopia where there is no money and everyone has ""equal"" (first come, first served) access to resources, but where everyone acts like a greedy consumerist! They'll take as many resources as they need/can from the public storage without any consideration for other people (they'll happily watch their neighbours starve while they have food for a full month) and will rather have their civilization collapse than regroup in houses during harsh times to save on fuel.That said, it's an enjoyable (but very harsh) game that will reward your good planning skills by not screwing you at the first occasion and has some great potential with mods coming along in the next few weeks (depending on how much can be changed/added in these).But it's also a very harsh game that might not very be enjoyable if you just want to place good looking buildings/roads all over the place (building diversity is at the bare minimum, as you'd expect from a small medieval community struggling to survive) for only the sake of making a good-looking city, buy SimCity, not Banished.And if all these points seem fine to you, then you should expect a lot of late nights spend building (and rebuilding) medieval villages and possibly a few ""damn it's 3am already!""

												I really enjoyed the time I spent with it but I didn't really see a reason for me to keep playing, I saw pretty much everything the game had to offer in my first session. The brutal difficulty that had been reported by many was not something I experienced at all. I actually found the game to be a bit easy and I didn't feel challenged playing on medium difficulty. I feel that the game doesn't provide enough incentive to return unless you fail repeatedly which I didn't. It really is a wonderfull achievement on behalf of the single developer who created it, but when faced with competition such as anno it falls a little short.			"

												I bought this game because i thought hey, im bored. Thankfully this game awards my boredome with a challenge that is unforgiving in a positive way. The first city i built actually worked, until my people forgot to have babies and all died of old age. My second city woked until the hurican landing right in the middle. In the third city i finally got far enough to start farming, leading to my population starving. (don't ask, im dumb) Still this game manages to give you a challenge that is incredibly hard, then shoots you in the knee. (once again, im very bad at this game) Still, i find myself coming back again and again for more and loving it. If i were to describe it i would say a graphically pleasing, less random f*** you version of dwarf fortress (yes, i love dwarf fortress, got a pop of 500 in my fort right now). Currently i would rate this game a 4.5/5 with it only not getting a 5 because i would prefer some more clarity in the guide, one crash I expierienced twice (autosave saved my progress perfectly though so this point is kind of mute) and that i believe, just like kerbal space programm, this game really needs mods. (modsupport currently in development but i do not rate things that are not here yet)For anyone who likes strategy, citybuilding orchallenging scenarios i would highly recomend this game.			"

												If you look at the screenshots and see a game that you're interested in, this game is for you.  Like Anno without combat, randomly generated lands with city planning and a disaster rate you choose.This is the calmest game I've ever played.  Payday 2 is on the opposite end of the spectrum.On the same rating scale, this is near to Payday 2 in my mind.  Hard to rate this a 8/10 when the basic premise is to relax and not be so rigid with your thinking.'Moving Screenshots'

												This game takes city building in a different direction. It's not like the Sim City games (The GOOD ones, so definetly not SIm City 2013) or Cities XL, which I do not own but I've soon my friends who love city building games play it and it looks good and they say it's amazing. No Banished is different from traditional city builders where what you build is dependent on the money you have and what poeple want. In those games you're the mayor of your town of >insert name here< and you are there to serve the people that move in because that's government. In Tropico you are the dictator and you have a lot more freedom though the things you do may get you in trouble and it won't take long for you to figure out what to do to succeed (Still a fun game though with a great sence of humor). In Banished, there is no one to please, no income, no hand holding and no dumbing things down just because things should be simple.Banished adds survival and RTS elements to the city building genre. You start off with a few people, a few resourses and no real instructions (which would be nice for a few things.). It's like Minecraft, there is no shame in going online to look up information on what to do and you may end up failing many times before getting the hang of the game and even then you still need to be careful. What you end up doing is creating farms, houses, tailors, woodcutters and other jobs slowly and allocate the amount of people you want to work that job and you can even adjust the max number of people allowed to work on that location. And if your like me, at least early on, you'll find yourself constently re-allocating people depending on the season. That's another thing that this game has is the seasons which will affect things like crops. For instance, you can't grow crops when there's snow during late Autumn through Winter, so during this time you move people from growing crops to other jobs.Now one might think that since the player relies that much on the citizen's A.I.'s, if the game is glitchy then they're screwed. And they'd be right. HOWEVER, that is not the case here. Aside from one issue I had with crops that might be due to the A.I., I never had a problem and seem to be someone who gets glitches most gamers don't get. It's so well made that when I fail I have no one to blame but myself. The game did what I asked it to but I should have done something different. This game is so optimized I've never had a problem with frame rate and it takes up such a small amount of hard drive space! I find it amazing that this game was made by one person where games like Day One: Garry's Incedent are made by a group of people and fail on things like collision and even things that can be fixed by simply changing a number. (Seriously, why can't the gun in that game kill people who are wearing nothing but a piece of cloth?) Or even big dev teams with a big name company backing them releasing broken, incomplete games (Looking at you EA).I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys city building. This is a game that can end up taking a lot of time out of you day. I bought it on a Friday and Sunday night I realized that not only have I not reach year 100 yet but it's actually 1 in the morning Monday and I have homework I forgot to do. This is something that has never happened to me with any city building game. Here I really felt incharge and what I say I want my people to do they will and when I fail, it's not to a glitch or poor A.I. but to my own mistake. ""I should have had more hunters and less fisherman."" or ""Should have made my sheep farm bigger."" I'm not even really one to play these types of games because I always failed at Sim City as a child. This game has definitly held my interests and I would even say it might be worth getting when it's not on sale. (Which pretty much when I buy all my games)			"

												Essentially, Banished is a very simplistic version of SimCity, placed in a time period where your biggest concerns were the ones directly related to survival. There's no technology or development tree or anything, allowing the player to freely choose in what ways to progress in his or her town. The citizens have vague needs, so you can choose how to satisfy them. A town can be based on any and all production facilities, and so long as you have some form of surplus, you can trade to acquire things that you yourself are not producing. Finding balance in population expansion and resource production is still a challange, and a quite enjoyable one at that. The AI of the villagers is about average though, and there are still some things that need improved, such as the deer walking across lakes and rivers... or hunters dying of starvation when there are animals in their front yard. Overall, 4 of 5 stars.			"

												It is very early in the year but so far this is the best game that has come out so far. Think of the Anno series or Age of Empire series but have it more about survival from teh cold, food and natural disasters. The village you craft will be the new home for the banished people. Along the way you will build all kinds of things as you try to get a nice village made for you're people. Older people die, there kids get older and you have a new generation of people to deal with. It is a very challenging game, but at the same time some how relaxing (like Anno is for me), highly reccomended. Great gameplay, nice art design, fantastic atmosphere, great immersion, good UI and its just a blast to play. Mix in survival elements into the city building genre and you have my personal favorite strategy game since Anno2070 and Total War Shogun2. It really is amazing that only one person made this game. You WILL fail at times but you will learn and improve and each time you start a new game things can and will go differently but you have some new designs and ideas from previous games that might help!Go buy this game right now if you want a survival game mixed with a city building game, fantastic indie game and a early MUST BUY for 2014. Two thumbs way up from Kozzy.			"

												Banished is a strategy game where you start on a seeded map with some basic supplies and must build, maintain and grow a society, while managing your resources and keeping your people healthy and alive. It is a little more difficult than it sounds as players can easily run out of food and starve to death, grow old and die, or get sick, especially during the winter. There is no end-game to Banished, you essentially just keep playing until you no longer feel like maintaining your society, or until everyone is dead. It doesn't have a very good tutorial system, so there is a little bit of a learning curve to the game. It has a level of difficulty to it, which makes it a challenge, but the lack of direction or an end-game makes the game repetitive after a certain point. All in all it's still fun to play and challenging.			"

												I want to like this game, but I just can't.The AI in this game is some of the worst I have ever seen. Villagers will not priortise their work, no matter how hard you try to get them to do the right thing. There is no ability to move resources from A to B (such as making sure the food from the store goes to the house that needs it). And the assignment of villages to tasks is just infuriatingly difficult.I know this isn't an RTS like AoE, Empire Earth or Stronghold but I much prefer those games as ""town building sims"".The game is pretty, but a bit lacking on content. You have a handful of buildings and thats it. You can get more via the workshop, but this is really a review of just the game.			"

												“Banished” is a city builder, pure and simple.  There’s no zombies, wizards, dragons or roving bands of raiders to fight off.  You start the game with a group of people that have been exiled from elsewhere and your task is to build a medieval-style community from scratch.  There are no buildings to unlock, since they’re all available to build from the start as long as you have the available resources.  There’s nothing to research.  You just need to build things.But don’t make the mistake of thinking it’s very simple; it’s not.  There’s a balance you need to keep: grow your population too quickly and they run out of food and starve to death.  Don’t build your population enough, though, and there’s not enough people left to take over the jobs of those dying of old age or accidents.  Don’t have enough firewood stockpiled and they could freeze to death come winter.It’s a simple game that can be quite complex.  If you’re unsure whether to buy it or not, though, then if the above sounds boring then it’s unlikely to be your kind of game.  If it sounds intriguing then I think you’ll enjoy it.  One thing to keep in mind is that this is a one man developer, so what he’s been able to achieve is pretty remarkable.  Personally, I haven’t encountered any crashes or obvious bugs.Update: One mistake many new players seem to be making is to play their first game on 'hard' mode.  I very strongly recommend starting on 'easy' or perhaps 'medium' the first time.  This will enable you to get to learn the game better, so that when you've built up enough experience you'll have the confidence and knowledge to tackle the game on hard mode.  Playing your first game on hard mode is an extremely steep learning experience, and all but guarantees starvation for your poor unsuspecting people.  Leave that until you have more experience.			"

The potential of this game is crazy but they abandoned it with a terrible AI and bugs all over the place. Nonetheless I had a lot of fun with this little game. The ones that sometimes miss Anno or Rollercoaster can revive old feelings with this. Others should probably just buy a more complex RTS game.Its fairly easy to build up an economy but there is literally no endgame content. I built the highest tier buildings in about 2 hours and then started to get bored... there are no opponents so all you have to do is watch the seasons go by and hope for a trader to offer you sheep ^^			"

												I love simulation/city building/base building/survival games and thought this game would be a good addition to my collection. Maybe the game just isn't for me but I found that it got very boring very soon. It's hard which is good - you have to concentrate to make things work. Although it just doesn't have enough content to keep me interested.Nothing is upradable apart from a wooden house to stone house. There is no progression, only expansion (and expansion is just a replication of all existing assets but building more of the same thing). It's great having mods but even those are limited. Your townspeople characters are just duplicates of each other wearing the same clothes, the music is short and repetative and the graphics are standard 'meh'.I'm glad I bought this game on sale. Considering that for a little extra money you can get the likes of Cities: Skylines which has far more to offer. Banished feels like an unfinished early access game to me. Again, this is just my experience with the game. It seems that there are a lot of people who are enjoying this game, maybe I just don't get it.			"

												Alright, let's establish what Banished is NOT.It's not a city builder like Sim City, it's not a life sim like Sims, it's not a survival/crafting game like Don't starve and it's not an econ sim like Industry Giant. It's a little bit of everything, but Anno on a micro scale might be a pretty fitting description.You basically start the game with a few settlers and various resources/buildings established. You do not have ANY goals, your only goal is to survive and thrive. To do that you're going to build houses, establish an economy and ""produce"" new settlers.That means cutting wood, gathering/hunting/harvesting food, so your citizens won't starve to death, creating building materials, chopping firewood, so your citizens won't freeze to death during winter, and carefully establishing houses and increasing your population, so your city won't simply die out. Blacksmiths create tools for your citizens to work with, trade posts let you trade materials, etc.All in all there is a lot to do. You need to balance your need for expansion with a sustainable economy. If you have too many citizens and not enough of them producing food, then your city will simply starve, which will usually lead to a chain reaction of you losing the game, since dying citizens can't produce more food, but if you take too many citizens away from other production like fire wood, hunting, tailoring or anything concerned with blacksmithing, you will have other issues to contend with. The game can spiral out of control quickly, which is what makes it appealing, I guess. The larger your city grows, the more sprawling your infrastructure becomes, the more challenging the game gets.I would also definitely recommend the Colonial mod, which opens up the game immensely with new buildings.Not so great stuff: The UI could need improvements, several buildings share ""jobs"", so it's a bit finnicky to assign citizens to a specific building. It's also very hard to see dependencies of buildings. You want to build X, but you don't realize that you need to produce Y first...only having icons is not so great. Apart from that I don't have many complaints.Now the obligatory game report:Started my city, everything went pretty well, produced food en masse, unfortunately did not realize that my citizens were getting too old, so my 40 peeps city went down to below 30 pretty quickly. Thankfully my Banished were still in a happy mood and procreated happily. Still that took over 10 years or so, then my food supplies started dwindling, all the while my old guys kept dying, and I still could not make all my children work...damn it. Vicious cycle. After having burnt through about 6,000 units of food (a lot) I almost got back on track, but then my city was ravaged by a disease. I was able to erect a hospital in time and got that under control as well. After that things started to go smoothly again. I played for about 31 years, then I got ""bored"".Banished is a great game, but lacks longevity, unless you are content to just simply sand box your way for hours upon hours. Still, I liked it and getting 5 hours out of it for a product on sale makes it worth it to me :D			"

												Getting rid of the wordy mess that was my previous review.Banished, on the outset, seems very bare-bones and drab.  I wish I could go back and recreate the first few hours I spent on it, watching my townsfolk die within the first year because I had no idea how to accurately meet their needs.  Food was a nightmare, and the game will punish *heavily* any sort of wrong step the player might take.  Planning ahead is crucial, and the learning curve might be steep for some, but once you see your town exceed 200-300 people, thriving with plenty of resources to trade, you will feel a sense of major, satisfying accomplishment.  That never goes away.Now that I've mastered it, I've found a plethora of additional content in the Workshop.  There's all sorts of cool things to do, some rather cheaty, some full-fledged overhauls, some adding to the difficulty.  I expect this to be a game I go to whenever I feel like I have ""nothing to play"".  Banished might look a little gray around the edges, but it is a beautiful, well-oiled machine.			"

												Once you figure out how to progress without starving/freezing all your citizens, it takes off quite nicely. The challenge is at a good place, and it's really addicting. It's exactly what I was looking for in a city building game. I watch Netflix on my other monitor while I build my towns, haha. I'm hoping it will expand with some DLC in the near future; maybe with more structures/commodities like music/entertainment, law enforcement, Bakeries/butchers, faster travel like horse and carriage and even trains and boats eventually. Maybe even different cultures/architecture etc. I'd love to get some Chinese or other Asian style cultures/architecture in there; even South American and Arab and get more varied environments (jungles, deserts, swamps etc). I'd definitely be happy to purchase more DLC/content from this developer for this game, and I'd love to see what else they have in store for the future!Well worth the money if you like a challenging city building game. It doesn't advertise one thing and then ends up being something else. They don't try anything new or risky; it's honestly just good, wholesome city building and resource gathering. Love it.			"

												If you enjoy the Anno games, you will also enjoy this one, although it isn't just a simple clone and much less complex.You will notice it is made by a single person, its mechanics are not very deep and you have seen it all rather soon.Nevertheless, I really enjoy this game. even though I probably won't play it for hundreds of hours.It's a lovely game where you can watch and follow each citizen during their daily routine. In German this would be called a high ""Wuselfaktor"".The mechanics itself are explained in a neat tutorial and are easy to understand, but (medium) hard to master.It's well worth the money, even if you do not play it for a very long time, especially when bought during a sale.

												Why do we play games, any kind of games? Basically, we want to have fun, but we also want to experience an ideas in safe environment, without suffering the consequences. The thing that excites since the dawn of gaming industry are god/manager/tycoon games, games that let players experience what is it like to run something and to be alpha and omega behind the whole idea.Comparison of indie wonder Banished with Simcity series might come in handy if we want to explain to someone what this game is about in the term of mechanics. Yes, it's a city builing-management game, but it is also much more than that. It is a war of nerves, fast decisions and perfect example of hard, but satisfying gameplay.You start to build your city with certain number of families and objects, depending on starting difficulty. Terrain is random. You gather resources, handle building, give instructions to people. You'll need to provide shelter, gather wood, stone, iron, chop it to firewood to keep everyone warm. Gather berries, hunt and fish. As the game progresses, you'll start building schools to educate kids, mines and quarries to dig deeper in search for stone, coal and iron, you'll expand over rivers. Your city will be visited by traders from all around that will bring more seeds, more different trees, various cattle. But the traders will also bring diseases, your town will catch fire, there will be other disasters... The summers seem so short and winters so harsh. People will be born. People will grow up. People will die. Frozen. Starved. Or just of an old age. You'll see local cemetery growing every year and respect the sacred ground, knowing it is the final resting place to people who gave  everything for a growing city...Graphics and sounds of Banished are there to sooth you and to help you concentrate on numbers. Lot of green color will make your eyes relaxed and ready for long hours...Banished isn't an easy game. You will face numerous challenges, even with the help of guides and tutorials. You'll be on the brink of extinction, but the game is fair - so it is possible to fall down and rise to be powerful again. That's the most beautiful thing about Banished - it's rewarding and it makes you quit the game and go to bed happy and fulfilled - even when you lose everything, it makes you come back for more.And when the game does that - that's why we play it over and over again.***If you like this review, feel free to join me for some more recommendations at http://steamcommunity.com/groups/libereviews "

												I love banished, with my heart and part of my soul (the rest to Rainbow Six Seige)I love building my city, getting things from the workshop to make it easier.But I really love the graphics, sound, and AI. Nobody is dumb, all AI act lively. Sounds and graphics make up the most to this stunning game.Yet, why the bad review?Simply one thing, and one thing only.Contentwithout getting new buildings from the workshop, the game seems dull with only like 20 buildings. It is very plain, as it shows that you can build a huge kingdom, when I feel like I am just building a small colony.What can Banished to to be better?1. An easier mode to start with. (I'm bad)2. WAY more buildings, like- bank, or barracks. (this leads to my 3rd)3. Military- Nomads will come and ask to be part of your village. How about a mode where they can go to war with you? Make people become soldiers, armed with weapons and armor, all could be made in a barracks. The blacksmith can make weapons and provide to the barracks which will distribute to soldiers. Send them off to fight or defend. Build walls and towers. Can't be attacked more than once within 4 years or something. Better weapons and armor can be researched in maybe a new building.4. Quests- Maybe merchants will tell you, ""Get me a treasure buried somewhere over there"" or ""Defeat the nearby nomads"" to earn food, XP (will be explained in 5th), or livestock.5. The ability to, after doing challenges or quests to earn XP, progress to the next age or era. From the colonial age to modern, build an empire. (maybe to ambitious)6. Realistic government- you can make rules, like nobody can own more than 2 weapons, or must work for food, or even pay taxes in whatever you choose.7. Currency, like real currency. You choose this at the start- Whether you start to use money or coins at currency at your village, people around will. Use these to buy ♥♥♥♥ from merchants. From the 6th, taxes would be whatever currency you use.Hope the developers see this. Please vote up and comment suggestions.			"

												Lovely game, unless you go for achievements a couple of playthroughs would make you already have done everything, however, the Colonial Charter mod opens a whole new world of posibilities, the guys that make that mod are working really hard and the results are amazing.If you like to play chilling disable natural disasters and get a fair weather with not a hard start, if you like challenges, a harsh weather with hard start and natural disasters on will give you a run for your money if you don't look up a guide on how to start.And the game was made by just one person, amazing.

												Wonderful, beautiful little city building game.  This game is elegant in its simplicity, and zooming in to watch your villagers carry about their daily tasks is one of the most serene things I've had the joy of experiencing in a video game.  Watching your first village come to life is utterly delightful.My main gripes here are that the game is somewhat limited in its content and depth.  After awhile, you stablize and simply run out of things to do.  Sure, you can grow and expand your village, but at a certain point growth just becomes a process of repeating the same building orders across a map until eventually you cover the entire map.  The game also suffers from a reverse difficulty curve--the first few years are usually the hardest part of the game, and as you keep playing the game becomes easier and easier to the point where your village is stable enough that it can self-recover from any natural disaster.Modding support is on the way, and with that will probably come more challenging scenarios and the like, but for the time being I feel like there's a finite amount of content to enjoy here.  Still, it's a great experience while it lasts.			"

												If you are like me and you play Strategy games to ""Build something"" rather than to destroy something, then Banished is the right game for you. Lead a group of cast outs to new glory and have them survive. In fact the goal is to have them survive, which ain't so easy. Hard winters, food shortage, supply problems, disasters... It's not easy to survive in the wilderness.The game never puts you into much stress, yet it is challenging on it's own away. You need to learn how to plan ahead. Even if you think you have a totally stable economy and enough supplies for yours the situation can change quickly if you try to expand to fast or if you ignored some issue.PLUS: Superb random names that totally ignore genders, citizens who mate with everything that is old enough to make children AND time travelling genetically modified humans who age 2 years per year.So far I did not encounter any bugs9/10 ( I so want to give a 10/10 but I miss a few simple ""not 100% needed but would be helpful"" features like sorting statistics, transport goods settings and other stuff)			"

												I would actually give this game a ""Not Sure"" rating. This is an amazing game and piossibly the best strategy/survival sumulator I have played. I did enjoy it and wouldn't change anything, but would at least add things but I was forced to stop playing because after 15hrs of playing, I feel like that one person who actually ready that one shirt ""How do yo keep an idiot busy? (see back of shirt). For me, the equivalent was spending hours on maps just to hit a brick wall when you reached a point where everyone died of stupidity, or at least the precipice of the programming.Cons:-After 10 plus maps that I spent hours trying to sustain a population of 12+ and making a town, those 10+ games ended with people starving within an hour+ into the game. The one before last everybody was hungry, there was no food, even though I had 4 crop fields, two orchards, a hunting cabin, a fishing area, and a gatherer. My very last game made me quit, because I was building houses for my homeless people when they suddenly just stopped all building at 30% and walked around aimlessly. I used the priority tool, I made everyone builders, I needed another stock pile for everything they had (I even had a Market Place) yet they all idled all over the land, far from even where they were supposed to be working as farmers. In the end, the 12 people I ended with were content to share two houses when they needed warmth instead of building the 5 houses they were supposed to build and use just to wander around aimlessly with 'House' symbols over their head, giving up their jobs just to starve to death. Tell them to tear a tree down it's a mass exodus to fullfill that one order. After that, wander aimlessly, some even winding up roughly the equivalent of 300+ feet away from anything that was being built or farmed. I had built a school to teach how not to be stupid, but that remained undone at 10%. Pros: -This is a wonderful game, the graphics are nice, it's really is beautiful, the controls are easy and I got the hang of it in no time, but this glitch or whatever it is that makes them stop, make it stop. I will continue to play this game, but I will use the Debug tool just so I can pop in more people that can just walk around aimlessly and not build a damn thing. So to all reading, yet I have played this game for 15 hrs, yes I played multiple maps and started differently in every way, always created a food source and homes first, used the priority tool when needed. Only on my last two attempts did I create the Hunter's Cabin first instead of after the crops and it worked out wonderfully, untill everyone just stopped building, eating and caring. I wasted all this try trying so many thing to make this game work for me and trying to convince myself it was just this map or this save got corrupted, but after 15hrs of trying to convince yourself, I let go og the ghost and decided to walk away from the money and hours wasted and trying to revive a dying horse and just went to play with another one. This game must have a bug because I am not the only one who has issues with this and had used attempts that others have suggested.NOTE: *This is my personal opinion and thoughts of the game, not an overall proffesional view if the game for general audience to use as a guide. As with many reviews and opinions, take this with a grain of salt and do your own research.*although this is based on actual gameplay and research done on others who have had same issues. My issue remains unsolved and unresolved.			"

												For any games, once one discovers a dominant strategy that can be repeatedly utilized to win any possible scenario, then there is no point in continue playing it.  The dominant strategy for Banished is this1) build a gathering hut in a large forest, prioritize-build it while the others go gather wood, stone, and iron in ANOTHER forest, put four people in it after it's finished.2) build a forester lodge beside the hut when enough wood and stone are gathered, put four people in it after it's finished, switch laborers to focus on stone and iron3) build enough houses to house the families, construct woodcutters, then either a taylor or a blacksmith, depending on whether you need more clothing or tools.4) build other buildings as resources come in, but always leave a surplus of food of around 100xpopulation, 10xpopulation of firewood; 2xpopulation of clothing and tools is recommended if playing conservatively.5) priortize houses as they are important for growth. They are where babies are made, and 30-something siblings living with their 70-something parents ain't going to make kids.Even on small mountaineous map with harsh climate, on hard difficulty, presumably the hardest starting scenario, one can double the population by year 10 just by doing the above, and get to 50 by year 20 is not out of the question.  The dominant factor for this game is the availability of space for more housing, balance against the food production buildings and wooded areas for firewood.  Variables like education and chapels are merely cosmetics that increase the efficiency of space, but not necessarily needed to grow your town.  As for natural disasters, since your town is likely separated into several parts by bodies of water, and as far as I can tell fire doesn't go through water, and tornados don't wreck more than one part of town, if one has enough of a surplus, one can easily rebuild and those are not game-changing disasters.So survival is simple.  If you like a game that you can play while playing another game on another computer, this is recommended.  This is a solved game; but people continue to play tic-tac-toe even though it's analytically uninteresting, so others may differ in opinion.Edit -- this is an evaluation of the vanilla game; perhaps with mods there will be enough complexity to make it less linear.

												I really wish I could recommend this game, but I just cant.There is but one way to play the first hour or so of every mission, stray from it and you end up losing very fast, mostly by starvation or death by old age.Once you know how the game is played, its pretty much rinse and repeat every mission and straying from that tactics will end the game as mentioned above.That's really not my understanding of a sand box strategy game and all the great graphics in the world dont change that.

												 After reading the reviews of previous owners... or  ... victims of this game.  I realized that food and even keeping your people warm was massively important. Later, as I learned about how important schools are...  I decided to be too smart for by pesty britches. Paused at start...  decided to do a layout of a city and ""pause"" the construction.Laid out the city with important buildings just a bit too far from the Storage barn...  result..  12 people froze before enough firewood could get chopped.Next try... Tried something a little similar...  only this time I failed to get the food buildings going fast enough to supply the houses I was making.  Result:  Not enough houses with either food or firewood in them. Compounded by each death made getting resources to buildings which initially had them. Starved and froze to death. Third try: Was doing better... had a gatherer's hut, hunter, fishing hut, second barn, school made...  then got into the rush to make houses before winter.  Somehow they survived it... Then the next winter hit...  one by one I watched my people freeze and a few starved (knew I shouldn't have sent them to that stone pile). Ended up with just a poor man named Joel with his wife Lucille and their four kids. Lucille died during child birth at age 39.... My farmer began to sing You picked a fine time to leave me Luuuucille...   four hungry children and a crop in the field....  Sigh....10/10 Would ""lay out"" my town again.			"

												Now that Banished has mod support and its first major free expansion mod made by the community (Colonial Charter) it is finally worth recommending to fans of builder strategy games like Anno or Simcity, and EASILY worth recommending at that. It went from ""meh"" to ""wow"" purely through the modding community. Before CC and the minimods that improve CC (Sawmill, 1 day is 1 day, CC Fountain mod, etc) Banished was a great idea and a great platform but without much game in it. Plus it had tons of bugs and AI problems. Now it's finally much more refined and the mod community has expanded and fixed the game up and made it worth playing, very similar to what they did with FTL. The future for Banished is now very bright, and I fully expect more and better mods in the coming year(s). It's easily worth a purchase now, especially when on sale, and I can only see it improving in the future. Buy it on GOG, not Steam, and support the DRM-free revolution. I did both, but only because I bought it on Steam before it was available on GOG.edit 6/4/2016: Now that CC:TFA awakens is out Banished is finally the game I always hoped it could be.

												I've been following the development of this game since finding out about it in April of last year. I was immediately interested and had some questions so I emailed the developer. Let's clarify that, its one guy. ONE. I emailed and minutes later he replied. This guy isn't just a talented coder (READ HIS BLOG!) but also a great, all around dude. Also, this game is amazing. Actually scheduled the day off of work just to play it on release. Its ""sim city"" enough that my simulation needs are covered, introduces enough ""Sims""-like stats to make you actually care about the populace (something the Sim (tm) games never did well). And then it adds lots of new things. Its also quite pretty. TLDR? If you like simulation-type games, you'll love this. At this point its likely my favorite simulation game and it will definitely be geting many more hours of my time, and multiple copies purchased for family members. Way to go Shining Rock! :D			"

												Now that Banished has mod support and its first major free expansion mod made by the community (Colonial Charter) it is finally worth recommending to fans of builder strategy games like Anno or Simcity, and EASILY worth recommending at that. It went from ""meh"" to ""wow"" purely through the modding community. Before CC and the minimods that improve CC (Sawmill, 1 day is 1 day, CC Fountain mod, etc) Banished was a great idea and a great platform but without much game in it. Plus it had tons of bugs and AI problems. Now it's finally much more refined and the mod community has expanded and fixed the game up and made it worth playing, very similar to what they did with FTL. The future for Banished is now very bright, and I fully expect more and better mods in the coming year(s). It's easily worth a purchase now, especially when on sale, and I can only see it improving in the future. Buy it on GOG, not Steam, and support the DRM-free revolution. I did both, but only because I bought it on Steam before it was available on GOG.edit 6/4/2016: Now that CC:TFA awakens is out Banished is finally the game I always hoped it could be. Say byebye to free time!			"

												The game was enjoyable the first few times I played it.At first it was a challenge to try and meet all the needs of the town through mining, servives, food and education. Unfortunately although the game throws up random weather events or disasters, the game becomes repetitive and the final outcome is a struggle to maintain a maximum population in the small sandbox map through starvation due to the impossible feat of feeding the citizens in perpetuity. As mentioned, I have enjoyed the game and each time I tried to different things - however the eventual outcome via sandbox is always the same. It would be great to see some expansions to the gameplay like interaction with external towns (not just traders), potential attacks from external parties or barbarians which need defending and the introduction of some forms of special unique structures. The game reminds me of an old classic 'Pharoah' which was quite enjoyable but after say 50 hours of gameplay becomes repetitive.Still highly recommend and quite enjoyable. For those seeking an extreme challenge, the hardest difficulty level is quite full on and only those whom have honed their skills on the game will be succeed (potentially)!ENJOY!			"

												My wife introduced me to this game, and I have to say it brings a soft spot to my heart. Very easy to pick up and play; and watching your community grow and thrive is rewarding. I can't help but wish that there were more threats besides natural disasters, however. I would happily pay for DLC's that added predators or other enemies. Some prevailing bugs and a lack of content are the only things keeping this one-man game from becoming a masterpiece. Still fun to play, though. Hopefully it will improve over time.			"

												Banished is one of those games that doesn't have a set plot.You are a group of people banished from their native homelands for reasons unknown to the player, so you can make up your own reasons why your citizens were banished.My surmise?They were too damn ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.The music in this game is fitting, the graphics are fitting, the map generator is a bit weird most of the time and the maps feel very artificial.But the AI?♥♥♥♥ed up, most of the time it makes the game unplayable.Within the game you have to give commands, mostly to the builders and labourers. This is great, however what is not so great is that they seem to do stuff at random. They do whatever they feel like.Had a game where my resource stockpile and storage barns were filled to the max. I had given orders for new stockpiles and storage barns to be constructed.What did the builder do?Gather more resources.The artificial intelligence is the only dealbreaker here and is so much of a dealbreaker that I can not in good faith recommend this game. After 50+ hours I thought I'd have noticed some behavioural pattern I could make sense of and adapt my play style to, but alas no luck.Similarly the game gives you notifications, this is good. ""Your stockpile is almost depleted"", ""Your stockpile is almost full"", it is all useful it is all good.Except my last game it forgot to tell me when my citizens died. One moment I had 50+ citizens, ten minutes later they had ""wandered off"" one by one without any notification WHY they had disappeared.Did they forget how to breath?I do not know.What I do know is that this games has a very VERY rushed feel when it comes to the AI and is not finished in that regard and therefore can not be recommended in good faith.

												Alright, so first and foremost, the game IS pretty interesting and has a great concept.It's basically a really neat city builder kind of game set in a pretty simple medieval-esque setting, no combat, no deeper overlaying faction mechanics, diplomacy, nada, just survival in the wilderness, and making your little halmet grow.And that's really cool and great and all -- when you have everything perfectly and tediously set up beforehand.See, the problem is, that as your town starts growing, your citizens AI begins to act haywire.Even getting them to their very best, ie issuing them warm coats, giving them proper education, making sure they are healthy and well fed, and clear stone paths to their general work areas, they will still get stuck in these asinine chain of actions that can ultimately kill your town or make simple instructions take up towards a while year.Like take a builder for example.You instruct your builders to build say, a fishing dock, relatively nearby the town, set that junk to be prioritized (which is a function that does virtually nothing).The builder will (not neccesarily in this order, and also sometimes several times until completion):1) Go pick up stones from the entirely opposite end of the village to store in the stockpile2) Go pick up food twice3) Walk to the construction site, store some building materials, and do something entirely different4) Go visit the herbalist 20 times5) Walk to the construction site, and then decide to walk all the way back home because he feels cold6) Walk to the construction site, build 1%, and then go do something else7) Go build 3 tiles of road somewhere else8) Go visit the herbalist, againAnd this sort of thing applies to any profession that has the citizen walking anywhere, so imagine what a sucker I felt like seeing my 15 laborers ignore cutting down the prioritized tree farm for a whole year and making my town freeze to death twice.Like damn man, I used to play Dwarf Fortress of all games, so I really do want to consider myself to be patient with strange AI behavior, but this game just gets absurd with that sometimes, to the point where it can be completely game breaking.A lot of people talk about how the game is hard too.And sure, it can be a bit of a challenge early on while you set everything up, but once you are starting to stabilize things you kinda start to get the impression that a large part of the ""difficulty"" is actually related to how terrible the AI can be at doing their tasks.So look, it's a pretty sweet game overall, so by all means do buy it and try it out.Just be prepared to savescum and get endlessly frustrated by your citizens AI a bunch.

												If you've been looking for a good looking ""graphical DF"" - Look no further. Banished is a deep and rewarding experience that can feel either zen-like, and at some times, extremely stressful. You will (try to) keep your citizens, well-fed, happy, healthy and live a productive life in general. Banished is actually one of the few ""civilization management"" games that i've actually felt attatched to the characters. They're born, go to school and work their lives away at trying to further their civilization only to end up dying in the end...BUT, their children and their childrens children will carry on and that's something that really strikes me with this game. Seriously though, it's an incredible experience, and it was all crafted at the fingertips of one man. This man deserves every penny he makes. 10/10 - A Must Buy			"

												My village, 20 years in, 4 hours of gameplay, just died out. Why? Because no one had sex. They were happy, they were healthy, there was space, but no child birth in 15 years. I watched the population dwindle, after it dipped below 10 I stopped them working in the mines and in the fields, I let them enjoy a life of relaxation. Did that make a difference? No. They just slowly died out. And when the last of them finally died, the game didn't even end, no ""you lose"", nothing. Everything else about this game was great and maybe, although I have googled what happened, I just did something wrong, but the fact that this happened made it very unenjoyable so I would recommend you avoid it.

												It's a good and entertaining game, for a while. The problem is that it looses any new thing to do too soon, but to scale up what you have, over and over again. When you understand the trick to keep in a decent balnce food, wood block and iron and stone, there is nothing more to do.The game becomes repetitive quite soon. I look forward to some campaign mode or a tree of science, but before it, I don't think I'll start another game from the beginning.			"

												This is not a completed game. And before you think ""well, he's probably asking too much"" I want to point out that I don't mean in a 90% kind of way, but in a 30% kind of way... The first 30% of the game is there, I can't deny that. There is a genuine satisfaction in overcoming the first obstacles and trying to form your little village. Alloting the work so that there is no shortage of food, wood etc. Building the structures in such layout so that everything works in the best possible way. There is even the added effect of season change. You eventually reach the best part of the game where you can trade with other villages for otherwise inaccessible resources. Aaand that's where the game ends. The choice of buildings is meagre to say the least. 2 types of houses. If that's not the bare minimum then what is? 1 type? You can pretty much build all the available structures after 4-5 hours of playing.  The villagers could well have been simply dots on a map, lacking any kind of realism. They move around at random, deep inside the forest or hovering around buildings. There is no pattern to work around and no sense of recreation or resting. They follow a random program of their own, in the absence of a night/day cycle at times farmers will suddenly drop everything and return to their homes.  The units of resources make no sense. The balance if you manage to find it is extremely precarious, one small change (like a disaster that kills a small percentage of your population) can have irreversible effects leading to a close extinction simply because there are no factors that work to pull the system back together. 2 farmers die -> 100 units of food are missing -> the forester dies of starvation -> 20 logs missing -> the fisherman freezes to death ---> and the population spirals to almost half the original one. This is just another example of the decline of the game industry. More than a decade ago, a game like Evil Genius was released offering hundreds of hours of gameplay with numerous types of units with excellent AI. Minions that didnt wonder around aimlessly but started conversations with each other or seeked various types of recreation. The game had depth, with countless unlockable objects, new rooms, new quests, a change of island. And now we get Banished.. A game stuck eternally in Beta with no hope of improving. Graphics slightly (if at all) better than Evil Genius and that's about it. The developer probably left this game forever, cashed in with fake promises and spent a week in Barbados. I don't understand economics so I don't know what the best move for us the community is. If we buy it then we're accepting the bad quality of gaming. If we don't buy it then the city builder genre amongst many others that are not CoD related may simply die out. In any case this game is bad, unfinished.			"

												In short:As it is right now, I did enjoy ""Banished"" for a few hours but that's about it. It's very simplistic and unrealistic. The overall concept is great, but nothing new. It has full 3D graphics and you can rotate seamlessly the view 360 degree, though that's really not even necessary and in the end is more a gimmick. Same with tilting up / down and zooming in / out. Overall, Banished is beautiful, yet VERY simplistic in terms of game mechanics, AI and UI. Beautiful graphics (well, they're not mind-blowing) alone don't make a good product, that's what most devs forget. I rather have more simplistic graphics, but much more sophistication and complexity in a game (AKA ""Factorio"" or ""Prison Architect"").Because of that, in the end I just can't recommend to get it (unless it's on sale and you don't care about the things I point out below), I got it on sale for $5 and might hop into it at some point again for some casual entertainment, but for something challenging that I can really get into, I rather load up Factorio or Prison Architect.So, if you're interested, here are (some of) the issues I have with it:1.Not enough stats output (graphs) - for example, how efficient is someone at their work? Or at least, how efficient is a work-space? Is demand met with supply? It's common sense that you've got those graphs, to effectively manage people (whether that's in a business or colonists trying to establish a town or an established city).2. Too much micro-management due to ""flawed"" AI...2.a. For example, you have a storage barn with food in it. You build another one so you can relocate to another area (there's no way you can do that in the first year, you have to settle, even just temporarily, at that location!) and want to move everything from the previous one to the new one. So you give a demolish order to the old one so that everything is moved over to the new one as soon as that one's built (or even if you wait until it's built, doesn't matter). Yet, as soon as you give the demolish order, everything in it, food, tools, ... will become unavailable to those people. Until it's transferred to the new storage barn and put in there.  Which results in the people starving to the point of dying. Makes perfect sense, right?2.b. Those people don't seem like virtual versions of humans, but rather robots that look like and have the needs of humans. If I'd be starving, I'd refuse first of all to go long distances to some remote place, knowing that I'd starve on the way there or back; secondly, I'd eat at least a little bit, to the point that I won't starve; third of all, the devs obviously never heard of jerky / dried fruits and veggies!? Why aren't those people taking some food and water along. I mean, come on, that's common sense. 2.c. In RL nobody goes mining / hunting / exploring w/o even the smallest of a backpack. Or goes to work without taking food along (unless you have a cafeteria at your job), even if it's close-by - instead, in Banished, every time someone gets hungry, they walk all the way to their living quarters to eat. Do you know anyone who doesn't work from home and does that? That's very rare to happen, even in a settlement like that where people don't have a 8-5 job but sometimes have to work from 5 in the morning until 8 at night or whenever the sun goes down, to get as much work done during daylight (I know somewhat from personal experience, and I know people who have done that kind of work and told me about how rough it is and what they had to do).2.d. The ""wildlife"" (well, there's only one kind, which are deer)... where should I start... For once, they're running all over the place, through your settlement(s), eating right next to where you mine / build / ...; not to mention there's only one kind - the aforementioned deer. No rabbits or other smaller animals. There are also no predators (bears, wolves, ...) in Banished.3. I'm also not fond of (because it creates a disconnect from reality) how time has been implemented... basically, your settles have babies, raise their children, they become eventually old enough to work and then at some point they die due to old age (or before then, due to accidents). All good stuff.  Also, it implements seasons and each of the four are further divided by three (early, mid and late). However, your ""banished"" people age rapidly within a year. I haven't paid full attention but I think it takes about three in-game years for people to go through their full life cycle. I understand that you can't obviously play the game in real-time, but all this could've still been implemented much better.4. In connection to what I just mentioned in 3. regarding time, this also becomes very obvious when building structures or harvesting resources (actually that's another point but I'll just say it here - you have 3 resources for building, that's it: wood logs, stone and metal - not even different types of metals; and two types of fuel, which is fire wood from cut up wood logs, and coal)... it can take a whole month to build a wooden house (one part of a season), yet it takes about the same time to create a fully functional mine.5. The UI and font both do not scale with your screen resolution, same goes for the location placement of the windows. Also, they don't ""snap"" to each other's borders. Again, it's usable, but just the way everything is implemented, is just very simplistic.			"

												REVIEW BASED ON Ver. 1.0.4Banished is SURPRISINGLY good that I simply cannot recommend this game enough. I am usually the type that doesn't like city-building in general, but so far the hours of playing Banished has been certainly entertaining (WITH TONS OF FRUSTRATION AND REGRETS behind the scene). Got this game during sale and it is definitely, oh DEFINITELY better than average city-building games out there in steam.Some notable features include: Extremely hard and Challenging at start - you can help yourself by reading new players-friendly guides to avoid misery but couple bad end due to starvation, natural disasters, or simply awful management Tons of micro-management necessary to keep the town/city growing continuously!  Really not bad AI for villagers, at least they don't starve to death out of nowhere and can follow orders... just .. give them time and be patient Need for strategically plan your buildings ahead Different ways you can choose to specialize your town - can be designed to be production based with emphasis on trading, or be agricultural powerhouse with vast fields of crops, orchards etc Crazy random disaster features. One good tornado across your town, hitting and destroying most of your storages? Might as well start new...  Extremely punishing. Forgot to build school early on? Don't expect efficiency for next couple years. Forgot to build enough wells? RIP once fire is set on one of your core buildings. Forgot to check the firewood or food supply? See your population reduced to half when early winter comesHowever, there are some parts that left me feel something is lacking as well. Limited way to start in the beginning - after couple of trial and errors, the only (so far) effective method to start is via gathers to maintain food production Lack of more sophisticated ""order"" system. There is priority function in the game, but it is totally not enough to make micro-management smoother. This really hurts once your population reachs certain level and town grows into considerable size Not being able to control specific resources in detail. Same reasoning as above, later into game, it makes micro-management even harder - which is like half the point of this game. Lack of late game content. Once you know what you are doing and city has expanded to like most of the available plains on map, there is absence of motivation and contents to challenge the players. The only concern might be maintaing healthy population.Nonetheless, it is great game to devote hours of gameplay into and overcome learning curve if you really enjoy City building, Micro-management, or macro survival simulation. Just want to see more late game contents :)Would give 9/10!			"

												Unfortunately, this is the game that I will forever use as a standard for other city building games. Banished is marvelous, an absolute thrill to play. The in game economy is very complex and diverse and can quickly screw you if you aren't careful. The city building aspect is difficult, time consuming and very believable. In order to survive, you need only provide houses for population growth, diverse food stores for consumption, clothing to keep the cold off, firewood to warm houses and tools to work with. With each new house, 2-4 children are born that need to be fed, clothed and educated (potentially). Each new citizen requires a rethink of food stores, clothing and tool supplies. If you build too many houses at one time, your people will risk starvation or dying from exposure. These things happen before you can even begin to consider a solution. If your people start dying, you will lose much needed workers. If you don't have enough farmers, even more people starve. If you choose to make all your tool makers farm for a season, you will run out of tools, resulting in extremely slow crop production and people will starve. If this wasn't bad enough, you also have to provide your citizens with a variety of food products to maintain ultimate health. People can't live on cabbage alone, they also need grains, protein and fruits to remain healthy. This is by far my favorite city building game. It has unlimited replay-ability and will keep you entertained for hours, even if half of your time is spent screaming at the screen in an attempt to make your farmers work more quickly, or trying to figure out how one of your builders got stuck in an icy tundra in the middle of winter with no clear path home (I mean seriously how does this keep happening??)

												Wow! I have to say that I'm so pleasantly surprised at how well-thought out this game is. Aside from the details about the game, the developer clearly put a lot of love into this idea enough to create an engine for it. He took into consideration others' imagination to make sure modding is easy (for modders, a circle of people to which I do not belong). I have only been digging into this game 15 hrs more or less at the time of writing this and by no means am I proficient. I've killed off all my populations thus far, but I've played enough to motivate me to share my thoughts.As someone who is drawn to the outdoors, I've always been disappointed with the way the living world is depicted in games. Granted, you are still harvesting resources in this building game, but there room for success through many different means. Yes, you could build a large bustling town that depends on farming, animal husbandry, and orcharding and all fueled by industries of coal and iron mining. But you could also supply your population with staples of venison, forest tubers, mushrooms, and other wild edibles by maintaining deep forested areas. This flexibility is a first in my experience, and one I have been long awaiting.Controls are rather straightforward and the tutorial is succinct.Cycles of seasons alter priorities for a town, as do losses of skilled members of the community, and Banished places the gamer in an enjoyable predicament of balancing interests. Population booms may well lead to busts in several decades time, and slow-and-steady seems the safest strategy for the beginners.The graphical quality is appealing without being a load on older systems when zooming in and out of the map. Thanks to developers for keeping some great games accessible!The music is innocuous (a step up for the genre in my opinion) though not noticed for its greatness. This is expected for a nearly one-person project as sound isn't integral to the No tech trees to unlock, which affords all the more opportunities for alternative roads of development.Some games I happily buy full price, this is one of those few. If you are interested in town-city builders or like me and looking for a break from fast-paced games, this is the best I've come across by far. "

(Before you scoff at my hours played let me tell you that the bulk of my time was spent playing the DRM free version. I was having troubles with my Steam copy crashing)I created a video review which you can watch by click this link ->Banished Video ReviewV--But if you're a fan of letters, then enjoy the written verson--VApparently you've been banished, I guess you refused to drink the Kool-Aid. Now you're in the middle of nowhere with a wagon and some potatoes...survive.That's the montra of Banished, a survival-based city-builder developed by one person. After selecting your level seed and difficulty you are left to your own devices. Either to create a sprawling town of trade and prosperity, or utterly fail attempting to recreate the Donner Party (unfortunately cannibalism is not in the game).As you clear land and begin building homes for your settlers you'll soon realize that you're about to run out of food. So you'll begin focusing on bringing in consumables by fishing and foraging only to see your supply of clothing is about to run out and winter is already here.If nothing else, Banished is a great reminder that electricity is awesome.You'll assign your settlers occupations and tell them what to build, but besides that you don't have direct control over them. A hard lesson I learned when the citizens of Bogustown decided a 13-year-old girl should be in charge of smithing tools for the entire settlement. She proceeded to bug out and sabotage the operation by stealing iron and placing it in random spots around town. The shortage of tools led to a starvation. Eight people died...including her.The small narratives that can be accidentally spun through gameplay are delightful, and I deeply wished for the ability to rename my citizens for added drama, but sadly you can't.Aside from the random bugs, the settlers are pretty intelligent. If they can't complete their current task due to a lack of resources they will assist in other jobs around town without you having to instruct them. The settlers truly feel like living people in a society. They work, stock their homes, and much to your dismay, even take breaks from work.But their autonomy takes some getting used to. I found myself overly managing their tasks on my first settlement, but once I understand that I didn't need to, the tedium was minimized.The games UI is customizable and unobtrusive, which keeps it from detracting from the game's simple beauty. As you play you'll find stats are hard to come by. Production is displayed on a per building basis and the overarching stats like population growth you'd expect in a city builder are unobtainable until an expensive city hall is constructed. Once built you'll have access to helpful growth and resource numbers to help you better plan and manage your settlement.Once your settlement gets to the point of farming, seeds and livestock become invaluable. Depending on the difficulty selected, you will begin with a select few or none at all. The only way to obtain new seeds and livestock is by trading with outsiders. This can only happen if you build a trading post and even then you must wait for a merchant to drop by, and then hope he's selling what you want.An interesting meta game is created as you divert resources away from your settlers and into your trading post in preparation for a merchant, only to then find out you don't have enough to buy what you want. This brilliant mechanic is diminished when you realize goods are always a certain price, allowing you to then prepare enough trade goods to buy your desired item.The game's achievements reward settlements that exist for over 100 years, but after passing the threshold of fighting for survival over to prosperity, the game has little more to offer you besides civilized buildings like the church or town hall. I found myself losing interest in my settlement after about 20 years, which equaled out to around 6-7 hours in real time for me.That's nothing to scoff at, but I would have preferred to remain engrossed in my existing settlement rather than starting fresh in search of a challenge.Besides disease and fire the only threat your settlers face is your own incompetence to fulfill their needs. As you get better at the game this threat begins to dissipate so it would have been nice to see non-environmental forces threatening you.The addition of hostile settlements would help to shake up the game, but the introduction of a combat mechanic would likely break the simple survival sim. I wished for a happy medium with something like hostile wildlife which would threaten your settlers in untouched parts of the map. This would help bridle rapid expansion into the wilderness and keep you on guard.After reaching resource stability and then the point excess, there are few things the game can do to challenge you. It lacks a large end-game goal to work towards beyond simple survival. But that's not so much a shortcoming, rather a sign that I want more. The game's budget price tag makes it a low risk purchase, and modding support is a planned release in the near future. So the thirst for more content may soon be quenched.If you're expecting the complexity of a SimCity then Banished probably won't be your jam. But the game has crafted a dense blend of survival and resource management that makes people like me squeal with delight.			"

												This game is awesome!My initial thought was that it had similarities to ""Black and White"" but without the pet and godly interactions and with more focus and details on the city management.The excellent tutorials gets you started then you'll spend the rest of the week, month or perhaps year to learn how to build a large town.I've read some complaints about bugs and instablities, with 120+ hrs spent to this day, without a single crash I'd say it's very stable and sure there are some bugs, but which game hasnt?I've been interested in this game for a while now, but forgot about it until one day I was given a coupon* for this game.And to be honest, I regret not buying it sooner!There are however some problems.This game is very unforgiving, make a mistake early and you'll regret it much later.This game is very addictive. It is about the same level as Civilization.""One more year""*As I token of forgivness from Steam I like to hope as I bought Rising Storm.			"

												So bannished is a interesting mixture of survival, town/settlement building and Tornadoes.So you start with 4 or 6 familys and you have to use the population you have to build a new life in the wilderness you need to gather materials and build what you need to survive and hopefully thrive, so far so good and as you build up your population increases so you need more houses,woodcutters and food production to feed you people and need enougth fire wood to survive the random winters some are nice and easy and other times its rather punishing to keep people alive.Once you get your first 100 people population is'nt a problem, if you don't manage to have a healthy and happy population they won't have kids and eventualy your people are too old to reproduce so the game is a proper balancing act of population and food production/stockpile to feed everyone.The game has a interesting approach to peoples behaviour as you can have big problems made by your own people such as hoarding and over population which can cause you allot of problems if people start hoarding food and firewood others won't have enougth food or fire wood and they will become unhappy or mostly die in a harsh winter from starvation or hypothermia? The fix you will need is markets as they make sure everyone gets what they need and it stops hoarding from happening so build a market and thats not a probem, or the oppposite problem you build to many houses or you have a mass die off and the younger generation move into the houses and  have kids before you know it you have 30 kids and you need more schools and they eat so much food and they won't help you gather or help produce more food until they adults and have been educated? I recommend schools as they work smarter and get more done with less accidents which is good!With houses keep them spread out and linked by markets and never build like 50 or 60 houses it'll come back to haunt you when you least expect it.Try to build multiple smaller settlements with 5 to 10 houses per place linked by a road with markets for supplies, as markets are awesome the vendors use wheel barrows and are super effient.The game is really good and well made, the only thing i find is a bit much is tornades they are random and can end your game really fast, the other disasters are easy to fix such as disease easy, crops failing easy theres probably more i have'nt had yet so i look forward to dealing when it happens to my peoples.Tornadoes are rediculous and they seem to become common when you have over 100 population and they seem to love wiping out schools and hospitals! or they plough throw you storage barns and markets and wipe out your food supplies, Here is the most common tornadoe effect for me in my games  they moves in a complete be line to built up housing area's and kills everyone except 2 people and a kid or 3 people and no kids survive, and if you have bad luck you will be stuck with 2 blokes or 2 women survivors and they won't reproduce = game over!I recomend this game its complicated in a deceptive way of looking easy to learn, and its lead to some some crazy stories for my people expecially when a tornadoe's killed everyone except a old man and young girl and they both died of old lol or when i had a orgy house of 4 people living there and they had 6 kids when i had 2 empty houses they could of lived in lol yet they preferred to live togther.Just turn off disasters and enjoy the game, when you have it mastered turn on disasters and prepare for a tornadoe wrecking you population or town.If you have any tornadoe survivor stories/strategies let me know.

												After 10 months of playing, I figured I should review the game. I know enough at this point to make an informed opinion, right?The first thing you should know is that there is no story, nor is there an ""end game"". I see so many people complaining about that in their reviews. This game follows the lives of your little group of settlers and all of their offspring. They are born, they get married, they breed, they die. Some of them go to school, some of them don't, some farm, some hunt-- ALL of them will, at some point, do something to infuriate you. But how can there be an ""end game"" in a city builder? It goes completely against the point of building, if you have to stop.This game is flawed, yes. There are bugs. People tend to freeze up when their houses catch fire, which is unfortunate. Playing on easy is usually more difficult than playing on hard. Traders only travel by water (slowly), but nomads only travel by land, and in groups that get larger and larger until you have to start turning them away. My favorite, though, is when people starve even though you have an enormous surplus of food. I've encountered this one a lot. All Messica has to do is go to the storage barn to get food, but noooooooooooo, she goes walking in the forest instead.Then dead.There are a lot of positives as well. Your AI is unpredictable, so even if you do the same thing over and over again, they won't. They graphics and sounds are beautiful. And it's true to life. Your mines and quarries will eventually dry out, deforestation causes not only a lack of trees, but a lack of food in that area, too. The maps themselves make you want to see just how big you can push your village, but there's such a delicate balance between growth and resources. It's incredibly hard to find it. I'm still learning how to do things better, even after the amount of time I've put in.Tl;dr- Sure, the game still has bugs, but it was made and is being maintained by one guy. AI is wonky, game can get repetitive, but, as far as city-builders go, Banished is one of the best ever made.			"

												This might not be a thorough review, but after 16 hours of playing this game, I do feel I have enough to share about Banished. If I wanted to describe ""Banished"" using a single phrase, I guess that phrase would be ""Colony Management"". All you do in this game, is manage your colony. You are responsible for the lives and the well-being of your colonists, sometimes very literally. For example, if during the summer you neglect an important aspect, such as producing food, your colonists will probably starve and not survive the cold winter. Or, for another example, you don't make sure your colonists have enough wood and the ability to use it to warm their houses during the winter, they'll just die of hypothermia. So far, the game's formula seems simple, yet deep and complex enough to make it interesting and carry the weight of an entertaining game. Visually, Banished looks really well. There's nothing too fancy about the game's graphics, as it seems the developers were smart enough to focus their efforts and resources on other aspects of the game, but they obviously did enough to make everything really polished and smooth. I really liked the weather effects, they really sell the seasonal theme of the game. I raised the game's settings to the maximum and it runs very smoothly. Up until now I haven't encountered any bugs or problems. No crashes, no slowdowns, nothing - pure gameplay experience! While I do have a decent computer (Quad-Core i7, 12GB RAM, Geforce GTX465), it seems like this game could handle itself well enough with much cheaper hardware.The only aspect I'm a litthe disappointed of, is the audio. There are important sounds effects, but the music is so insignificant, that after 15 minutes I decided to turn the game music off, so I could listen to popular music while playing.If you like colony management games, you should definitely try Banished. While it might not be an incredible AAA game or a pure city-builder, it's easily better than the broken and buggy Simcity and Cities XL.I promise to update this review if I learn anything more worthy of sharing.

												This is one of those games that you buy in the sale because it looks cool and then realise you'll probably never play it. That's exactly what I thought of this game originally. Then, an update appeared on Steam. No idea what the update was but it reminded me of the game and thought I'd try it. 10 hours later and 4 maps later I finally managed to get to a self sustaining village of around 70 citizens.The game is a challenge, resources are constantly under pressure particularly in the early stage and this is a micro managers dream. You need to shift your dozen or so citizens between various lines of production to stop the village from starving, freezing or without resources. There are a few mods available that make resource production a little bit easier, I used the iron and wood boost for a short while to prevent my city from dying out.I love city building games, my favourite being Cities Skylines and this game is a medieval city builder with some differences in gameplay which make it unique and make me want to recommend to everyone that enjoys any kind of city building game.10/10 would let guy get crushed by a rock again.

												May eat away at your life several hours at a time.    I like this game, but it takes a lot of micromanagement.   Specifically, food generation is both critical and labor intensive.  So producing enough food for your villege to make it through the year seems to take a good deal of your potential laborers for all of the spring, and summer.   When you have finally collected all the food, to repurpose a laborer, you must first quit them from the farm before you can assign them another role.  Still a fun way to slowly realize it is 2am and you have work in the morning.			"

												Back To Basics With BanishedBut don’t be fooled, it’s far from easy! If you like micro-management then this game is right up your street. You start with a small band of citizens in the middle of a randomly generated map, depending on the selected difficulty level you have a starting stock of resources and the aim of the game is to survive and prosper.The winters are harsh so you have to quickly build shelter, get the food rolling in, secure raw materials and find somewhere to store the surplus before the weather turns nasty. You decide what to build, but remember, you only number a few so choose wisely as limited hands means not all of the roles can be fulfilled.In order for your people to be happy, healthy and fertile you need to consider providing a varied diet, herbs and medicine, education, their spiritual needs, clothing, leisure. These requirements entail farming, mining, hunting and gathering, forest management, schools, taverns, blacksmiths, woodcutting and more.The basics of the game are covered in a number of tutorials that take about forty minutes to complete, the game interface is simplistic and all of the main functions are accessed from a single icon bar that has two levels. Everything is based around common sense decisions and as long as you apply a little thought and planning you will be up and running in no time.Although only written by one man (Luke Hodorowicz) there is a surprising attention to detail. The seasons change with deciduous trees losing their foliage in the winter months only to go through various shades of green into full leaf in the summer months as an example. House styles differ so that there is little visible repetition of game objects making it always pleasing to the eye. It even supports DX11 (though my monitor insists on switching to 50Hz which skews the display).I have played the “game proper” for a little over four very enjoyable hours, though I will admit to disabling natural disasters for the first play through, and can thoroughly recommend it. If you liked Sim-City I think you will like Banished.			"

												A beautiful and well made town builder and management game.Banished can take a little practice to get the hang of with to start with but when you get going you can build up a really large town able to sustain itself.There's a good amount of resources to to collect and a wide variety food grow, gather and hunt.There's no progression in the sense that you unlock new buildings or features, everything is available for you from the start so you can build up how you wish.Your village can spiral out of control into disaster if you're not careful, especially near the beginning or if you're hit by a natural disaster. Such as lack of tools which bring all of your production down and makes even more chaos.One thing to watch out for is the colonists can get a little greedy and take all available food when there's only a small amount in stock, leaving none for others and letting them starve.The base game does lack buildings and you can soon feel as though you've built everything in a short time, there's plenty of mods to download but I would have liked to have seen more in the game.Biggest problem with the game is the frame-rate when reaching 1,000+ population, for me it became unplayable so you will need to keep that in mind when building a village across the whole map.Overall it's a great game and plenty of time can be spent, there's some nice achievements you can work towards if you like extra challenges/goals..Definitely worth a buy if you like builders and/or management games.

												Oh my. So I just got this game. Played less than two hours so far, and most of that was going through the tutorials. I thought the tutorials were excellent. They don't cover every detail, but rather give a functional overview of the basics, and most people can sort out the rest from there, I'd think. So then I start. Building my first town, going along nicely, staying on top of food needs and such, and... and...Someone died.He froze to death. A man FROZE to death because he didn't have enough firewood! I felt awful. It... it actually hurt. So soon? So sad.WAIT! WHAT??? I have a woodcutter that should be handling that sort of thing. What the heck is my woodcutter doing over there???I click on the woodcutter. He's not working, he's idling. He's messing around while people are freezing to death! I started yelling at the computer. You lazy jerk! Get back to work! Are you insane????Yeah, I probably didn't build the woodcutter as early as I should have, but that's not the point. The point is that any game that can get me that involved, that invested, is doing something very right.			"

												Well, this game defininetly isn't for everyone and it takes a bit of time to get down how to be successful in the game. For me personally this game was worth it, but someone that doesn't like something that gets repetitive, and doesn't really want to strive to get to like say 900 citizens, or building more efficient cities this probably isn't the game for you then. Basically you'll have made every building available in the first few hours. But the real awesome part of this game is building the city you made more efficent, getting through natural disasters, preparing yourself for winter's worst, and just keeping everyone in your city happy and health is where the real fun is in this game. This game honestly can be played while watching a movie and kinda just monitoring your citizens every once and a while on x1 speed, or if you want to power through and built up your city and not have to wait as much for things to be built go ahead with the x10 speed.Hope this helps any of you that are skeptical about buying the game, and that it will sway you towards or away from buying it because we all want a fun enjoyable game to play through and this may be it for you.

												Do I recommend this game? YESDo I recommend this game at the actual price? NOThe first 3-4 gameplays are fine, building houses, cutting down trees, growing cattles and seeing your inbred citizens freeze to death. Watching your small village made of 2-3 dirty huts become a city with 100+ citizens is nice and pretty rewarding also.. the problem is that this game doesn't give you many things to do. No story (I know, it's a city building game, but at least you could have give me some minor quest to do), very few available buildings (there are like 20, it get reaaally monotonous after a while) every gameplay I did was a copypaste of the precedent.Don't get me wrong, Banished is a fun game. The graphic is neat, the music also (although a bit monotonous) and I really liked some minor details like the cycle of the seasons, or seeing the deers wandering through the map for example. But for 20€, I really expected something more.. this game feels like a very well done BETA version of a game, not like a complete game. I bought this game during a summer sale for 9,99€, and I think this is a more reasonable price for what Banished gave to me as a videogame			"

												Banished is a city-builder game which is mostly about survival. While it may seem that there is not that much content (types of buildings etc.) you won't notice since the game plays relatively slowly and it takes a time to build a solid town. You will find yourself struggling mainly in the early years as the firs few winters tend to be the hardest, yet you musn't let your guard down even in later years as the careful planning is crucial and key to be succesful in this game. Me for example I was able to build a city of some 600 people and I was doing great, but since I had bad infrastracture and didn't place the buildings in efficient manner, the whole system collapsed on itself... population dropped by roughly 400 individuals due to starvation and my town became a ghost towm... The game is challenging and quite addictive despite being relatively simplistic, I'd say there is a steep learning curve, as beginners will probably struggle for first two or three games but once you pick up basics (and there isn't really much to pick up) it is relatively easy.

												I don't think I can recommend this game, as the mechanics that work behind the scenes aren't refined. I wish there was a priorities system, but unfortunately the main priority is always hauling things--even if the settlers aren't laborers. Builders tend to build when they want to and some houses will hoard 50 fish while the other house next to them is starving to death. What sh*tty neighbors. :DI really like the concept of the game, but I can't seem to last more than a few years before things get stagnant. Also children are freeloading jerks--they don't even haul anything. They just f**k off and walk around. But at least they become adults at age 10.			"

												First you should know this game made by one guy !! it a City-build/Manage game hard to find in this age. Everything in this game is awesome and it make me love this game so much. It like Stronghold, Simcity or any game in city-build style but hard than any other games, because you needs to look carefully in everything Food, Firewoods, Tools etc. and the best part is, if you don't have food for your people just a minute late, they die... just like that :Pit cost just 20$ but it so much fun and addictive !! *Recommend*			"

												This is the first Steam review I've written where I feel conflicted about giving a thumbs down. Let me explain why I don't recommend this game.My first 50 hours in this game were okay--it was somewhat challenging and I sorta enjoyed it but, the game lacks depth. Once you figure out how to minimize disaster (diseased crops/livestock, sick citizens, etc.) there isn't much left to do. I moved on to using mods for the remaining hours I played. I tried all of the mods and many had neat additions but, they all failed to add real depth to the game-play. Additional types of crops and livestock don't add depth all they do is make it easier for me to keep the citizens happy.On top of the game lacking depth (its #1 problem) it also has some very glitchy mechanics. I've had a newborn child end up living alone in a house (and somehow survived). Greedy citizens will steal all the resources they can and horde those resources (food/fuel) in their homes at the expense of neighbors who will starve and/or freeze to death. Resources can randomly teleport across the map which, can cause your workers to starve or freeze to death during the long journey to pick up that gliched out resource (in my case a piece of meat) from across the map.The final nail in the coffin for this game is the horrible FPS drops it suffers when you build up a large population. People who are really into this game play it on pause because once you have a large population, if you try to play at 5x or 10x, you'll get 1-5 FPS/sec even with the best possible hardware.In the end there was nothing that made me want to come back and play this game. I love City Builders but, this game pales in comparison to games like Anno 2070 and Cities: Skylines. I like the general idea of this game but, aside from building up an ever-larger population (which isn't even much of an option because of the game's ♥♥♥♥ optimization), there's really nothing to do after about the first 20 hours of game-play. This game doesn't have war/fighting, the trading is limited/lackluster and the random glitches/FPS drops can be infuriating. If you're looking for a City Builder with real depth check out Anno 2070 or Cities: Skylines.Edit: 06/12/2016Still at 55% helpful on this review despite all the fanboys coming here to make arguments like ""You played 50+ hours be happy with your purchase."" Or the other which is, ""I've never had a 1000+ population town but, I know that the low fps you have isn't from the game."" Both are worthless fanboy arguments. The devs who made this game are LAZY. they released a partial game and left it for the community to finish. The game is such UNOPTIMIZED TRASH that your FPS will drop like a rock (1-5fps on max game speed) when you have a large population. This game is junk. I tried to like it but, its ABSOLUTE JUNK! Don't let the comments from these fanboys trick you into wasting $20. If you want to buy this game wait for a 90% off sale (even then its still overpriced).			"

												A beautiful gem of a game. On the surface its another town builder, but from the moment you start playing you realise just how different it is. That idyllic little patch of land you've got may look bountiful, but unless you get your act together those four lonesome families are going to be starving and freezing come winter. Even when you get on your feet there is the ever present worry in your head - ""Will the harvest be good?"" In this game there are only two enemies: nature and your own incompetence. Get it right and its immensly satisfying. Get it wrong and its stomach turning. The only drive you have is making your villager's lives better, improving their homes, their variety of food, their working standards; this means expanding, and with expansion comes the potential for upsetting the delicate balance you've spent hours tinkering to achieve. If this game had came out of a big developer well versed in this genre (Paradox, Maxis, etc) I would be impressed at their return to basics, discarding all multiplayer, all add-ons, all DLC, all glitz and glamour. This game is polished and complete at launch - how common is that these days? But this has not come from a giant dev, it's come from one man. ONE. This one developer shows what you can do with commitment and ideas. It shows in his game, where perserverence and determination will reward you and hasty decisions will punish.Play this game. It will remind you what good, honest video games can and should be.			"

												Everyone in my village is starving because my farmers died of old age and my fishermen are too miserable to do their jobs right. So I built a brewery with the last remaining resources we had. Happylandfunville might be in a food crisis, and the rest of my dwindling population will likely perish come next winter, but the free flowing ale shall ensure they'll never be sober enough to stay mad at me.

												Banished is a very interactive and challenging game. Not challenging like in other games where you have to hide or get shot by AI or other people, but challenging in the fact that you have to have a careful balance between buildings and people in order for them to live but not so much that they run out of lets say: logs so they cant get any firewood (for which you need a forester.) In many of My playthroughs my people die of some wierd and wonderful diseases like ""influenza"" or ""the mumps"" because i hadnt built a hospital or a herbalist soon enough and my health bar (for the whole village) has declined. Banished is a very detailed game with so much to offer and so much potential i just cant believe it has been made by a single developer! (who i cannot find the name of....) So im definatly recommending it to all my friends (and family...) because it is such a amazing game!8.5/10 TheCatWithTheHat			"

												This game is really fun... the first time you play it.I really want to recommend this game, but I cant. It has very little replay value, and you get bored quite quickly once your town starts surviving on its own. The first couple of hours are fun and challenging. Your citizens keep dying of numerous things like hunger and cold, but once you have a steady supply of wood, medicine and food you get bored. It doesnt take very long to build every single building and it just isnt fun to see how high you can push your population.This game also has a few issues that require mods to fix as well. The worst offenders are probably the balancing and AI.If you can buy this game on a good sale, expect about 10 hours of fun. Maybe a few mods can extend its lifetime.			"

												This game is incredibily frustrating. I telll my colony to build food sources, and harvest resources. They decide, they should get firewood from the resverves and pick up food from the storage shed. I tell them to build a forester lodge and a well, We run out of resources and they decide, they are cold and hungry and need to go home, instead of gathering wood and stone. Then 16hrs later a building catches fire or a tornado blows through and everything Ive tried so hard to do, is lost!Its a good game, its not Simcity or Tropico, where you build it and it happens. As Ive said the sims have lives which keeps me bonded with my/their struggle and keeps pulling me back to this somewhat bare bones and incredibly frustrating simulator. I havent tried any of the mods from Workshop, but Im getting there. 8.2/10 Would grind my teeth again			"

												Banished is a good concept, and I got some enjoyment out of it, but it's a one-trick-poney, and the trick doesn't go that far. It's a city builder with very little in the way of progression. Only a couple buildings can be upgraded (from wood to stone). The AI is occasionally frustrating. The game is rock hard at the beginning, but if you can survive long enough to get your population under control.... that's it. You expand at a snail's pace, till you're out of room. There's no tech tree, no missions, no customization (beyond where you decide to place the limited number of building types in the game), no unit variety, and no depth. Walk the tightrope between gathering food and building houses.... and you've beaten the game. There's nothing to reach toward beyond survival, and survival is only difficult at the beginning.It's a city-builder, where the city-building isn't the fun part. I reccomend you wait, and see if there's a content patch or something. There just isn't enough here, to justify a game that's twice the price of Terraria.			"

												Very good and difficult build-up game in a non-technolegy style, which felt/feels very fresh. I like this game, even though there are some moments, which are so frustrating, I am sure, because of me, 'cause I suck, but why do my farmers die, while they are harvesting? An unsolved mysterium to this day. However, if you are a skilled player in this genre, you will have a lot of fun. I would not recommend this for beginner.

												Okay everyone, I'm just doing a quick review of Banished to give you a general idea of whether or not you might like this game. I'm not going into deep strategies here, but I'll try to give some pro tips. Thanks for reading.Banished is about a group of people who have been banished from their homeland and must re-establish themselves in their new land while trying to survive exposure and deprivation. It's essentially a city-builder where your enemies are time, weather, starvation, sickness, and poor planning. You start the game by setting a few basic conditions that will determine much of your fate before you even begin. In my experience, even on the easiest settings, I rarely have a group last more than 20 years. I haven't studied any strategy guides or gone into the forums much, so I'm sharing just what I've learned through the school of hard knocks. Banished can be an unforgiving game. If you frustrate easily, you may want to give it a pass. Let me add, however, that when your strategy works, there is a sense of an actual accomplishment that many far less challenging games fail to deliver.  And you're going to need some type of strategy and some luck to survive more than 7 years in many instances.After you've made your starting choices, you hit the ground running. You can let the clock tick along fairly slowly, but where's the fun in that? Pause the game, have a quick look around, open your most critical reports and let them hang on the edge of your vision, assign initial tasks to villagers, and pump the clock up to 10x speed (if you get bored easily like me--otherwise, just let it go). You may feel an inclination to go big, but I judge that would be a mistake. Don't clear huge areas of land or build the largest farms you can in the hopes that you will survive the first winter--you probably will regardless of what you do.. but that second winter might be your end-game even so. There will be time for going big later after you've learned the basics.Go moderate, but go quickly. Consider these as your first tasks (not necessarily in this order, but order can matter a great deal while you're learning... and even after that). Assign a few builders from among the general laborers. Clear some land. Plant some modest farms and an orchard or two. Build a place for the firewood provider to do his job.  Bump up your resource limits for food and fuel. Keep the list of future tasks assigned fairly short so you can change strategies easily when you're first starting out. You'll need more storage space. You'll need more tools. You'll need more iron, stone, wood. You'll need more fuel and food. You'll need medicines, too. The list of tasks keeps rapidly expanding, but choose wisely and try for some moderation. Don't be afraid to switch people around to whatever job is most needed at the moment. Keep in mind, too, that if things get moving along in a good way, you may be faced with a population explosion that might rapidly deplete one or more essentials. If you run out of fuel or food and someone dies of old age or starvation, you may have consigned your settlement to a slow withering death, or a quick one depending upon your skill and luck. Never give up. You may find yourself down to three people, but if they are hunting, fishing, or engaged in some other food production activity, and if they have enough fuel and other necessary items, you can bring them back from the brink. Just be careful. An abundance of good things combined with a population explosion may leave you without the resources to keep from going over the other direction--then you run out of food, your older workers die from some cause and your children are left to starve or freeze to death. Did I mention the game can be unforgiving? Or perhaps the younger ones already died, and there's nobody but the old and infirm to keep things going just a little longer. Okay, this is getting a little repetitive, but the game can be just that at times.Banished currently has an active modding community, though the mods seem pretty much limited to tweaks: a new type of building, an improved harvest rate, better schools. Consider adding some. Using the right mods, you can change some important aspects of the game that can give you enough of an advantage that you find yourself lasting longer. However, in my experience, having a few mods does not necessarily guarantee a stroll through the park on Sunday afternoon. A few dumb mistakes could leave you without the things or people you will have to have to survive your first 5 years. Who knows? You may even decide to mod it yourself and make it just the way you'd like to play it. Or not. The choice is yours. If you need a big pay-off, I don't think there is one. Nothing in the game gives me any sense that there is anything more to hope for than to survive and grow as a community for one more year. Also, watch out for the time dilation effects. hahaha... No, but you must seriously pay attention to the passage of time in the game because it looks like the seasons pass and only a year has gone by, but your people seem to age far more rapidly than they should. And death is always waiting for your people. Watching and waiting. It's all a delicate balance that you must maintain. Fortunately, there are tweaks for these things as well if you desire to change them.I think that's enough to give you the general sense of how it plays and what it is. I hope that helps. Thanks again for reading. The game isn't for everyone, but it is worth playing. If you played it before, consider trying it again because, even without mods, it seems a bit easier than it did when I first purchased it--I think the developer may have taken some of the community feedback to heart, in other words.Peace.

												It's a great city builder but I feel like it could have more content such as more resource types and industries, other than basic needs. My village remained small and eventually shrank to a tiny size because I didn't build enough houses and had bouts of famine taking a toll on the young. The population that survived was mainly too old to have children so I had a severe labour shortage. After about ten years my population started to recover as I built many extra houses. Now I have a small village of 40 people that primarily produces food via foraging, fishing, a little farming and pastures.The interface would be confusing for newcomers to videogames, it's primarily button symbols with no writing but is controlled using the function keys to access sub menus. The sub menu of food production for example, would then be controlled by using the number keys 1-6 to access the different buildings. This is comfortable, quick to use and looks minimalist which fits with the 'bare survival' theme of the game.Visually the game is very enjoyable and the animations are of a quality I'd expect. I do have some criticisms, the pilot of the trade boat's model looks blocky and low quality at odds with the rest of the game. Also I feel like the tree chopping and falling animations could have been improving with an element of physics or ragdolling. Sometimes the trade boat passes through the fishing dock's model, this is very irritating.The tutorial explains the basic use and controls well enough without spoiling the challenge of the game. It's a great, polished game but I hope that Shining Rock Software take the time to add more content around the 40-year mark. Such as new buildings for new industries and such. It may be possible however that I simply didn't grow my town to a large enough population to unlock stuff that may already be in the game. The occurence of disasters is very low, I had one house fire in a 35 year period, though all my houses were made of stone and one walnut orchard disease. I would also suggest that traders visit more often, or there are other methods to acquire livestock as I had extreme difficulty buying any animals for my pasture which sat empty for nearly 25 years. I did however especially like how the farming seasons work. I would like to see more crops that can be grown at different times of the year such as winter grains.I can definitely recommend this excellent game to anyone who loves the idea of shaping a large town over long periods or failing horribly in the process. It may seem expensive for an indie game but the quality and effort put into creating this, compared to some other games, make it worth the price in my opinion.			"

												I was somewhat underwhelmed by my first hour or so, having finally picked it up months after a strong release to good reviews. I had expected a bit more challenge with a different degree of pacing in order to setup your economy. Instead, it seems to be more of an exercise in tedium and micromanagement of resources and workers. There is a lack of endgame tech/production content or complexity. Ultimately, the game becomes incredibly simplistic once you solve the equation of survivability. Meanwhile, simply scaling up your town and population just doesn't seem to have the right feeling of satisfaction compared to other simulator/builder games.			"

												Banished is a sort of city-building game that focuses on a few families creating a town together, facing not zombies, monsters, or even aliens, but common problems associated with building a new town without any outside force helping (other than traders which only come randomly after you create a trading post and charge very high prices for chickens). This game is not for the faint of heart; if you screw something which may seem minor up, many of your citizens could starve, freeze, or become sick; even when things are going well, something happens which completely blows you off course, such as tornados, crop pests, or just one's own ignorance.I like this game because it is unforgiving, which may sound strange, but it is because I like knowing I messed something up and there is a large penalty for it: Death of citizens, which in turn, results in more death.

												Charming and cute, but uninspired and lacking in challenge.This game combines the startup of Tropico, the theme of stronghold and the resource management of Anno. But in capturing portions of each of these games it also loses what made each game so defining and enjoyable.Reasons for not recommending:- Survival is far too easy, game feels unchallenging.- Achievements are a poor substitute for any sort of challenges or missions- Game badly lacks pacing, even with the speed kicked up- Lack of any political structure (I guess the banished group forms a perfect anarchist utopia?)- Later game just becomes a constant juggling of resources instead of being growth focusedThe game is a good concept but it lacks in execution. With more content and development this could become a great game, but sadly that will likely never happen.			"

												This is one of my favorite games.  I like slow-paced, intricate simulation-type games (SimCity, Patrician, Farming Giant, etc), so if you are looking for action and excitement, stay away.  If you are looking to really immerse yourself into a survival and city-building sim with a handful of people starting out with a wagon and some tools, then this will appeal.  You feel every birth and death as if you were the village leader shepherding his people toward a brighter future, and, at least early in the game, every decision seems essential.  I like that.  As others have commented, the mods really make this game.  The base game was built by one guy in his spare time, and he did a great job considering.  The mods take it to the next level, and although it seems like every version of mod left some bug unfixed, and it isn't likely the creator will go back and fix them, all in all its a very satisfying experience.  The weakest part of the game is late in the gameplay, where there just isn't much to do after survival is assured and your handful of villagers is in the 1000's, and the game can lag a bit on some systems.  But it is always fun starting over again in different climates (the frosty harsh climate, the arid desert climate), which brings a whole different feel to the game, and in the mods, new opportunities for different crops and growing seasons.  There are too few games like this for those of us who like this kind of detailed, down-in-the-weeds, slow-paced simulation style games.  Highly recommend.			"

You have to quickly get the ball rolling; get resources to build new structures, chop wood for firewood, gather roots and berries for food, begin hunting... and the complexity ramps up from there, building tools to keep production going, planting crops, orchards, trading for seeds and livestock, sewing clothes for winter, building a tavern... and while there are a few more things to do after the previously listed goals, once you get to a certain point the difficulty drops off entirely and you are mostly just managing growth at a decent rate that doesn't make you run out of food or supplies.It's very tough to get your first successful village past year 5. You'll deal with problems like old age wiping out an entire generation leaving a bunch of kids to try to survive, or hunters and gatherers under-performing and leaving the village hungry. Once you figure out how to optimally build production, and figure out a couple of the tricks, there isn't much else other than expanding your town to the edges of the map. It feels a bit funky to go from managing 15 adults and 4 kids, barely hanging on, to suddenly having a bustling village of over 300 people. It kind of spirals out of control from there, where you'll have tons of crops, orchards, and pastures providing a massive bounty of food and a plethora of activity going on, fueling your medieval empire.Keep in mind, I don't find this necessarily to be a bad thing. With other city-builders, once you learn the ropes, it's practically impossible to fail unless you seriously screw up. Banished is kind of the same way, but it gets stale after a bit of time  because the hardest thing becomes simply waiting for your builders to walk across the map to bring stone to the new house you want to build, or waiting for your mine to generate more iron. As long as you continue building proper clusters of production buildings, replace quarries and mines as they run out, and keep building new housing, it's very hard to hit a fail state. This feels weird because getting your first 100 villagers can be insanely difficult to the point of frustration. You'll have the previously mentioned generational problems, or you'll run out of nearby stone and end up being unable to build anything, but then it all clicks and you're just building a few things here and there followed by waiting for a bit, seeing how the production and supplies even out, and then repeating.For an indie city-builder, this is a great take on the genre. It's fun to go from a very micro-oriented mindset to managing a few hundred villagers and tons of jobs. The early-game is definitely the most fun part, as it can feel very dire sometimes. Most of my early villages involve watching jobs very carefully and using each citizen to their maximum potential. Most of my late game villages involve setting five things to build, waiting ten minutes, and then building another five things, maybe glancing at my jobs to make sure everything is accounted for, dismissing a trader because I don't need more pecans, and then waiting to build some more things. I wish there was some kind of endgame... I mean, expanding your village can get tough, but once you realize that hunters and gatherers only go so far, and that crops or orchards or pastures will do more than enough to feed you as long as you have plenty... it kind of gets a bit old.Definitely worth it, even if my review here sounds a bit critical. I'm a city-builder fanatic and take them pretty seriously, for whatever reason. This is one worthy of your time if you enjoy the genre. Even if not, you might get some enjoyment out of the ""suffering simulator"" aspect of the first 100 or so villagers. Every winter can be a challenge at first, and that rush you get when you get your first seeds from trading is great.			"

												If you have ever played a city sim that was hard at first but then after a few things became like cruise control then you know how hard it is to make a good city builder. Banished does not have this problem, it is ALWAYS a challenge. Just yesterday I went from a huge 600+ settlement, ( a hell of an achievement in this game) and within 3 winters my people were starving because I was eating through the food surplus built up over decades. So dam sad.... a whole city gone well most of it. The game has great visuals, it is what you would expect England circa 1200 to look like. Fantastic game made by one individual, he definetively deserves to have his efforts rewarded. I wholeheartedly recommend this game it cannot be overlooked if you are a serious city builder type of player.			"

												Sim-City with a strap-on. Make a mistake and you're ♥♥♥♥ed boi.Compared to Sim-City and other city bulding type games, Banished is a lot more challenging. It is really easy to lose in this game, You've got to make sure that your citizens have homes so that they have protection, have to make sure that you have loggers to get wood, have to make sure that you have someone that converts the wood into firewood to keep everyone warm, have to make sure that everyone has enough food before winter, you even have to make sure that your town is not too overpopulated or underpopulated because having an overpopulated town means you most likely have a lot of children who do ♥♥♥♥ all work and increase the demand of food and having and underpopulated town means that not a lot of people are able to work and harvest food.It may sound like I am complaining but that extra challenge is obviously the appeal to the game and which is why I personally love it.I would only recommend it to others if they have an interest in city builders and want an extra challenge.

												This game has some mixed reviews, and from what I've seen, a lot of the negative ones are based on frustration bred from laziness and an inability to properly apply one's common sense in a city building simulator.All negativity aside, Banished is an excellent city building game, but could do with some fine tuning where information is concerned. When I first started playing, it took one or two towns (what I like to call my trial and error period) to figure out how to set things up, and what the natural ebb and flow was. This was - maybe - two or three hours of experimentation, and certainly post-tutorial. When I figured out the very basics, it was relaxing and fulfilling to watch my tiny population grow into something a bit more impressive.My only critiques would have to be regarding the placement of buildings, as that seems to be the hangup for a lot of players. Tooltips would be grand, even an in-game FAQ of sorts for people to refer to when they had questions about what buildings work best, and where. Otherwise, Banished lives up to everything it promises to offer in a city building sim.Tips & Clarificationsthings learned on the fly -+ The benefit of a School House is undeniable, but in the early stages of the game, not the smartest move to make given the time it takes to groom more efficient laborers. Establish a comfortable population, wait for the initial ebb in numbers, where the founding members of your new town die out (and they will, usually one after another) and once you've compensated for that loss and have a few new kids on the way, build a schoolhouse and let the grooming begin.- School Houses take children 10 through 18. New laborers without a school house present, start work at 10. Good things to bear in mind when deciding whether or not to build one.+ Fishing Huts suck. There's no other way around it. They yield next to nothing for the manpower and they introduce panic early. If there is a decent sized patch of trees, it's prudent to drop a hunting lodge, or a gatherer's hut in there first. (I will add fishing huts later more for the variety of foodstuffs and less out of actual need.)+ In the beginning, I like to take stock of my seed (map) and will immediately pause, zoom out and start mentally zoning areas, everything from places suitable for livestock and crops, to dense forest areas fit for cultivation.+ Foresters, Herbalists, Hunting Lodges and Gatherers should never, ever, be placed in a residential area. The further they are from your main buildings, the better.+ Foresters keep the area pruned and lush, providing your people with the wood resource.+ Hunters can only do their job when there's enough woodland to camouflage the deer (less woodland means less deer.) + Herbalists get the largest yield of herbs in old forests. The longer the forest has been there, the better. (Don't clear cut EVERYTHING in sight at the beginning of the game.)+ Gatherers are much the same as Herbalists, the better health the forest is in, the better yield you're going to get.Possibly the most underappreciated, and infrequently mentioned tool in this game is the Increase Priority function. I use it in the beginning to let my builders and laborers know what things need to be built first. (Typically food sources are the first things to go up in my town, regardless of mode and especially in hard mode.) They can live without houses for a season or two, but food is a must have if you want them to survive until they can build those houses. I also cannot live without my Statistics, Log and Job Menu tacked to my screen. Later, when I build a Town Hall, I often have just that and the logs pinned, but it's helpful to have those three open to easily assign workers and keep track of things happening in the game.In conclusion! Don't be afraid to let your game plateau a little bit and build an excess of resources. Manage this with your birth rates, and workers coming of age, of course, but building stores is always good when you're trying to grow and for the longterm.			"

												This is a really enjoyable building game - it reminds me a lot of Settlers, without the fighting. If that sounds boring, then I will say that looking after your people in this game is pretty tough. They will die very, very easily, and they don't reproduce especially quickly - your previously thriving settlement can be a ghost town in no time at all. But if all goes well, and you manage to juggle, plan and manage properly, your people will thrive, and it's one hell of a feeling of achievement. On top of that, responsive chatty developer - and a bonus for me - it looks beautiful on very low end hardware.			"

												First of all I'd just like to point out how incredibly impressive this game is, specially thinking it was made by just one guy. Best game of this genre that I've played in ages!This is the kind of citybuilding/strategy type of game I've been waiting for. It's all about building, managing resources, trading and to make sure all your villagers stay both healthy and happy at all times. That being said, it's not an easy game getting into. The chances your villagers will either starve or freeze to death the first couple of attempts are quite high. However theres a few things you can do that WILL make it all much easier.1) Get into the statistics-menu (the gear-icon on the lower right side of your screen)2) Enable the resource window. This right here is a must. If you don't monitor these closely... you're screwed.3) Enable the jobs/labour window. Make sure you balance these well! If your woodcutter dies and you don't assign anyone to replace him, there will eventually be no firewood left and your villagers will die.4) Enable the evenlog window and to begin with also set it to notify you when someone dies of old age. Reason for this is that the game by default won't tell you anything about this, and therefor you might end up having crucial jobs unoccupied.Place all these windows somewhere on your screen where they aren't in the way of anything and keep them open. The fact is... You will spend a great amount of time looking at these windows. Like it or not. This is what might put some people off in the long run. You've got all your resources flowing well, and you expand by looking at what resources you have available, you place the building while closely monitoring the different values, pressing x10 (game-speed) and pause depending on the outcome. It can get a little tedious at times, but the sense of achievement once you got it all under control makes it all worth it.The graphics aren't really that much, yet it's just how I want it to be. It's simple, yet somewhat charming. I think the graphical-style appeals to me as it reminds me a lot of what the Black & White games looks like - which I played for countless hours back in the days.I'd easily pay 30€ for this game, so the current price of 18,99€ makes this a no-brainer for me. Prepare for many hours of challenging, but at the same time rewarding and relaxing gameplay. Recommended!			"

												Banished is basically a city builder that requires you to start from scratch. Before recommending it to anyone, you have to ask yourself what type of city builder are you searching for? Below I will mention what Banished provides from a unmodded perspective.A. Challenge - In the beginning of gameplay you will be challenged on how to keep your population alive at times. Once you learned the ropes and strategies, the challenge to keep your population alive is not that difficult. But then again I've played this game quite a bit.B. Buildings - Banished in the unmodded format provides limited buildings. If you build a stone house, then that is all it will be, a stone house. Buildings don't evolve like in a civilization style game which means the buildings stratisfy evolving into more efficiency or the graphics change with the next generation. Banished buildings stay the same unless you use mods.C. Sandbox - Banished can provide hundreds of maps you want to start from. The map seeds are practically limitless. This allows you to construct a new village/town facing various dynamics of land types, weather, and bodies of water.D. Micromanagement - One aspect to this game is you micromanage jobs, resources, crops etc etc. If you don't like micromanaging how many people are working as a farmer vs miner, then I suggest you pass this game up. A large part of this game is micromanagement.E. Modding - The game was designed to be modded. There are numerous mods out there that allow new buildings, crops, jobs, etc. etc. The only downside to modding is many mods disable the achievements. There are some downsides to this game but it depends on your tolerance level.A. AI - The computer AI sometimes get very annoying after a bit. The computer AI is the citizens. Citizens go idle once in a while, which results in them being non-productive. An example is you are building a house, the builder almost finishes the project but then he/she goes idle and stops working. The only way to get them out of the idle phase was reload the game.B. Timesink - Expanding your village and creating a higher population takes lots of time. If you don't mind playing this game passionately for an extended period of time then no issue. On the other hand if you have limited time to dedicate to building a village up into a town, then I would think twice.Overall, the game is fun for a while but over time, once you played it over and over, it gets kind of boring. When it is on sale I recommend buying it cheap. At full price I would say it is not worth. If you have lots of time, enjoy micromanaging a village, and understand the aspects of keeping a population alive that was banished to a land, then by all means I would recommend.			"

												After playing well over 1000 hours of this game offline when I had no internet access and trying out a couple different mods I can say it will be one of those games I always go back to, just like Minecraft and The Sims. Sometimes I'll think ""Just an hour of game time before bed"" and suddenly I have a population of 500 and the sun is rising outside. The randomly generated names are a double edged sword. So many times I've thought ""What a great name!"" only to see another newborn girl called Fred born shortly after. The walkthroughs are great for starting out, and anything can be found online. Note: if you put all of your animals in the same area, don't be upset if a hurricane wipes them all out. (Spread herds all over the map and always have multiples!)			"

												A long but descriptive review:  This review should give enough detail for you to decide if it's the right game for you without telling you exactly how to play or making generalizations (""If you like X or Y this is the game for you!""), though I do make comparisons to Anno games in places because it's the easiest comparison to make.Banished is less city builder and more town/village builder/management sim.  This is a good thing in my opinion.  There are no lofty tech trees to chase and no taxes to levy or money to manage.  There are no nobles to appease for fear of them burning down your city.  This is a game where your citizens are simultaenously your biggest problem and your most precious resource.  If you're looking for combat, you won't find it here.  This is survival against nature.Learning curve:The basic operation and interface of the game is very intuitive, but the learning curve on balancing people and resources can be surprisingly brutal.  You do have to be forward thinking with respect to resource management and population management (more on that below in relevant sections).  Even if you are a city builder/management sim pro, you can still expect to have at least one major failure before you get it all figured out.  I personally started a few towns with the intention of determining limits and understanding population growth before making a town I was really invested in.Building:Much like the Anno series, you place roads and buildings where you see fit.  Unlike Anno, there are no hard coded limitations on where you place buildings in relation to each other (no ""sorry, but you can't finish your road because the corner is outside the influence radius), but citizen travel times are factored in and distance of a home to a work area affects the ability of a worker to complete their tasks.  Roads are important for reducing these travel times.  Layouts that would work well in real life can work in this game.  Storage and stockpile buildings, farms, etc. all share the need for reasonable proximity to each other.  Building speed and collection of materials all seem fairly balanced.  There are no tech trees and all buildings are available to build so long as you have the materials to build them.  Luckily, unless you assign workers to a building you don't need, constructing something too early is just a waste of construction resources and time builders could have been doing something else.  There are far worse mistakes you can make.  The only downside to building I've found in this game relates to lack of any terraforming.  Hills are in the way and will prevent building placement even if it's just one square on a corner that's on ""hill"" terrain.  Real people would just dig out a little for that corner.  You can construct tunnels to pass roads through hills but it takes a while and uses a lot of stone, which is an abundant but non-renewable resource (more on that in the resources section).Citizen Management:You manage your citizens by assigning X number of laborers (the default/idle job) to various other jobs such as builder, farmer, woodcutter, etc.  Your citizens will determine for themselves which laborer picks up that job based on their home's proximity to the building/resource being worked.  This distance factor appears to update only when unassigning or reassigning jobs.  Citizens are divided into families which will occupy one house each.  A family starts as two adults and any children they already have if it's a starter family or nomads.  As children reach an age to make families of their own, you have to provide housing for them to expand (unlike real life, young couples won't move in and breed in mom and dad's basement).  This is the primary method of controlling growth and has to be balanced with aging.  If your people get too old before you make extra houses, they'll never get a chance to have kids and your population will stagnate, ultimately dying off.  If you build too many houses your population may outpace your ability to gather food and resources.  Schools are necessary for fully efficient workers.  Health and happiness are factors controlled mostly through resource management.  With the right building, you can receive nomads from time to time which helps with recovery from stagnation, disease, or other population reductions, but they also have the potential to bring disease with them.  Populations can get to decent sizes with a LOT of work.  Early on you can expect to reach a hundred or so before you start losing balance.  With experience and careful planning, people have reached into the low thousands.Resource management:This game has nowhere near as many resources to manage as an Anno game but it does cover all of the basics.  Logs, stone, and iron are your construction resources, all of which can be gathered by laborers under manual direction.  Logs can be sustainably gathered by forresters who will cut and replant in an area around their building.  This is important because logs also become firewood to keep your population warm and will need constant replenishment.  Stone and Iron can be quarried and mined if there's not enough on the surface, but they require significant labor, are dangerous for worker and will eventually deplete.  Often, trading for stone and iron is a more sustainable approach.  There are a wide variety of food sources (farming, gathering, hunting, etc.) and having a variety is important for the health of your citizens (living on potatoes alone isn't healthy).  Some are more efficient early, some more efficient later, but all very good to have.  As you might expect, food is the most important factor in balancing your population, followed closely by firewood (or coal) and clothing.  There is also an herb resource that contributes to the health of your citizens.Final opinions and replayability:This is a sandbox game, not a game with quests and goals.  The goals are whatever you set for yourself, be it steam achievements, X population, stabilized population, challenges, etc.  This makes the game as replayable as your personal interests and imagination allow.  The variety of buildings and resources are reasonable but don't make for significant replayability on their own (like trying to build superprojects in Anno).  If you are a very content driven gamer, you will probably be able to see everything this game has to offer in 5-10 hours of gameplay.  Personally, I love the challenge of growth balance and the long game so I'm going to get a LOT of hours out of it.  This game is complete, not early access, and the finish is solid.  I haven't encountered any bugs myself.  The creator is presently working on making it modable which could lead to significant community expansion.  The music is pleasantly ambient and the sound effects are good.  The graphics are surprisingly good for a one-man project, which I think is partially due to use of great textures.  It's a lightweight game and plays just fine on my i5 laptop with Intel HD4000 graphics.  I hope this review was helpful.			"

												Banished is an excellent game, however not for everyone. If you're looking for a citybuilder that is similar to Sim City, then this game may not be for you. However if you are looking for a City Builder with survival elements, akin to Anno then continue listening!What is banished?I've come to call Banished a Town builder instead of a city builder, even then you'll be luck to get more than a large village in your first few games. At first you will begin with a small hamlet, then you'll become ambitious and want to expand so you can add mines, quarries, town halls, schools, churches and more to your town. This is when the real fun in in Banished begins, as suddenly it becomes a game of balancing people's job. In the winter you will want to change certain citizens roles, such as farmers, as they are useless in the winter and vice versa when it comes to spring time.

The catch of the survival is when something goes wrong, it really can go wrong. Lets take my most succesful town (at time of writing) as an example. I was expanding to quickly, i had a mine, blacksmith and a quarry, all i needed to support growth I thought. However I forgot to take into account that some building use iron and tools, made in the blacksmith use iron, my income of iron wasn't exactly flowing. I had hit around 60 population at the time and everyone had a job. Suddenly the entire village ran out of tools, now everything took far longer to do; farming, mining, foresting, woodcutting. I had no tools to mine the iron fast enough to make tools.

And there, is what Banished truly is, a balancing act, in which things can go drastically wrong with a single mistake "

												Although I have only played about 8 hours so far, this is by far my favorite game in my collection at the moment. It is very addictive and extremely fun. It's the kind of game you want to have when you're sick of getting shot at or dismembered. This is one of the few games I have enjoyed with no story, no stunning graphics, no main characters. You yourself are the protagonist and antagonist. It is up to you to help or hurt this makeshift society. Pros +- Fun and engaging gameplay that anyone from 5-105 would enjoy.- A nice getaway from games like Skyrim or Battlefield. - It doesn't pull any punches. What I mean is that if you make a few bad decisions, your citizens will die. As Eddard Stark so wonderfully puts it, ""Winter is coming.""- Better graphics than expected, this is the first game I've played on Steam that I can with out a doubt say that the pictures don't do the game justice.- Worth the price. Right now $19.99 USD, worth it, although I got it for $10 in a Humble Bundle Sale.Cons -- Still needs work, the game is not perfect. The AI is a little buggy, and the timing on the weather is very predictable. Sunshine, rain, sunshine, rain, sunshine, snow, sunshine, snow, sunshine, rain, sunshine, rain,  and so on...- Not exactly a CON, but the dev is one person from my understanding. Great game designed by one person, but it could be even better if designed by 2+.- Very hard to play now that Borderlands 2 is $9.99, but that's a personal problem.All in all, I give this 4 out of 5 stars. To put in prospective, I give Sims 4, a LOOSLY similar game, a 2 out of 5. Unfortunatly I can't compare it to another City Builder game, as I have none. Hope some people get something out of my  very first review, thanks for reading!			"

												     I purchased Banished during the Steam Summer Sale due to the fact that I love simulation games and the price was right. This game is the most challenging simulation game that I have ever played. The only thing it might be missing for other who enjoy a good simulation game would be the advancement over the years of moving into technology. The other would be others either real or computer generated that you would battle against. I myself do not miss those two factors.     That being said what I do like about this game is it’s challenging factor. You have to balance your focus on many things at once and make smart decisions on where and when to build and or expand your city. Just one minor wrong decision could make the difference between having plenty of supplies or running out and having half to three quarters of your cities population starve or freeze to death.     Another great factor of the game is the pairing of people. If you building the community shelter not a lot of “Breeding” will go on and your cities population will not expand. You must build houses at the correct time and the correct amount in order for your citizens to move in and create children.     The graphics are acceptable and the terrain maps are okay but it is the game play that makes me spend so many hours trying and trying to build a huge city. My maximum population that I have achieved in my 50+ hours of game play is 149. I know and realize that I am doing something incorrect for any possible expansion.     I intend to play this game as long as it take in order to create a thriving city that is well balanced and expanding. I am glad that I purchased the game and I give it a 7 out 10. Thank you. "

												Okay okay, i have been seeing many comments about do not add multiplayer or a combat system in the game. Where I do agree with everyone saying do not add combat, I must say honestly i would love multiplayer added in. Not a multiplayer system that involves competition play, but a co-op feature so I may play with a friend. Co-op (not an AI co-op) would seem to benefit this game, I see no valid argument as to disclaim my personal opinion. Think about it, Banished having two people in it, one player starts on one side of the map, and the other person starts on the other. Both players build how they wish and neither of them may mess with the other persons buildings, roads, or civilians. Endless fun of playing with a friend, again, in a non-competitive and non-combat way.With that being said, I still love this game! It is hard, addicting, and very fun! DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME BEFORE GOING TO BED! You will become obsessed and you will not be able to stop, you have been forewarned future Banished players!			"

												Simply awesome game. In this game, you must sustain and grow your population, either by waiting and breeding your original villagers, or by taking a risk of accepting outsiders to fuel your growing village (soon to be town.) You must assign your villagers a variety of jobs and tasks, such as farming, mining, and trading. However, you face the threat of starvation, disasters, and disease.Pros:-Long-Different difficulties-Logical (villagers must haul materials to build site, instead of magically building without visible materials)Cons:Mid-game, you most likely have already built all different kinds of buildings. The goal of the game is to expand and grow, but late-game it may become repetitive with the limited building options.Overall, I give this game a 9/10. I would like to grow to different ages, not just the Stone House age, but modern and possibly Age of the Future.			"

												Great city building games are few and far.  Banished is a very fresh take on the genre, and takes it a few steps futher than others.  This is an outstanding game, and any who are into builders should play it.PROSEasy to pick up the basics (the tutorials don't kill the mood and weigh the fun down), just the right amount of difficulty.  Once you understand what it takes to make it through the first winter or two, you get a great feeling of accomplishment.  That's when things start going wrong.  The game really makes you analyze what you did try different methods.  Never once was I disappointed when a town died out.  Introduced the idea of sustainability to a city building game.  Most games like this have either a single resource (money), or several that are used to build stuff.  Banished makes it much more real by consuming your resources the way they should be.  It's your job to make sure you don't expand too quickly, or remain stagnant and your villagers die of old age before a new generation comes in.Many city builders are plagued by annoying micromanagement and not enough of the right kind of customization.  The way they designed how you can assigned different types or workers and change them on the fly is awesome.  Also, the idea of being able to limit your resources and how they are used adds a great layer to the game. You'll quickly learn that maybe it wasn't such a great idea to make a crapload of tools for your town.CONSThe only thing I can really think of is some people may want more options of buildings, jobs, crops, tools, etc... While I think they did a good job, some may want a bigger variety.  I can understand some of the negative reviews about how it doesn't have a lot of content, but I believe the gameplay is good enough to play a long time.			"

												You start with just a handful of settlers, banished from their homeland. And perhaps a cow or two, depending on difficulty settings. Winter is approaching fast. Clear an area, build some houses, get some food production going in the form of a farm or fishery. Will you have enough lumber for firewood during the harsh cold of winter? Will your food stores last long enough until the next harvest? Or will a sudden disease, fire, or natural disaster wipe out your colony.Banished is a pure sandbox colony builder. The only goal, aside from chasing a few achievements which can act as “missions” if you interpret them so, is to see how far you can get. Expand your colony too fast, and you might not have the food production to meet demand. This leads to starvation and a huge chunk of your population dying off. If your birth rate is too low (limited by population mood and available housing), there may not be enough future laborers to take the place of those that die of old age. A sudden cold snap, when you don’t have enough warm clothing to go around, causes people to freeze to death in their homes.There is so much that could go wrong at any time in the randomly-generated wilderness, that simple survival has it’s own zen-like reward. When all the plates are spinning nice and balanced, somehow, and everything seems to be going well, the colony acts like a well oiled machine. One you built yourself, through trial and error. It takes a bit of time to learn how things work, like the interplay between the various types of resource generating buildings you can make, how close or far apart you should place things, when should expand, and so on. But each catastrophic failure becomes an important lesson learned to apply to your next attempt. The way Banished works, how its colony ecology functions, is very clear visually. Unlike, for example, SimCity where much happens in “abstraction” as numbers and the movements of the city’s inhabitants are visual fakery, Banished leans closer towards the likes of Theme Park or Theme Hospital. Every colonist matters. You can follow an individual, track their mood and thoughts, and watch them from birth until death.There is so much quality in both the design and execution of Banished. The user interface in particular stands out as clear, functional and powerful without being overwhelming. It’s hard to believe it was all made by just one person. All the software development, artwork and audio is the result of one Luke Hodorowicz, whose debut effort outshines most of the recent city planning simulators by far bigger studios.			"

												This is a great little title - brutal and zen-like all at the same time. Definitely creates that atmosphere of ""five more mintues"" until 3AM.

Draws upon elements from the Anno series (city building with various resources to produce and manage), to Dwarf Fortress (various professions for citizens and the need to strategize so that your entire population doesn't get wiped out due to one shortcoming).

												I like this game a lot. Start with four families and a cart; attempt to carve a new life for your people out of the (not really very howling) wilderness. See the screenshots and videos for how it looks; I find it quite evocative.The game is very tight, very elegant; I like how all the pieces/parts fit together. There are a couple of places the UI could use some tweaking (larger fonts, resizable windows, and perhaps the Trade screen), but otherwise it's intuitive and appealing. I love the look of the game, and I love the attention to detail the developer (singular) paid to the graphics. The AI is one of the better ones I've seen - your populace will occasionally appear to be doing something insane, but for me there has always turned out to be a reason for the insanity (usually something braindead I have done). In fact, the agent-AI is a lot like what EA said was going to be in SCnewest, and then horribly failed to deliver.The game changes with the seasons. Rain falls in spring, trees get their leaves, your people move back into the fields.  Crops grow in summer, your foresters continue to plant, your orchards grow full. The fields empty in autumn, little stacks of resources pile up as your laborers try to get all the crops in before the snows of winter fall.  And around we go again. Every person in your village has a house, that needs to be near where they work, and needs to be near to some place to gather food, and tools, and clothing, and firewood; you can follow individuals around as they go through their day. People age at (I think) four times a village's year - so you quickly find yourself dealing with generations, and watching the elderly die as the young are born. (Or not, if you aren't paying attention)If you like city-builders, if you go through the tutorials, and if you adjust well to the idea that ""slow and steady wins the race,"" then the complaints/issues of it being ""too easy"" and ""too shallow"" have a certain amount of validity. My first village, for example, is in year 58, I have ~375 people, on a small map, and things are pretty much bopping along needing only marginal help from me.If you ignore the tutorials, and common sense, and run the game at 10x speed, and ask regularly ""when does the combat start"" in various fora - You're Going To Have A Bad Time. It is amazingly easy, even when things are going well, to trip into a domino-effect of Suck that will see half your pop starve or freeze to death before you fix the problem.There are achievements, and most of them actually mean something (as opposed to the ""Grats! You Started A Game!"" style) Also, there's no way to get all them with one village, because some of them require mutually-contradictory playstyles.Sometimes I zoom in as far as I can, pitch the camera as low as I can, and zoom along 20 feet about the streets of my little village, just watching my people go about their day.  Yes, I am a geek :)I was in the last round of beta testing, so I've got about 40 hours in the game, fwiw.			"

However, you can learn a bit more with each playthrough, which makes the experience rewarding.  If you stick with it, you'll eventually find yourself running a thriving community.

												My greatest advice is: know what it is you're buying.This is a survival game with elements of city-building. There is not much to it once you have achieved plenty of stocks to survive the harshest of winters. Then, the game becomes more contemplative, with no clear objective other than achieving the highest pop you can.I did get a lot of fun with the game and I still do fire it up sometimes, but the lack of content past the surviving part killed it for me, sadly. I think this game needs expansions if it is to maintain interest.7/10 - A rough diamond at best			"

												The start of the game is fanstastic: hard, engaging, the graphics are ok and you have to plan ahead or your population will die. Once you see how you can balance things out, it starts to get boring really quick. After 10h I've seen everything this game offers. Don't get me wrong. It is a good game and if the developer puts more time into making the endgame worthwhile it could become a must-have. At the state it is in now, I'd be ok if the price was halved. For 18€ I expected a longer time of tension and more content. I can still give it a recommendation, but only barely so.			"

												This games has ALOT of potential. But one problem. FOOD. Okay i have had soooo many games die to this problem. There is always one hungry villager who has 150 food while all my other people starve to death. I had 3 fisher huts with only 20 people. 1 house survived. This is a serious problem and i hope for either a mod or a update that adds less greedy villagers.That being said it is a good game but this one flaw pretty much kills all games so i have to give it a 4/10.

												Banished should obviously always be explained as a survival city-building game. The city-building on its own is rather limited and bland, as you'll register, if you deactivate catastrophic events.If you don't, the game gets far more exciting, with the most important task being to look for a variety in your production. You gain variety, by trading for important seeds & goods, which is very expensive.Summed up, the game remains too limited even in survival mode and rather pointless as a pure city builder, with plenty of better alternatives. It is decent, but nothing that I would recommend. 6/10.			"

												I really tried to like this game, but in the end, even after tying to fix it up to my liking with mods, I just feel ""meh"" about it.I think my problem with it was the lack of meaningful goals. After I got the lemmings to survive and maintain a supply of resources and happiness, there was really nothing else to do but continue to micromanage. I set my own goal of trying to spread out and cover an entire huge map, but it started to get unbearbly laggy before I had covered a quarter of the map.And speaking of micromanagement, I found that part really tedious. The ai of the citizens is pretty awful and in a lot of respects there's nothing you can really do about it, you just have to work around them being stupid. The game ui leaves a lot to be desired in terms of maximizing efficiency, to the point that anything beyond a tiny city becomes a nightmare to manage.Even if you really like city builder games, I'd wait till a sale to try this one out.

												This is not Sim City.  This is not Age of Empires.  This is not simply a city-building game.  This game is about survival of a city you are building.  The graphics are perfectly fine for the gameplay that is offered.  The gameplay is relaxing, fun, and can be BRUTAL.  This game loves to let you feel like you are building a thriving city then all of a sudden you are hit with a tornado that starts a fire, food shortage, and to top it all off the game gives your people AIDs and they all die.  This is a survival city building game.  Your next building decision could literally decide the fate of your entire city.  You have to use your intelligence to balance all the needs of your people.  If you allow that balance to go out of whack for one second, you will be starting a new game.This will be the best $19.99 you spend on video games all year!			"

												This review is based on a single 6 hour play at medium difficulty.Graphics & UI:The game correctly detected my settings and ran at 2560x1440 (something most AAA titles have a problem with). The graphics are well done, detailed and suit the game. The UI has a scaling feature but even at the highest setting some buttons are under 2mm wide. Some UI elements look scaled and blurry.Sound: No problems here except trade ship arrival, a death and low stocks all use the same quiet alert sound. Can't comment on music as its usually the first thing I disable in a game.Bugs & Issues: No crashes or freezes of any kind. On a few occasions builders stopped working but reloading fixed this. The game ran smoothly with no slowdown or lag even running at x10 speed.Gameplay:Banished is mostly a typical city builder game but tries a few things that mostly work well. Lack of an in-game currency is a nice change and trading for new crops and livestock is a nice idea although after a while it felt like any other 'random event'. It doesn't have the extreme manpower shortage that most games of this genre use as as a 'feature' and the way resources are featured is well done. The in-game character A.I. & scripting isn't the best but isn't bad and is much better than a game like Towns. It also lacks a way to prioritize some jobs over others which makes managing supply chains more difficult. The one thing most builder games suffer from is a weak link in resource supply chains and this game is no different, the problem being tools. Once you run out of tools everyone slows down so much that its only a matter of time until your people slowly starve or freeze to death. At 6 hours long it was a fairly quick game but the map felt big enough and while there were more obstacles to building than I like, I never once felt that I was running out of space to expand. In fact I'd say that Banished works better than most city-builder games with smaller segregated clumps of development. The one thing I did feel while playing was that at no point did difficulty ramp up in any way.  Managing 120 people feels no different to managing 20 and there was little incentive to diversify foods when health & happiness barely dropped. Despite a few issues that can be easily fixed (or overcome with mods if the feature is added), the game is fun and worth a buy if you like the genre.Summary: A well made fun entry into the city-builder genre. While it suffers from a few of the common problems with this type of game its worth a buy. "

												I managed to put over 30 hours into this game in a barely 72 hour time spam. Very addictive and highly recommend it for someone who's looking for a great simulation game. Actually, it's more like a survival/simulation game imo. But, you want everything in this game to be perfect. It can get pretty intense when your people start starving if you don't have enough food or a sickness breaks out and you don't have a herbalist and a physician. One of the things I absolutely love about this game is that when you want to start over, it doesn't feel like a boring rut or anything like that. You just become so focused on getting crap right this time. The maps are also randomized as well. One time, everything was going perfect for once. There was enough food, tools, clothing, firewood, etc. And the next thing I know, a tornado comes ripping through my village. Killed some villagers. Destroyed my town hall building, houses, fisheries. Mother nature is cold. And you will never ever be prepared for it. Banished is also all about balance, such is life. You have to make sure your people are feed, happy, and healthy. As well as make sure you keep building enough houses for them to reproduce. The townsfolk also love their booze, it makes them happy. Do not have a village without a tavern for the love of god. The villagers also have a mind of their own. At one point, my village was running low on food because I screwed up. And I go around clicking on houses, checking inventory. And this 16 year old woman was living all by herself and she was hoarding food. ""On this episode of Hoarders...."" She literally had over 200 servings of corn, 150 fish, 300 venison, etc. Are you freakin' kidding me? So you know what I did? Ordered to have her house tore down and then build a small cemetery out of the materials from her home. She became homeless. Thus she had no inventory. And died. Her grave being in that cemetery. Overall, if you want a game that's addictive and repeatedly punishes you, get this. Pros.-Addictive. (I know, I know. I keep saying it. But I don't think you guys understand). -Challenges you.-The villagers will annoy you and will find ways to extract revenge. You are the god now. -The soundtrack is really amazing. Love it. -Different maps, map sizes, local seeds for corps, livestock, and can also name your village.Cons.-Villagers can be assh0les. -Nothing is truly in your control.-Addictive.			"

												"" Banished is what many city/village building games wish they could be when they grow up. No barbarians screaming at the gates, not a zombie in sight, just good solid building with intelligent villagers, clever mechanics, and thoughtful details. It's easy, it's relaxing, it's soothing. Until the realities of colony life bite you in the backside! Banished is addictive. ""

												Banished is the best sandbox town builder! Similar to Age of Empires and Settlers games except without the threat of war. There is no need to produce soldiers or defence/offence items/people, its just a pure town building simulation, where the only threat is mother nature. Be warned, Banished is addictive and while playing, hours can go by in a snap!			"

												This is a very simplistic game. There are about 20 buildings, from houses to farms, orchards, markets, etc. At the start it can be challenging because you have little margin for error. If you run out of food, everyone starves. However, once you master that challenge, there's basically nothing else to do other than make the city bigger. There are no advanced supply chains or goals, it's just rebuilding the same 20 buildings over and over. And about 8 of these buildings are to make food. I bought this for the good reviews, but this game will entertain you for about four hours. After that, there's just nothing to keep your attention, unless you just want to make the biggest city you can.			"

												I must say its a great game. But it has some issues that decrease its replay value and make you depend on mods (which locks all the achievements.) And there's no patches or updates that fixes these issues, just mods. Mining is too hard, your civilians cant move their asses etc. Its not exactly a city builder, its a survival game and you'll go crazy how much your folks eat and cant MINE. You can cut trees and produce firewood or use coal in order to stay warm. If you use trees either you wont be able to move your town towards forests or you will make the map a desert.  I've been cutting trees like Isengard and it wasnt enough. So you'll want to go with coal mines, right? 30 workers in a coal mine makes 7000 coal at max which is not enough. And each person eats 100 food per year so in big picture you exchange 30.000 food for 7.000 coal. And that's a lot of food.This issue made me crazy so thats why i stopped playing. It should be fixed by the developer for more fun and in order to try achievements. As i said its a great game, but it needs fixes. And without those fixes it doesnt worth its money.			"

												I love this game, but I also HATE this game. I love the idea, the setting, the goal ... everything. But, the mechanics are downright frustrating. Typically, at Year 15, I have 20,000 or more food and around 60 residents. But, around that time, regardless of all the population-building strategies I've built, people start dying ... and the game doesn't tell you that people are dying or why. And, strangely, their homes still use firewood, and they keep eating. In fact, the decreased population eats more and faster than the increased population. So, by Year, 20, I'm down to 30 residents, but I'm still burning as much wood as 60 residents, and my food stores are down to starvation level. After 140 hours, what's the lesson to be learned? Don't play this game. All it does is become an obsession to try to figure out why it works this way, but for this game, there is no answer. Anymore, I just play the first 10 years, because they usually make sense. Banished is the only game I've seen where the better-off your city is, the more people die for unexplained reasons.			"

												1-sentence review : it's not a bad game and it clearly has some strong appeal in if you're into casual building games, with no goal nor real challenge, as there's nothing to aim for except keep on on extending your population till you bore, which for me happened after less than a dozen hours, and thus makes the game too expensive at the $20 price point ; you might want to get it on a sale though.Pros :- nice ambiance- seeing growing your village- interesting to set up the economic chaining for the 1st timeCons :- no difficulty except for 2 things (see following points)- keeping your population size requires to create new houses ; apparently, grown up adults would rather die childless than having sex in their parent homes, even if it's 60% empty ; this is problematic because in the long run, the extra houses will lead to extra population, and not creating new house means your village will wipe (they might be Mormon), so it's not really possible to keep a constant population without doing a lot of extra stuff (ie: manually destroying houses at some point)- the only economic challenge is to know that you need to have a Storage Barn near your production zones, while the description of the market made me feel it'd replace the barn ; this lead to a massive starvation death rate in my village ;-)- once you reach a population of 100, you'd do the same things other and other again- the different vegetables & fruits don't seem to have any relevance except a little bit for trading- a lot of information is hard to get ; eg: I have no idea how much food my population needs per year, so I just looked the available food in the inventory and when it went down too much, I built more field (game is already way too easy so extra information would make it a total ride in a park, I guess)			"

												For short version, Banished - without a proper story or purpose - is a magnificent game for people who likes to create what they want to create. City building, micro management, lovely sounds, realistic graphics, medieval theme, simulation. If you like at least 3 of these things you need to take a look at this game. There are plenty of achievements and they are HARD ( or just long, depends on your gameplay skill). You can create your own story behind that town. You can watch your exiled villagers. If you are powerful enough, you can even play long enough to see that they are improved theirselves and they don't need their civilization which banished them at first.In conclusion : If you have enough time to spend on games like this, DO NOT even think a second time. This game will be known as one of the legendary games and after 10 years or something when people talk about it you can say, '' well i was playing it before it was cool.''Because the developer opened the game to other developers, it gets updates and there are a lot of workshop items for it.

												I now am busy with village number 4 after dying of twice from hunger and once from cold.Yes there is no war but there are PLENTY of other things that can kill your village: Hunger, Cold, Disease, Animal Attacks, Childbirth(yes, I kid you not!), Old age(trust me, when  you don;''t have enough kids, age kills you off!)Yes the game is zen as their is no war, but if you don't watch out you'll run out of supplies before you know it!Start slowly, don't build to many houses... come to think of it, don't build to much at once, you don't want them finishing the cemetary while everyone is waiting for the new farm to finish and give them the much needed food supplies.Building a small harbor(trade outpost) gives you access to livestock, seeds and all kinds of nice stuff. downside... you need to trade! there is NO money in the game, you want something then you better have something to trade.You never like UI in games? Well in Banished you get to choose waht you want to see, simply choose the info you want and drag it to where you want. Love the custimisation!Options: Well it supports DX11 (and 9c) and has a lot of graphic options, music ingame is amazing and of course lots of settings for audio tweaking as well. Oh and don't forget that all the hotkeys are custimizable! :DIf you like games like the anno series , simcity and sorts.

There won't be enough food.I also recommend that if you have to step out you save beforehand and leave the game running to see what happens...if its bad just reload.So Population first than everything else.

												Banished is one of those games that looks amazing in it's simplicity. A combination of rolling hills, forests and rivers combined with modestly sized and decorated builds make the game look as barebones 'back to nature' as the title would suggest.The game requires you to be adept at planning and building your town from the ground up, with sometimes severe restrictions of resources. You need to manage your population to ensure that you have enough homes, food and clothing to take care of them and you need to assign jobs in order to increase your production. The game can become incredibly difficult and actions made in the first moments of the game can sometimes seriously hinder future progress. I'd highly recommend to anyone who is interested in a well implemented city builder which focuses on keeping your people alive. There's no big talent trees, there's no evolving through the ages, no building troops or managing defenses. Your only enemies are the cold and starvation, so get building.			"

												I picked this up in the sales for just under £8 and can immediately say it is well worth that price. I would very much like to see this game progress more and see what else could be added to better justify the £14.99 price tag. But if you're into town/city management games like this (eg. cities xl) then seriously buy this game, cause you will sink hours into it.Gameplay is really nice, UI is very pleasent to use especially when you can drag modules like town stats and a map around to places where you like them to be. It's also really simple to understand and get into. If anything the play style will be the hardest part to get used to.Graphics are really nice as well and the game runs so smoothly, no fps drops or spikes.Overall I would highly recommend picking this game up.

												This punishingly hard medieval town sim will have you managing not only building materials, but also food, tools, and items to survive winter.  Don't plan effectively, and your town will fold like a cheap suit at an origami expo.  Not enough food from your farms prior to winter?  Everyone starves.  Did you forget to have your woodcutter working this summer?  Prepare for you populous to freeze to death.  Did your blacksmith die of old age, and did you forget to replace him with a young apprentice?  Prepare for your production to slow to a crawl when you run out of tools.  You will manage workers, food sources, renewable building materials (read as: trees), and even housing vacancies.  Ignoring any of these metrics could spell the end of your fledgling colony!  Players are challenged to not only gather resources to survive, but to do so in such a way that is sustainable.  While the base game is very good for those of a management mindset, Shining Rock Software has made a smart decision by integrating steam workshop support.  The player community has added a number of resources, such as different crops and livestock, and new buildings as well.  Banished really shines when you add the Colonial Charter mod by [Black Liquid].  Colonial charter adds a large number of resources and new starting options, allowing new players an easier way to learn, and offering veterans numerous options to challenge themselves.    Beyond the fun and challenging gameplay, the graphics are also quite nice.  With a multitude of building and road types, your eyes will soon feast upon the robust hamlet you have created, and the sight is both pretty and something to be proud of.  If you like city builders and are looking for a challenge, look no further.  Banished is for you.

There are a few serious issues that pop up after a while—notably the ""march of death"" wherein your laborers will starve themselves on the way to a job across town, and a single optimal strategy that allows for far faster expansion than any other—but for a few dozen hours it's a lot of fun.

												Not often do you get such an in depth and complicated game that is as easy to play as Banished. Banished is a game about trying to create a small town while battling the hardships of cold and hunger. You will have many towns that die due to fire or lack of food, but this can all be prevented with a little forward thinking and planning. The user interface for this game is excellent and provides ease of access to any aspect of your town that you want to control. The game also looks pretty; aside from the reoccurring rain, it's a joy to be able to look at the little town that you have built from scratch. The easy controls, rewarding play, and good graphics make Banished a great game that's worth picking up!			"

												I nominated Banished for the Test of Time award.  It could be bigger, it could evolve further, but what it does it does so well it's hard to not keep coming back.Winter Update:I left Banished running overnight at 10x to take a run at the last 200 year achievement.  I figured I trained my peeps well, they'd survive without me for a night (err, 20 years).  Recovering from the fallout is about the most fun I've had with this game, and that's saying something.  When I returned, tornadoes and fires had ravaged two major population centers.  Two markets were in ruins and 50 homes destroyed.  Half my farmers unassigned.  They were freezing with almost no stored food with twice as much consumed as produced in the last year.  500 people without tools.  But I've got 1400 stored iron, weirdly enough.  Even weirder, my population is not only within my designed parameters at about 950, it's actually been on a growth spurt for 10 years.  How did my town grow under these conditions?  I like to think they evolved the ability to digest iron while I was sleeping.  And that's why I love my people.... original review ...You've just gotta hate it when a game dev figures out that exact formula to completely overwhelm your good sense and trap you in a never-ending spiral of digital imprisonment.  It must be amusing to wield that kind of power over people.  I imagine the dev has a throne and a white cat and often spontaneously ""mwahahahaha!""s while stroking the kitty.I was half finished with the tutorial when I began to suspect that this game would suck up hundreds of hours over the next few years.  About 20 hours later, I know I was right.  I don't know how long it will take to build out the modest space I'm in now, but I know when I'm done I'm gonna want to try again, and again, and the modding possibilities are tantalizing.Sure, the interface could be improved (suggestion: display recommended worker count alongside material requirements while laying down pastures/fields) in several places and there are some limitations to the A.I. and prioritization that require a somewhat restrained style of play, but all in all I haven't been this pleased with a purchase since I bought Defense Grid.  I actually feel a tiny bit guilty for having gotten Banished on sale.  Release some DLC, Shining Rock, and I'll do my penance.			"

												A village simulation game. There are no ancillary objects other than succeeding challenges of growth, fire and winter. You start out with a handful of homeless villagers and a stockpile of food and tools. You can build houses, roads, farms, fishing piers, wells, mines, etc. There are no skill trees. However, there are resource walls. Don't plan on raising cattle without trade as cattle can only be acquired through trade. That's not to say successful towns require anything other than your creativity in resource management. Successful towns are often built around diversity and quantity of food and resources.The game reminds me of Black & White but without the godlike abilities, opposing town, or civil strife. Essentially, Sim: Village. Just needs a few aliens spaceships to go with the occasional tornado.I recommend this game to those who enjoy the genre of simulation; specifically, city-building, without the city. If your looking for conflict other than watching your villagers fight off winter, famine, and fires, then this might not be the game for you.			"

												Really enjoying this game based on my experience so far. Intricate and relaxing game of micro-managing people and resources to slowly build a thriving settlement. Similar enough to games like Dwarf Fortress or UnReal World that simulation/management genre fans should be able to pick up and play, but originally styled enough to feel like a fresh experience.I have built up a small self-sufficient community, and am embarking on educating the children that are soon to be young adults. Compelling just watching the settlement grow through the seasons. The major part of the gameplay involves the balancing act of providing buildings and specialised jobs for labourers, thus increasing your production output, whilst ensuring enough resource production for the immediate winter - and for a growing population.I believe that the test of the gameplay in the future will be how luck factors designed to introduce challenges (such as disease and famine) are manageable with forethought and planning. If it's always doom and gloom with little way to mitigate failure, it may be that there's not enough longevity in the game. But I have no reason to suspect that at this point. It's been fun (and worryingly smooth sailing).I want to mention that the movable, informative (and yet unobtrusive) UI is fantastic and should be something of a benchmark for future games.			"

												For a one-man project, this game is amazing.  It's a solid city builder in a pseudo-medieval setting with a population scale that makes sense for the sort of structures you're building.  There are a few serious issues that pop up after a while—notably the ""march of death"" wherein your laborers will starve themselves on the way to a job across town, and a single optimal strategy that allows for far faster expansion than any other—but for a few dozen hours it's a lot of fun.

There won't be enough food.I also recommend that if you have to step out you save beforehand and leave the game running to see what happens...if its bad just reload.So Population first than everything else.

												I've seen city/village building games come and go. This one however is a keeper. Its easy to learn and very straight forward. I'd go as far as to say it has all the best parts of many good City/village building games without the battles every 10 seconds.The game looks very mild at first. My first words were...""I'll fall asleep playing this and my city will probably keep going""...nope.Took a shower and cooked some food...came back and a tornado wiped out the town. So you have to pay attention or it will check to see if you're really there and watching.The graphics are top notch, the game play is excellent, the replay value...Awesome!All the tools needed to build and keep track of every little detail have been thoughtfully provided. Not something you always get in a city building game, It even has a log that you can read back to the simplest thing.You might not conquer the world in this game, but the maps are hard enough.			"

It took me many tries to even get started, and once I thought I was going just fine, something would happen and I'd have to start all over again.This game is a test of patience. There hasn't been any updates to the game, but there is a belief that development is there. The game is small content wise, there isn't a whole lot of variation in what you can do, but honestly it's currently enough. This game is difficult and really fun.

												Banished is, hands down, the most addictive city-builder/strategy game I've EVER played! It is almost impossible to believe that the best game in the genre is made by a single person.  It puts the ""big dogs"" to shame.  That being said, Banished will relax you, it will make you panic, and it will make you mad beyond belief -- until you figure out a good strategy.  Just when you think your town is going well, BOOM... starvation, a lack of tools, or another disaster kicks in.  Say goodbye to all of your little people!I've played this game over 100 hours and just yesterday had my first really successful town of 800 people.  And that was only after a helpful tip from another player.  That lasted for 57 in-game years, then 150 of them died off, one at a time.  Despite how mad this game makes me -- because of my own bad decisions -- I find myself playing it again, and again, and again... DETERMINED to have a really great town.Applause to the developer!  You have me hooked!Update: 600 hours and it still has me addicted!			"

My Pet Medieval TownOr how Banished turned me into a complete monsterFinally, a city building game without incomprehensible statistic screens and no invading armies to worry about. Just me and my people against nature.I started Banished all hopeful and tried to nurture my first brave band of exiles into a happy, healthy community. After they all starved to death I tried again, paying more attention to quick food access this time. When they froze to death with the onset of winter, I took a third stab at it, balancing food, fuel and housing more successfully - and thus began my slow but sure conversion into a medieval despot.Now I'm ruling over a small town ordering ten year olds down mines or sending them out into snowstorms to break rocks. A couple of very old men who have worked for my town their whole lives, sired many children and tragically lost their wives to old age - these men still work, but I want them dead, because I can't evict them and they're taking up a whole house by themselves and I want a younger 'breeding pair' in the house. When the old widows and widowers die, I let out a happy little 'Yay! Finally!'The only reason I even have a graveyard to shovel these spent workhorses into, is because productivity suffers when the dead go unburied.I began the game a nurturing benefactor - now a mere 24 hours in, I'm an iron-hearted tyrant. You have been warned.			"

												A true city builder in that Banished is all about planning & efficiency. You could say playing Banished is ""Zen-like"" because there is no overbearing external pressures - you are merely massaging your production systems for optimal output. But don't rest on your laurels - there is the ever present slow burning drain on your resources - you consume resources to live and build. If you fail to plan ahead your town will wither away: because you didn't store enough food, tools, or materials. The first 100 citizens is an engaging challenge, but then it becomes repetitive - until you hit 300+ citizens when you start to struggle against the natural limits of expanding your large town. Banished was developed by one man, and while I praise his talent, I can't ignore the following issues. The trading mechanic is very basic, but that is 'ok'. There is no stupid combat mechanic like in the Anno series, which is 'great'; The variety of external threats is still pretty good. The production & building requirements are simple - which is bad, ok, or good depending on your love of complex systems (but this is a city builder game you are playing). In comparison to the Anno series, Banished is very basic in many ways. Banished doesn't have the huge variety like in the Anno series (crop variety is not real variety). In Anno 2070 there are many ways to optimise your production because of the intricate production networks you create - but this is not possible in Banished (because it is all AI determined) - but this may be a good thing you prefer your city to be easily understandable.I highly recommend Banished as a good introduction to city builders because of its almost elegant simplicity. When you get bored, which you may not, then try Anno 2070. "

												this game is what every strategy/citybuilder game should be.the very moment you start with this town you already start to make plans for the future.""I will build that over there and that over there, and my mines will go over here next to that thing over there""the first time you build a graveyard next to your church you are happy, because there is no one on that graveyard, that is a sign that you are doing well, but it's the sadness that kicks in when you see the first 2 graves there and you start to wonder:""what happend to them?""but it's also the weird stuff that keeps you going: ""why is that 0 year old girl walking around?..

												Balance seems to be the most important thing in this highly enjoyable sim. You have a small band of refugees under your care that need everything from shelter to food. You are given the task to make sure they get the right resources from the right spots.And this can get really frutrating sometimes, because you never seem to have enough people for all the jobs that need to be done and never enough resources to get all the items you need.And then winter comes and your people start dying from the cold or from starvation... Or you didn't build enough homes and your village is slowly dying because not enough babies are born.But once you get some balance... it is just  worth it to see the seasons pass and to see your village grow.Absolute favorite 9/10			"

												Banished is a simple 'settlement-builder' game which, I imagine, will continue to take up many hours of my gaming-time. If you jump straight into the game without tutorials then you won't last long, but if you take the time to learn the basics then you will be set for building your cute little villages.Here, though, is the darker side – if you make a mistake in your planning, you can accidentally lead to mass deaths. Unlike games such as SimCity, there are serious consequences for your actions. For instance: in trying to build a Town Hall I soaked up all my iron resources, meaning tool production stopped, meaning my food supply plummeted, meaning a serious famine. A great game that every gamer should try, even those not used to the genre.  All I would ask for is OS X support.			"

The game looks good and has a good bit of depth. In fact, if you didn't do any study or watch any videos or read the Banished forums before you played, my guess is you would kill off your population several times before you figured it out.

												To say it's a bad game,  is incorrect.   It's a game of struggle and survival.  Unfortunatly,  once you ""survive""  you are then limited on challenge.  Sure an odd disease may come along,  Tornado,  and fire,  but then as your city grows, the games poor pathfinding and AI become your bigger concerns.   However long it took for this 1 man to make this game,  using ""I'm only one guy"" as an excuse for all its faults is nothing but frustrating.   If you want a little sandbox game,  then this is good, but if you are seriously looking for the rival to Tropico,  Anno, or Sim City 4,  hold onto your 20 dollars for now,  and see if the modding community can polish this into what it should have been, rather than what it is.

												This game is inexplicably hard.  The strategies and pathfinding lack any form of reasoning.  For example, gatherer's huts, hunter's lodges, and fishing huts all produce more food per person than farm fields.  If that were in any way realistic, humans would never have moved towards agriculture.  The game boasts scenic, procedurally generated environments.  But, that is the extent of this game's shining points.  Resource gathering is as a whole is a painful and dreary process.  Moreso, however, maintaining reasonable levels of harvestable resources is nigh impossible.  Not to mention that once your town reaches a respectable size, citizens prefer to starve rather than path to the nearest storage barn.  Overall I would give this game a 3/10.  If you're looking for a challenging civilization builder, download Dwarf Fortress, it feels more complete than this game.			"

												I DO recommend this game. The 'city-building' concept is one I like and have pursued from the earliest years of the genre. Banish is appealing to look at with its neat little houses and leafy landscape and would seem to have great promise for those who like  games that slowly progress to their end-point.  Trouble is... dare I say it? It is, at present... boring.   Starting from 'Hard', it has taken me 10 years to grow a population of about 35 souls. I  have a mine, quarry, school-house, couple each of hunting-lodges, gatherers and forestry conservation sites, a fishing hut, market and traders post. Oh, and a blacksmith and tailors. No-one has died, children have been born and raised to adult-hood, no-one has starved or got ill, no disasters whatever have come my way - and only one trader, so far, has arrived, who wanted to sell wool, but did not have the seeds or stock I need to start a farm or grow fruit. I sit here twiddling my thumbs, waiting for something to happen.I followed the development of this game from early days as the developer, known as Dukas,  took time and trouble to inform us of its progress; the snags he encountered, the problems he solved, the  details he attended to. It was a fascinating insight and for that alone I want the game to succeed because to see it actually finished and presented was almost like  watching a baby come into the world. In that analogy, I think Banished has some growing up to do. I look forward to the promised mods. Dukas  said he wanted  us to create - mods to enhance the game, expand it, enrich it. Yes please! I also think it needs something more to aim at than simply balancing the plus against the minus. Something extra you  can get to happen or attain. Seeing houses  evolve from what they are at the start of the game to something else as you progress, for instance, though I do not  think that will happen for Banished. One day, but not quite yet, Banished will be a great game, and if Dukas puts as much time and attention into the next game he creates as he did this one, building on his experience with Banished, it will surely be a corker - and NO ZOMBIES - yay!

If a Civ tweek could be added, where you can evolve from the nomad life to the full on space age life, I would probably never play another game for as long as I live. I enjoy the build, the management, the ""playing god"", if you will. Most high functioning sociopaths do.The greatest thing I enjoy about this game? NO WAR like other builder platforms. Let me build my town, let me battle tornadoes and crop bugs, but keep your stinkin guns and tanks away.Highly recommended you get the Colonial Charter mods, or any of the Black Liquid mods. Total game changer. I played bareback for almost 300 hours in this game before I discovered the workshop and all of it's wonderful addons. Now, its like a whole new game, for FREE. HURRY! GO NAOW!

												What to say about this game.... Very hard to get your foot in the door if your a big planner. I have failed so fast because I keep trying to build things to fast long before the citizen's could sustain it's self.This game is a Challenge. You will need plenty of Patence and planning skills to enjoy this game.I would say get this game if you truely wish to enjoy City planning, that focuses soley on the survival off the land with the occasional trading for farming resources.

												Despite my thumbdown on this title, the game is good and has potential, the thumbdown is due to a few things that makes the game more or less unplayable.Its not crammed with tons of features, but it holds a few good ones which makes it possible not to lose the overview of things.However, the gameplay is completely ruined by the starvation bug where ppl suddenly start starving to death and theres nothing you can do about it.I have approx. 56 fishermen and 44 gatherers in a population of 250, then I also have some livestock, so basically, almost half the population is producing food, but still they all die from starvation.I was running the town with lots of foods and the stock continuously climbing and with no increase in population, but then suddenly ppl started to starve to death.I added in xtra gathers huts and a couple of fishing stations, took ppl out of the mines and quarry and put them into the food production units I just created and as those who already died didn't need to be fed, I was actually producing more food for even fewer ppl, still the stock of food were tumbling up and down between 500 and 1200 and ppl kept dropping like flies.Hopefully the game will become playable beyond a few hrs of progress some day, but until it does, its not worth investing too much time (or money) in as ur town will be doomed the minute u found it, its all a matter of how many hrs before the starvation bug kicks in.Theres also plenty of room for expanding the AI code to a level where villagers wont make stupid decisions, like one villager I watched, who were grabbing and dropping the same batch of iron in the same spot for 1/4 of an ingame year and when he stopped, he ran out and came back and started over again. :sigh:Also like some villagers might get stuck between buildings where they walk in to, but for some reason cant find their way out of again.Villagers will also vanish into the thin air from time to time with no warnings at all.You wont find out until some production drops massively or is completely halted, due to the fact that whoever worked the given productionunit, has simply vanished.It means that u have to actively monitor all productionunits by clicking each type continuously (one after another) in order to make sure they are up and running 100% and that part soon becomes VERY annoying, especially as u have to dig up replacement workers all the time.Implementing some feature that allows u to set automatic job assignments for the villagers by priority, would be a huge advantage here.Like if u want to have foodproduction set with top priority, so that when a worker within a foodproduction unit vanish, he will automatically be replaced by a worker from a lower priority productionunit e.g. coal mine, stone quarry or whatever u like.Then add in a notification when it happens, so that u are aware that a worker went from ""Mining"" to ""Fishing"".Combined or made with something like ""Automated job assignment"" where u can set the minimum and maximum amount of workers u want in any given line of trait, either so u assign a fixed number of workers or by percentage of the population.The feature shd be free of choice whether to use or not, as some ppl may actually like the micromamangement aspect in clicking single workers and giving them individual assignments.But if u want to try and grow a village to a more massive scale, that micromanagement may just become too tedious and even overwhelming and in that case, automation shd be a possible choice.

I cared for my town and its kids, it was great immersion for me.  I have not tried any of the mods yet (and I am at 87 hours!).  I have just enjoyed trying different strategies to see which works the best and which keeps my people from dying off.I bought this on sale and would strongly recommend you put it on your wishlist and wait for a sale to come along and buy it.

												Banished is a great and enjoyable game! However this game got me addicted and played it nonstop, when I looked at the time it was 6pm then next it was 3am! When I first started the game I was amazed with the amount of detail that the developers have put into the game. I got myself into the tutorials to get my elf a head start so I know what I was doing and get used to that basics, but that wasn’t enough! The game can be hard for some to get the grasp off so I do recommended reading some guides but others may find it easy and can play the game with no struggle.The sound quality is awesome!The Animation is awesome!The Graphics is awesome!Overall I would recommend this game to anyone who likes the survival and to build they own town.

												Banished is an amazingly built indie simulation game.  I say indie because it is built by Shining Rock Software which consists of one person.  He does everything from the art to the programming.  It is amazing what one person can accomplish.  Like it says on Banished’s own website the game is a throwback to the games that were played in the 90’s.  I am barely old enough to qualify to talk about those games, seeing as I was born in 1989, but even I can remember playing those early simulations games and loving them.  This game for me brings me back to those days when a Sim game of any sort could just waste away whole weeks of your time.  Whether it be Sim City or Sim Farm, those games were just the best.  And it wasn’t about the graphics or the immersion or anything that we usually talk about in games today, but it was about the fun factor.  The exploration and building of a little world that you created.Banished is also a neat little game that you can’t win, but only survive.  And because of that I think most people will find the game boring because there isn’t really much that happens.  You plan and build a little settlement into a town.  Hours upon hours go by if you are doing it right as your town grows.  Eventually you just run out of resources and your little ecosystem comes crashing down all around you.  The game however is actually very hard because if you “overexpand” the same thing can happen and lives will be lost so it is important to plan ahead.  All in all I can wholeheartedly suggest that everyone should try Banished.  With my current disappointment in Sim City, Banished fills that gaming whole for me and then some.  It is a great game to pick up and play between gaming sessions and on those “raining” days where you just want to sit around and play a fun simple game.			"

												This game gets old very fast. After just 12 hours of playing I'm already bored of it. The gameplay is tedious and incredibly imbalanced. AI is unresponsive. It was fun for about the first hour before realising that unless you play perfectly something will always come up and wipe your whole town out in a matter of minutes - regardless how much time you invested into it up to that point. This game is not worth $20.00. Very disappointed.			"

												This is a hard to master/high reward type of game. The goal is to keep your settlement alive, which is a lot harder than it looks. Keeping an eye on food, clothes, firewood, medicin, laborers, health and much more without failing is a real challenge, that's why I love the game.Unlike many other city builder games you have to keep track of everything that your city produces, and make sure the population has access to it. A single missing resource could create chaos or in worst case, kill off the entire village.When you have learned the basics of keeping your population alive, it's an amazing sight to see the villagers slowly build up the village into a huge city, if you can keep them alive...Pro:- A challenging & rewarding experience- Decent graphics & music- Tons of mods & new stuff with the steam workshopCon:- A bit repetitive after a while - Hard to learn and VERY punishing for mistakes- Bit lacking in vanilla content (workshop makes up for it though)			"

Banished is one of the games where you just need to play 10 minutes more. Even without a goal, other then keeping your town alive, it keeps you hooked for hours and hours.Its all about managing your ressources and expand when the time is right. If you expand too soon you will end up starving or freezing to death. Or if your too late the outcome is equal dire. But if you like a good management game you will love Banished.THE GOOD- Complex interlocking systems- Charming presentation- Wonderfully challenging- Steady difficulty curve- Weather effects- Solid menus with a customizable interfaceTHE BAD- No long-term goals- Lacks a sense of progressionDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE			"

												Rarely do I love a game as much as I love Banished.  It's atmospheric - the sounds of rain, wind, and seasons are beautifully done, and the music is melancholy and haunting, but lovely.  The sagas of the people you watch over in these tiny, scrappy towns could be used to write a Steinbeck novel.  There is tragedy and hardship, but also, a kind of rugged, pastoral beauty.At the end of the day, it's just a wonderfully pure gaming experience.  A rare thing, these days.  For the price, it's more than worth it.  My hours played should speak for themselves.			"

												Jaide was the first baby born during the population crisis, a new hope to the town. After a couple years more children were brought into the world by the citizens and a new generation was secured. I accompanied Jaide's life closely, often checking on her in her parent's house near the gatherer's hut admist the forest.The girl became the first attendant to the village's school, a village where half the population was illiterate, years before any other child would come to attend. Graduated at 18, I was proud to see her become an efficient educated worker and help the others in their struggle to survive. One summer I was surprised to see that Jaide was no longer living with her parents, she had moved in with Dicki, a 16 year old still in school; they had a daughter of their own in that very season.The town hit it's lowest population of all time while Jaide was an adult, as the older folk were quickly dying of old age, but Dicki and his wife had 5 kids, all parts of the silver lining above the food shortage and low workforce. Years later another generation was finally reaching adulthood and the people started seeing better days.Jaide died in the autumn of '20 of old age. When the message announcing her death popped up my eyes shed a single tear.10/10			"

IntroThe game type is not only sandbox, but a full sandbox game: indeed it lacks any type (really any type) of goal. The game genre is a strategic medieval city management with stunning graphics and it has (maybe) the better season system I've ever seen.Pros- 3D graphic and visuals are wonderful;- music is good also if there are just three or four songs and that's it;- season system is really realistic and well represented into the game;- in the first game the morale will be destroyed by death of a family member and the cemetery is used also to replenish it: it's totally realistic;- trade is another realistic thing: to me is ok but for someone could be too much 'real'.Cons- total lacking of plot and goals: just survive in a random generated land;- it gets repetitive: any scenario will force you to find the same configuration of buildings to survive (i.e.: forester+gatherer will be the first of your problems in any scenario also with food buildings). The total absence of research and progression in time will render the game just more repetitive: it's merely the same building after one hour of play and the same after twenty;- no campaign and no friend or enemies to interact with anyway no interaction at all with anyone;- after you've decided a scenario is done (because resource is limited or because you're satisfied or because simply you've no more building space) the only strong reason to play another one is a passion for the Steam achievements.ConclusionBanished with some more attention and variety could've reached the Olympus of the strategy games. Unfortunately the game is really survive and that's all. Apart from that this game reminds me the first in The Settlers serie: ok in 1993 graphics are not like that :) but the concept is the same. I abandoned The Settlers at the sixth level because I found it repetitive: any new scenario brought more or less the same challenges but at least they are masked with some interaction with enemies and a progression in difficulty. In Banished I felt the same sensation... at the first scenario: for me it's inconceivable to have the same let's say configuration at the first hour and at the tenth. Nothing evolves in Banished.So to appreciate or not this game depends on the type of player you're: I have limited time to play, I love plot, character/condition evolution, research, development and of course strategy. If you're like me, then you could find this game frustrating and maybe found something better to invest the limited time in.If you have plenty of time to invest in playing and you cannot sleep until you've obtained every Steam achievement in the universe, then definitely Banished it's for ya ;)			"

												The game is good in many ways, but something that really bothers me is that the developers kind of abandoned  it. I know that it wasn't early acess, but anyway many developers still release gameplay enhancements after the game's release. It really relies on mods to have a better replay value, and many i liked are now outdated. If they release a little expansion, or even a big paid one, i may change my review.			"

												Man this village I made is GREAT, it's self sustaining and has an average population and... wait... wait NO!!!!.....Well 2/3rds of my population is now dead thanks to a tornado.... awesome...For those who actually care about a review:Skipping all the bland details that every other review states I will simply skip to the most important part of my oppinion on Banished...The reason I decided that Banished was not worth a positive recommendation is simply put:After nearly 2 years of this games release, there have been very minor updates (Mind you ones that should have already been fixed before the game was even realised!); bug fixes (Holy jesus a lot!), gramitical errors, and crashes(a lot)...(I did my research)... And this thing called the ""mod kit"" got realsed and the dev kinda... poofed. Went from 5 updates a year to 1Lets face it, the dev kinda dropped this project and left it to the fans to finish for him... and unfortunatly unlike minecraft and other heavily fan influenced games, there was no major fan based game saving mods created. Banished has died. :(With such little replay value, as anybody who has gotten past the initial hurdle of surviving has discovered in this rediculiously tedious and challenging game. There needs to be more content for this game to be considered good by my standards.That is all.			"

												This game gave me simple pleasure, the pleasant music and alluring nature of the environment lured me in from the get go. Then I experienced my first famine and from then on the game became a battle and it wasn't a battle for epic or for even moderate it was a battle just to be mundane and survive and I loved it!!Nothing was more satisfying than getting a town to survive long enough to have 200 inhabitants. However even then even when I had lots of food, plenty of clothes, abundant tools it can all go to hell in that precious few moments. 2 Bad winters and my people started to starve, you are never safe and this game requires 100% attention and 100% dedication but it is by no means boring.A game I proudly own.

												It's simple. It's no Dwarf Fortress, maybe more of a cross between Sim City and the Anno series, just without the complex spreadsheet-based gameplay of either. There isn't a lot of variety in the gameplay, even the maps are simply ""How much does it rain/snow? How much impassable mountains are there?"" and with both the inability to pick where you spawn and how fast you kick the bucket if you don't set up immediately means you're just stuck with whatever the game starts you out on. Once you do get started, though, it's mostly twiddling your thumbs and trying to set up constant resources while hoping you actually get people.But, despite all that, it really isn't a bad game. This review was made when it was first released and it's being actively developed, so circumstances could change. If it's on sale or you have a itch for this sort of game you can do much worse.			"

												Banished, a city building game that not only makes you want to build a city and have it self-sufficient, but to push the boundaries with labourers. This game tests your managing skills and your ability to work out what you need and when you need it, to keep the city going. Banished is based in an era where technology is not around, so farming, tree cutting, tool making and other similar jobs are done by hand/humans. This make the game simple by there being no upgrades, however for your city to grow, you need to build more houses so the people of your town can reproduce growing your adults population which in turn creates labourers which you can use to set a direct task i.e. farmer or blacksmith, or simply leaving him/her as a labourer to collect stock from the areas around your town coal/iron etc. By evolving and building up your town, you need to make sure that it has sufficient food wood/coal to survive the winter. This game is based on seasons (Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring) which is broken up into 3 sections early middle late. Surviving before during and after winter is one thing, but to survive with enough food for your town during all seasons, or being able to help the sick, or even put out fires is a constant battle. This game make take an hour or two to understand, and you may wipe out a town in a process. But this is the Banished experience. Every person play this game differently, and it is great to see how people setup their towns if you buy the game as it is only $20 and play a few hours you too will enjoy this game.			"

												Try as I might to actually like this game it is far too unbalanced to be what it claims. Love the graphics and most of the relaxing feel when everyone is working, but with the sudden swing that comes when some of the eldely die and housing becomes available away from a person's actual job it eventually screws you... With no way to designate one service as a higher priority it is beyond frustrating to have everyone starve in no time because the citizens decide to travel to the furthest location available for the same job.

												The game is completely ruined for me by utterly abysmal AI. I just can't handle the stupidity of the townsfolk. It makes the game very difficult to manage but for the completely wrong reasons... For example:- Out of four houses in my town, two houses would be starving and the other two would have way too much food than they needed. This was purely because certain townsfolk would get to the food first and take it all for themselves. Even though the two houses that were starving were actually closer to the food source. - People would completely ignore that fact that they were starving and let themselves die. Going to work when they should prioritise feeding themselves. And even leaving their starving new borns at home to die. These problems quickly resulted in a downward spiral of death and labour shortage. Further resulting in a completely dysfunctional town. I tried to play three times. This happend everytime and I gave up in total boredom. Yes I haven't played for very long but regardless of time played the AI would not change it's behavior.			"

Banished is a city building simulator with a difference. My first few attempts met with disaster and I quickly realized that it's also a survival simulator. Building a healthy colony that will prosper over the years requires planning and careful, moderate growth.  Early survival sometimes is balanced on a knife edge. While all buildings are unlocked immediately in the unmodded game, overconfidence is a killer, and many folks may find this a harsher, less forgiving simulator than most.  However, once one works out the mechanics one soon has a colony up and running and carefully building up a surplus while not over-expanding can lead to an addictive game for those that are detail oriented.  Hours and even complete afternoons may quickly disappear while managing one's colony. The game is visually pretty great. It runs smoothly and without any difficulty on my Windows 8.1 set up. While  there is some minor lagginess when running at 10x speed with a population over 800, that's NOT really a problem most of the time. I understand that the game is the work of one single developer and I find that amazing. It's an incredible achievement.I've currently got 94 hours in game and have collected 27 of the Steam Achievements associated with the game. So far I've NOT played with any of the mods though I have watched a couple let's play series using them and mods add a whole extra level of awesome to this game. And that brings up one of my few complaints... Achievements cannot be earned if any mods are enabled. Of course that includes the mods that allow non-English speakers to play the game. (Guess one of the hidden challenges is that one must master English in order to earn any achievements) Several of the achievements aren't conducive to earning in the same game. These include building a colony without any agriculture , or building a colony without educating one's populace, or even building an isolationist colony that doesn't trade with the outside world.  While I THINK that I could now earn any of these in separate replays (and I''m planning on trying) I'm more interested in exploring how the game plays with some  great mods that are available.  If only there were a mod (like the one in City Skylines) that allows you to earn achievements with Mods enabled...For a game that costs less than a movie in Manhattan this game was a GREAT investment. (I got it in one of Steams frequent major discount sales) By All Means if this sounds like your kind of thing I'd check it out.			"

												This review is based on the current vanilla version of the game, which is to be regarded as completely finished (There will not be any further updates or patches). THE GOOD + It's Different: Banished is a city-, or rather, village builder. The main goal, however, is not to build a prosperous metropolis, but to keep your citizens alive in a hostile environment. The key to this is wise resource management and proper planning. Banished has been called ""The Dark Souls of City Builders"" and I can agree with this. It may seem very hard - even unfair - at first, but once you understand the mechanics, it becomes very doable as long as you keep paying attention.+ Actual Simulation: Every single citizen is born to a family, given a (weird) name and after growing up and finishing school, will get a job, move in with a partner and found a family of their own. Everything that you set in motion will be visibly carried out by your citizens; from clearing land to planting seeds to finally bringing in the harvest, you can observe every step being carried out. Similarly, buildings don't just plop up where you order them built, the necessary materials have to be carried to the location, after which you can watch the structure being erected in two or three visible stages. Your workers have to get there first though, which means the farther away from established infrastructure you chose to build, the longer it will take (and the less efficient production buildings will be). + The Achievements: There are no ""Do something incredibly moronic and counter-intuitive that will totally frack up your savegame, or just be a boring grind that will taint your memory of the game if you care enough about achievements to actually do it"" type achievements. Almost all of them are just about doing well at the game. The others, like ""Mountain Men"", can be viewed as scenarios (which are otherwise missing from the game).+ The Bugs: I haven't encountered any. THE ""MEH"" ~ Graphics: The graphics are OK, i.e. ""not ugly"". Fully zoomed out, they're even kind of charming, as long as you ignore stuff like the river-crossing Jesus Deer.~ Sound: The loop of a very limited number of background music tracks quickly becomes boring, but at least the music isn't annoying (to me). The same cannot be said for some of the ambience sounds like the mooing of cows or the gusts of wind, which are constant if you play on x10 speed. MOO MOO MOO WOOOSH MOO MOO MOO WOOOSH MOO MOO MOO WOOOSH AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH. You'll probably play with (ambience-) sound off after a while. (Why isn't this under ""bad""? Because it's almost enjoyable on x1 speed.)~ Resource Management Tools: While overall very well done, they're lacking in some parts. E.g.: - You can place production limits on all manufactured goods, including clothing, but not on leather and wool, which are needed for clothing. If you produce slightly more raw materials than your tailor uses (and if you don't keep an eye on this), your storage barns will eventually overflow with them, meaning there's no space for produced goods anymore. This is exaggerated when the clothing limit has been reached and the tailors stop production. - You cannot prohibit citizens from using certain goods. They will eat the wheat intended for your brewers to make ale and they will use coal instead of firewood to heat their homes if coal is stored closer to the market than firewood at that moment. (You need coal for steel tools). You also cannot limit selected stockpiles to only store certain goods, or a maximum amount of a specific good.These are minor issues and there are ways to get around them, but it certainly isn't optimal.~ Variety: There's not a lot of it, except in food. There are very few building types and even fewer upgrades (one for houses). But hey, it works and there is enough to manage. THE BAD - Performance: This simulation-heavy game is not optimized to run on multi-core processors and will only use one core. This results in simulation speed and FPS drops after a certain amount of citizens in your town. The point of the game slowing to a constant crawl was reached at a population of around 1000 in my case (i7 5930K). This is quite late in the game though. Point of reference: The highest population achievement is 900. CONCLUSION I obviously enjoyed playing Banished and I sincerely recommend it to everyone who is interested enough to read through this review. It's a good game. Not great, but good.			"

												Good city building game, often on sale.You control villagers by placing orders to harvest/build and by managing employment. You don't control villagers directly. Want to cut forest? Select trees to cut and increase your wood cutter/forester employees. Unoccupied workers will go do the job. Villagers needs houses, food, clothing, even firewood to burn in winter, so this can be real survival simulator if you dont have enough wood before winter. You can live with your villagers from their birth to death so you will need also to build some graveyard. No need to mention that there is plenty kinds of berries and other things.			"

												It's been favourably compared to dwarf fortress. It does have the same issue of being a bit dull if things are going well.

												Banished is a fun and interesting city builder once you get the hang of it. Despite the riveting negative commentary that nearly persuaded me to give this game a pass I am certain I'll be playing this for quite some time. Comments about the game lacking content are completely unfounded in my opinion (besides, pong and asteroids didn't need content to be fun.)The overall command system is fairly easy to master, and the ""micro-management"" referred to by many is actually just assigning jobs to citizens (some of the comments made it sound like they had almost no autonomy) and ensuring you have everything they need to survive and thrive. Yes, your townsfolk will starve if you neglect to plan ahead, but I was able to keep my food stores full on my first try just by anticipating the worst. Think sustainability, and don't grow too quickly, and you'll be in for a great gaming experience.			"

												Summary: Lots of fun for a city-builder, definitely worth 20 USD.  Took me 50 hours of playtime to get all achievements.Long Version: You remember the rabbit in Monty Python's Holy Grail?  It's a lot like that.  You start off with this cute little bunny of a village, then all at once, it lunges for your throat and leaves you bloody and beaten.Banished is full of ripple effects:  Everything's running smoothly and you feel confident in building another house?  20 years later, because of that extra house, everyone is dying of starvation, freezing to death or dying of diptheria.My laborious little laborers have been trampled, stabbed, plagued, frozen, crushed, drowned, burnt, swept away, and one lucky teacher went batshit crazy.  And yet, humanity persevered and thrived.It's a game filled with subtleties and harsh lessons, but definitely worth playing!			"

												Of all the city building games, this one may be one of the more basic games out there. It was a low budget indie game, but it does a ton of things right. As you play through the game and build your town up, you're faced with a ton of problems. The world is harsh, and food is scarce. As your population grows, so too does threats of diseases and harsh winters. There are various resources that must be constantly harvested, hunted, or gathered year round. The changing seasons of winter, spring, summer, and fall affect the way your crops grow, and if you are too slow with planting and harvesting, you may find your town collapse.One of my favorite games from 2014.

												Great game for those who love the combination of a city builder with a dash of survival & simulation. Can be relaxing to play on the easier settings, and can be downright ARGH mode on harder, when you just want to survive the winter without total starvation. Exceedingly fun, and with some interesting achievements to go after. I've logged about 80 hours into the game, and it has a good replay value. I find myself coming back to it time and again for a few hours of gameplay. Just now getting into modding the game, so there are many more possibilities to be opened up.

												It is a pretty nice game. It seems to be difficult at begin but after few hours you get the tricks and can have a got start then, even on hard conditions. The interface is easy to operate so you don't have to search for anything too long. At some point you will make your actions automaticly.In some aspects, this game is unbalanced (e.g. amount houses needed for population to grow with population that exceeds 300 citizens or getting enough firewood for that population). I am not going to say that those are bad, becuase I couldn't handle it. I suppose in reality it could be the same. You have to think in order to let the town grow smoothly and if you are too lazy to think, just try again :PThe disasters which can destroy your town are awesome. I had a town with about 350-400 citizens and tornado had struck it. As you can predict almost everything have been destroyed. I have lost about 80% of population citizens left so I had to build everything again. I haven't done that but I loaded the previous saved game in order to avoid waisting additional time.			"

												When I first played Banished, I greatly underestimated the numbers involved. Its not like a traditional simbuilder where you just keep an eye on income, but you have to keep an eye on literally everything your villagers do. It has a decent learning curve though and it is a very good example of ""trial by error"". It takes a few attempts to get a good village going, but you shouldn't let that stop you from trying again and again. It's very rewarding to notice you keep doing better and better at the game.One final important piece to notice though is that this game will start to lag the larger your town becomes. Some people with bad computers will notice a slowdown after 500 inhabitants, I noticed a huge lag/slowdown at 1000 inhabitants. I recommend just playing on a medium map.Dont expect a thrilling story or objectives and goals. This game only has two goals: expand and survive. It's a great game ""to pass time"".			"

												My thoughts on Banished...This game has been produced by a single person, so first off congratulations on such a tough task!Banished is a city/town building game which combines survival elements found in many recent games. It has a vast array of building types, jobs for citizens and can be extremely engrossing.Graphically this game looks wonderful, small details here and there offer the world a lot more depth. Colours looks fantastic as seasons come and go, caking the landscape in snow or lush green hills.The tutorial lays everything out for a newcomer to the series, though making sure you complete every single one provided is key to success. Lastly this game includes mod support and some mods that the community has cooked up are really interesting but NOT required to enjoy this game since the vanilla version is extremely well done.Props to the developer and i look forward to future DLCs for games you release.10/10			"

												So, this game is pretty fun, gets you thinking about what you need to build first and makes you keep everything going together. Only problem i've had with the game is the AI setup for both tasks and item distribution, both are a little wonky. People do things that don't make sense, such as not eating when there is food in the stockpile, and 1 person having 5k fish and nothing else in their house. Other than that, it's pretty good, mods mainly just add aesthetics to the game, not ease of play.			"

												3/5 StarsPros: This is an open sand box game where you have a lot of freedom to make choices over how your settlers move forward. It is reminiscent of a wilderness version of the old (fill in the blank) Tycoon! games. If you liked those games, I would definitely recommend this game mostly because there aren't a lot of newer games in it's niche. I would recommend starting without natural disasters because at first struggling to move forward is hard enough (and slow enough) in this game without half your village burning to the ground. It's definitely fun once you learn the controls, but it wears off. The graphics seem good for a casual game, and the soundtrack sets a very immersive mood. The controls aren't that difficult to pick up on, and abundant descriptions help you learn as you go. Also the randomly generated geography is both entertaining and beautiful.Cons:There's a limit to how long you can play before you get annoyed/bored out of your skull. Commands take annoyingly long to complete. And when you have limited resources (Basically the entire time you play) you're basically watching people die while you wait a painfully long time for workers to collect/make a resource so that you can do something so that they won't die. Even in full fast-forward the game seems to take forever. It probably is a more realistic expectation, it just means that you spend the whole game scrolling around looking for something to do while you anxiously wait for something to finally finish.Some of the game mechanics are annoying. The merchant ships never have anything that you want, and the few things that you would want (different livestock for example) never arrive. You're supposed to be able to help prevent natural disasters with different structures in the game, but they don't seem to help much (wells don't seem to do much against fires, the sick people wander around outside the hospital and get everybody sick) And it feels like nobody is ever productive. Most annoying of all, Resouce production is stupid slow.			"

												This game is absolutely brutal.  That is a good thing.  Normally after playing a typical sandbox city building game for an hour or so, you have the whole system figured out and can game the hell out of it so you can just let it autorun for an hour without any attention.  Banished is a harsh mistress and isn't just your run of the mill citybuilder.There is a constant need to keep an eye on your town since the overall success of it all boils down to people.  Citizens can die from anything, from workplace accidents to old age.  The loss of just one person can set off a ripple effect that can wreak havoc on your village if you're not careful.The graphics and sound design are pretty decent, seeing as this game came from what amounts to a one man studio.  Controls are simple and easy to use, and the guts of the simulation will keep you on your toes.Probably one of the best citybuilding sims I have ever played.  10/10			"

Select trees to cut and increase your wood cutter/forester employees. Unoccupied workers will go do the job. Villagers needs houses, food, clothing, even firewood to burn in winter, so this can be real survival simulator if you dont have enough wood before winter. You can live with your villagers from their birth to death so you will need also to build some graveyard. No need to mention that there is plenty kinds of berries and other things.			"

												i've only played for a little bit, but i can definitely recommend it. it's kinda been putting me in a trance lately just watching the people go about their daily routine. then i get tired, so i save and quit. after a couple minutes, i snap out of it and wonder why i stopped playing. so i turn the back on.i've been playing games since i was eight years old (almost 40 now) and this is without a doubt one of the best games i've ever played in my life. buy it. i got it for  5 bucks awhile back and i believe it's 5 right now. i wish steam didn't keep track of hours played, it's pretty sickening to look at the total sometimes.buy the game now. thank me later1.

												This game IS addictive, challenging, relaxing, and really a pleasure to play.The background music is almost hypnotic - I think there must be something subliminal buried in it xD.  Hours after I've turned off the computer, I find that repeating tune stuck in my head.  God help me, I love it.As of this writing, over 91% of the reviews are Positive, and there is good reason for that.  The game is a winner.  There are an almost infinite number of scenarios to choose from, with some childishly easy to succeed at (a good place for beginners to start), and the difficulties go all the way up to essentially unsurvivable.The incredible number of MODs available to choose from in the Workshop also adds so much richness and variety to the game.  There is a HUGE Banished community growing and supporting the game and its MODS.  The one scenario that seems to disturb me most is the two settlers, Adam & Eve scenario - LOL, where brothers wind up marrying sisters, and then 1st cousins, etc.  Now, that's a genuine Uncle Daddy & Aunt Mama family tree.  Anybody on earth should find that hilariously funny, with no disrespect meant to Arkansans.... Bless their hearts.I've seen a few critical reviews that reference Sim City, and such, and if that's all they see here with Banished, they came in the door with the wrong expectations.  I own multiple generations of the Sim City series dating back to Win95, as well as, Cities XL, Cities in Motion, and so on.  Banished has little in common with those, IMHO.  The Banished player gets the chance to more closely manage resources and activities, and essentially 'craft' to build more complex structures, more sophisticated clothing, etc. (Hint - warmer settlers work more efficiently in harsh winters).  This is not a high pressure, can't go AFK for a coffee or bathroom break, kind of game.  So, settle in, relax, and enjoy.  For frenzied, Constant ACTION, Run 'n Gun players, there's always a CSGO / COD server somewhere, right?!In short, the Banished player chooses the region and number of initial settlers, as well as starting resources in the game menu.  The race is on to get sufficient shelter, food, and fuel (firewood/coal) before winter sets in.  When it gets cold, you won't see much production from the settlers.  The strategy you start with is up to you.  As for me, early in the game I prefer to focus on Gatherers and an Herbalist (the Healer) before that first winter.  I've had great starts where there were tons of firewood, food, etc., only to see everyone die off to sickness, because I forgot the Herbalist.  Another point I keep in mind is to stockpile absolutely every scrap of firewood, food, and medicine that you can lay hands on to the point of ridiculous excess, so that you can spare settlers to be teachers, preachers, and healers.  Sure, it sounds corny, but Education is important, since educated workers here simply produce more.  Be leery of nomads.  When they show up, they usually lack education, have scores of unproductive, hungry children, and invariably bring disease, so you better have a hospital.  The game never makes it clear what the disease is, but I suspect some nasty STD - LOL.  Again, no offense intended, Arkansans.When I first started the game, I had settlers dropping like flies, and sadly, my major concern seemed to be having a large enough cemetery.  But now, regardless of difficulty, I manage to keep things balanced enough that the only deaths seem to be from old age - as it should be.  I also highly recommend one of the Mods that change the passage of time to one actual year of gameplay for each year of the settler's life.  The default seems to be several years of life for each four-season Banished year.  When everything is stable for a moment, and little direct input is required, it has a great Fast-Forward x10 that moves things along until a point where more input is required. A satisfying moment for me is when I'm 8 or 9 game years into a scenario, and I have some of the original potatoes from the wagon in the barn.  That's when you know the food production is more than under control.  Anybody hungry for a 9 year old spud?  I'll pass!I bought Banished during an earlier Sale, so keep your eyes open for sales.  Frankly, for me it would be worth the money at full retail, so jump at the chance to buy it either way.  More than 91% of the buyers think you'll be glad you did.  I hope this was helpful.

												Decieving. Banished appears as a very relaxing game as it has great graphics and good soundtrack which creates a tranquilising atmosphere but upkeeping your town is hard work as the town and its populace can be wiped out with very simple mistakes such as not creating a food source early on or forgetting to make firewood.You should play it.

												Banished is a willage building sandbox simulation set in medieval era. Feels like a mix of Cultures, Stronghold and ANNO series, except there is no combat involved. But soon, you will realize that there are more dangerous things than armed enemy approaching your carefully designed willage. Things like aging of your citizens, whom after death have to be replaced, otherwise there will be no production and most of your people will die. Vicious and unreliable weather which WILL now and then freeze the soil and prevent your farmers from planting new crops in early spring. Yes, and the same weather which will insidiously freeze your crops in autumm, thus preventing the farmers from harvesting those few left shrunken potatoes. The potatoes that you were praying for all summer to be last chance of feeding your starving population. Logically there is no escape from starving so most of your people will die. What's next ?. Yes..Does your food production relie on those lazy hunters ? Bad luck ! deers have moved on the other side of the map so there is a slight possibility that your people will die. Nice ! a merchant has arrived to the city ! He sells sheep and chicken ! Quiclky bulid some space for them to multiply ! Now there is a nice herd and is succesfully reproducing itself and providing your population with some meat resource... But look ! what's that green cloud over there ?! Is it a death cloud from Baldur's Gate ? Yes it IS !!! Now in Baldur's Gate it could kill a Boss Dragon.. so.. yeah,, you get the picture... Banished is good and addicive game. It has quite simple logic : you just have to let your people multiply and keep them alive, that means happy and healthy. The circumstances that cause your people to die are well balanced. In a while you will be able to guess the chance of your stonemasons to be killed by a falling rock, or your other citizens to freeze to death because of lack of a firewood. Yes you did't cut enough trees to survive the winter ! But don't worry you can always train some foresters so there is someone taking care of planting new trees. If you like detailed and production systems you will be in heaven when seeing your chicken farms producing not only eggs but also fresh meat from chicken above limit. Yes, you can easily set a number of chicken allowed in the pasture by draging your mouse on the scrollbar. All other chicken gets slaughtered generating a meat income. Also sheep are fun, and aditionally they produce wool for making warm clothes. Really nice is the possibility to combine resources to make more valuable and more durable versions of a standard products like clothes and tools, and if your barns are overflowing with equippment you can always sell it to a merchant and buy for example new seeds or animals. Just bear in mind that there is lots of events that will randomly change your resource flow, one year making you rich of food because of a good harvest and the other year losing third of your population just because yo have sold your food to a merchant expecting the weather and harvest to be as good as the last year.I would recommend this game to players with adiction to simcity, anno, cultures and stronghold games. Just don't expect it to be a walk in the park.			"

												This game is hard , very hard but that is where it shines. Even on easy it's hard. It challenges you to keep trying , keep trying again and most likly you will fail but it makes you play it again , to try again and learn and it rewards you .  This isnt SimCity and dont treat it like it or the game will not be nice to you .            The indie dev team deserve a lot of credit for this . The graphics are good and the soundtrack is excellent . Now with the addition of the steam workshop the mods available makes the game even better, while not needed , they add dept to an allready great game . In conclusion   if you like city builders this is a great game which needs a bit of thinking for every little action you take . Never expand too quickly or you will die . Thats my golden rule when playing this game .			"

The biggest problem I have is finding an ideal starting place for my town, but I'm starting to get the hang of making due with what I'm given. The challenge is quite fun.

												This is a peaceful, relaxing game.  No combat, no soldiers, no defenses, no conquering what-so-ever.  The game primarily focuses on resource management, especially food management.  You grow your city at your own pace, fast or slow, doesn't matter.  The traders come very rarely at first which is a bit of a milestone.  From them you can purchase seeds, livestock, food, etc. in exchange for your own goods.  Not all traders have the same thing.  One might have peach seeds while the next 5 might have coats and leather.  I've played games that take years before I get livestock.The visuals, ambient music and sound effects, are all pretty good.			"

												First of all, if anyone tells you that this a nice relaxing building game, they are wrong. This game can be extremely hard (even on easy difficulties) especially to begin with but once you get the ball rolling and have a nice, stable town… my God… it’s so satisfying.Although this game is hard I still think that this is one of the best games that I own and I am so glad that I bought it. It’s extremely addicting and I find it really hard to put down.Pros:-	Easy to control the camera-	Easy to understand-	Complete control as to what you build-	The families grow by themselves-	Fun to laugh at some of the stupid names this game has for these people-	Lots of control with the difficulty settings (disasters etc.)-	FEEL LIKE A GOD!!!!Cons:-	You might find yourself yelling at you screen going “HURRY UP AND MAKE BABIES YOU FU**S!” like I do…..-	Can be really hard-	Not good for people who can’t be very patient-	Once you do get a lot of food etc. people die of old age :( "

												It´s authentic and hardcore. I like it.Ever thought Anno was to easy? Well then try out Banished, seriously, on normal settings it´s even hard to keep your people alive and away from starvation, which is not your only enemy. This is really hardcore and there are enough variables to make it hard enough. This game punches you in the face when you think you´re finally achieved a structure. I really enjoy it but just recommend it to people who are searching something like a hardcore expierence which can be much more challengin than Anno. Otherwise you will get frustraded all the time, because this game easily wipes out your hole town in minutes. That means you got to retry a lot.But I still enjoy it, it´s the experience i was searching for.			"

												Banished is a wonderful take on the classic ""civilization building"" game that creates a beautiful mix of survival and expansion that isn't seen much in modern games!I would recommend this game to my own grandmother, as it is that fun. If you like Sim City, Tropico, or any other ""build your own town"" game, then you will love this!One problem I've always had with this genre of games is the obnoxious problem of budgeting expenses, as I would always end up in debt somehow. Banished takes the time period of the piece (ranges from rennissance town to early American settlement, your choice) and only asks that you use natural resources to live. No fumbling money, no need to trade (if you're good), and no worrying about debt.The game boasts beautiful graphics, simple yet challenging gameplay, and an infinite amount of possibilites.Heres a little rundown of the game: -- You start by creating a town, and there are map seeds in case you like a certain area you've played before. You can choose a difficulty which will dictate how much stuff you start with. Weather/climate, disasters, and other changeable aspects  are all modified before entering the game. When all of that is done, you're entered in, and depeding on what difficulty you've chosen, you must start building certain buildings. Simply cut tree's and stones to gather resources, assign villagers to certain jobs and balance out what is important until your population begins to expand. There is an automatic birth/death cycle constantly going on, so your population will eventually increase. Eventually, you can designate hunting areas, farming areas, and much more (trading, fishing, herbalists, woodcutting, tailors, blacksmiths, teachers, etc.) Keep building until your town suits your style, and is sustainable!The game is great! I would recommend you buy it when you get the funds (as 19.99 is a great price for the content you get).Here, have some pros/cons:PROS--Great simulation with climate, seasons, weather, disasters, health, and much more needed to be watched over to ensure survival-infinite amount of ways to go (you can literally build many different towns on the same map)-A+ Graphics-Simple yet challenging-Awesome tutorials that make it easy to get in and go-Large amount of content-No money to deal with! Trading is done through material bartering-Good time period for this kind of simulator-Overall: A+ Fun, Great concept, infinite replayablilty, and always changing gameplayCons:- As of right now I have not found any at allFinal Rating:10/10Beautiful game with an awesome concept and great execution! I would like to see some DLC in the future to expand on the concept!  "

												This game is very, very reminiscent of the Tropico series rather than Cities XL or SimCity.  Individual lives are more important than big-picture thinking, resource gathering is a matter of watching visual feedback---you can see your people at work---and the in-game economy is very much dependent on producing enough to export so that you can get what you need from foreign trade.Then again, that might be this game's problem.  It's Tropico set to Battletoads difficulty for reasons that often don't make sense.  Citizen resource consumption rates are set high seemingly as a difficulty construct, random (negative) events occur at the same frequency they would in the aforementioned Tropico's ""Are you loco, Presidente?"" setting, and the game never reaches a point that's the most rewarding part of the genre---the ability to sit back and enjoy what you've built.  There's always _something_ horribly out of true, or if there isn't, it's only a random event away.Which makes it a great Ph.D-level program for master city builders (I've been playing this genre since SimCity Classic and have played every major and some of the minor series to come out over the last 25 years).  What it doesn't make it is a game to just relax with and enjoy.A hesitant recommendation.  Know what you're getting into and don't force this game to be something it's not and you'll like it just fine.  It's well-constructed.  It just too often crosses the line between fun and frustrating.			"

												It´s authentic and hardcore. I like it.Ever thought Anno was to easy? Well then try out Banished, seriously, on normal settings it´s even hard to keep your people alive and away from starvation, which is not your only enemy. This is really hardcore and there are enough variables to make it hard enough. This game punches you in the face when you think you´re finally achieved a structure. I really enjoy it but just recommend it to people who are searching something like a hardcore expierence which can be much more challengin than Anno. Otherwise you will get frustraded all the time, because this game easily wipes out your hole town in minutes. That means you got to retry a lot.But I still enjoy it, it´s the experience i was searching for.			"

												Banished is a wonderful take on the classic ""civilization building"" game that creates a beautiful mix of survival and expansion that isn't seen much in modern games!I would recommend this game to my own grandmother, as it is that fun. If you like Sim City, Tropico, or any other ""build your own town"" game, then you will love this!One problem I've always had with this genre of games is the obnoxious problem of budgeting expenses, as I would always end up in debt somehow. Banished takes the time period of the piece (ranges from rennissance town to early American settlement, your choice) and only asks that you use natural resources to live. No fumbling money, no need to trade (if you're good), and no worrying about debt.The game boasts beautiful graphics, simple yet challenging gameplay, and an infinite amount of possibilites.Heres a little rundown of the game: -- You start by creating a town, and there are map seeds in case you like a certain area you've played before. You can choose a difficulty which will dictate how much stuff you start with. Weather/climate, disasters, and other changeable aspects  are all modified before entering the game. When all of that is done, you're entered in, and depeding on what difficulty you've chosen, you must start building certain buildings. Simply cut tree's and stones to gather resources, assign villagers to certain jobs and balance out what is important until your population begins to expand. There is an automatic birth/death cycle constantly going on, so your population will eventually increase. Eventually, you can designate hunting areas, farming areas, and much more (trading, fishing, herbalists, woodcutting, tailors, blacksmiths, teachers, etc.) Keep building until your town suits your style, and is sustainable!The game is great! I would recommend you buy it when you get the funds (as 19.99 is a great price for the content you get).Here, have some pros/cons:PROS--Great simulation with climate, seasons, weather, disasters, health, and much more needed to be watched over to ensure survival-infinite amount of ways to go (you can literally build many different towns on the same map)-A+ Graphics-Simple yet challenging-Awesome tutorials that make it easy to get in and go-Large amount of content-No money to deal with! Trading is done through material bartering-Good time period for this kind of simulator-Overall: A+ Fun, Great concept, infinite replayablilty, and always changing gameplayCons:- As of right now I have not found any at allFinal Rating:10/10Beautiful game with an awesome concept and great execution! I would like to see some DLC in the future to expand on the concept!  "

												Banished is a willage building sandbox simulation set in medieval era. Feels like a mix of Cultures, Stronghold and ANNO series, except there is no combat involved. But soon, you will realize that there are more dangerous things than armed enemy approaching your carefully designed willage. Things like aging of your citizens, whom after death have to be replaced, otherwise there will be no production and most of your people will die. Vicious and unreliable weather which WILL now and then freeze the soil and prevent your farmers from planting new crops in early spring. Yes, and the same weather which will insidiously freeze your crops in autumm, thus preventing the farmers from harvesting those few left shrunken potatoes. The potatoes that you were praying for all summer to be last chance of feeding your starving population. Logically there is no escape from starving so most of your people will die. What's next ?. Yes..Does your food production relie on those lazy hunters ? Bad luck ! deers have moved on the other side of the map so there is a slight possibility that your people will die. Nice ! a merchant has arrived to the city ! He sells sheep and chicken ! Quiclky bulid some space for them to multiply ! Now there is a nice herd and is succesfully reproducing itself and providing your population with some meat resource... But look ! what's that green cloud over there ?! Is it a death cloud from Baldur's Gate ? Yes it IS !!! Now in Baldur's Gate it could kill a Boss Dragon.. so.. yeah,, you get the picture... Banished is good and addicive game. It has quite simple logic : you just have to let your people multiply and keep them alive, that means happy and healthy. The circumstances that cause your people to die are well balanced. In a while you will be able to guess the chance of your stonemasons to be killed by a falling rock, or your other citizens to freeze to death because of lack of a firewood. Yes you did't cut enough trees to survive the winter ! But don't worry you can always train some foresters so there is someone taking care of planting new trees. If you like detailed and production systems you will be in heaven when seeing your chicken farms producing not only eggs but also fresh meat from chicken above limit. Yes, you can easily set a number of chicken allowed in the pasture by draging your mouse on the scrollbar. All other chicken gets slaughtered generating a meat income. Also sheep are fun, and aditionally they produce wool for making warm clothes. Really nice is the possibility to combine resources to make more valuable and more durable versions of a standard products like clothes and tools, and if your barns are overflowing with equippment you can always sell it to a merchant and buy for example new seeds or animals. Just bear in mind that there is lots of events that will randomly change your resource flow, one year making you rich of food because of a good harvest and the other year losing third of your population just because yo have sold your food to a merchant expecting the weather and harvest to be as good as the last year.I would recommend this game to players with adiction to simcity, anno, cultures and stronghold games. Just don't expect it to be a walk in the park.			"

												This game is brilliant. Amazing. You will love it, and it will show you why you should hate childeren. Children are freeloading scum. They sit around and eat your colony's food in a shortage and won't even contribute to the colony. You will never see children the same way after this game.9/10would be 10/10 but sadistic children in food shortages and the ai's inability to share (it failed kindergarden) made me dock a point			"

												This is certianly just as much a survival game as it is a city builder, don't expect for the city to run itself ~ your population will constantly be in flux and so will their needs. I highly recomend this game and find it alot of fun managing a growing town and trying to keep it stable. Number one tip is: keep building houses early game! Children wont move out unless there is a new house for them to start a family. Number two tip is: concentrate on stable year round food sources first (fishing, gathering, hunting) and don't overlap two of the same (two fishing, two gathering etc) circles! or they'll produce less.

												I have found inner peace with Banished. This is the city-building simulator I have been dreaming of. Yes, there aren't as many options as I would like, and yes, it still needs some patching, but it is completely worth the price. This one man has managed to create a better product than sim city and release it at a near-bugless state.The game isn't very difficult for me, and the lack of difficulty may be a turn off for people. This is more a sandbox city builder. You are always trying to improve something, however, whether it is building placement, food and resource management, or population growth. It is worth it to build a big beautiful town and watch it go to work			"

												A charming, simple little game that will keep you busy for ages. It's pretty tough, and can be quite unforgiving but having a village/town that you've grown from the ground up, even getting to know your villagers a little, is really rewarding. It's a village management game that isn't afraid to throw you some horrible decisions (Should I keep my villagers warm or feed them?) and can certainly pain a pretty bleak picture if you throw yourself into it hard and fast - but if you take your time, cultivate your village with care, and treat it like the fight for survival it is, then I think you'll enjoy it.TL;DR - tough as nails, survival-heavy, highly rewarding. Save often.			"

My main problem so far is the lack of feedback for any work being done and the sudden surprise by which a town can die.

												This game could be a FANTASTIC game if they would fix the system where every villager takes as much food as possible and shoves it in their mouth to where eventually this leads to rapid death and starvation. For example I had a town and after trying everything possible I just made a bunch of fishing huts and two farms. When I looked at the inventory of a house I saw that they hade every ♥♥♥♥ing peice of fish in the game. They had over 400 pieces of fish! I looked and saw this was the same case throughout all the houses. In the end everyone died of starvation. I don't like that if you are short on one material that it leads to your ultimate demise. So maybe the creator could make it so villagers did not take so much food. Or maybe you get more materials so you don't die. Right now I give this game a 7 out of 10. But if they fixed it I would make it a 9 out of 10.So after playing this game once again after an update or two I thought they would change the AI so they didn't take the world's population of food and ♥♥♥♥ themselves in the ♥♥♥ by having a Thanksgiving feast in every home every night so they don't have ♥♥♥♥ for food two days later. I noticed it was slightly better but not much instead the population of my town caught autism while looking for a settlement. When you want ♥♥♥♥ built where there are trees the builders 40% of the time will stick their tumbs in their asses and walk around staring into the sun and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ themselves instead of do their ♥♥♥♥ing jobs. Leading to an exhausting effort to get these ♥♥♥♥ heads to move their asses. Many seasons later the ♥♥♥♥ing structure is built but it is too late because 75% of your population has died in that time. #♥♥♥♥YOUBUILDERS. I wish the builders would build the structures in the order I ordered them to be built in instead of doing the one that is closest. Who am I kiding I just want a guarentee that they will build at all. Also I would think that a fishing hut would produce as or as close to as mush as a hunters hut. No that would make too much sense, if a hunter kills one ♥♥♥♥ing deer it is given 100 but if I have 4 fishermen fishing they get around 40. In what ♥♥♥♥ing universe does a deer give anywhere close to 100 meat. I should expect that considering every household eats 3000 potatos. The pathing also sucks. If I build a road I expect the people to use the road. Instead they waltz through the grass when there is a road right beside them. The name of this game should be ""Autismville"" and the description should be ""If a group of Autist engore themselves stand idle and die"". I swear ants function better than these ♥♥♥♥ers. This game needs an AI fix and balanced. I played the game exactly like the tutorial and still failed. I wish I could successfully play this game once in my lifetime. I am changing my rating to an ""OW I AM DYING OF STARVATION"" out of ""WAIT I AM SUPPOSED TO BUILD ♥♥♥♥"".			"

												I've been having a fantastic time with this. It's a nice break from other city building games, but you have to adhere to a careful balance of food and production versus population-- take in a group of 20 nomads and before you know it half your town has died of starvation from a downward spiral composed of a tool shortage, farmers dying off before anyone else and leaving your crops to rot in the fields, thus more starvation and less food production. Commerce is a little shallow, but there's room to grow.			"

												Banished is, at it's very basic core, a city-builder. That being said, it would be better to call it a ""Town-builder""; instead of games such as SimCity where citizens are given in the thousands, and their well-being can be negligable at some points, this game focuses on keeping them alive and thriving. Food, warmth, and resources are arguably the core concepts. There is no defined currency in the game; resources are used (wood, stone, food, iron, leather, tools, etc.) to construct buildings or to trade. When beginning, the game might seem overly-difficult and overwhelming, though after ""mastering"" the game it can become repetetive and lacking. Pros: Mostly original take on city-buildersChallenging, but not challenging enough to ruin itvery few bugsfuture workshop supportCons: Beginning can be daunting and frequent restarts are requiredlimited end-game content, expanding can become a grind for resources  **Could be fixed when the workshop is introduced** "

You start off with this cute little bunny of a village, then all at once, it lunges for your throat and leaves you bloody and beaten.Banished is full of ripple effects:  Everything's running smoothly and you feel confident in building another house?  20 years later, because of that extra house, everyone is dying of starvation, freezing to death or dying of diptheria.My laborious little laborers have been trampled, stabbed, plagued, frozen, crushed, drowned, burnt, swept away, and one lucky teacher went batshit crazy.

												Banished is a fantastic indie city simulator, or maybe town simulator. The game is challenging, it doesn't hold your hand through every step, so you get a sense of accomplishment as your city grows. There's no advisors or missions telling you what to do next, which is a refreshing change. Balance plays a critical role as you decide what to build and try to keep your growing population warm and fed. Grow too fast and there won't be enough food for everyone, chop down all the trees and you won't have resources for the future. Every decision is important as you weigh the cost of the resources you use up and the workers you'll have to assign. That said, there is a point in the game where you have done most of the things available to you and gameplay can get stagnant. But until new content shows up, you can always just start a new city and deal with a whole new set of challenges.8/10			"

												So I have put 100 hours into the game so far and I'd have to recommend it if you are looking for a RELAXING game.  It may start hectic at first, but eventually you learn that speed multiplier is your long-time friend.  A bit of a learning curve for settlement management, but trial and error is a wonderful instructor.  If you have trouble here's a few hints:PAUSE the game early on while you place your initial layout, editing as you go along, and pause each build.  You can then activate each one 1-2 at a time when you restart the game.TRACK all your core resources closely (iron, stone, logs, firewood, and food). Lack of firewood or food WILL kill you.BUILD at a pace.  Do NOT have multiple open build projects active at once.  Prioritize and only have 2-3 at a time going.TOWN HALL will bring in nomads, if your health/happiness is above ~50% TEACH your people ASAP with a school.ALE and religion will raise happiness, CEMETERY will keep it steady.DEVELOP a variety of food sources, and learn how to use them for secondary benefit (wool, leather, ale, TRADE)RELAX... get comfortable and take an interest in thoughtful development.ROADS are an utter waste of time while active builds are going.  They may also divert your builders from more important work.PLAN your settlement out in advance.  You can designate buildings and FREEZE their resource demands and builds for later on (mines, quarry, bridges, tunnels, markets, trader, town hall, etc).EXPLOIT your terrain.  Plant trees in open areas, and place associated resource gatherers within the AoE. (hunter, herbalist, gatherer, maybe even a woodcutter and small stockpile).SEND me a message, or a question, and I'll do my best to help you out.  I give this game a 9/10.  -1 for unminimizeable windows, an apparent non-exponential population growth to population ratio, and use of text in game that borders on beyond too small)			"

												This game is very, very reminiscent of the Tropico series rather than Cities XL or SimCity.  Individual lives are more important than big-picture thinking, resource gathering is a matter of watching visual feedback---you can see your people at work---and the in-game economy is very much dependent on producing enough to export so that you can get what you need from foreign trade.Then again, that might be this game's problem.  It's Tropico set to Battletoads difficulty for reasons that often don't make sense.  Citizen resource consumption rates are set high seemingly as a difficulty construct, random (negative) events occur at the same frequency they would in the aforementioned Tropico's ""Are you loco, Presidente?"" setting, and the game never reaches a point that's the most rewarding part of the genre---the ability to sit back and enjoy what you've built.  There's always _something_ horribly out of true, or if there isn't, it's only a random event away.Which makes it a great Ph.D-level program for master city builders (I've been playing this genre since SimCity Classic and have played every major and some of the minor series to come out over the last 25 years).  What it doesn't make it is a game to just relax with and enjoy.A hesitant recommendation.  Know what you're getting into and don't force this game to be something it's not and you'll like it just fine.  It's well-constructed.  It just too often crosses the line between fun and frustrating.			"

												Great game for those who love the combination of a city builder with a dash of survival & simulation. Can be relaxing to play on the easier settings, and can be downright ARGH mode on harder, when you just want to survive the winter without total starvation. Exceedingly fun, and with some interesting achievements to go after. I've logged about 80 hours into the game, and it has a good replay value. I find myself coming back to it time and again for a few hours of gameplay. Just now getting into modding the game, so there are many more possibilities to be opened up. Snag this one while it's on sale and you won't be disappointed.			"

												Of all the city building games, this one may be one of the more basic games out there. It was a low budget indie game, but it does a ton of things right. As you play through the game and build your town up, you're faced with a ton of problems. The world is harsh, and food is scarce. As your population grows, so too does threats of diseases and harsh winters. There are various resources that must be constantly harvested, hunted, or gathered year round. The changing seasons of winter, spring, summer, and fall affect the way your crops grow, and if you are too slow with planting and harvesting, you may find your town collapse.One of my favorite games from 2014.

												Surprisingly chill game. Worth a shot if you enjoy building a town from scratch and evolving it into cities as time goes by. You also have food, tools and other supplies to worry about, but the supplies are not tedious at all to aquire, as the civilians automatically aquire and transport the supplies based on their job. Civilians aren't locked into a certain job either, so you can force them to switch jobs dependent on what you need.			"

												Very addictive, not like Sim City where past the first hour you've won, I've got to 400 population before with 60 000 food stored, only to accept some nomads who were uneducated and disrupted the balance, causing nearly 200 to starve a few years later.Could do with a bit more depth, like food preperation, bakers, smokehouses, etc. Also different terrains would be nice, and I'm confident the modders will take care of that.£15 is a good price, I have 55 hours in this game, and if you like city builders you will get the same too.I have noticed people saying the AI is ""bugged"", I haven't noticed anything wrong with it, everything is done in order, if you give an order and it's not being done, that means your workers are of somewhere else trying to complete all the previous tasks. Sometimes builders need laborers to start foundations, miners need them to take coal to the stockpiles. Anyway, there is a priority tool which is all you need really.Apart from that I have had 1 CTD, in my 55 hours, and that was before the first patch, so I can say technically there is nothing wrong with it (although I have an OP system for this game).

												Hey guys,I wanted to properly recognise this game for the high quality it exudes. This game was mostly written by one guy and to see how well he has put the whole package in terms of gameplay, longevity and overall look and feel of it is amazing compared to other games from ""companies"" sold thesedays.10/10 Excellent game, certainly my game of 2014 so far this year.Okay for those of you considering this game it is basically a survival city builder game. The main object is to build your settlement and maintain growth and sustainability for your population. Initially you need to provide homes, food and warmth, if you can maintain that your population will have basic survival. To extend past this you need to education, provide building resources and tools, clothing, religion and health care. There are lots of food options to maintain a balanced diet to keep their health, along with various ways to improve their happiness including a tavern. There are some things I would love to see this developer add, but I know he has made this game in the mind it can be modded, although I would prefer to see official DLC from himself than third party ones that could clash with each other.Anyway my conclusion is, if you like city building and want a nice twist and challenge then this game is 100% for you and definately worth the price and the support for this guy to continue!

												Banished is a city building game, where you start as a group of people banished from an unknown city for an unknown reason. You help them build and grow, fighting the harsh elements and disasters along the way, but is there a storyline throughout your cities growth, beyond that of what years were harsh, and what years were not? I submit that yes, there is a plot buried deep within this game, a secret plot that is probably overlooked in the grand scheme of things. It starts and ends with one ""death"" for me this ""death"" was as followed: ""Early Spring 69: Lutheribert the Teacher went crazy and was banished"". Beyond the comical date, lay an interesting idea: this growing city had become just like the city that abandoned my people so long ago. This was the only ""death"" that I had seen thus far that actually didn't explicitly mean death, and I had seen many deaths throughout my cities time. yes, he probably wandered into the wilderness and died.. but possibly he did what my people had so long ago instead: he left to create his own city. Throughout my years growing and suviving the harsh elements to help my little exiled people survive, just so that they can finally prosper, I had lost something invaluble along the way: the very reason my people had been banished in the first place. In the end, my people became what they hated most, what had abandoned them so long ago and left them to die in the elements, just so that they could prosper in this new land. In doing so they had banished a functional member of society because he was deemed crazy, just as they had been banished for the same injustice.alternatively, he could have just been a kooky psycho trying to teach my children and they kicked him out because he was being creepy. Either way 10/10 Sewnwington's mighty empire shall rule this land eternally!			"

												When I first bought Banished and started playing I was immediately hooked.  A game that seems so simplistic is actually quite challenging.   Graphics and Performance While Banished won't win any awards for graphics they are adequate.  The animations of the citizen models and animals are quite good.  I have not seen the game slow down at all, even with a large map full of buildings and crops the game runs well. Gameplay and Replay Value The gameplay can be as challenging as you want, feeling brave?  Do a harsh mountain environment with natural disasters.  First game?  Then maybe go easy, turn disasters off and start with a couple houses.  The choice is yours.  The game is easy to jump into and start playing but complex enough that you do have to think and plan ahead.  Like most ""City Building"" games this one has you managing resources, some renewable and some not.  For the non-renewable resource the game allows a trader to visit your town so that you can buy some supplies.The replay value of this game cannot be underestimated.  With over 100 hours in this game for far I am still just as hooked as I was after 1 hour.  The replay value is awesome.Bugs and CrashesVery few crashes, once in awhile a citizen will get ""stuck"" between buildings and starve.  Other than that I have not ran into any bugs with the game.CustomizationActive mod community and steam workshop.  Mods that are out right now are great.Overall 9/10.  Would recommend to other Steam users.			"

Took me 50 hours of playtime to get all achievements.Long Version: You remember the rabbit in Monty Python's Holy Grail?  It's a lot like that.  You start off with this cute little bunny of a village, then all at once, it lunges for your throat and leaves you bloody and beaten.Banished is full of ripple effects:  Everything's running smoothly and you feel confident in building another house?  20 years later, because of that extra house, everyone is dying of starvation, freezing to death or dying of diptheria.My laborious little laborers have been trampled, stabbed, plagued, frozen, crushed, drowned, burnt, swept away, and one lucky teacher went batshit crazy.  And yet, humanity persevered and thrived.It's a game filled with subtleties and harsh lessons, but definitely worth playing!			"

												Banished is a fantastic indie city simulator, or maybe town simulator. The game is challenging, it doesn't hold your hand through every step, so you get a sense of accomplishment as your city grows. There's no advisors or missions telling you what to do next, which is a refreshing change. Balance plays a critical role as you decide what to build and try to keep your growing population warm and fed. Grow too fast and there won't be enough food for everyone, chop down all the trees and you won't have resources for the future. Every decision is important as you weigh the cost of the resources you use up and the workers you'll have to assign. That said, there is a point in the game where you have done most of the things available to you and gameplay can get stagnant. But until new content shows up, you can always just start a new city and deal with a whole new set of challenges.8/10			"

												Banished is a game about managing HUMAN RESOURCES.Just because you have farms doesn't necessarily mean that the farmers are working every day of the year.  This means micromanaging your farms so that all your farmers are productive farmers from spring through autumn and firing them all to abuse them as extra labor for other more pressing needs like construction projects and basic laborers or even having them work the quarries and mines.At some point, you can forgo the micromanagement and focus on the more pressing matters such as how your city is laid out.  Designing a city with good layout is very difficult in this game owing to the geography but getting to a population of 500+ is entirely possible.Planning expansions is also important to the survival and welfare of your city because if your expansion is one fully zoomed out screen away from the nearest point of civilization, your citizens will DIE from starvation or the cold.  Timing your expansion is also important.I wish my citizens were smarter about getting food from the marketplace right next to them instead of running two fully-zoomed out horizontal screens from one end of the map to the other only to die from starvation... despite my having 40k food stocked in multiple barns and marketplaces spread all over the city.Oddly enough, these issues really haven't distracted me from the game.  That said, I still consider this game to be far superior to last year's DRM City.			"

												It's not great, but it's not bad either. I can't see the game holding attention for very long with such limited building options, but for the most part everything works and makes sense.  There are certainly problems, but I have to give props for a single developer pushing out something as well refined as this is. Give it a look and gaze in awe as your farmers somehow starve to death.			"

												Your town in full of sick people, literally and figuratively. One time I dreamed of a game where my entire townspeople would be having sex with kids, hogging all of the food, and the eventual decent into full blown disease and starvation which murders all of the sinners of your township. If watching your townfolk grieve when their children get crushed in a mining accident excites you, you should find help. Luckily thats okay because shes going to freeze to death soon anyways. Play banished to figure out what happened to the colony at Roanoke and why they would rather live with indians than let you run their lives.			"

												A nice, slow-pace medieval village builder that focuses on survival instead of technological progress.  Despite the limited nature of this type of game... the strategy is brutal and unforgiving.There is a lot of replayability as long as you don't rage easily when 8+ hours of gameplay get ruined by poor early planning.If you like city builders, and are open for some lovely gameplay and new strategies... give it a shot.

												Pretty solid city building game. There are still some bugs tho as many reviewers pointed out which is sad given that this isn't one of the billion ""early access' [read: paid beta] games that seem to be overtaking Steam these days. Yes I had some crashes, some really odd villager behavior, etc but overall it is still a solid game. The only real problem I have with it [aside from the bugs which I'm sure will get fixed with time] is that having a ""flat"" tech tree with all buildings open at once... really gives you not a lot to strive for. There also sadly are no building upgrades aside from upgrading a wood house to a stone house which seems like a missed opportunity given the detail and thought put into this game and its systems.

												This game was made by just one guy, but the immersive gameplay and great graphics are qualities you could expect from a full dev team. If you are looking for a casual city builder, where you can build monuments to proclaim your glory, then don't play this game. Your citizens are locked in a gritty struggle against the elements, feverishly trying to produce as much food as they can before the harsh winter sets in. If you neglect a single aspect of your town, starvation sets in and the death toll climbs. There is no such thing as taking a break in this game. Neither is there any taking a break FROM this game. I bought it the day it came out, and I haven't been able to stop playing since. This is truly one of the most addictive games I've ever played. To see my storage barn full of enough food to last the winter is the greatest feeling in the world. So too is seeing my citizens survive more than one winter.			"

												I am having a lot of fun with this, trying to build my civilization and keep them alive and prosperous. Be careful one plague can wipe you out. I the fartherest I have made it is year 245 before plague took me down. You have to run your whole colony, from setting up the first houses and letting the couples mate to planting your first crops and butchering your first animals. there is wood to chop, waters to fish and lodging to build. Later nomads will come to your city looking for shelter. Beware they carry disease sometimes. I was accepting them all the time and then got a sick batch that killed my whole village. All in all it's a fun challanging game, definately a time eater as I easily lost track of time and spent hours on my little peeps.			"

												there are two main things I must say about this game that sway my decision of this review, but there is one bad thing that really must be addressed when it comes to the AI in this game. We will start with the good things. :)1. Great Time Waster (In a good way) - I have spent a few good hours of my life playing this game and to be honest if someone asked me if they should buy it, I would grab them by the collar of their shirt and ask really loudly, ""WHY THE HELL HAVEN'T YOU BOUGHT THIS YET?!?"" before quickly dragging them to their computer to buy the game. Mainly I remember sitting at home waiting for my friends to show up which wasn't for another three hours, so I decided I would play Banished until they got there, not four hours later I finally noticed my friends had been sitting in my living room downstairs for an hour waiting for me. So yes if you need to pass time quickly get this game, just be sure to set and alarm if your like me and lose track of time.2. A Glorious Challenge - I can't stress how much of a challenge this game can be even on easy if you have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ seed you will have your hands full trying to keep all your settlers from dying of starvation, hypothermia, or just plain sadness. But starvation leads me to the one issue I have with this game.THE ONLY CON IN MY OPINION IS THAT THE AI ARE A BUNCH OF RESOURCE HOARDING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S!I have had multiple games fail due to one family of settlers taking 75% of all the food I had for themselves leaving the other 85% of my population to fight over the reamaining 25%. Frankly this has stopped me from playing this great game and it really peeves me that this one thing with the AI is what kills the game for me. If I had the time or capacity to mod this game, it would be a rationing mod so I can set up what people take from the barns I would honestly have no bad things to say about this game.I hope this helps those of you looking to get this game and if you do get it, holy hell best of luck.

												This game is great.  It is solid gameplay at a fair price.  It is more challenging than your standard sim because everything has direct consequences, moreso than in other sims.  For instance, if let yourself run low on tools, you will quickly find that people don't work as effectively.  People that don't work effectively are mining for the materials that the blacksmith makes to make the tools.  So you run out of iron, coal, and logs to make tools.  Farmers, hunters, and other food bearing people need these tools.  So then you starve and your village becomes a ghost town, all because you let yourself run low on tools.  The game mechanics remind me of back when Stronghold was a good game, a couple releases back.  There were things in Stronghold that I wish were in this game, such as taking wheat to a mill to make flour that you take to a bakery to bake bread.  More of a ""tech tree"", if you will.  But the few elements that this game does have (metal, coal, various food types, wood, etc) are done extremely well.Banished has some fresh ideas as well, such as crop and animal diseases, various human diseases (filthy nomads!), and schools.  Regarding schools, educated villagers perform better but are a drain on resources until they graduate.The graphics and sound are great for a game at this price point, and I only suffered one crash to desktop in my over 500 hours of gameplay.About that.. The insane amount of time you see that I've played Banished isn't entirely accurate.  One of the things I enjoyed with the game was to see if I finally created a self-sufficient, self-surviving village, and then I would go to bed and leave it running.  9.9 times out of ten I would wake up to see that I didn't think things through in one area or another, or that a tornado had come through, or my pastures were diseased, or....If you like sim builders, and are up for a challenge, Banished is definitely for you!

Its lots of fun and a real challenge to keep your villagers happy en well fed over a period of time.You start out with a few family’s gathering resources and building your homes, but be prepared winter is coming and she isn’t going to be mild, so make sure you have warm clothes and enough food in your barn. Also as a player make sure you are warm and well fed because Banished is going to claim allot of your spare time making the best community for your people and I am sure you will enjoy every minute of it.

												I have found inner peace with Banished. This is the city-building simulator I have been dreaming of. Yes, there aren't as many options as I would like, and yes, it still needs some patching, but it is completely worth the price. This one man has managed to create a better product than sim city and release it at a near-bugless state.The game isn't very difficult for me, and the lack of difficulty may be a turn off for people. This is more a sandbox city builder. You are always trying to improve something, however, whether it is building placement, food and resource management, or population growth. It is worth it to build a big beautiful town and watch it go to work			"

												I had an entire population of over 300 die because there were too many farms spread out over too large an area. Farmers took too long to reach the farms from their houses to do work, so everyone died of starvation.At the end there was just a woman and two children who lived with her. Every day she would go to pick up eggs from the overpopulated, decaying chicken coup to feed the only two reasons she had to live.It was not enough, after a couple of years the two children died of starvation. You could see the loss in her, her happiness rating down to 1/2 a star out of 5...She made her way to the woodcutter's to fetch some firewood. Once she had picked some up and walked a short distance, the firewood was put back down again.She had snapped. The two reasons she had to live were gone. All of her friends were dead. All of her family lost. She was all alone in a ghost town, there was no escape. There was no point.She picked up the firewood.She put it back down.She picked up the firewood.She put it back down.She picked up the firewood.She put it back down.You could see the insanity she had taken over. She just wanted it to end.Over and over she just picked up the firewood and put it back down again, as she tried to burn as much energy as possible on this pointless act so that her death might just come a little sooner...It took a while, it took a long long while, but finally the bells of death rang.The woman had died of starvation.Banished is a wonderful city/town sim.

												Banished is a very well thought game about town management and survival. You take control of a small community of outcasts and attempt to keep them alive as long as you can in a verdent but harsh environment. You will have engineer your town to provide the necessities of life not only for your workers, but also for those too young to provide for themselves. Those needs include shelter, fuel, food, clothing, tools (non-fatal) education (non-fatal), medical services, wells for fighting fires as well as sourses of wood, stone, iron and other resourses for the production of said items and for the growth of your town. It is the first game I have seen that has penelties for not expanding your town regulaurly. As your population ages, your older workers will die off and, if no new childeren have been born for some time, you may run low on citizens old enough to work. (Adults will move into new houses and begin raising children if new houses are avaliable, but older adults can't raise children)in addition to the need for basic nesessities and growth, your workers must walk to their place of work, meaning that you must make sure enough housing is nearby for them to live in (but they will exchange jobs automaticaly to minimize the legnth of their walking paths)There is also the ability to trade with other towns for needed resourses and unlock new types of food by trading. Medieval setting.bugs of note:-laborers (the default task) may die to starvation if a task is set too far from their home no matter how much food is available. -roads cannot always be removed by the remove road tool once placed.-game crash if you set orders for a merchent after they have already left your dock.A very intuitive, interesting, and relaxing game that challenges you to make the best use of the resourses avaliable to you and create a major metropolis from sticks and stones. Very impressed with the game's design and how seemless the game experience is from start to finish.			"

												Built a town for hours. It started to rain in the game, which is quite a normal event, but then something terrible happend.A tornado came and wiped out my trade port (which had just been finished), a fishing dock, and 15 inhabitants - which was more than half of the population.The ones who did survive were all over 70 years old or were only children. The old men and women stuggled to feed the younglings, but winter was coming. A shortage of warm clothing finished off most of the elders and sickly children.However, some of the children and a couple of the elders miraculously survived the winter, and began to rebuild. The fishing dock was restored to its formers glory, and the bridge that had been under construction for many seasons, was finally finished. The bridge would bring in new resources with minimal effort. One girl joined the labor force, and produced warm clothing for the entire village. For many winters they survived, and the town population steadidly grew. Things were looking prosperous.But the damage by the whirlwind to the town's infrastucture was too great. The fishing dock only yielded 2/3's of what it used to, and once again the adult population slowly starved to death while struggling to feed its children.In an effort to feed my people, I ordered for firewood production to be put on hault. I sent the wood choppers to help the hunters and gatherers in a last attempt to keep this civilization alive. Not only did this not yield enough food, the entire population froze to death from the lack of warmth in thier homes. The blacksmith was the last to fall; he worked up to his last icy breath, stood still, then dropped to ground.If you are a fan of brutal strategy games, then this is a must buy. Casual gamers need not apply.			"

												This is an interesting sort of game that at first glance might seem like another city builder. It's rather a simulation of the struggle to survive.There's a couple ways to play the game and one is to read a guide and spoil the entire process or simply endure a lot of failure so that you better understand it. Given that I rather enjoy games that thrive on the later, I've been quite content with the purchase of this game. I saw a lot of complaints from people that suggest they ""figure it out"" and then become bored, but now I realize that realistically that would require them to reroll the map to get better conditions for themselves and I'm glad I didn't listen to them. I've failed a half dozen times , learned from my mistakes and adjusted only to realize my strategy was being formed around being able to place fish immediatly or some similar ""best way to start"" scenario which I suppose is a possibility towards a better way to ease you into learning, but for a long term solution on playing the game as it's presented to you, not so much.I've noticed a few issues with roads and pathfinding (they will ignore roads and take a straight path in a lot of cases), but it's intended to fixed in a later patch. Also was  times where I feel like I had to be a bit too explicit with commands and often people still might not do exactly as I tell them, but once I learned how the game wanted you to go about this, it became less stressful. That's kind of the point of this game though. You have a lot of control and freedom, but it's very evident this game knows what it wants from the player and you will have to give it that attention. It also takes a ton of preimpetive planning and not understanding the result of what you just set in place may bring the learning curve up a bit until it all sinks in. I welcome that kind of thing though.Given most building games are meant to be some kind of peaceful endevour where you stack blocks and watch plants grow, it's nice to finally see one that embraces a bit of a harder-edged attitude. It's slightly rough around the edges in a few areas, and I feel like the UI is working against certain aspects, but for it's price and considering ONE person developed this, it's a solid recommendation from me if you are looking for a builder game that has a bit of roguelike curve to it.

												Well let's start off by saying this game is EPIC, but lets look into the things you might expect if you are deciding to buy the game. This game is HARD, forget what you played in Sim City, you will find yourself restarting numerous times untill you get it right, in my case load was my best friend. It's really a calm game, the only thing you will fear are the low food reserves, untill you understand what to do of course. It's very addicting, and the maps are HUGE. You will indeed be sitting there a few hours, scratching your head as to why your citizens are dieing but that's what fun about it! For the few hours I have played this, I can say that this will be one of my few favorite games in the long run, if you're really into strategy / City Building, than this is the game you need. Very enjoyabl, and very well made.			"

												Very addictive, not like Sim City where past the first hour you've won, I've got to 400 population before with 60 000 food stored, only to accept some nomads who were uneducated and disrupted the balance, causing nearly 200 to starve a few years later.Could do with a bit more depth, like food preperation, bakers, smokehouses, etc. Also different terrains would be nice, and I'm confident the modders will take care of that.£15 is a good price, I have 55 hours in this game, and if you like city builders you will get the same too.I have noticed people saying the AI is ""bugged"", I haven't noticed anything wrong with it, everything is done in order, if you give an order and it's not being done, that means your workers are of somewhere else trying to complete all the previous tasks. Sometimes builders need laborers to start foundations, miners need them to take coal to the stockpiles. Anyway, there is a priority tool which is all you need really.Apart from that I have had 1 CTD, in my 55 hours, and that was before the first patch, so I can say technically there is nothing wrong with it (although I have an OP system for this game).

												Very very nice game, classic city builder with beautiful season effects and useful gameplay mechanics. Unlike other reviews I want to focus upon the issues you may encounter and how to deal with them:Firstly the game is deceptively complex, you go in thinking its a simple city builder but it requires a few things that, while simple once understood, are not covered in the tutorial.The solution is simply to go to a fan site like reddit's r/banished (r/banishedmaps also gives good seeds). The support from other players will teach you what you need to know fast and prevent you from having no fun when everyone is starving or you're population isn't growing.Finally, Rock software have confirmed mod support in the future so don't expect this game to stagnate :) "

												Banished is a fun and interesting city builder once you get the hang of it. Despite the riveting negative commentary that nearly persuaded me to give this game a pass I am certain I'll be playing this for quite some time. Comments about the game lacking content are completely unfounded in my opinion (besides, pong and asteroids didn't need content to be fun.)The overall command system is fairly easy to master, and the ""micro-management"" referred to by many is actually just assigning jobs to citizens (some of the comments made it sound like they had almost no autonomy) and ensuring you have everything they need to survive and thrive. Yes, your townsfolk will starve if you neglect to plan ahead, but I was able to keep my food stores full on my first try just by anticipating the worst. Think sustainability, and don't grow too quickly, and you'll be in for a great gaming experience.			"

												Banished is a city building game, where you start as a group of people banished from an unknown city for an unknown reason. You help them build and grow, fighting the harsh elements and disasters along the way, but is there a storyline throughout your cities growth, beyond that of what years were harsh, and what years were not? I submit that yes, there is a plot buried deep within this game, a secret plot that is probably overlooked in the grand scheme of things. It starts and ends with one ""death"" for me this ""death"" was as followed: ""Early Spring 69: Lutheribert the Teacher went crazy and was banished"". Beyond the comical date, lay an interesting idea: this growing city had become just like the city that abandoned my people so long ago. This was the only ""death"" that I had seen thus far that actually didn't explicitly mean death, and I had seen many deaths throughout my cities time. yes, he probably wandered into the wilderness and died.. but possibly he did what my people had so long ago instead: he left to create his own city. Throughout my years growing and suviving the harsh elements to help my little exiled people survive, just so that they can finally prosper, I had lost something invaluble along the way: the very reason my people had been banished in the first place. In the end, my people became what they hated most, what had abandoned them so long ago and left them to die in the elements, just so that they could prosper in this new land. In doing so they had banished a functional member of society because he was deemed crazy, just as they had been banished for the same injustice.alternatively, he could have just been a kooky psycho trying to teach my children and they kicked him out because he was being creepy. Either way 10/10 Sewnwington's mighty empire shall rule this land eternally!			"

												This game is very, very reminiscent of the Tropico series rather than Cities XL or SimCity.  Individual lives are more important than big-picture thinking, resource gathering is a matter of watching visual feedback---you can see your people at work---and the in-game economy is very much dependent on producing enough to export so that you can get what you need from foreign trade.Then again, that might be this game's problem.  It's Tropico set to Battletoads difficulty for reasons that often don't make sense.  Citizen resource consumption rates are set high seemingly as a difficulty construct, random (negative) events occur at the same frequency they would in the aforementioned Tropico's ""Are you loco, Presidente?"" setting, and the game never reaches a point that's the most rewarding part of the genre---the ability to sit back and enjoy what you've built.  There's always _something_ horribly out of true, or if there isn't, it's only a random event away.Which makes it a great Ph.D-level program for master city builders (I've been playing this genre since SimCity Classic and have played every major and some of the minor series to come out over the last 25 years).  What it doesn't make it is a game to just relax with and enjoy.A hesitant recommendation.  Know what you're getting into and don't force this game to be something it's not and you'll like it just fine.  It's well-constructed.  It just too often crosses the line between fun and frustrating.			"

												My thoughts on Banished...This game has been produced by a single person, so first off congratulations on such a tough task!Banished is a city/town building game which combines survival elements found in many recent games. It has a vast array of building types, jobs for citizens and can be extremely engrossing.Graphically this game looks wonderful, small details here and there offer the world a lot more depth. Colours looks fantastic as seasons come and go, caking the landscape in snow or lush green hills.The tutorial lays everything out for a newcomer to the series, though making sure you complete every single one provided is key to success. Lastly this game includes mod support and some mods that the community has cooked up are really interesting but NOT required to enjoy this game since the vanilla version is extremely well done.Props to the developer and i look forward to future DLCs for games you release.10/10			"

												When I first played Banished, I greatly underestimated the numbers involved. Its not like a traditional simbuilder where you just keep an eye on income, but you have to keep an eye on literally everything your villagers do. It has a decent learning curve though and it is a very good example of ""trial by error"". It takes a few attempts to get a good village going, but you shouldn't let that stop you from trying again and again. It's very rewarding to notice you keep doing better and better at the game.One final important piece to notice though is that this game will start to lag the larger your town becomes. Some people with bad computers will notice a slowdown after 500 inhabitants, I noticed a huge lag/slowdown at 1000 inhabitants. I recommend just playing on a medium map.Dont expect a thrilling story or objectives and goals. This game only has two goals: expand and survive. It's a great game ""to pass time"".			"

BASE GAME:Its good, but by the time you reach about 100-200 people, you are just rebuilding the same stuff over again.WITH COLONIAL CHARTER:Far past 200 people, you are still building infrastructure in order to sustain the huge variety of crafts and products that can be made.  Way more animals, way more crops, a lot more shipping options, a lot more trade options... just more of everything.  Colonial Charter is a free mod in the Steam Workshop.			"

												3/5 StarsPros: This is an open sand box game where you have a lot of freedom to make choices over how your settlers move forward. It is reminiscent of a wilderness version of the old (fill in the blank) Tycoon! games. If you liked those games, I would definitely recommend this game mostly because there aren't a lot of newer games in it's niche. I would recommend starting without natural disasters because at first struggling to move forward is hard enough (and slow enough) in this game without half your village burning to the ground. It's definitely fun once you learn the controls, but it wears off. The graphics seem good for a casual game, and the soundtrack sets a very immersive mood. The controls aren't that difficult to pick up on, and abundant descriptions help you learn as you go. Also the randomly generated geography is both entertaining and beautiful.Cons:There's a limit to how long you can play before you get annoyed/bored out of your skull. Commands take annoyingly long to complete. And when you have limited resources (Basically the entire time you play) you're basically watching people die while you wait a painfully long time for workers to collect/make a resource so that you can do something so that they won't die. Even in full fast-forward the game seems to take forever. It probably is a more realistic expectation, it just means that you spend the whole game scrolling around looking for something to do while you anxiously wait for something to finally finish.Some of the game mechanics are annoying. The merchant ships never have anything that you want, and the few things that you would want (different livestock for example) never arrive. You're supposed to be able to help prevent natural disasters with different structures in the game, but they don't seem to help much (wells don't seem to do much against fires, the sick people wander around outside the hospital and get everybody sick) And it feels like nobody is ever productive. Most annoying of all, Resouce production is stupid slow.			"

												This game is absolutely brutal.  That is a good thing.  Normally after playing a typical sandbox city building game for an hour or so, you have the whole system figured out and can game the hell out of it so you can just let it autorun for an hour without any attention.  Banished is a harsh mistress and isn't just your run of the mill citybuilder.There is a constant need to keep an eye on your town since the overall success of it all boils down to people.  Citizens can die from anything, from workplace accidents to old age.  The loss of just one person can set off a ripple effect that can wreak havoc on your village if you're not careful.The graphics and sound design are pretty decent, seeing as this game came from what amounts to a one man studio.  Controls are simple and easy to use, and the guts of the simulation will keep you on your toes.Probably one of the best citybuilding sims I have ever played.  10/10			"

												Probably the first and most important thing to know about Banished if you're considering purchasing this game is that it's really not a city builder. Sure you literally build a city, and it looks like a lot of games in the genre, but it really doesn't play like one. Banished is better classified as a resource management game where the most important resource is your population. It's an interesting twist and although I have seen the concept a few times before, not to this level of detail and with this level of execution. A lot of times fans of either city building or resource management will be fans of the other as well, but I think it's very important to realize this both before deciding if the game is worth buying and also once you start playing so you don't walk away frustrated because it is nothing like you expected it to be.Breakdown:This game has the most advanced and accurate take on population demographics and its impact on economic theory that I've ever seen. Unlike most city builders where population age and size largely handles itself based on your need, these are the first priorities and biggest concerns in this game. Taking the totalitarian city mayor trope to a new level, even when your citizens have children is now within your control via the amount of free housing you make available. It takes constant adjustments and consistent vigilance to keep things balanced, as things like baby booms and overcrowding can wind up devastating a settlement as fully as famines and tornadoes if they're not handled correctly.Initially I found this irritating. A lot of it had to do with my expectations that this game would be like most city builders I've played where I could leave it running for a half hour and come back without worry. After getting used to the idea and learning a little more of the mechanics of the game however I came to enjoy the eternal struggle as a really unique aspect, and that is why I included the opening statement at the top of the review.The learning curve is steep but that's really due to how much information is actually important, and this plays to the game's advantage because the learning curve is also long. No matter how far you've gone, there is almost always something else to optimize, despite the relatively small selection of buildings.The graphics are impressive for an indie game, and twice so when you realize that this whole thing was actually made by just one guy. The weather looks amazing and gives a great feel for the harsh winters. Everything even runs really smooth despite so many moving parts, I honestly can't say anything bad about the game's graphics or optimization.Drawbacks and things to consider:There isn't much direction.The complete story is that a small group of some Medieval (maybe?) European (maybe?) civilization winds up in a new land and tries to survive. That's about it. There isn't much further in the way of smaller objectives or milestones built into the mechanics of the game either, so even for a sandbox game, the game is very much a sandbox. There are however some well-made achievements that can be used for goals and scenarios, with things like One With Nature, Mountain Men, and Isolationist applying some constraints and Tenure to challenge your poise and patience.Data is scarce.Despite the praise above about just how well put together the inner workings and underlying mechanics of this game are, for some reason it was decided to be better left hidden. Early, when you only have a few people in your settlement it is not hard to get a fairly accurate picture of who's doing what, what is needed, and to see potential problems. Later this becomes increasingly difficult and much of what you'll do is based on what ""feels"" appropriate given a broad and imprecise picture. There are only a few data tables and graphs concerning resources and population information and some don't even work correctly when things like trading are introduced. It seems like a simple feature, and a major step backward considering Caesar III had better census and economy data almost two decades ago. Maybe it was done to supplement the feel of a Medieval town, but for a data junkie like me playing a game where causing extinction is as simple as missing a downward trend in a single resource for a short time, this was a huge frustration and overall my biggest complaint with the game.Limited variety.There simply are not very many buildings and professions. Plenty of the gameplay depth comes from building placement and timing, but if you tire easily from looking at the same kind of buildings over and over this is something to consider. There are a ton of different crops and livestock, but the impact their variety has on gameplay is small, even if important. There are a lot of absolutely fantastic mods available on the workshop and this community is great, but as this review is for the base game I feel this aspect needs to be listed as a drawback.Soundtrack.The music's nothing special and very short. I'm always baffled why simulation games that are expected to be played for dozens of hours think that a short soundtrack constantly looping in the background is a good idea. I suppose initially it's better than nothing but you'll be muting the music pretty quickly. It's not like this is hard to do, it's just not a plus for the game.Verdict:The game is pretty solid and if you're a fan of difficult resource management and strategy you're sure to get your money's worth, especially considering how often this goes on sale for only $5.

Now i am going to put some idea's in here i think the game could improve with.Butchers to process meat into sausages etc, A Mill to proceed wheat and corn to flour,Baker to proceed flour to bread, some new animals - Pigs, Horses, Bulls, Wolves, Bears.hunters could kill these animals with Bows,Carts would be a great idea for use when moving more Materials.this game doesnt need combat the challenge is in the elements.this is a great game though and i will be happy to be part of the game for years to come.Carpenter would be a great idea also			"

												As a city builder, it's incredibly addictive and deceptively difficult to get the hang of in the beginning.

												In Banished, the point is survival, its a cruel world and your people will die.

Your firewood cutter will freeze to death. Your foresters will die of trees falling on them. It takes some time to learn, but once you get some experience, its pretty easy. (Its a lot of micro managing at first, but once you get going, its more like running the game on 10x speed and waiting for something bad to happen) Not to say it isnt fun, its just a little repetitive. Worth my time, it might be worth yours. "

You constantly have to juggle your resources and workers to make sure you have enough of everything, you can easily lose a few hours once you start playing by just keep on telling yourself 1 more season or i'll just build this first then i'll come off. xD			"

Now i am going to put some idea's in here i think the game could improve with.Butchers to process meat into sausages etc, A Mill to proceed wheat and corn to flour,Baker to proceed flour to bread, some new animals - Pigs, Horses, Bulls, Wolves, Bears.hunters could kill these animals with Bows,Carts would be a great idea for use when moving more Materials.this game doesnt need combat the challenge is in the elements.this is a great game though and i will be happy to be part of the game for years to come.Carpenter would be a great idea also			"

												Summary: 8.5/10Really great city building sim. You are outcast from your previous city and with 4-5 families and you goal is to start your own city. The start of the game is more survival than city building, but once you can stabilize your resources the game transitions into managing a growing city. Good:The mechanics are all pretty solid. You must juggle your resouces and slowly expand for a city to thrive. Try to expand too quick and you can cripple your city quickly. Trade to much and you might not be able to recover the resources. Very well built game you can spend hours play and not even relize. Beware it is addicting. Bad: Some people don't like that the guy fishing can starve to death, but starving has to do with the food in their homes, not what their job is. I personally did not mind this mechanic.			"

												Banished is a lovely, peaceful city builder and I would recommend it to anyone interested in games of this genre.There is plenty of room to expand your village, even on the smallest map size; I currently have 3 hours on a small map and have covered roughly 10% of it, and I've only built farms and production buildings so far! The game features no combat element, which in my opinion is delightful as I prefer to just relax and get on with building, although I imagine some may not like this aspect. 'Disasters' can be switched off, stopping large fires from breaking out, bad weather and general mishaps causing your workers to die, but if you want more of a challenge, by all means leave them on; they aren't particularly common anyway!One negative point about the game is the lack of progression, only houses can be upgraded, and roads replaced with stone. Although as I mentioned, you can expand greatly, and doing so can make things easier or harder, just like normal progression. Another problem I have is that there are no planning tools, in games liek this I like to mark out areas where I am going to build things in future, so I don't forget and possibly waste resources; although many games of this genre are lacking this feature so I wont blame this game.It's overall a pretty demanding game, it can be very difficult, especially if you forget something at an early stage (make sure you have lots of food and firewood for when winter arrives!) but I think this makes the game more engaging and enjoyable.If you like city builders or have £15 to spare and have nothing to do for 3-5 hours, buy Banished!

												I was honestly surprised by this game. It was a lot harder than I thought it would be, as unlike other medieval city builders which usually involve combat and enemies. In this game the only enemy is nature. Whether it be a bad harvest causing half of your population to starve to death, or an unexpected snow causing your civilians to freeze because you were unprepared and didn't have enough firewood. An outbreak of syphilis because you opened your city to nomads or you forgot to make room for extra population so your people stopped reproducing and then all died at once from old age, leaving useless incapable children which do nothing except drain your resources. Or of course a aggressive tornado rips through your city leaving nothing but rubble and ♥♥♥♥ing children..It's quite a challenge and your city will probably die for your first few attempts but it's a lot of fun and I'd recommend it.The game was made by one guy and that's impressive. 9/10 "

												A very good city-building game. It can satisfy your city-building genre need and having pleasure while doing so. Very good graphic and nice challenge with the climate requirement. However the game is not without flaws. The game lack upgradability, which mean once you built something, there's not much left to it. If your eager is just to build everything on the build list, you'll have it all in few hours. Thankfully, there's a large mod which added lots of craftable building to the list. The game, however still lack the quest/challenge to push you forward, even with the mod. In short, it's like Anno series in sandbox mode.If you're the type of person that lost interest once you reach the stable city build, play the game with the hardest mode. This way, you'll spend more time learning and perfecting your planning, instead of just spending 3-4 hour build everything the base game has on the list.			"

												First off, the AI is absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Secondly, their retardation manages to keep them alive for surprisingly long.Citizens are selfish, they hoard ALL the food that they can while others starve to death. That aside, the game is surprisingly fun albeit frustrating from time to time. The game can also be very difficult (it is highly likely that your first town will not succeed or be very unstable and wobbly before failing altogether). The game is time consuming and very stretched out, but like I said it does offer a challenge and I can reccomend this game despite its minor faults.			"

												I bought ‘Banished’ expecting a hard but fair addicting micro-oriented management game, but what I ended up with was a game with too many short-comings to fulfil my hopes. The game isn’t addicting enough as it doesn’t offer enough involvement from the player at the start and turns into macro-supervision later on, reducing one of the key elements of its identity: the slightly personalised workers and the organisation of families. Worse, actually setting up a successful town shows just how little the game has to offer as there are no clear ends or goals at that point in the game.But let’s start at the beginning. ‘Banished’ is a management game about trying to successfully establish a small village in difficulty conditions, and providing for the people living in it through the satisfaction of their basic needs and caring for their happiness.‘Banished’ has a feeling of a low-budget game, hence the price, making the best of its ideas but lacking in overall polish. The biggest flaws concern the game’s goal, which is basically none-existent, and the overall difficulty which can be rather easily overcome. Polish-wise, the user-friendliness is disappointing: no alt+tabing, the user interface is full of grey (and doesn't fit the tone of the setting) but also, like many if not most game of this genre, in the explanation of the gameplay. That new houses are required to split existing families (even though there is still enough room in the original homes) to create new ones to increase your population is only one of the small information titbits missing from the tutorial. Further on, the game lacks a visually distinctive identity. It’s not graphically impressive and every building has already been seen before, creating a feeling of Deja-Vu. It’s a shame because I like the setup, -the idea of banished families banding together and trying to make the best of it while living mostly self-sufficiently-, but the game never actually goes further with this idea, doesn’t try to expand on it beyond the simple name of the game, and perhaps the necessity to buy seeds and livestock before growing farms.The personality of the game is further let down by its musical score, as the music, -which I usually truly enjoy in management games, and is quite important as that genre generally demand a commitment of long hours to get going-, feels just lacking altogether: it’s neither memorable nor setting up an enjoyable mood. Same goes for the other ambient effects of the game, which are best turned off if you don’t want to hear the constant bleating of sheep. Trying to give your villagers more personality with randomly generated names is a nice touch, but it doesn’t really amount to anything, although it can be fun to find some people at the job you would least expect, like the town eldest of 79 years working alone in the quarry. But those points are just nit-picks. The main problem I have with ‘Banished’ is that the game doesn’t offer a challenge or a real goal beyond “survive”. What is there to do after you have taken a successful start? Survive a fire? Sure. A tornedo? Been there, done that. A tornedo and a fire? Yes, that too. Once successfully set up, it is rather difficult to be completely decimated, even if setbacks are still a possibility, they are nothing that can’t be fixed with a little patience. The game just isn’t challenging enough in the long run, once the mechanics have been understood and that knowledge successfully applied in game. There are some achievements, true, but that’s not really my cup of tea, especially since the starting setup is the same and repetition can’t be avoided. Even at ten times the game speed, I was already growing weary of the game, as waiting for resources to be collected is the main part of ‘Banished’, leaving little to do for long periods of time. The micro-management parts don’t require much attention and don’t offer much to do anyway as resources are collected for your next projects, while the macro-management parts don’t invest the player as goods become abundant. I did enjoy a few points of course, the game isn’t bad, it’s completely functional and has mod support. I do like the idea of not being taxed, ie. that buildings have no running cost, apart from requiring a villager to operate obviously, and also that every trade requires a barter and so on. I do enjoy the forest lodges, actual caring for a forest, -and thus having a great synergy with other buildings requiring trees to work-, while also giving a regular income of wood. The game has some specific mechanics but it is not enough to set it apart and make me want to play more of it. After less than twenty hours, and playing a game on the harshest and rockiest settings, I feel like the game has nothing more to offer, which might be alright for the price tag for some. I didn’t find mods to spike my interest either, and those are a gamble anyway. Like so many of the starving/malnourished villagers, I couldn’t help feeling hungry for a little bit more here.			"

												Let's get some technical questions out of the way. The User Interface is fluid. The game is responsive. The attention to detail is astounding. When you build farms, you don't just have a farm, you are allowed to choose between a dozen food types. Your main resources are wood, stone, iron, coal. Which you harvest in familiar ways. The options are what stand out to me in this game. Other simulations might have you build farms for every 10 people or some other fixed value. In Bansihed you have choices. Lots of choices. Lots and Lots of choices. You might start the game only knowing how to farm squash. But everntually you will be able to have over a dozen fruits, vegetables, and meats to choose from. You have farms, in the typical fashion, but you have orchards now. This allows your brewer to use any fruits, or wheat to make ales. You have fruit and nut trees. You have over a dozen food choices to from. Corn, pumpkin, squash, wheat, beans, and more. Easily worth the $20 i dropped on it. I missed it on sale for 15 by a few hours. Already have 20 hours in the game. So at $1 an hour, well worth the investment, and I'm just getting started.			"

												Big shout out to my girl Felicia Day for being the one who made me discover Banished!10/10 – Absolutely amazing gameBanished is a city building and managing simulation game developed by Shinning Rock Software. In Banished you guide a group of outcasts as they build a band new village and help them settle and grow as a community. Banished is one of the best city simulation I have ever played right up there with Cities: Skyline, but with a completely different genre. In the game, you have to manage the collecting and distribution of goods, food, tools as well as things such as firewood that are necessary for the survival of each and every one of your citizen. It gets cold, sometimes the food gets low, and people age and die, and all of these things are things that you need to keep an eye on, as well as whether or not your citizens are happy enough to procreate and thus expending your population. Banished isn’t a particularly easy game, or rather, I’d say that it can be quite the challenge. You can choose the zoning of your village, the size of the map, the temperate, as well as the difficulty, but even the lowest can still offer you some challenges. It took me a while to get a hold and a good understanding of the mechanism in Banished, but when you do, the game works great and the soundtrack becomes almost therapeutic.As stated, although Banished can be assumed to be a straightforward, simple simulation and managing game, do not be fooled, as it also is way up there with Cities: Skyline in terms of how complicated and messy it can get if you do not pay enough attention, especially in the winter. Jobs need to be assigned and certain buildings needs to be built in appropriate places, such as the hunter’s cabin, the gatherers etc Do not dismiss the importance of food because your townspeople will die of starvation rather quickly.All in all, now that I have figured out (or at least think I have) how Banished works, I look forward to push my population to the highest numbers and observe where things go. It is a game that I adore, that is incredibly fun and entertaining and that I would recommend to any and all lover of simulation games.			"

												I bought ‘Banished’ expecting a hard but fair addicting micro-oriented management game, but what I ended up with was a game with too many short-comings to fulfil my hopes. The game isn’t addicting enough as it doesn’t offer enough involvement from the player at the start and turns into macro-supervision later on, reducing one of the key elements of its identity: the slightly personalised workers and the organisation of families. Worse, actually setting up a successful town shows just how little the game has to offer as there are no clear ends or goals at that point in the game.But let’s start at the beginning. ‘Banished’ is a management game about trying to successfully establish a small village in difficulty conditions, and providing for the people living in it through the satisfaction of their basic needs and caring for their happiness.‘Banished’ has a feeling of a low-budget game, hence the price, making the best of its ideas but lacking in overall polish. The biggest flaws concern the game’s goal, which is basically none-existent, and the overall difficulty which can be rather easily overcome. Polish-wise, the user-friendliness is disappointing: no alt+tabing, the user interface is full of grey (and doesn't fit the tone of the setting) but also, like many if not most game of this genre, in the explanation of the gameplay. That new houses are required to split existing families (even though there is still enough room in the original homes) to create new ones to increase your population is only one of the small information titbits missing from the tutorial. Further on, the game lacks a visually distinctive identity. It’s not graphically impressive and every building has already been seen before, creating a feeling of Deja-Vu.

												Town one: The villagers spent too much time clear cutting the forrests they had no food for the winter and all starved to deathTown two: The villagers were able to survive the first winter and managed to survive a raging fire. However the second  winter was cold and dark and everyone froze solid.Town three: The village flurished and grew for many years. Unfortunately no one had a proper sex education and did not have families. instead they just grew old and frail until one day a group of immigrants came and took over the land. Many years later a tornado left a young child and a few elders stranded on an island with just enough resources to stay warm and fed for a decent amount of years. The elders died of old age quickly which left just the young boy to witness the rest of his village die from a ruthless epidemic. He could do nothing but watch all his friends and family die from his island just off the coast. The child starved after 7 years alone on that island.Toronde: Toronde is currently a thriving village of 100 surviving off of its main export ""fire wood"". Other than a few small fires no real problems have occured we can only hope the vilage continues to remain stable. We can only pray. at the chaple the people have built for the one god...Shrek. pray for Shrek to protect them from the disasters that may be on there way. Shrek is love.... Shrek is life10/10 great game			"

												10/10 spent 4 hours making a town. Everything was good. We were pretty much self sufficent. about 200 people lived in my town. I had about 10,000 food and 7 fields, 3 orchads and 6 pastures. Life was good. 3 schools, a church, herbalists and hospitals. Everything we needed we made. Then the nomads came.I was happy the nomads came. It was some more people. I didnt know what I was getting into. Those ♥♥♥♥s unwittingly cause so much death.... I willingly took them in. Nice guy that I am . Turns out we need way more homes because we are full. OK, again I am a good person and we are thriving.Wait what? All our 10,000 food is down to 100! Look at that the nomads ate it all... OK, again I am a good person and the fields will bring in some harvest.Oh a infestation has taken out three fields... OK, this may have arrived with the FUC... lovely nomads but again I am a good person and we have some more food sources. The mumps? What the ♥♥♥♥ is the mumps. Well it doesnt matter because our children are droping like flies. OK, happend to start with the nomads. But I am a nice guy. We have lots of people.Great look at that it is early autumn and we have blistering snow. Its never been this bad. Those damn dirty... Nevermind. OK, Well surely that cant stop all the food sources... Oh wait, Everyone is ill and two fields are out of duty. Well good job I am great ♥♥♥♥ING GUY. I suppose the traders will have to save us.Oh the traders are only offering seeds?!?!?!? Look this guy has some food. Oh yeah the miners are all ill so we have nothing to trade. OK good job I a am a brilliant and tolerant person. I guess we will... I dont know anymore...At least only six people have died, oh ♥♥♥♥...... at this point the graveyard with a capacity of 144 was filled and overflowing in two minutes. Over 180 people died in two ♥♥♥♥ing minutes.Everyone left is over 60 years old. At least those ♥♥♥♥ING NOMAD SCUMBAGS DIED THOSE STUPID ♥♥♥♥S. I have only learned that nomads are bringers of death and disease. Four hours of my life was destroyed in 10 minutes. This game never lets you rest. No matter how nice your settelment is.... Nomads will destroy it.			"

												Banished is a survivalist city builder loosely set to medieval times. You're tasked with keeping your few followers fed, clothed and homed, gathering resources to expand and battling the elements and the terrain. This is much harder than it sounds like, as disasters in the form of disease or fire can hit without warning, nevermind more common occurrences like starvation or hypothermia caused by your mismanagement. All in all, an enjoyable game once you figure out how to grow and diversify your settlement a bit.The biggest issue I have with the game is how housing distribution is handled, and how little control you have over it. Your citizens will not have children unless they have homes of their own (i.e. adult children do not reproduce). This means that you will either have to constantly build more homes, or suffer devastating generation crashes every so often as widowed old people greedily demand a full household until they die, meaning you'll have fewer families and ultimately even more people above child-rearing age. A demographic disaster can be harder to recover from than anything else the game throws at you, save perhaps a wildfire scorching half your town. If you have a town hall and the ability to bring in nomad settlers, it'll be easier, but often the first pop crash happens long before you get that far.Given that this is a survivalist game, though, overcoming such challenges is a large part of the game experience. The game does grow on you after a while, and the soothing, perpetual music urges you to continue for that little while more even when bedtime beckons.Banished is quite decent value for your money, all things considered - just expect some frustration as you learn how to cope with the many hurdles it can toss at you.
