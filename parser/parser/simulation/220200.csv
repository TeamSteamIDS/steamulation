Early Access Review
								One day my daughter came home from school and asked me ""Have people actually travelled to the Moon?  How is it possible?""Two years ago, I would have answered ""yes, but I don't really know how.  It's very complicated, with lots of math and science.  You might learn about it in a physics class in 10 years time.""Instead, I answered ""Here, let me show you."" and fired up Kerbal Space Program.  We built a moon rocket and launched it, me steering and she hitting the separation detonation buttons when needed.  30 minutes later we had landed on the moon.Thank you, Squad, for enabling me to give that answer.

												My 8 year old son broke away from Minecraft today. He sat on my lap while we made a rocket. He asked questions about rockets. We made it into space and he asked, ""Are we in space?"" We came down and the friction caused our heat shield to glow. His eyes were wide open as we slowed down. We pressed the space bar to deploy our parachutes but were going too fast and our chutes failed. We crashed and he asked if the kerbal was OK. I said yes as I hit ESC and went back to the VAB and changed a few things. A few minutes later, we landed our capsule safely and he had the biggest smile on his face. I haven't heard a word about Minecraft since! Thank you for making this wonderful game!!!			"

												Words alone cannot express how amazing KSP is.To be honest, this is not a game for everyone.  If you are in the market for some fast-paced ""space combat sim"" with all kinds of weapons and big explosions, then this isn't what you are looking for.  (Except for the big explosions... KSP has you covered there).However, if you ever dreamed of actually being an astronaut, this is definitely for you.  If you sometimes forget to breath when watching recordings of the Apollo moon landings, this is definitely for you.  If precise, measured flying; careful planning; and delta-v budgeting are what drives you, this is definitely for you.  If you want to learn about Orbital Mechanics and are dying to know what the Oberth Effect or a Hofman Transfer Orbit are, this is definitely for you. If you like Physics, this is definitely for you.Optionally, if you just like building rediculously large rockets and watching them explode with glorious comedy when they fail catastrophically because you forgot ONE PART... then this is also definitely for you.Kerbal Space Program is challenging, fun, frustrating, mind boggling, huge, hilarious, complicated, deep, and just plain awesome.

								1st hour playing: WHAT DO I DO WHY IS IT BLOWING UP400th hour playing: If my calculations serve me right with this T/W ratio It will take me 1 minute 43 seconds to burn at my periapsis to reach duna insertion at which point I will get into an eliptical equatoral orbit and perform an aerobrake at 16km to get into a steady circular orbit and then I will descend with one of my 4 spaceplanes I took to go to the north pole at which I will set up base at my already existing rover while getting TAC resources to monitor life support and make sure my colony of 212 kerbals can live.11/10Edit because for some reason this gained popularity, proper review:Pros:Endless fun, so much to do. Bored of building rockets? Build a space plane! Fed up of the mun? Go to Duna! Don't want to leave the atmosphere? Build whatever you want! The list goes on!Fantastic modding community and fantastic mods. So much more expansion on an already amazing game.Fantastic community in general, some of the nicest people I've met have came from this game. They are such a helpful bunch and I'm glad I'm with them! They'll most likely love to help you. There's also a bunch of fantastic YouTubers such as Scott Manley and others... (too many to name) :)YOU CAN LEARN STUFF FROM THIS AND GAIN NEW INTERESTS! Before I played this I had no interest in space or space exploration whatsoever but now I actively follow space news and am quite knowledgable on the subject. I have also learnt a fantastic deal of orbital mechanics just from playing and learning the game.Cons:The engine and optimisation. This game uses Unity and it only uses 1 CPU core. This can be a major problem if running a multicore with low clock speed. The 32bit version of the game is a whole lot more stable but limits your RAM meaning that if you have a ton of mods you can run into a lot of crashes but thankfully there are mods out there such as ATM (Active Texture Management) and texture replacer to limit the amount of RAM the game uses. 64bit as of now is still pretty unstable with mods.The learning curve and tutorials. The learning curve on this game is huge, I'm not complaining much about this one as rocket science isn't exactly easy is it? You can learn from trial and error and it's how I learnt alot but some things you just have to read up about or watch a tutorial on youtube. There isn't really much of a tutorial in game either.Conclusion: Buy it. It's really fantastic.			"

To remove any doubts, this is by far THE best space simulator out there. The Good Amazing learning experience Choose where you want to go, with what, when, and how. HUGE planets to discover, literally, thousands upon thousands of kilometers to walk, drive, or fly your epic creations (or, if your not very creative, preset or other players' ships) Create awesome rockets, landers,ore collection/ astronaut housing bases on other planets, and spaceplanes, the way you want them Fun science mode to work your way up, earning ""science"" in order to get better equipment and rocket parts (I recommend for newish players who know at least basic orbits / how to get to the Mun) ""Creative"" mode where all parts are unlocked (great for testing and trying new things) ""Career"" mode for those really wanting a challenge (balance economy, science, and reputation for your own space organization, I recommend having a little more experience before jumping right in) The Career mode adds A LOT of purpose to the game, as well as adding new challenges such as having to make landings in certain locations, sending satellites in specific orbits, making space stations at specific altitudes, placing a flag on a certain body, collecting ore from a planet, etc. They are still adding to this game... Additionally, there are several user created mods that really expand on the experience, adding new parts or game mechanics. Built off of real physics! One doesn't just lop space junk up into the sky; one must deliver that space junk the realistic and correct way, thus rendering Kepler and Newton proud!!! (generally speaking, it allows one to see how actual launches and orbits work in the real world) Many other great aspects to this game (however, this would be a long list with all of them)The Bad Graphics aren't the best, however, they are still good and create a real sense of depth and can deliver a ""lost-in-space"" kind of a feel... It makes me feel so small compared to the vastness of our world. Plus, the graphical style really fits the style of the overall game.  Somewhat steep learning curve- It took me a while to learn to get to the ""Mun."" After this achievement, it was a lot easier to get to Minmus after this. It was difficult to get to Duna, however, once I got there, I have gradually learned enough to go pretty much anywhere and have made a permanent base on Laythe complete with science lab, crew pod and a brand spanking new air breathing engine jet transport, as well as a souped up Rover for them to drive. I have been to almost all of the planets. So basically, it takes time to get ""good"" at this game, but I assure you, it's rewarding and so spectacular to see how huge this world is (And this one is scaled down, too!). However, new tutorials should be very helpful for the beginner.  not too much music (it's still good, just gets repetitive sometimes) (*ahem* devs please add more music)  Getting to further out planets can take a long time, because it is a little more difficult and takes more resourcefulness... (several hours if your like me and really take your time, especially if you send a 3 manned mission to Eeloo... [you'll get faster the more experience you get though])Overall, this is a wonderful simulator offering a lot of real science with fun, providing lots of hours of engaging gameplay. I am so happy the developers have successfully brought this amazing game out of beta. I have purchased this game so long ago, and the updates have vastly improved the game and have solved many of the problems I have dealt with. Thank you for reading this book of a review, and I hope this really helps. Feel free to leave a comment if you have any questions, I have over 400 hours logged and played the demo for several hours. I will try to get to them as soon as possible. Happy Kerballing!!! "

								This certainly was the best 20 Euros ever spent on a game. I love this game, its learning curve and its modability.Here a few pointers to help you decide:1. If you love astronomy and space exploration, this game is for you!You can do everything you have read and fantasized about. Build any rocket, no matter how stupid the concept may look at first and then try it out in the cold hard reality of space.2. The game has a very steep learning curve and will constantly challenge you.You will learn a lot about orbital mechanics, why staging is absolutely necessary and how to conserve fuel. If you don't, you probably won't make it into orbit, much less to the Mun or even other planets. Even after more than 600 hours of playing Kerbal Space Program, I'm learning stuff the hard way by losing vehicles and Kerbals.3. The game developers actively encourage modding and the modding community is breathtakingly awesome.The modability of this game is the hidden strength of this game. Without it, I wouldn't have played it half the time I actually did and wouldn't have enjoyed it as much at the same time.The first time you play through the career mode (meaning you unlock all the technologies) you should play it without any mods, just to learn the basics, look how the game behaves, etc., but after that you should really check out the Kerbal Space Program forums mod section (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/35-Add-on-Releases-and-Projects-Showcase ), KerbalStuff (http://beta.kerbalstuff.com/ ) and/or the Curse Mod Page (http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal ). There's mods for so many aspects of the game...Want to play in more realistic solar system where it's harder to even get into orbit? Check.Want to have more realistic (= punishing) aerodynamics? Check.Want to have rocket parts for even larger rockets? Check.Want to have some autopilot capabilities to assist you with repetitive tasks? Check.Want to mine for fuel and ores on distant celestial bodies? Check.Want to have a warp drive? Also check.There's so many more which you should probably explore for yourself. The replayability of this game is great, thanks to all those mods. The community forums are also really great and helpful.If you play this game, please make sure you don't forget to mod it at some point, really!You should not play this game,  - if you don't like space sims to be too realistic. Again: You will have to learn at least basic orbital mechanics which means the strongest force around is not your ship's drive, but gravity. And a heartless ♥♥♥♥♥ she is indeed... - if you don't enjoy learning stuff the hard way by explosions, disintegrations and death. There is no perfect rocket. At some point stuff will blow up and you will have to start a whole mission again. - if you don't like games that are still in development. There will be new versions released every now and then, so things change from time to time. For example, when the game was upgraded from 0.22 to 0.23, the whole science system got a rework and a lot of my rockets that were built specifically for science grinding became useless. The update was great though, since it got rid of grinding altogether.I hope you enjoy this game as much as I still do. :)			"

Early Access Review
								This is an incredible game, I've almost got 300 hours into it and I'm still looking forward to firing it up nearly every day.There's a lot of reasons to buy this game:* if you love space, this game will get you there, first hand, and let you have your hand at designing space crafts (and planes), flying them, and of course, crashing them in big glorious explosions* you will learn a lot about space, physics, orbital mechanics, aerodynamics, etc... this really happens, I have two friends that are rocket scientists (one does ion drive research, the other designs micro-satellites, I work at a large university), and after playing this game for a few months, I could easily talk to them about their work, where they drop terms like ISP, TWR, retrograde, normals, etc, terms that I now fully understand* the game is very approachable, you can play in ""career mode"" which walks you though the beginning steps of putting a rocket into space, to orbiting, to visiting the Mun and beyond. If you need more help, the YouTube scene is quite impressive, with people like Scott Manley producing really professional (and charming) video tutorial series. I am not a lover of simulation-type games, I play mostly FPS's and RPG's, but I found this game quite easy to pick and up get into.* while approachable, this game is certainly not easy, for example, landing and returning from Eve (the Venus-like planet in the Kerbin system) is one of the hardest tasks in the game, and while most of the game is fairly non-stressful in its nature, landing spaceships is a tense experience, especially when Jeb's life is on the line! For those that find it difficult to master some of the more difficult tasks, there are impressive control mods like MechJeb2 where you essentially point at a spot on a planet and press the ""Land There"" button, MechJeb does the rest.* the game has a unique charm to it, in the game you are progressing through the space race for the people of the Kerbin panet, you'll get to know and love the kerbalnauts that will fly your craft, especially Jebediah Kerman, pilot extraordinaire and fearless hero to the Kerbin people* the community for this game, is active, organized, and quite friendly, mostly found on Reddit and the Squad forums, you can get any question answered, or read mission reports from someone's latest mission, or get news on upcoming updates for the game. The only time you see people getting belligerent on these forums is when some is misbehaving toward othersSquad is actively developing this game, each release (every new months) bringing a lot of new features and parts to build with, and just this week the update to KSP brings many new rocket parts built in collaboration with NASA plus a mission to save Kerbin from killer asteroids!* the mod scene for this game is extremely impressive, from new real-life inspired rocket parts (so you can build your own Saturn V), to impressive new systems that enable for example planetary mining (so you can get more fuel on route to your target), to just plain fun mods like the nuclear pulse rocket, which explodes varied-sized nuclear bombs behind a large plate to produce thrust (scientists actually design this beast in the 50's)* the endgame is rich and deep: once you've completed career mode, many KSP players switch to the realism mods, which give you the real solar system, truly deadly reentries, realistic communication constraints (that require building satellite networks), more realistic aerodynamics modeling (e.g., Ferram's amazing FAR mod), real life-support constraints, etc. that make for a significantly more challenging and rewarding experience; if that doesn't trip your trigger, the forums have organized challenges with leaderboards, to see who can, for example, get to the Mun with the least number of parts, or eject the most Kerbals out of the solar system, all great fun with the competitors meticulously documenting their missionsIf these things sound interesting to you, get this game! It was the best $25 bucks I ever spent! "

								Kerbal Space Program is essentially NASA by trial and error. All the fun of building things and launching them into space, without the hassle of acquiring funding or the responsibility of having to return people to Earth safely.The Kerbals are a race of little green humanoids who love space. More than anything else, they want to go to there. You can get them there by designing rockets and space planes of near-unlimited complexity (read: convolutedness), and testing them out. Some of your designs will succeed, and some will experience a ""rapid unplanned vehicle disassembly."" But that's half the fun.Once you get the hang of getting things off the ground, you can really start to see how incredibly in-depth this game is. There is an entire solar system modeled here, with 7 planets and a bunch of moons orbiting them, giving you tons to do -- enough for hundreds of hours of play. As of this writing, I'm over 100 hours spent in-game, and the furthest I've gotten from Kerbin (the Earth-analog starting planet) is Eve, one of the nearest planets (and even then, I was forced to watch helplessly as the craft crashed into the surface, having spent all of its fuel on the voyage there). The game's physics are -- while scaled down for difficulty's sake -- actually fairly realistic. I never realized how little I knew about the physics involved in orbits until I started figuring out how to save fuel during launch by focusing more on horizontal velocity. Before long, I was looking up how to do gravity assists to get to other planets, and looking up actual rocket science formulas, trying to understand the principles behind them in order to improve my designs.The game is still in Alpha, and as such it's a little rough around the edges (the most obvious to me is that the surface of Kerbin is devoid of any kind of structures besides the space center), but new updates are coming out with decent regularity. Most recently added is the career mode, which starts you out only with a handful of parts, requiring you to perform experiments and generate reports around the solar system to gain ""science"" -- a currency you can use to unlock new part selections. The part limitations give a new kind of challenge, and obtaining science gives the game a more objective focus, which I found very refreshing -- especially just as sandbox mode was starting to lose some of its draw.TL:DR;If designing and flying rockets, space planes and/or whatever ridiculous contraption you can think of sounds fun, it's a safe bet that you'll enjoy this game. Despite still being in alpha, it's already more than worth what I paid.			"

								3... 2... 1... Aw shi-If your parents have ruined your life by pumping your head full of overt positive reinforcement of all the great things you will accomplish in life, and have a shrine of your Academic Team, Little League and Girl Scout trophies and awards, and you live in the shadow of their crafted image of potential you know you will never fulfill, then KSP is for you. You will spend hours engineering great and mighty rockets, planning to launch humble little Kerbals (in game human analogs, because kerploding simulated HUMANS isn't politically correct in gaming unless it's portrayed in war, murder mysteries, alien invasions, war, zombie horror, war, armed rebellion stories, humorous ciminal empire sandboxes, war, over the top armed racing games, war, Valve circlejerk physics engine display pieces, war, or the kitchen sink) into space...Wait. What was I saying? Oh, right, you slap random aeronautic components with names longer than a West Coast Rapper's discography (what did you think I was going to say?) and plot a course for the very stars themselves! And then promptly cry tears of relief that your parent's were always wrong about you, and you actually CAN'T do anything right, all along - when you realize you forgot to put adequate battery banks on board, so now your little astronauts are floating through the hostile void forevermore, committed to the lonely depths of space, never to set foot on green Kerbin again. THIS. IS. YOUR. FAULT.Just kidding. They kerploded on the launch pad like your freshman fall semester career plans when you realized ""Intro to College Biology"" was the EASIEST class your degree required. But it doesn't matter, because trial and error in this game is so much fun, you'll completely forget about your dead end job and/or unemployment!But getting to the meat and potatoes of the game, you have about 15-20 celestial bodies to explore, and all the components you need to get there, not to mention very easy to add mods to fill in any gaps in equipment. Each body, moons, planets, even the local star can be explored and your engineering options are endless. One can make: crappy unmaned probes, crappy unmanned rovers, crappy space stations, crappy single stage to orbit launch vehicles, crappy shuttles, crappy rockets, crappy planetary bases, crappy space boats, for the odd moon with liquid surfaces. The possibilities are as countless as the stars, in that, the number could probably be calculated, but if you spent time doing it, no woman will ever touch your pe- Moving on. KSP is hours of fun, offering both structured career mode, and stupid anarchist sandbox mode for rebellious teens that hate rules. The game is still in development as of this review, and thus new content is constantly being added, not that there is any lack of stuff to do - KSP is massively replayable and tremendously enjoyable.Final score: 293/299 superfluous boosters.Protip: This game currently constitutes the entirety of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea's space program, despite the state's lack of hardware capabe of running it, even with its undemanding specs.

												There are no other games really like this. You will, in a terribly entertaining way, learn some fundamental of orbital mechanics, rocket science, aerodynamics, astrophysics and even a bit of mechanical engineering and straight physics. There is nobody to shoot, no zombies, no monsters, no combat. No grand conquests and raising flags over captured enemy bases. Yet you have never and will never play a game that will challenge, entertain and reward you like KSP will. The learning curve is stiff but not terrible. You play it at your own pace because, well, there is no other pace you can play it at. Games like Dark Souls are 'hard' because you've got to have the right mix of luck and muscle memory and you have to throw yourself at it again again. KSP can be hard because calculating the right setup for the right injection burn to put you in a viable position to get past Ike into a stable orbit around Duna with enough fuel to get you home is a staggering undertaking, a lot of planning and forethough. This is one of those games that changes gaming. You will kick yourself, repeatedly, when you look back and realize you didn't have a chance to play KSP. It is a complex, indepth, engaging, well balanced and changing but simplified to make it fun to play simulator for building and deploying rockets and ships to go into space, visit and explore other worlds and travel a solar system. The developer is a big part of this success. One of the first trail blazers on 'early access' they have been amazing for involving the community. Several of the top modders for KSP (they love and support modding in KSP - not to fix bugs but add content) were engaged and used in building content for the 1.0 release even. They are still engaged in improving and adding content to KSP. I've got close to 800 hours in at this point and still haven't really played swaths of the game, there are dozens of mods I want to try but haven't had the chance. This is the kind of game that's fun and engaging for years and years. Sometimes you need to step outside the regular run of the mill and see why a game like this has tens of thousands of reviews that are almost universally positive.			"

Early Access Review
								I was able to learn and actually understand far more about orbital mechanics by playing this game obsessively for 2 weeks than doing an astrophysics course for a year at university.This was originally a neat little rocket building and exploding simulator that attracted a couple of hours' worth amusement before being returned to the ""may play again later"" shelf. After many updates, it has grown into an immensely satisfying personal sandbox space programme simulator.The first time I landed a Kerbal safely on the Mun was a historic moment, and very emotional... until moments later when I wondered how Jebediah would possibly get back. Swiftly, a rescue mission was devised. Hours were spent meticulously over-engineering an overly capable craft, until I realised I felt quite hungry. I couldn't decide what to eat, when I noticed the name of the planet Mars equivalent. Seeing it as almost divine inspiration, I went out and got a Duna kebab. Very satisfied with the food the game chose for me, I spent the next few hours trying to fly the monstrosity that could only barely be called a ""return vehicle"" without: 1) exploding on launch. 2) tipping over and exploding whilst landing. After many reverts and quickloads, it was finally successful. A celebratory viewing of Apollo 13 ensued, followed with feverish design work on the next, more ambitious project. And then it was 6am.The game is far too addictive.I now wish I had studied aero engineering instead.There is a full solar system to obtain science on explore, with lots of ways to do it. Contraptions which can only be described as ""adorably ridiculous"" yet surprisingly effective may be constructed to your heart's content. As with many other sandbox games, you provide your own amusement - set yourself ridiculous tasks and restrictions, be efficient or over-engineer the ♥♥♥♥ out of everything such that the Littoral Combat Ship looks like a very sound and practical design.With or without mods (of which there are many), you can build almost anything from planes and land vehicles to giant flying space horses and bananas.Official multiplayer support in the future was announced a while ago, and there is currently a multiplayer mod that allows you to build space stations or conduct joint missions with friends and partner agencies.It is still currently in development, with more and more features being added with each major update. Even in its current state, I would be more than happy to pay double its current full price based on how much enjoyment I have gotten out of it.TL;DR: Spectacular failures, decided what I should have to eat one day and now I regret my key life decisions. Would buy again.			"

												If you have a deep longing to attempt landing on the surface of a star, or the gumption to fling countless people into space without any consideration toward their lives, then this may be the game for you. Failure is the only option.Most of your best stories will have nothing to do with what went right on a standard planet-to-planet maneuver, or how you really nailed that Hohmann transfer. No, it'll probably be the flaming wreckage you created where no one should have survived, but somehow did. My game once glitched as a Kerbal was falling from the upper atmosphere and he bounced on the surface. He bounced! And not in the crumpled heap of flesh and bone matter way. He bounced off the ground and appeared to be coming in for a graceful finish to a mission gone horribly wrong--the only type of mission that truly exists. He fell from space! And lived! Forget space, erect a statue!My first manned mission to the Mun ended in predictable failure. I tried landing without any sort of landing gear. How, you might ask? By landing on the engine so it was primed for vertical takeoff. I forgot about my horizontal velocity, however, and ended up ripping the engine apart. I had all the fuel I needed for a return mission, but the broken engine was left kilometers away. Oops. At least I could plant a cool flag.I attempted a rescue mission, because that is the first irresponsible thing everyone always thinks to do: stranded person in space? Send more people to help them! The first mission collided with the Mun at 600 m/s. Rough landing. The second mission landed, but I was probably 50km away--which isn't all that bad, all things considered. I had the stranded Kerbal run toward the landed ship, but it was taking forever. So I started using his little jetpack to expedite things. Lemons and lemonade. As it turns out, you can actually disintegrate a Kerbal if you get too much forward momentum and collide with something solid, like the surface of the Mun. You will forever be in our thoughts, Mac Kerman.So much for the rescue. I may as well have the rescue team return safely. Remember that landing gear part? Yeah, I still hadn't updated that section of the ship. Instead I landed on my side and planned on using elevation as a natural ramp. Bulletproof logic. At least this Kerbal had the dignity of a fiery, fiery death. An honorable death. By my own hands.In KSP, your little Kerbal guys can die and be listed in the ambiguous ""Lost"" column. It was with great sorrow that I saw Mac Kerman's name in there. I didn't care so much about the other guys. Who cares about the second guy on the Mun? But here's the thing, several years into my career mode Mac magically reappeared and was ready for action! He came back from the dead! And what was the first thing he wanted to do? Go back into space! To die again!In conclusion, yes to this game. Just yes. I currently have a Kerbal orbiting the second moon, Minmus. Yes, he is in a stable orbit without a ship. Just him. And he's been there for close to 30 years now. I'll get around to that at some point.Update: Still in orbit.			"

												I score this Simulation game 12/10, just hit the buy button! It exceeds all expectations. The game isn't finished yet, but I don't care. They can't fail anything anymore. Just buy it. Or wait for a sale and then buy it. Whenever you buy it, you won't feel ripped off! I guarantee you that! Kerbal Space Program is pure MAGIC! On the facade it comes across as something with the depth of Angry Birds and the looks of a crappy looking 3d rollercoaster tycoon and the unsuspecting gamer is easily fooled. However, there is a reason this game has a fanbase of millions! There's a reason I'm scoring this game 12 out of 10. I find this game to be the most addictive thing in my library. I even try NOT to play it, but when I do it keeps me awake at night and busy while doing daily chores...KSP, like the name might have hinted, is a Space Program Simulator Game. There is the career mode, involving missions and research, and there is the sandbox mode that allows you to run free with it. The game is in early access and the career needs work (I find the missions redundant and confusing, but it's already fun), and this review is more about the sandbox mode.You run the show, so you set out your own missions, like fly to the moon or another planet. Then you have to build your lander, rover, satelite or whatever, the means of manouvering in space and a rocket to get it in space! Then you have to find out not just how to get something off the ground and into space, you also need to learn to make an orbit. Then you learn how to manipulate orbits in order to get around. There are no concessions! By the time you've figured out how to get where you want to go, you will have learned the basics of actual spaceflight! You don't need a science degree to do this and to understand this, the game is brilliant this way. You can get there by trial and error and in a fun way too.I recommend this game to all people that like simulation games, tycoon games, Lego (the plastic bricks), science fiction in general, science in general, rockets and blowing stuff up, real space exploration or even have slight positive stance on looking at the sky at night willing to learn.As you set out your own missions, you send your Kerbal individuals (they all have names) on grand adventures. Their homeworld has a cicumference of about 12000km and it comes with 2 moons. The bigger one looks like our own moon and it can even cast a solar eclipse (really a fun and beautifull feature). In the Kerbol (name of the star) system you will also find the planets Moho, Eve with it's moon Gilly, Kerbin with Mun and Minmus, Duna with Ike, then a gas-giant called Jool with no less then 5 moons plus finally the dwarfplanet Eelo. The distances are measured in millions of kilometers when traveling in space. It may be a scaled down planetary system, but that doesn't mean it's small. I have never before adventured through such an immense ingame world. Each planet and moon comes with it's own biomes and anomalies to discover and explore and you'll busy for hundreds of hours before you've done it all. Everyone plays in this same systen so everyone can share their adventures with eachother, you know what the other player is talking about.When I started playing, I had little expectations. It looked like a mod, but then I reached space. It was like the opening of the movie 2001: a Space Oddisey. The ""space whales"" ingame music started playing and my contraption was floating in a serene fashion high above kerbin, ever going higher and higher, kerbin getting smaller and smaller, I passed the Mun... lost kerbin, then found the ""eva"" button.. I found out stands for ""Extra Vehicular Activity"", or ""Go play outside"".. so I lost my Kerbal. Hours of my life passed by while staring at this phenomenon called KSP, while drooling over my keyboard.This game is not done yet. I'm not sure when they aim for a release candidate, but they can't fail this anymore. Nasa has made an addon for it, so now asteroids are also part of the game and can be landed on or grabbed. Nasa also added their own rocket parts based on the new Space-X rocket, how awesome is that! And the developer has even announced multiplayer!!! I don't know how this will work and what we could do in an online game, and It's already more fun if a friend plays this game too, but it's anticipated by me nonetheless. The educational value of this game is through the roof! I thought I understood the principle of orbits, but boy did I learn a lot. I understood the concept of flying faster horizontally then you fell vertically, but putting it to practice requires more then just going. So, I watched Nasa do it. They pivot the rocket as soon as it has picked up enough speed, so ok... I built a rocket with steering parts and pivotted it correctly after a few try-outs and finally worked out an eliptical orbit to play with. At this point the concept that Isaac Newton put down of ""every action has a 'pose and equal reaction"" gets a whole new meaning in orbit (you'll see :KSmiley:). Every run you make in Kerbal, you get more advanced. Your rockets become more stable, because you know how to make them, you get to other planets faster, because you know how to get there. My rockets grew in size from around 60 parts for the rocket with my first moonlander, of which I built a new version every night, to about 1300 in my rocket plus massive oversized truck I landed on Duna, which took me 2 weeks to build! It went from slapping together a simple contraption to a mind-boggling engineering puzzle that even my pc (or the game's engine) found hard to process when launched.There comes a point where you get stuck on something, like how to dock in space. There are several things to do, but I warn you: this can make or break your experience. Try as hard as you can if you're stuck, play with a friend (you know, together on one pc thinking and building) and if all else fails, then try youtube or a guide. Letting guides take you by the hand can ruin your experience. But when you've reached this point it just means a whole new world of Kerbal opens before your eyes. I think every KSP player has posted screenshots, videos, guides both online and private to friends. The ammount of material you can dig up is staggering.Also, don't install mods as you just start playing, exept for scan-sat perhaps (but don't, the other mods will lure you). Mods potentially ruins the experience as they can either make it to hard or too easy. I've reached the point where making an orbit has become a boring thing to do and I had seen all the parts ingame. I've reached the point of not getting my ships docked. This was the point where I looked on youtube, read guides and reviews for mods and then installed mods, mods like MechJeb (in flight telemetry and autopilot options, use at your own risk), advanced cockpits (cockpit screens, buttons to press, external cameras, awesome!), more parts, graphical addons, scan-sat (scans planets, awesome!), etc. But with all games in early access, mods can be broken when the game is patched. But when you've reached that point, KSP can be enhanced in such ways it brings about limitless posibilities, as realistic as you want it to be.This game is 100% quality, dedicated hard work and deserves all credit it can get. When it's done, it just means it has reached a point where the developers can call it a complete game. With more standard parts, more physics, more career, more tycoon and basicly more game then it is now. From that moment this game will only expand as if it were the universe itself thanks to mods and I don't think this game will die out soon. Just buy the game, you'll have fun for years to come I promiss!!!Now years after release, I stand by my review. This game will stand it's ground.If it's not on sale, check out Steamhookups.com if there's a good deal in it for you!			"

								Imagine the most intricate, accurate to life space vehicle simulator you can.  Dozens of toggle switches, displays ranging from the strange and esoteric to the vague and incomprehensible, buttons flashing angrily at you and daring you to press them.  The screen shakes and aside from the roar of liftoff, the only thing you can hear is your own labored breathing and the pulse in your ears.  Do you have this picture in your head?  Good.Because KSP is nothing like that.   Take parts, attach parts, launch parts, land parts, detonate parts, survive falling parts.  KSP is learning through failure.  Unless you go on Youtube and look up the Scott Manley videos, you are going to fail.  You gonna fail bad.  But it's okay.  Failure is only data by another name.  Bit by bit, you'll learn how to do things right.  You'll realize that putting the engines under the tanks is probably a good idea.  Putting the crew capsule in a place not likely to be burned or detonated is also probably a good idea.   Parachutes seem like a logical choice, but what the heck, right?  Maybe you just need a five hundred meter long crumple zone.  Nobody's gonna stop you.  That's the great thing, isn't it?  You can put anything at all you want on the launchpad, and nobody knows well enough to try to stop you.  The Kerbish OSHA rep is permanently locked into the bathroom.  He's not gettin' out of there.  We welded the window shut, locked the door, and put model airplane glue in the keyhole.  Cell phone reception in there is sketchy.  You're safe.  So go nuts.There's places you can go.  Land at the poles, the sea, the mountains, or all three at once with a creatively timed spray of shrapnel.  There's other worlds.  A big burning thing with no surface that'll tan you for free if you check it out.  It'll tan you to the bone.  So that's a bonus.  There's other worlds.  Red world.  Purple world.  Green world with little worlds around it.  Hidden stuff everywhere.  All of these places are fit to seed with refuse.  Landers, rovers, living quarters, stations, battleships, pasteboard furniture, lawnmowers, spaceplanes, robots, scooters, springboards, et cetera.  KSP is a litterer's dream.  There's so many places you can leave stuff you have no hope of bringing home.  And it's worth doing it just to see that stuff sitting there.But I've got to warn you.  You've reached TL;DR level four, so here's a bonus.  This game has very unexpected side effects.  You will learn things.  Hoffman transfer.  Periapsis.  Apoapsis.  How orbit actually works.  Why orbit is halfway to anywhere.  Launch windows.  Free transfer windows.  Free returns.  If you make the horrifying inadvertent mistake of buying this game for yourself or your child, somebody's gonna learn things.  It's unavoidable.   Real things, even.  Newton's spectre haunts this game.  You will find no escape, and he fears no earthly garlic.Lemmie wrap this up for the TL;DR folks who check the bottom summary.  Just get KSP already.  You aren't really learning anything from my review you probably didn't know already.  Let's be honest with each other, here.  Ok?  You don't want to learn whether or not this game is worth buying.  You're looking for someone to make the excuse for you.  You're already gonna get it, you just want someone to possibly take the fall for you if you catch heat for doing it.  And to you, good sirs and madams, I say;  Yes.  Yes, I'll take the blame.  ""That fat idiot Whackjob from KSP told me to get the game, or he said he'd cut me.""  They'll believe you.  You're good.  So do it.  Hit that buy button.Thank me later.~Whackjob of KSP[i.imgur.com] "

												Started playing this game when I was 11, it was too complicated for me. I'd spent over 20 hours trying to reach the moon but always failed.I'm now 14 and I've finally reached the moon and back.10/10 - would wait 3 years until I'm mature enough to understand a game again.Edit: For those saying the game came out last year, the first public release of this game was on June 24, 2011.

												I played this game with my son, now he wants to be an austronaunt.10/10Seriously, once upon a time if my son would have asked me ""Dad, how did people land on the moon"" I wouldn't know what to tell him. But today, when my son asked me that question (awww yis!), I simply said -- ""I'll show you how"", and we fired up the game. I was able, with the help of KSP, to show my son the beauty of trial and error, the difficulty of space travel and just how vast and empty space is, and how small we are. I let him built it himself, parachutes on a moon lander, backwards engines and everything. I remember his look of disbeleif and surprise as our first rocket exploded, the look of awe as we made orbit, his wide eyed gaze as we made our trajectory to the moon and he could actually see just how small earth is and how far we are from the moon. I remember his enthusiasm as we were about to touch down on the moon and we deployed his parachutes. Which didn't work. We crashed. Hard. After the inital shock was over, my son asked in surprise: ""Dad why don't parachutes work on the moon?"".Oh man, thank you KSP. Thank you for making science fun!			"

												When you play Kerbal Space Program, you find yourself becoming one of two types of individuals.  Either you throw everything together and make things up as you go, or you spend equally as much time planning for a mission as actually flying it.  Either way, mission success (whatever you define that to be) is always either painstakingly earned or astronomically lucky (pun intended).  It's very hard to compare to the feeling of seeing a safe splashdown after one of your Kerbals (the characters that man spacecraft) has walked on the surface of another celestial body.  It's also hard to compare to the humbling feeling you get when you've made it halfway across the Kerbol system after significant planning and execution time only to realize that you left your landing legs at home.This game will frustrate and exhilarate you.  Well worth the purchase.			"

												It's been quite a ride. Four long years of development, cool stuff, accidentally education, and the Kraken... and here we are. One point oh (point whatever!) And oh, are things different! But that's all the past! Let's talk about the present.This is a game in which you go to space repeatedly, success optional.Most of the entertainment value in this game is either limited or boosted by your imagination. You can just throw some bits together, hit the go button and see what happens! What's that? There are Kerbals in there? I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you over the sound of my massive explosion device. Conversely, you can put things together in a very particular manner and create the perfect interplanetary shuttle. It's all up to you. Your sandbox is the solar system. Go play. Due to the nature of things and such, this game would be truly incredible in a classroom environment, yet it's just as fun alone at home.Now, for the less sandbox-oriented among us (or just the people like me who enjoy progression,) there's a career mode! This time, you start out with the exclusive ability to make short range, manned, ballistic missiles! FOR SCIENCE! Seriously, you generate Science! from everything, and you use it to unlock more things to build better missiles to make more Science! Be careful though. Don't want to blow up too many bits, because you have funding to worry about now. You should also take care of your Kerbals to keep your reputation acceptable.Also the camera shakes, there's complicated aerodynamics, there's thermodynamics, there's moresodynamics, there's orbital mechanics, there's resource mining (which you can MAKE FUEL with,) there's management, there's pretty explosions, there's good sound effects that are also deafening, there's accidentally education, and so much more for only some money!However, the tutorial is absolutely useless and frustrating. Ignore it, fumble around for a while, and utilize the internet to learn what you must know when you decide that trial and error is so last era.There's not really much else to talk about... All the other details are either not noteworthy, neutral, or better kept quiet... so...Go build some intercon- advanced spacecraft.			"

								KSP Version 0.23, Alpha. (Try the free demo if you're unsure!)An absolutely brilliant example of an open game still under development, KSP lets players explore the Kerbol system with a fleet of (mostly) operational, self-designed ships, probes, rovers, stations, permanent bases and, of course, manned missions. Although the Unity engine causes even top-end PCs to sometimes run at sub-par framerates, the game is slowly becoming more intricate and beautiful with every update. You'll quickly realise that there are no predefined goals and a lot of what you achieve on KSP is fuelled by your imagination, so if you're looking for a linear game with missions and a set storyline, this isn't for you.The game features two different modes; career mode and sandbox mode. While the (basic) career mode is currently being updated and improved, sandbox definitely contains enough content to give dozens of hours of fun, if not more! Multiplayer is due to be introduced before final release too.Outside the stock game, the community is excellent with a plethora of mods created to complement the game, easily installed thanks to developer support and an official mod-sharing website. Once you begin to look for objectives beyond scooting around the rocky surface of Moho or exploring Jool's many moons, you can introduce extraplanetary mining with the Kethane mod, orbital mapping with the ISA MapSat mod, or a host of other content packages created by the community. Just expect to crash often when you first start, and don't grow too attached to any of your impressive creations. This is an alpha-level game, after all.			"

 This game is like a toast...  Your first attempt at toast looks pretty good, but you end up burning it. You don't give up, after several attempts you make some better toasts Those toasts taste awful and one nearly burns your entire house down Desperate for toasting glory you search for some toast videos on youtube All these people making enoromous and gloriously looking toasts make you jealous and sad One day, you discover that you sorta don't need to make overcomplicated toasts to enjoy your snack. You also notice tiny differences between toasts and their preparation You finally enjoy a proper toast, but the more you eat, the hungrier you get Your hunger for toasts gets bigger and bigger with every known recipe You start modifying your snacks and try challenges from other toast fans You achieve toasting heaven, nothing can stop you now, you have mastered the art of toast. You begin preparing your masterpiece. After several hours of hard work you end up burning it.  You look back at all your progres, and you realize that you don't have to make every toast perfect. It's in the dedication, will to learn from your mistakes and enjoying little victories on long and hard path.This game is sweet combination of pride, joy and relief you'll feel after every successful mission although you also get hours of excrutiating pain, swearing and mental breakdowns. Get this game for full price, it's worth every penny....and I like toasts.			"

												OLD INFO AT TOP- KEEP READING. Probably one of the best games i have ever played. i have logged well over 1000 hours on this game and i still enjoy logging into it frequently. try it out, and get some mods. you need to accept a bit of instabuility at times with lots of mods (im using like 13 mods right now) but if you go vanilla (witch still allowes for Lots of unique ideas on its own) stabuility is rarely an issue. game takes a hog of a PC, and due to 32 bit Engine.... sigh, is stuck using only 1 core of your processor. but is usually sparkling on a good pc none the less.and For advanced Players, theres really no end to what you can do.a person need only look at youtube and they can get an idea of the insanity that is building your own rockets in a physics engine. you plan it all... and if you mess up, fuel levels, mistakes ect..... another kerbal bites the dust.. ""now serving #15"" a Pa announces.April 2015: 2000 hours and climbing, still have not run out of uniqe things to do.. theres always a crazier mission than you considered before... the mods have only gotten better, and with some tricks like running in OpenGL mode you can load this game up with ALOT of mods before it explodes. you can install Real solar system mod and play on a real life sized system, makes going to the moon and back something worth bragging about. thats for extremely advanced players as even i find it hard.Feb 2016 - 3000 hoursGame completed, runs great on 64 bit version, now mods arent an issue and you can load it up until the cows come home. so much more stable than ever, faster than ever and every thing. Just works better now as the last thing they did was optimize the crap out of it. still one of the best games i have ever owned. play it constantly			"

												Truly Epic. One of those games I keep going back to (300+ hours as I write this).Being a simulation, the number of situations you can find yourself in is nearly endless.My most recent Kerbtastrophe occurred when my unmanned mapping and science probe (JoolStar1) was about to arrive at Jool after nearly 4 years in flight. Actually, it happened quite a while before that, I just wasn't aware of it.I switched to the probe, ready to fine-tune my approach so I could cut through the atmosphere, bleeding off speed without wasting fuel.Something was wrong. The probe didn't respond to inputs. That's when I realised I hadn't deployed the solar panels before leaving Kerbin orbit! Cursing, I tried to deploy them. Nothing. I mashed the button repeatedly. Still nothing. I checked the batteries... Empty!Since I didn't have a kerbal on board to do an EVA, there was nothing I could do except watch helplessly as JoolStar1 sailed straight past its destination, a failure destined to orbit the sun forever.This game is all about failing repeatedly (and hilariously) until a Darwinian process of attrition results in an understanding of how to build, fly and land rockets.I can't recommend it highly enough			"

												2 things 1. The best game I have ever played. 2. SCOTT MANLEY.I could write a 10k word essay on all the good things about this game. But I'll stick to pointing out the one thing that was both what got me hooked and would also frustrate me to the point of almost not wanting to play. The learning curve. It's the single most challenging learning experience I've had since I left uni! But I LOVED every second of it. The absolute highlight of this game for me? When a friend and I shared a save file and flew a mission (over 2000tons of spaceship) to the planet jool with the aim of landing and every moon and then coming home. We worked on the designs together, assembled our ship in orbit together and ran the mission. Kerbal has given me the most rewarding gaming experiences of my life... and I play a LOT of games!			"

								Think of Kerbal as a Do-It-Yourself-NASA, albeit less successful because you haven't a clue what you're supposed to be doing. It's all fun though, as you'll learn quite quickly and by the end of the week, along with some Scott Manley Youtube schooling, you'll be on the right track.You'll probably spend 95% of your time exploding, but that slim 5% that you actually manage to get into orbit, dock two craft together to make a space station, or land on another body (such as the Mun), will become some of the most memorable experiences in your video gaming life.As close to a solid space simulation as you'll ever get. And extremely mod friendly too!			"

You have explosions, the ability to build the best spacecraft you can comprehend; and best of all, you have raw power.You may first get it and think, ""what was I thinking when I got this, it's more difficult than becoming friends with Piers Morgan!"" With that, you would be correct, but what you need... is to practice with many many crafts to get the right ideas.The controls are like some kind of madness that would drive you away, but it's very easy to understand after you play for a bit.All in all, I must say: this is one of the best games... in the world, and even out of it. If you wanted to pick this up for a mere 27 dollars (17 Quid), you would have to be mentaly insane to not get it.And on that bombshell, back to the studio.			"

												Kerbal Space Program, at least to me is the king of simulation games. While I play numerous others (such as Farming Simulator) they don’t seem to hit every mark in that field. KSP, while challenging at first is the one that throws everything that happens in reality at the player, and force them to deal with it. While a game like Farming Sim only really requires you to keep an eye on fuel or some crops, KSP requires that you maintain a healthy supply of necessities ranging from fuel and electricity, to a satellite connection back home. But the part of the game that truly shines is the feeling you get when you first land on the Mun. A friend who gave the game a shot said  Originally posted by Bacaber: “it was just...pride. So many Kerbals died in previous attempts, and I finally made it.” While the game is difficult, I can’t stop asking people to try it. To me, it’s the perfect “life isn’t about the destination, but the journey” and I think this game captures that perfectly. "

												I have been playing this game for a very long time. Very easy to get into, very hard to master. It is not a simulation by any means, but that doesn't mean you won't still learn a lot about rocketry, and the things which NASA and the folks who fly in those crazy contraptions have to deal with. The Community as well is extremely nice, and extremely active. With a mass amount of mods for the game, which allows you to really customize it to your liking (Much like Elder Scrolls games are). On top of that, they are also moving it to  Unity 5 (If they havn't already at the time you're reading this in the future), meaning the limitation on mods will be quite literally... limitless. That with Multiplayer to boot! (Coming Soon as well with Unity 5). -----------------------------The game itself has 3 modes. Career: Which pits you against your mind. Balancing income from successfull missions, reputation, and science. Failed missions could cost you big, and  learning how to create a more cost friendly ship to do the same job could save you bundles. Use Science to unlock new parts on the tech tree, to push your exploration even farther. Science: Same as Career but without the reputation and Money. Sandbox: Like all Sandboxes.. Everything is tehre from the start, no money, science or anything else, Just build and have fun. -------------------------------What you do in the game is open ended. IT's your choice. Build what you want, and fly it anywhere you want (Or anywhere it can go). There are many many entire different planets to explore, moons, asteroids, etc. A fully open ended solar system. Taking off from Kerbin, flying through the upper atmosphere, and breaking through into space is seemless and a wonderful excitement when you do it for your first time without the ship exploding. From there, going to another planet, landing anywhere you want on it and exploring it, then coming back and hoping you have the right trajectory to burn safely through the kerbin atmosphere as flames fly up around your ship.. epic. 5 Tests launching rockets that failed: 2,000,000 Launched a rocket to the Mun, but couldn't return: 400,000 + 1 stranded Kerbal Attempted a rescue Mission with the same result: 450,000 + another stranded Kerbal Finally reaching the Mun, and returning back safely in the water: Priceless			"

												While it's not exactly beginner-friendly, Kerbal Space Program (KSP) is a brilliant game for what it achieves.  What other game can boast of accurate portrayal of orbital physics, staging rocket sequences and interplanetary travel?  Gravity is a difficult beast to tame!You're drawn in by the relatively simple ship construction aspect where you put together your ship like building blocks, attaching parts one at a time with options to make certain parts attach symmetrically.  Once you're on the launchpad though, ♥♥♥♥ gets real.  You will fail a lot, with your rocket exploding, or tipping over, or messing up the sequence of stages.Just leaving the atmosphere and establishing an orbit is a massive challenge, and that is still the early game!  Sending probes and landers to other planets and moons, building space stations and exploring the far reaches of the fictional solar system; these are all possible.  Beyond that, the Career and Science modes provide new tasks and objectives such as completing contracts or carrying equipment to perform various scientific experiments, and further still the Sandbox mode allows you to set your own goals.Unless you're a genius or have a huge deal of patience you will need to refer to various tutorials, wikis, guides and discussions online.  If physics scares you off you will probably find it hard to enjoy the game beyond its initial simple tasks.  You'll need to be willing to learn new things to get the most out of this game.KSP will likely give you a new appreciation of the space program of the 20th Century and what was achieved with the technology available at the time.  Any person who's dreamed of working at NASA must try Kerbal Space Program.Recommended!			"

								Kerbal Space Program is great fun.If you love space and explosions, this one comes highly recommended.A lot of potential players express concern at the complexity of the game, but they needn't worry if they're really interested in playing.  KSP is a game first, and a simulation second. You don't have to be Scott Manley, or even average, at the game in order to have fun. Just build stuff and fly it about! You'll learn the nuances of spaceflight as you go. Not to mention if flight and orbital mechanics elude you, there are mods such as MechJeb that assist you with flying your ship and going from one planet to another, or perform the maneuvers FOR you, that way you can focus on building and watching things go boom. The more recent addition of ""Career"" mode takes the new player experience even further, serving as a guided, but still sandboxy, introduction to all aspects of the gameplay.Reasons to buy KSP:You like space.You like explosions.You like sandbox games.You have a soul.Reasons not to buy KSP:You mistakenly think space isn't awesome.Explosions scare you.You're afraid you'll get sand in your eyes.You have no soul.

												**Based on 500 hrs of gameplay**Best game I've ever played. School grades have been sacrificed.Do you want to get addicted? Because this is how you get addicted.Build and design spaceships, rovers, or even spaceplanes, like the shuttles NASA is using. Build it, launch it, crash it, try again, crash again, build again, and eventually manage to explore the solar system.This game is for the players who enjoy challenges and small chances of success - at least at first. It's a steep learning curve, and a lot to dig into, but the fact that a lot of your coming failures will be the result of having to adjust to the laws of physics, aerodynamics, thermology and so on makes the whole experience rewarding in even real-life practical ways. Smart people play KSP. Be smart. Seriously.			"

												This game has one of the steepest learning curves of any game i've ever played, but it has also given me the greatest feeling of achievement from any game i've ever played.When you land on the Mun for the first time, after mashing buttons trying to stabalise your craft and you barely make it due to the lack of fuel, there's no better feeling than knowing you have to do it all again and launch a rescue mission. (or you could just leave Bob there for science).....I am a big fan of space, physics and science in general and playing this game has been an education for me. Because of KSP I have watched dozens of YouTube videos on astrophysics and aerodynamics I would have probably never watched without this game and learned a ton of interesting things, and i love that.The game has a fantastic modding community with a huge variety of mods to add realism or give your game a futuristic sci-fi feel. A favourite mod of mine is 'Remote tech', I don't play without it. This game produces some stunning visuals too as you drift through the vast openness of space, orbiting moons, chasing asteroids, collecting science and designing planes, rockets, trucks, rovers, probes, boats even helecopters and mech walker/transformer type sh** thanks to mods... If you ever look up at the stars and wonder what it would be like to go there..... Well, this is as close as i'm ever gunna get.			"

												It's not exactly rocket science is it?....oh wait, yes it is!Kerbal Space Program is a game about building spacecraft and, unless you're very good at the game, watching them blow up which is currently in Early Access. In KSP you design and build your very own spacecraft/rockets and spaceplanes which you then use as you leave Kerbin to further the scientific knowledge of the humble kerbal. With a vast array of parts at your disposable it's daunting at first, well it's daunting for a while, but once you get the hang of it this game is a blast, especially if you have any interest in astrophysics or aerospace engineering.KSP has four different game modes each of which I will give a brief description of. First off there's sandbox mode. In sandbox mode you have no limitations and most importantly you have access to all of the parts right away, this is the perfect way for new players to get to grips with building and figuring out what works well and how the game works.Next we have scientific mode. In scientific mode you have to generate science points from doing experiments in different places, e.g. the surface of Kerbin or low Kerbin orbit. Science points you earn can then be spent on new technologies in the tech tree which unlock new parts which help you to go to new places to complete more experiments. You begin with few parts which are basic so unlocking new technologies in imperative to progress.Up next is career mode. Career mode is scientific mode but now with money and reputation to worry about. Money is earned by completing contracts, such as putting a part on your rocket and getting it to a certain altitude and then money is spent on parts for your rocket or spaceplane. Reputation is earned by successfully completing contracts, the higher your reputation is the better the contracts you get offered are. However, reputation can be lost through either failing contracts or losing kerbals.Last, and probably least depending on what you like, are the game's pre-made scenarios. Ranging from tutorials on docking to the NASA redirect mission this game mode is what you would expect it to be, just different scenarios to try out, not much to say about this one.+Graphics are pretty nice+Lots of different parts+The building menus are good and building is relatively easy, by easy I mean straightforward to use not easy to make decent vehicles+A number of different planets and moons, each with different appearances and properties+Good controls and useful hotkeys+Good staging setup+Endless possibilities of what you can make, from simple little rockets to huge spacestations in orbit around distant planets+Reasonaly good physics but not perfect (I'll get to that later)+Plentiful explosions+Huge replayability+Great modding community and adding mods is extremely easy+Kerbals are nice little race and you can get attached to the more well known kerbals quite easily (I <3 Jeb)+/-Very basic tutorials, this game really throws you in at the deep end-Immensely steep learning curve, I'm 60+ hours in and I've only recently made it to the Mun (and successfully landed) -The physics and controls for spaceplanes are pretty bad, spaceplanes have clearly been neglected in favour of rocketsVerdict:9An outstandingly good vehicle builder/sandbox game which is perfect for anyone with an interest in space, the related physcis or anyone who likes building vehicles.El K.

												So i told myself when i reached 100 hours on this game i would write a review. Well, here i am.So i got this game around summmer 2015, after wanting it for a long time.The game had just left early access and was in beta. (I just want to point out that i am very attatched to this game)I adore this game. Most of my summer was spent playing this. (Before you say that isn't possible, i would like to point out my hours didn't add up as I ran the game from the .exe rather than steam.) I would, and have, recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the feel of success, science, exploration, engineering, space, cute green creatures who you shall become the merciless god of as you stack them on top of each-other and use them as landing gear.The only slightly bad thing about this game is the learning curve. I know the 1.1 update added loads of tutorials, 'cuz the old ones were exeedingly bad, but you will spend around 5 - 10 hours before you can do anything useful. Needless to say though it is worth it, and soon you will conquer the solar system!Or, y'know, just abuse the various bugs the game has... that's cool....Anyway, thanks for reading this review. If it helps someone buy the game, or spread the word, or anything, then i'm glad.-- Simple Concept			"

								Oh boy, this game is definitely worth your money. My Kerbal Space Program story originated over 2 years ago when a friend suggested it and I quickly shrugged it off. I started watching videos, downloaded the demo, got hooked and here I am with over 960 hours and still going in this game. I never run out of things to do. Yes there is a huge learning curve but it is totally worth it. Even with the amount of time I have dedicated to this game I still cannot perfectly perform maneuvers, but what would be the fun in that? The modding community is great, as is the community in general. I have never seen a community so dedicated to ehlping others as the Kerbal community is. Now that the game is in beta I feel like we are a step closer to the final product and i would completely recommend buying this game before it's price continues to increase.			"

												To begin, I guess I should give a short description: Essentially, KSP is a fairly realistic simulation game where you take control of and guide the nascent space program of a race of small green men and women from a planet named Kerbin. You will build your own vessels, choose your targets for exploration, colonization, scientific endeavor, etc, and blast off for space. The construction system is incredibly robust and fun to use, and, because of the level of customization available, tends to mean that no two ships will ever look or behave exactly alike. There are no food or oxygen or water needs on ships (several mods change this if you want), but the actual mechanics and physics of the game are convincingly accurate, and make for a, while unforgiving, very fun game, because the feedback is extremely consistent. A mistake will kill you EVERY time, unless something hilarious happens (this is actually one of the great parts of playing KSP). I cannot say enough positive things about this game. I purchased this originally in April of 2013, before it was on steam, and only purchased it on steam now that it has officially released. KSP has few goals, and in sandbox mode, it has none, but  goals are not the reason to play KSP. The first time I successfully put a Kerbal in orbit around his home planet, I was dancing around my dorm room, and the first time I landed a Kerbal on the Mun, I felt a sense of accomplishment I have quite literally never felt in a game before. Now, over the course of what must be at least a thousand hours of play, I have built massive colonies on Laythe, the Mun, Minmus, Duna, Eve, and even Ike, I've built huge orbital stations around various planets, and I've even built floating cities in the clouds of Jool and Eve through the use of just a few of the thousands of mods available. I've built resource collection and transport systems including storage, mining, and transport operations. I've explored hundreds of different areas with probes, landers, and vehicles, and yet, to this day, I still play this game at least two to three hours a week, and I'll go on KSP binges several hours long when I think of a new challenge to set for myself. Currently, a friend of mine and I are in a little friendly competition for who can build the most epic Duna colonization project. If you can't tell by now, if you want an 'on rails' game where everything is spoonfed to you, just leave now. This game is most certainly NOT for you. The contract system is honestly only there to give a person inspiration.But if you want a game that throws challenges at you that will test every brain cell you have, and pound your face into the ground mercilessly if you make even the slightest mistake, then KSP is your game. And when you finally put a Kerbal safely on the Mun, you just might understand why so many people write such glowing things about KSP.			"

												Kerbal Space Program is hands down the most fun I have had with a video game in quite a while. The core premise of the game is fairly simple: build some rockets, try to fly them to places. That might sound pretty straightforward, but where Kerbal Space program really shines is in HOW that is done, and how it is done is with SCIENCE. The game perfectly encapsulates one of the best ways of looking at science.  I do not know what will happen if X.  I guess I should try it and see.  Holy ♥♥♥♥, I didn't expect that.  [knowledge gained]It really is a hell of an experience, and you can really feel it in full force thanks to the fact that there is very little hand holding in the game. In all liklihood, when you first sit down to play it you WILL mess up. Badly. You will have rockets flip over, burn up in the atmosphere, and explode. You will forget key parts, mess up staging, and accidentally deploy your parachutes at the same time as your engines. You will bolt things together at random because you have no idea what to do, run out of fuel stranded in space, and crash into moons at 2000 m/s. It will be a disaster, but you will keep at it, and eventually you will learn. As your Kerbals gain an understanding of their world and grow, so too will you, and believe me when I say that the feeling of accomplishment is tremendous. When you are flawlessly burning prograde at your apoapsis to circularize your orbit around some god-forsaken rock on the edge of the solar system, you will feel like a colossus bestriding the universe. It will be glorious.I cannot recommend Kerbal Space Program highly enough. Buy this game right now and get started sciencing your way to the stars through a series of horrific explosions.			"

Hey, you!Yeah, you!Want to... Go to space?Want to go to space, but accidentally end up going to the ground again, in pieces, get more determined and try again ten times until you can savour a brief victorious moment when you pass the threshold to the technical definition of space? Before the cruel gravity rudely yanks your creation back down towards physics emulated certain doom?Want to ""land"" on a moon? Riddle your equatorial low orbit with tons and tons of debris? Want to feel the bitter-sweet thriller-laced surprise of seeing your heartily built spacecraft perish in ways you never imagined possible, stretching your definition of failure to new horizons? Want to...Unwittingly run out of fuel and get stranded in an orbit painfully close to, yet unreachably far away from your intended destination, forcing you to sporadically architect and implement a quick rescue mission?Only to resignedly succumb to the realization that your newly launched rescue expedition, due to inexplicably unfortunate circumstances, suddenly also finds itself in an immediate and dire need of yet another rescue mission?Accidentally learn orbital and aerodynamic flight mechanics in your desperately frantic efforts not to explode, due to the game covertly being both inspirational and educational?Have your spacecraft buggedly duplicate itself upon loading it, causing the freshly spawned evil twin clone from the dark abyssian realm of the Kraken to physically intersect with the unfortunate original craft, gleefully tearing it apart in a heartbreakingly horrendous show of telefragging, the likes of which you have not seen since playing Quake?Curse your own careless inattention after painstakingly placing a small unmanned lander around an unexplored foreign moon of a newly discovered distant planet, readying it for the final descent stage when you discover that you have mistakenly attached an Argon gas tank to your Xenon gas powered ion engine?Making the engine produce its simultaneously first and last soul tearingly choking sputtering sad noise before dying out, effectively sealing the fate of the lander to forever being an embarrassingly bricked monument to your own dementia?Construct a fragile but vast interplanetary satellite communications network, precipitously vulnerable to periodic catastrophic cascading signal outages due to its many points of failure and lack of redundancy?Pilot unproportionally enormous single staged space-planes all the way to other planets' moons and proceed to land on them in a frivolously flamboyant show of defiance against the confines of practicality, purpose and reason?Want to...Have your very distant, intricate and expensive spacecraft insolently threaten to violently wobble itself apart, for no reason other than purely in protest to all your meticulous and loving efforts of simply having created and cared for it?While the craft wilfully ignores your all blood, sweat and tears from the strife of its arduous journey, as they silently boil away in the cold black emptiness of space?With all the screaming impudence of a small child not having received the perfectly correct nuance of sugary flavour in its strawberry ice cream with colourful hello kitty sprinkles on top?Yeah? Good, then the game is for you!I can promise that you will have surprisingly much fun failing completely and miserably, compared to any other game, while the reward from the challenge of succeeding makes it all the more sweeter when you finally do succeed.10/10, would launch again, for science!

A game you can easily spend 2000 hours plus onOne of the best games of all times,If you are looking for action,If you are looking for fast game play.... you are completely wrong here.This game is about brains.... and has inspired many people to have a deeper look into (rocket)science or astronomy.Build the Spaceship of your dreams, but bound to the realty of physics and chemistry.And sometimes it can have fast and intense moments, e.g. if you try to land your ship on another (docking on surface) which not only needs well designed ships, but a lot of fast reactions and a high level of precision.But 1320 hours on the Steam clock alone, is speaking for itself (many player have over 1000 hours and most have several hundred at least). My would be higher if I didn't also play it without steam (own also the DRM free EDU version) a lot of times (probably another 1000 hours).And there are still things in this game I haven't done, and still wan't to do.(Next up in my career play through: Catching an asteroid before it is hitting the surface)When the game is too hard for you, then there mods that make things easierSome simply reduce the amount a math you have to do (trial and error only get you so far, so you need math to get where you want),some play parts of the game for you (not a fan of these mods, but some are tired of the launch process and automate it, some of these mods are not too bad, like kOS, which might start an interest in programming)When the game is too easy for you there are mods that makes it harder ...  a lot harder. It astonishes me every time how seemingly little changes can make a huge difference. Like adding in Life support, or a delay in research, rocket build time, and building upgrades.Bored of the stock parts? There are billions of other parts out there.(not much a fan of those either, because only little match the stock varieties, and many are over or under powered).Have a beefy PC? Though the stock game is looking good, there are mods out there that can make it astonishingly pretty. Though it has a huge impact on performance and memory use.and it might make knowlage fun!Looking for a gift that has a chance to get your child / grand child to learn physics and or math?Look no further!Update: It might also be availible in more languages than English, soon. (In case you are not an native English speaker yourself ... as e.g. I am)			"

								Half flight simulator, half sandbox game and half space exploration; it makes 1,5 and this game counts more than just 1.My best money spend so far. You can explore from purple to green planets, from exploding on launchpad to crashing into sun, for making rockets like nasa, well, flights are less like nasa, your rockets will be more like ''manned cruise missiles''.There's not a single thing that you can cannot explore. I learned a lot about orbits and physics, you'll realy feel like a real space engineer (or an idiot) after playing this game.It is simulator, but not boring simulator like other simulators, it is very exciting in every mission you launch is unique (except routine flights to spacebases).10/10, would buy again if had enough money			"

												This is one of my favourite games. Its simply amazing.KSP is walking the fine line between a space sciency simulation and a comicly slapstick just for fun and giggles game.Its harsh and unforgiving in the beginning, expecting you to know about the basic science of rocketry or fail over and over until you get it on your own. (Watch ScottManley tutorials if you want a head start) I had trouble in the beginning even getting into orbit around the planet (or keeping my rocket upright on the way there) - but now I am planing missions to other planets, landing and returning - sending unmanned rovers to explore - or even bringing asteroids back home.800 hours in and I feel like I am still just at the beginning.»Mün or bust« - unknown (prob.

								So im going to give you a short list of the pro's and cons and it will inevitably leave you with a sense of dread if this game is not already in your steam library (Shame on you!)==PRO's== Endless Fun Insane Modding Community As complex or as Simple as you want Has a career mode for those who need goals when things go just as you planned you get a giant smile on your face and when then go horribly wrong you get a bigger smile.==CON's== There is only so much in the time in a day to play this game, so if you only have 30 minutes a week to play you might have trouble getting into it. (But you should still buy it to support this awesome game) The game is not free (And it never should be.. buy it!) If you suffer from having only 2 hands and 2 eyes you may find it difficult to control and micro-manage a space research empire (Warp'ers Bewaaaaare)So thats my little list as to why everyone should own this gem of a game.

												Updated to release (1.0)[ Fun: 8 | Plot: 6 | CTRL: 7 | GFX: 7 | SFX: 7 | Stable: Yes | Replay: 9 ] [ Total: 8 ]+ Most bugs are gone+ Loads more to build and experiment with+ Feminine Kerbal's are here and they are just as dumb~ Some graphics and sound are still underwhelming~ Lacks a much needed tutorial~ Interface is still clunky, slow and filled with buttons you dont know are there~ Tough economics in Career can leave you penniless~ Still requires YouTube tutorials to find stuff out- Sponsorships are not easy to figure out- Bug sets building upgrades to $0 allowing instant upgradeWhat was already a solid game is solidifying into a final product. I'd love there to be some intro and cut-scenes to get us closer to our kerbalnauts. It's still not bug free and does have an air of indie/beta about it but this is one project that is being run correctly and has been a joy to support.-------------------------------------------------As of release (0.9B)+ Kerbal's are cute and fun to interact with (sent screaming into space)+ The complex physics of space flight is accessible+ Hugely sense of reward in achieving even small steps for Kerbal kind+ Lots to do and experiment with+ Regular updates and an active community of modders+ Sound already is fun and adds to the atmosphere~ Graphics are not phenomenal but are appropriate~ Loading times are unoptimised but nothing bad~ Some interfaces are unrefined but totally functional- Still in Beta so issues are forgiveable and probably being resolved- Tutorial leaves out useful info and needs expanding- Sponsorships are not easy to figure out and brokenWhat a hugely fun and charming game that demands your love and attention. You care about your dim lil Kerbal's and it's fun to see them flounder and succeed. The science is well packaged to be accessible and if you take the time to experiment and read around the subject it becomes all the more rewarding.Recommended for those who like space, science and being educated as they are entertained.Conclusion: 8/10. A work in progress you can invest hours of enjoyment in already.			"

Early Access Review
								Every once and a while I'd pick up a new videogame, play it for a few weeks, beat it, then put it down after it was over. That is the general pattern of gamers this day in age, where developers make a game with hopes that the player will get a good 7-8 hours of fun, then leave it satisfied and thirsty for more.Then I heard about a game called Kerbal space program in 2012. I watched the trailers and a few gameplay vids, and thought that this looks interesting enough to try out, maybe I'll get a weeks worth of gameplay out of it... oh boy was I wrong.KSP is an example of how a videogame can change the way you see videogames forever. It is revolutionary, it is inspiring, and it is educational; and it doesn't even have an objective! The player is given an entire solar system to explore via the utilization of their very own space program. It literally is 'Build, Fly , Dream.' No videogame seems to have figured out that the best way to keep a person engaged is to provide them with their OWN goals and the tools to reach them. You start KSP with no instructions, only a small tutorial on how KSP basically works. Then the game lets you do whatever you want. So what do players do? They invent a new challenge for themselves, like to make it into orbit. So the player keeps designing, building, testing and crashing, until they reach their goal. And OH BOY is it satisfying! You feel accomplished, like you've done something unique in your life and want to share it with the world. Then you see the Mun in the background and you say to yourself... ""I wanna go there next!"" So the player builds, tests, fails, retests etc until they get to their goal. This goes on for the rest of your gaming career in KSP. Wanna build a space shuttle? Go ahead! Wanna build a car? Go ahead. Wanna build an elevator? Go ahead. Wanna build ANYTHING you want that actually WORKS via physics, this game lets you. It is the ultimate expression of engineering, creativity and the human spirit. I cannot sing this games praises enough. I picked it up in summer of 2012 and have played it EVERY. SINGLE. DAY since then. And if the stock game becomes too easy... why not try some of the communities mods? Everytime you download a new mod, you basically get a new game with more toys to build and design with. I don't need any other game other than this one. Thank you Squad for reinvigorating my hope in videogames! 10/10 and it's not even finished yet!Bravo!			"

												Kerbal Space Program version 1.0.2.  I've been playing the early access game for over 2 years, but now that it became official I thought I'd write a review.  My review is very positive.   (But see the caveat about version 1.0 below at the bottom).(Full disclosure: I don't work for SQUAD but I do help write one of the mods for the game, so I am personally invested in this.)Get This Game.  For once a sci-fi game that is actual sci-fi and not science fantasy.  It doesn't insult the intelligence of the player, and it speculates what-if, in a relatively reasonable way, only breaking a few laws of physics here and there where needed for gameplay, rather than breaking ALL of them constantly like most space video games do.Kerbal Space Program as history:Although the solar system in the game is artificially smaller than would realistically be possible (so it doesn't take as long to get things done as it really would), it still has all the parts and the right places to emulate historical real-world space programs.  Don't be fooled by the cute derpy-looking Kerbals - you can use the game to see what it would be like to emulate historical actual space missions - space stations in low orbit, docking maneuvers, performing an Apollo-style ""Mun"" landing, send rover probes to ""Duna"" (which is Mars-like), and so on.  All from gluing together parts and having fun.(And if you really want to go all-out, there are user community mods out there that replace the game's solar system with the real thing, so you can really try these missions out in full size).Kerbal Space Program as a 'tycoon' style game:If you like the old style 'tycoon' games where you have to come up with a means of keeping your business afloat and research new technologies to do interesting things as you move on to bigger and more ambitious projects, then Kerbal Space Program Career Mode is for you.  Start up a new game, pick ""career mode"", set Normal or Easy difficulty (do NOT use Hard until you've played a while), and you'll have the fun of trying to balance funding (for making better space center buildings, and for making the rockets themselves), reputation (for making future offers you see be better for you), and science points (for buying your way up the tech tree).  Accept contracts, and try to fufill them cheaply so your space agency makes money from them to fund the other stuff you want to do.   Don't fail them or else you'll lose funds and rep for it.Kerbal Space Program as a mod platform:From it's early access days, a user community of modders has grown, such that you can do just about anything you can think of with the game.  As of this writing, because KSP 1.0.2 is relatively new, some of those mods won't work just yet, but they will after only a week or two.  If past use is anything to go by that's about how long it takes for the modders to catch up to a new release.  As Steam is not the only means of obtaining the game, and not even the first means of obtaining it, the company, SQUAD, has chosen not to support Steam Workshop for mods due to the way it would open up the chance for people to make Steam-only mods that would be unfair to those who bought the game in its early days and supported the company before the game was even on Steam.  I support this decision, but it does mean you'll have to take a few extra steps to find the mods and install them.  Look up ""KSP"" on curse.com and look for Kerbalstuff.com.  most mods are in both places.Kerbal Space Program as ""edutainment"":The game is quite educational, but in that good sneaky fun way, where you don't realize you're learning - you're just trying to get stuff done in the game and in so doing learning stuff along the way.  If you've got a teenager or pre-teen at home, give this to them.  It does something that is really hard to do - it *demonstrates* though gameplay how a mathematical concept works, visually, without revealing the actual formulas, in such a way that the hard math can come *after* the intuitive understanding.  Usually what makes math hard is that the understanding and 'feel' can't happen until *after* you understand the numbers.  But here, it lets you play with the phenomenon first, and understand it later after its behavior has becomine intuitive to you, rather than the other way around.Get. This. Game.A caveat:My review refers to the 1.0.2 version of KSP and emphatically NOT to the 1.0 initial release that came out a week before and had a critical re-entry bug.  Had I written the review about the 1.0 version, it would not have been as kind.  The 1.0 release was rushed by about a week.  The 1.0.2 release from a week later was MUCH better, and is probably what should have been the 1.0 release.R.E. The KSP 1.0 re-entry bug:  You may read reviews by people complaining about re-entry being broken when 1.0 game out.  Those reviews weren't wrong *at the time* they were written.  KSP 1.0 was rushed out with a re-entry bug that was very unfair, and importantly, really obvious so it's hard to imagine how they missed it.  Adding a heat shield actually *caused* the ship to blow up on re-entry because adding it made the vessel flip nose-first, rendering the heat shield worse than useless as a part.  If you see reviews complaining about this behavior, be aware that they are stale and referring to an old version. "

Early Access Review
								I absolutely love this game.  When I first started playing however, I did not.  I kept hopping in for an hour or so and attempted to play, never getting much done.  This went on for the first 30-40 hours I played the game.  In theory it seemed like a cool game I would like, but I could not get past the learning curve with my limited playtime.  Finally I quit playing an MMO and really sunk my teeth into KSP.  With the help of Scott Manley  and his amazing tutorials I started to really understand what in the world I was doing.  After my tutorial spree I spend time playing with different mods and ultimately unlocked the tech tree in science mode.  Then for the first time I played in career mode.  For me it was a different spin on how I played and it hooked me back in again.  As of now, I can send spacecraft to other planets, land on them, do some science, and return to Mother Kerbal without killing anyone (usually).If you think you might like it, try the demo, watch some of Scott Manley's tutorials, check out the KSP subreddits, but most importantly give yourself some time to know what in the hell you are doing!

												It's okay for a couple hours.*Update*So, all jokes aside, I felt like it would be good to give this review a little more effort to make it more useful for people considering the game.   This is a game I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to anyone who has interest in space or exploration. You will learn how NASA and other space agencies perform maneuvers such as orbital rendezvous and Hohmann transfer orbits. Unlike some games that have been claimed to ""have potential"", this is a game where you discover YOUR OWN potential for planning and finding creative ways to accomplish tasks.    Vehicle construction works like Legos and is very intuitive. The modding community is HUGE and there are lots of tools that make designing the perfect vehicle easier, such as delta v and thrust to weight ratio calculations. This sounds educational, and it is, but it is incredibly fun and gives an immense sense of accomplishment when you learn how to reach your next milestone. The feeling of landing on another celestial body the first time is an unparalleled sense of satisfaction.    This is Early Access done right. The game is fantastic and has infinite replayability. This is the most bang (literally) for your buck you will get out of any game. In the words of Scott Manley, ""Fly safe.""			"

												The best thing about Kerbal is when your crazy plans actually pan out. For example, (before they added the claw) one of my ships was stranded in high-orbit with no fuel. It was carrying valuable science, but had no docking port. So, I built a rescue ship with a big metal butterfly net to capture the stranded ship manually, and bring it safely home. That ♥♥♥♥ worked.In KSP, you ♥♥♥♥ up. The fun part is thinking of ridiculous plans to un-♥♥♥♥ up.			"

PROs ""You have a solar system, a box of rocket parts and a race of suicidal green men who love exploring and explosion and your mission is to help them."" Rocket science made easy: KSP is the easiest way to understand and learn about everything space related, from designing and building rockets or planes to orbital mechanics, docking and rendezvous and the means of traveling to other celestial bodies. An overwhelming depth: Let's be honest - your first attempt at launching a rocket will be disastrous and you won't go anywhere even close to space. But from failures you will learn, to arise from the ashes and achieve more and more greater stuff. Soon you will be on your first suborbital-trajectory, have your first Kerbal astronaut in space and so on and so on; and yet you have no clue of the possibilities that await you. But with logic and lots of explosions (trial&error seems to be a leading motive at the Kerbal Space Center) you will always advance somehow. Be rewarded for your achievements: KSP does not have integrated achievements that tell you what virtual master piece of a task you just completed, and yet everything you accomplish feels more fulfilling than it ever felt before. You are behind the success or failure of whatever you do. A humorous touch: Very early in the game you will realize that those small green guys (that are somehow in the fashion of the minions of Despicable Me) you command are very keen to progress in their space program. They are also a little bit clumsy and as you can imagine the combination results in a lot of explosion, but Kerbals like nothing more than explosions and therefore failure will never feel devastating.   A devouted developer: Squad, who is responsible for KSP, is working hard to improve their game continiously. What started years ago in an early alpha version of the game has developed contionously and even now, after the official release, there is a steady flow of updates, additions and fixes. Similar to Skyrim the game is easily moddable and has a tremendous amount of mods that are easily installable and often high-quality.CONs ""We're gonna need a rescue mission""You will lose: This game is definitely no game that guides you from A to Z like many other newer games do, and on your journey there will be loss of material - parts, rockets and Kerbals. But this is just part of the experience and the process of learning. The in-game tutorials offer you a sufficient start and if you further want to increase your knowledge and limits there is always the possibility to watch videos or read guides - both of those are out there in great quality!

												I bought this game after trying the demo and having a lot of fun with it.  I've played KSP off an on for a few years. The game has a very active mod-making fan base and this opens up a lot of new avenues for play.  My best review of this game is anecdotal.  (I sent this to a friend when I was only a few hours into play.  I had no mods installed and was still very much learning the basics. Anyone who plays KSP might find this story relatable.)""One of my test flights put 3 Kerbals into orbit. They were low on fuel so I did a retrograde burn to bring them home.  Except that I didn't do a retrograde burn, I did a prograde burn.  By the time I realized it, I had burned too much fuel to get them home.  I reduced their orbit as much as possible, even using all available monopropellant from the thrusters.   They were stuck in an elliptical orbit over 100km from the surface at their lowest point.  With no way to return to the surface under their own power, I had one option; a rescue mission.I built a new ship, one with sufficient fuel to achieve orbit and maneuver to intercept the lost ship which I dubbed ""Lost Eagle.""  Lost Eagle had been fitted with docking collar and I guess that was just fate because it was now my goal to use that in the rescue effort.   The rescue craft went through several iterations and multiple aborted attempts at rescue.  The final design of the craft contained a single seat cockpit and a 4 seat hitchhiker pod which was used for it's relatively low weight.  This would end up being the ultimate design flaw.   It was my goal to grab the 3 stranded crew members, and transfer the rescue pilot to the pod before re-entry.  Docking is hard.  I would say impossible but I've seen videos of people doing it and I know it can be done.   But despite many hours and multiple misses. I had got Rescue 1 and Lost Eagle lined up next to each other about 200 meters away.  I closed enough distance that I felt it would be close enough to 'jump.'The first crew member from Lost Eagle jumped from his old ship to the new one.  It went pretty smoothly, but in the process the ships drifted further apart.  I did a corrective burn on Rescue 1 to get them closer together and jumped the second crew member.  Success again.   1 left.   He jumped, this time from the furthest gap.   He too arrived successfully.  I felt a rush of success, a feeling of accomplishment frequently lost in today's video games.    Plenty of fuel for the retro burn.   They were coming home.  This process had taken hours and this was the payoff that would make it worth while.The design of the re-entry craft was basically a can that held 4 crew with 4 radial parachutes coupled to a single seat inline cockpit with a shielded docking collar on the tip.  She wasn't pretty, but she was light and efficient.  The plan was to transfer the pilot to the reentry craft before they hit atmosphere, but I had discovered that I couldn't deploy the parachutes from the re-entry craft.  It was a problem I had known about since earlier iterations of the craft but I was willing to work around the problem by deploying the chutes without decoupling the cockpit.  The whole thing still landed successfully in my tests.At 5000m above the surface, having survived re-entry. I pressed the spacebar to activate the chutes.   I don't know if I double tapped it or if I had just had my staging backwards, but when I hit the space bar the cockpit split off from the hitchhiker can.  Knowing full well that there was nothing I could do to save the pilot of Rescue 1 I watched in horror for a second as it hurtled to the ground with no possibility of survival.  I quickly switched to the other part of the ship.  I tried manually clicking on the parachutes to deploy them.  The hitchhiker module contains nothing but chairs.  No controls that could be used to deploy the chutes.  Again I watched in horror as the 3 rescued kerbals hurtled towards their doom, the exile in orbit seeming to be safe alternative to the instantaneous death that awaited them at hundreds of meters per second.  The game would have let me revert to the launch of the mission, or even the assembly area where I could have redesigned the rescue craft that had doomed these 4 brave kerbals.  I chose not to.  I was angry at myself for the mistake. I had invested so much time into this and laziness had prevented me from fixing what I knew was a flawed design.  The empty ship, Lost Eagle remains in its orbit a floating monument and constant reminder to any Kerbal that looks up, that taking the easy path or acting haphazardly can have terrible results.  I will be reminded of this every time I play the game."" "

												I've only had this game for a month and I've already logged over 50 hours into it. Kerbal Space Program is NOT simply a game about building rockets, launching them, and seeing where they go. Its tagline is ""Conquering Space Was Never This Easy"", and that is true, it is easy, compared to doing it in real life. But don't let it fool you- KSP actually has a pretty steep learning curve. In the month that I've had this game, I've only just gotten my first satellite into orbit of Kerbin (KSP's version of Earth). I haven't even gotten to a single moon or other planet. But don't let that deter you. Look up tutorials for the game (Side note- The in-game tutorials are actually pretty terrible. I recommend finding ones online, such as Scott Manley's, who does a great job of explaining how the game works). The sense of accomplishment you get when you do accomplish those tasks- even if it's just setting up a simple probe like I did- is phenomenal. And from what I've seen, once you do manage to master the game, you can do basically anything. Never give up.All in all, Kerbal Space Program is not just a game. It's a lifestyle.10/10			"

												Possibly the best purchase of a digital product I have ever made.Pros -* Educational, but in an optional and completely natural manner.  * Makes light of a terrifying subject matter.* A true sandbox with no invisible walls or assumptions made about your competency.* A fairly accurate and interactive physics system with tools to help you use it.* Almost everything in the game can explode, melt or die, with game options to prevent it.* Might start you on a new found interest in real world space exploration.* Extensive, active and competent modding community.* Development / bug fixes continue long after official launch of the game.Cons -* The ingame universe feels a bit dead, as there are no cities or npc's. Only a scattering of easter eggs.  That said, you probably will not spent too much time actually on planets running around (the planets are about 1/10th scale, which is still HUGE) and so might not notice.*** Updated post 1.1 release ***			"

												In my Steam library, there are about a half dozen games that are in a special category called ""All Time Greats"". Civ IV is there. Skyrim is in there. KSP is in there.Note my play time does NOT include the 50-100 hours I put in before the game was ever on Steam.Simply one of the best products in the last decade, KSP is not your typical ""game"". It's a software toy. You tinker. You experiment. You adjust. You tweak. And you have a grand time doing it. KSP is not a game that is going to hold your hand and help you build a super-deluxe space rocket that can go to the Mun or Eve with ease. If it did that KSP would not be any fun. Besides, if someone wants that Buzz Aldrin's Space Race is available for sale on Steam. Instead, you get better at the game. You develop an understanding of Newtonian Physics - more than you ever thought you would. You build massive rockets and undertake interesting expeditions. You'll grin the first time you get a rocket into orbit. You'll pump your fist when you land on the Mun for the first time. And you'll continue having fun.What are you waiting for? Go buy it!			"

												Me and my friends take this game way to seriously. Practically had a functioning mission control room durring a LAN party. Came to the point where our first successful touch-down on the mun felt like we won the lottery. It was amazing.This is a great game for anyone looking for:1: A fun simulator and not the boring ones that drag on2: A great way to channel creativity and problem solving3: Something to feel proud aboutGreat game, was once unsure about the price tag but looking back I wouldn't change a thing.

												As goofy as the game seems, you will NOT find a more in depth and accurate space flight simulation out there yet.At first, it's fun to build explosive and cobbled together monstrosities to launch into space and send crashing back to the ground, but then you learn the basics. Then suddenly a successful Mun landing becomes a point of pride and the next planet over becomes your new goal.The career mode starts you with simple parts, to be expanded through scientific discoveries and contractual financial incentives.

												Kerbal Space program is my 2nd most favourite game of all time. I always have loved building things. I love realism and I love the idea of space travel. It covers all these aspects and more! Better yet, you can mod the game to make it even more amazing. There is many hundreds of hours of gameplay to be had here. The Kerbal Space Program (KSP) game community is massive. With so many mods available, the game can easily be surpassed with more gameplay experiences such as Mechjeb or FAR (Ferram Aerospace). So when game updates, it can break your ship builds if the mod isn't updated. Some mods are not updated for months. That's about the only downer really. I would have liked multiplayer as a feature but it may be added in the future. Only time will tell.Pros:>> Building your own space ships.>> Realistic stock physics. Can be upgraded with a mod called FAR>> Exploration. Game can be played in sandbox mode a bit like minecraft.>> Game actually teaches you orbital mechanics. NASA use this game to teach people about space.>> Uses a recent build of the Unity engine so graphics are pretty decent.>> Sound track is good for an indie game.>> Many many hours of gameplay to be had.>> Flight controls are good once you get accustomed to them. You can use joystics too.>> Interface is useful, ie navball, fast forward, setting waypoints etc...>> The KSP Forums are helpful where people share designs and talk about mods etc...Cons:>> Saving and loading is a bit confusing.>> Could use a better navigation system. Ie hard to locate runway when landing or locating a waypoint on the map.>> Takes away a lot of your real life time. You could spend 8 hours on this game and not even realise the time had gone by.>> Some mods are so damn awesome that you become dependent on them. Recommended mods:B9 Aerospace parts pack.B9 Procedural wingsEngineer Redux (To show you more info as to what's going on)Ferram Aerospace Research (Adds advanced simulated flight physics)MechjebI bet there are hundreds of other amazing mods out there for this gameI give this game 9.5 out of 10			"

												Kerbal Space Program, AKA ""One Thousand Ways to Definitely NOT build a rocket.""Coming from a physicist, I love this game, and all of my physics/math/CS/engineering friends love it too.  Granted that's a pretty narrow selection of people, but judging from all the other good reviews, I'd say our opinions reflect the general consensus.You should buy this game.  Then you should go tell everyone you know about it.  Then maybe public opinion on space exploration will get a bit of a nudge back toward where it belongs.			"

								A sandbox in space shouldn't technically be possible so the career mode may suit you better. If building massive rockets with a belligerent and indifferent attitude to gravity, maths and science is your thing you can do that.You might want to create sophisticated engineering marvels with all kinds of equations about dV, TWR.Discover boffin level science and pretend to be cool as the family wonders why you're counting backwards, loudly? Prefer to be a nerd on steroids?Maybe watching little green Kerbals grinning stupidly as you perform amazing feats of...... crashing is your thing. Perhaps planning a 3 day serious rescue mission to collect said crashed Kerbals is even better.Lack of knowledge about rockets, gravity, physics is helpful. Comprehensive knowledge about rockets, gravity, physics is also helpful.Only your imagination can stop you!  Oh, and gravity, fuel shortages, poor orbital transects, hard surfaces and bad designs.If you know what Skylab was, what Voyager is and you are fully aware that ISS is not some new FPS shoot-em-up, Kerbal Space Program is for you.

								This game will teach you more about physics than any bloody school.Starting off, my ships all exploded on the launchpad. Eventually, though I managed to get a ship to 10.000 meters up in the air before it fell back on the ground, killing everyone within. ''That'', I thought, ''was the greatest thing I have ever done.''Fast forward a week or two later, and I have already mastered orbiting, have landed on the Mun, Duna and Eve and am ready to set up my first refueling space stacion and send a rover to Duna.This game pumps more adrenaline into my veins than any FPS out there, and is probably the most rewarding game I have ever played. Landing your first ship will make you jump, I promise you that.The only downside is that there are some fairly annoying glitches, for example, warping time in atmosphere ♥♥♥♥s your ship up badly, but they don't appear all that often. Definetly a must buy.			"

												I consider KSP a staple of my collection - and one of my favourite games of all time. One of the first (maybe the first) games I backed as an early access project, before that was even really a thing.If you love to build, simulate and generally enjoy space - then you'll enjoy KSP. The building is fantastic, and there's a healthy modding community that make it all the better.There are things I don't like about it though. I think that it could be prettier. I think that the UI could be slicker. Generally it could do with more polish. I'm OK with the fact that it's a fantasy (for want of a better term) setting, it's probably a better game for it, but it won't be for everyone. I know I'd prefer Elite Dangerous meets KSP - but had that been the ambition it'd likely have fallen short - maybe KSP 2 :)			"

Kerbal Space ProgramI started off with this game quite some time ago, back in the days when Kerbin was still neon green and all the fuel tanks were an ungodly blue color. I feel like the time has finally come for me to offer some decent feedback on this title, so that others know what to expect.GraphicsThis game isn't very impressive visually, and while its art style is mostly consistent that doesn't change the fact that it suffers from both somewhat low resolution textures and a general lack of detail. For example, the lack of settlements on the Earth-analogue planet. I won't criticize it too heavily, though. While orbiting a planet or moon, the game does shine quite nicely - literally, as the sun rises over your celestial body of choice. Despite its flaws, it definitely gets the job done better than its closest relative Orbiter[orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk], and one should keep in mind that it is an indie title. There's enough detail here to be satisfied, and that's without installing modifications.

AudioThe in-game audio design is decent, but it gets repetitive eventually. The explosions are particularly satisfying. The music is calming, but also gets extremely repetitive after some time. I would suggest modifications, or to mute it and put your own music on instead. There isn't a ton to talk about here.PerformanceThis game's performance has improved considerably lately. Previously, I would've had a bone to pick with Kerbal Space Program, but it has made a turn for the better in the past year or so. It still won't run on just any PC, but even unimpressive laptops can run it on low settings fairly comfortably. I should note that performance is highly dependant on what is currently happening in-game. If you construct a large ship, the framerate will drop due to physics calculations. Also, the newest version of the game has some issues with regards to bugs and glitches, so you might want to wait for another patch or else revert back to an earlier version via Steam Beta.GameplayThis title is in a league of its own with regards to gameplay. I'm still not sure that I've ever played anything like it. It features (mostly) realistic orbital physics and revolves around a sandbox building experience where you construct virtually anything - ranging from space shuttles to fighter craft to rovers... even to boats - out of rocket and aircraft parts. Some people will spend all their time using aerodynamics mods to create realistic aircraft designs, others will recreate historical rocket missions. Some might colonize another planet, and others might just spend most of their time crashing into the ground or fumbling as they try to understand how space really works. No matter what you like doing, there's almost certainly something for everyone with Kerbal Space Program. If you're up to the challenge, you can even begin a career managing a space program, accepting contracts and missions to fund your launches. In my opinion, the only game that comes close to rivaling this title's gameplay is Orbiter, and that title is a much more in-depth space flight simulator that does not allow building your own ships out of different parts. Note that the game has no multiplayer as of this review's publishing.

Community ContentThis game is absolutely phenomenal with its community content. From its humble beginnings, the aeronautical parts in-game were directly inspired by a modification, and the author of that mod was later hired by Kerbal Space Program's development team. There are now mods for everything. Realistic aircraft engines. Weaponry, ranging from machine guns to ballistic missiles. Careful recreations of historical spacecraft. Complete remakes of the physics system to be extremely realistic. In-game computer systems that will do things for you. Audio and visual modifications that completely change how the world looks. And, of course, complete overhauls to the Solar System, bringing things to the scale of real life. The game doesn't even have multiplayer, and someone took the time to code a fully functional mod to make it happen. The possibilities for community-driven content are endless in this game, and more is created every day.VerdictThis game is a perfect example of everything right in PC gaming, and is probably one of my favorite titles on Steam. I gained a better understanding of orbital physics from it than I did by reading about orbital physics in textbooks and encyclopedias, and I still marvel at all the possibilities in this game. It is simply incredible how it has progressed from its Early Access days, and despite its flaws, and the questionable decisions made by its publisher, it is a fantastic title that I recommend everyone try.I recommend Kerbal Space Program.

												""Kerbin, We have a problem...""                  -Bill Kerman in the command pod next to Jeb, who opened the hatch during re-entry. First of all, I played this game for a LONG time, way before the 1.0 release (not on steam, no)To be honest, the is probably the best game I ever played in my whole life. I mean, I'm an astronomy nerd for almost 9 years and trust me... This is real space travelling. This game will entertain you for the rest of your life and if you like astronomy/airplanes or looking at a star during night at all, this game can't go wrong. This game allows you to play in 3 different modes and the ultimate goal is to explore different bodies and complete researches. However, the 3 different levels has their own way of fun too. So, the basic mechanic of the game is you put together a craft in ANYWAY you want and with ANY PARTS you want! Then, you do the calculations for a specific mission (or not). They you fly it! You can build a plane and fly around, or build a rocket to go visit the different planets and the moons in the system! You can actually do anything you want in the game, capture and asteriod, dock to make a station or go mining on the Mun. So, learn REAL rocket science by starting this game!Now... 11/10 would complete a Jool all-moon landing mission and forget to bring parachute when going back to kerbin12/10 would attach a solid booster to a VTOL13/10 would unorbit a space station that I built for 10 month just to see the solar panels snap14/10 would spend 200 hours of the game calculating and design a ship so that it will glich through Jool15/10 would spend 2 hours trying to make a kerbal dance on the Narrow-Band Scanner (you can do that)16/10 would blast a kerbal with a kerbodyne engine to let it fly 17/10 would script edit and make the sperators have 10,000,000 ejection force and name it ""velocity injector""18/10 would slingshot around all the moons in Jool and glich through Jool, launching yourself at 5,144,255,345m/s19/10 would build an aircraft carrier then attach a F22 to it and build a aircraft catapult using the ""velocity injector"" (it crashed, the plane, not the game!)20/10 would 9/11 the VA... I mean nothing 21/10 will play kerbal for the rest of my life!Now, with the new update of 1.2, new communication networks and etc. The game got even better and even cheaper! So, with the 1.2 update, IT'S WORTH YOUR 23 BUCKS! And I think I made myself LOUD AND CLEAR!haha... okay... get it?			"

												This game is nothing short of amazing. While seemingly simple at first, the game quickly shows how much it has to offer. There is a whole solar system for you to discover, planets to land on (and attempt a return from) in the stock game, and with a large and active modding base, the combinations for rocket types and adventures are endless. The game also gives you a far better appreciation of the difficulties, challenges and indeed triumphs of actual space programs, past and present. From various types of custom built rockets, space planes, space stations, and installations on other worlds that can be constructed, Kerbal reminds us how good games can be, and is a game that will definitely not leave you disappointed and keep you coming back for more and more, as the amount of sleep you get dwindles away.

								This is quickly becoming one of my favourite games of all time. There's a steep learning curve, but your reward for persistence is hours and hours of non-stop fun.The developers constantly update the game with new parts, better campaign mode, and eventually new worlds to explore.This is the best $25 youll ever spend.

												You know, when I first saw this game way back in early access, I thought, ""Cartoony, throw away game, not worth the effort."" But, then I researched a little, and watched a couple of episodes on youtube detailing game play.I was more than intrigued. I bought the game in what was called early access beta, but it was already pretty polished. I think that was in versions .6 or so? I became OK and landed on Mun and Minimus several times. Many, many times, actually, and maxed out science just by going to Mun and Minimus and getting every biome.But, then I set the game aside. I didn't want to be burned out on it before it actually left Beta. I recently returned and almost ragequit. Many things have changed. Everything I thought I knew, I had either forgotten or didn't work anymore. I have played it a lot the last few days. I have had a lot of successes and a lot of failures, but I am essentially back to where I was before I quit. The learning curve is pretty steep. Do you want to just fly out of the atmosphere? Fairly easy to figure out. Do you want to fly to one of the moons, land, and then take off with the expectation of getting back to Kerbin (Kerbal's Earth)? It's going to take a lot more knowledge.I do recommend this game, but I have to agree with someone else. Unless you're an engineer by nature, you're probably going to need help at some point, because this game is not a child's game. It is tough, but rewarding.I try not to look at too much on youtube because I don't want to spoil it for myself, but I am to the point that it is going to take a drastic rethinking of what I'm doing, or I am going to need to watch tutorials to get anywhere out of Kerbin's orbit and get back safely. I sent an unmanned probe to Duna (basically Kerbin's Mars). I was not able to bring it back. Thankfully, no Kerbals were killed on that adventure.Yes, I'd say get this game. If you see it on sale, then grab it immediately. I guess I have put 170 hours in to it. I'll probably put thousands into it before it is all over.			"

 Overview Utterly fantastic space simulation game. I cannot recommend this game enough, it has brought me hours of fun and has really managed to enable me to rediscover my personal passion for space exploration. There are three main game modes: Career, Science, and Sandbox.In Career mode you take control of your own space program and must manage administrative, financial, and logistical aspects of your space program. There is a detailed research system for unlocking new technologies to use in your spacecraft. You will take contracts from various organizations, earning money upon completion. These contracts will get progressively more challenging and rewarding as you advance your space program.In Science mode you are free from the financial and administative burdens of career mode but are still faced with having to research technology for your spacecraft. You progress along the tech tree by performing various science experiments on your home planet and various other celestial bodies, with experiments performed in more distant and challenging environments granting more beneficial rewards.In Sandbox mode you are free to build and explore whatever you like and are not limited by any tech tree or financial limits. Positive Aspects +In-dept and accurate space simulation with realistic physics and particularly noteworthy orbital mechanics.+Very challenging and rewarding gameplay.+Wide variety of celestial bodies to explore.+Ability for player to choose from a selection of pre-built spacecraft or construct their own using a very intricate construction system featuring a large variety of parts to choose from.+Features unmanned probes aswell as spacecraft piloted by Kerbals.+Optional communications system for unmanned probes which require them to have a connection to mission control. This adds an additional layer or difficulty and realism to the unmanned space program, allowing for the construction of satellite communication networks around the star system.+Excellent community.+Large amounts of superb mods available.+Very large explosions.+New features are still being added by the developers. Neutral Aspects ~Planets, although  very  large, are not realistically large.~Celestial bodies are (somewhat accurately) extemely empty and desolate, with few surface features apart from a few rocks or trees  and a few easter eggs here and there... ~Does not feature any real form of pre-made story (though the player is free to make their own).~Does not feature any online functionality or multiplayer.~Has a very steep learning curve, particularly for players with no previous knowledge of orbital mechanics or astrophysics, though a wide variety of  excellent tutorials  easily available.~Unfortunatley lacks Steam Workshop support as of the time of writing. Negative Aspects -Not a particullarly good looking game. (Personally, I use a variety of mods which make the game look  utterly beautiful [forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com].)-Can have some performance issues when dealing with extremely large spacecraft. (significatly improved as of the 1.2 update)-Some may consider the game to be a bit too expensive. Conclusion Overall, I would thoroughly recommend this game to anyone with an interest in space, adventure, or very large explosions. In my opinion, no other game can give you the same amazing feeling as when you first land kerbals on the moon (Mun). This game has brought me so much fun, and I simply love it.			"

												This game should be said its for those that have atleast some Engineering or Scientific side to themselves.Yes you go to space, if you can design your own rocket to get there.But Kerbal Space Program is more then just rocketry, you can build space stations, rovers, space planes, and even some other unimmaginable things I haven't listed.Or if you want, you can build some contraption to see how far you can launch a Kerbal, really the choice is yours.There are tons of mods for the game, some are far better then others.   A whole variety of game changing mods from mechanics to realism or even down right silly.Yes its not really for everyone, its not ""fast-paced"" at all but it is challenging to those of us who can design things and face defeat when we fail at designing (or just revert to assembly).Can you get to the outter most planets on KSP?Since the newer versions of KSP, We've also been able to do science things and manage our budgets and even play with asteroid capturing.   And they're still working on adding even more to the game.The only real con I have about the game is that it doesnt like to run with massive/intricately designed items.  But thats just a physx limitation, and a proper Physx card will fix most of this issue (to an extent).			"

												Mission Control asks me to put a craft into orbit.Third attempt, looks like Jeb's gonna be just a little short on fuel again.Burns all his fuel because he's not gonna make orbit anyway.Realizes that he did in fact achieve Orbit.Mission Control informs him that they didn't tell the recovery team Jeb was staying in space, so they are still looking for him.Jeb is about to resign himself to being stuck in space when he has a bright idea.Climbs out of pod and uses monopropellent jetpack to attempt to push his pod into a decaying orbit.Succeeds on pushing pod into decaying orbit: ""Mission Control, I'm coming home!""Few minutes later, Jeb and his pod burn up on re-entry.R.I.P Jeb :'(Great game, I've had lots of fun with it so far, and reaching the mun's orbit is the farthest I've made it. There are some really cool mods for it too, I my personal favorite so far has been the SCANSAT mod. Also the whole presentation of the game is well done too imo, a lot of little details that really make it feel like the Kerbals are running the most incompetant space program ever. The incompetant space program feeling usually makes accidents more comical than frustrating, at least for me. It can be difficult to learn, but if you have the patience to learn it, it's totally worth it. At the ~$40 asking price it's worth more than 99% of AAA $60 games, imho.			"

Kerbal Space Program is a deceptively dense game hiding behind the cute green Kerbals that populate this space-age world. In Career mode you’re given a basic NASA-like facility. Buildings include Vehicle Assembly, Tracking Station, Mission Control, and a launch site that’s little more than a slab of concrete.Money is earned by accepting various missions, such as providing an orbital touring service, testing out new engine parts, and reaching the Mun. You can earn Science credits by succeeding in missions and using certain devices. Science is spent on a tech tree that unlocks advanced parts and components.A bunch of scenarios provide interesting challenges to work through, like returning a Kerbal from the Mun safely. There’s a ton of gameplay and replay value packed in.The heart of Kerbal Space Program lies in the Vehicle Assembly Building. The builder is intuitive and fun to snap together. You need to take heed of where all your parts go, and how your ship will steer. Decouplers eliminate empty engines and spare parts. Engines can be tweaked to carry a certain amount of fuel. Each device is activated through a staging sequence by pressing the spacebar before and during flight.Kerbal Space Program is rocket science. While the learning curve is rather steep, what the game sets out to do, it does extremely well.THE GOOD- Limitless creative freedom- Well designed, challenging career mode- Unbelievably impressive attention to detail- Incredible sense of satisfaction- Rewards persistence- Kerbals are hilariousTHE BAD- Mass amounts of information- A bit overwhelming at times- Default text size too small- Various camera modes can lead to nausea- A few graphical glitchesDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE			"

								When i was a child i dreamt of being a NASA engineer. Turns out i slacked off too much at school. Ah well. But i always had an interest in space, and particularly exploring it.This game gave me a sandbox to play in where i could design spacecraft and send little green men up into space above the blue earth... erm, i mean Kerbin. You know its always the little green men trying to visit earth in the movies. In this they cant get away quick enough. You know this game has something for everyone. Even if you do not have any real inclination to do anything so involved as perfect orbits, or landing perfectly on the moon (Mun) or whatever this game still gives you the chance to make crazy rockets that you can set off and see how far they get before it, and its possible inhabitants die a horrible, horrible death.And for those, like me who have a more involved interest in the subject matter, there is plenty that will satisfy you.Think you can do it better than NASA? Give it a go.For the price, you get a lot of play hours, and even some replayability. Check out the mods, also.			"

								I can honestly say that had this been in existence when I was younger [turned 42 today] I would have been able to fullfil my dream of being in space.  I know, sounds corny I'm sure but this app and it's game play takes me back to my youth where Astronomy and Space were most of what I could dream, think and talk about.  Roll ahead a few decades and this game gives me such a sense of freedom, accomplishment and challenge.  Sure it's geeky, nerd stuff but honestly what isn't these days?  Madden 2015? Sure, geeks playing pixels of sports greats they can never be like so I guess it's not far off. (lol)This 'game' as they call it will teach you things about the science, mathematics and common sense problem solving that could help you in your life.  I'm sure by this point you're saying 'But how will an orbit trajectory to Mun help me..?' and 'How is knowing the dV to escape the SOI of Kerbal going to help me..?' and you for one would be right.  These, while still teaching the literal effect in game, also teaches you about solving sometimes complex puzzles or math problems or those 'how could I even do that?' types of questions.  From the first launch, which in itself is not 'easy' by any stretch of the imagination; to the 100th, 200th and several thousandth launch later you want to do more and push further into space.  It's those types of feelings that mold and lead those younger generations to wanting and wishing they knew and could do more.  Much like an aging dreamer, who at his younger years had always dreamt of getting the chance to leave this floating rock we call home.Game is great.  You just have to dream a little more, want a little more and do a little more.TL:DR - Game is stupendous and anyone interested in space, space flight and rocketry with a keen sense of having fun all the while doing math, physics and all that wonderful science stuff without really knowing you are/can/will.~Icky			"

Plus, one of the best mod communities around; as someone else said, if the game is too hard there's a mod for that, if it's too easy there's a mod for that too. Want better graphics, helicopters, scriptable auto-pilots? Yep, mod, mod, mod.

Perhaps the greatest space exploration game there isAuthor's note: Upon reaching 100 hours in this game, I decided to write a lengthy review. Recently, however, I reached another milestone in the form of 400 hours. As such, I felt that the time was ripe to write a new, better review.I was born on the exact same day as the Mars Polar Lander was to touch down on the south pole of Mars. This NASA probe was going to broaden our knowledge of the red planet - not unlike countless other probes that had already visited - but this was, regrettably, not to be. Prior to landing, an error caused the craft to crash into the Martian surface at a high speed. Errors like this are common in Kerbal Space Program as well. We all know how it is: You've sent a lander-type probe or capsule through the Kerbol system, and at last, the target is right below you - be it the Mun, Duna, or any other solid object. At some point, you discover that there's not enough juice. Or not enough electricity to keep the baby under control. Or that there is enough fuel - but only for a landing. Which is fine if it's an unmanned probe, but good luck if you have three unlucky Kerbals on board. It's a good thing they cannot die of thirst, hunger, exhaustion or boredom. The interesting thing about KSP, however, is that these errors do not matter. You might have an impressive explosion on the launch pad, a complete failure while trying to leave the atmosphere, or a more annoying error - like the fact that your fancy satellite doesn't have enough batteries, or that you forgot to bring science instruments. But guess what? This game encourages you to try again. If you fail in this game, it will not shove you into a ditch and laugh. Rather, it will help you back up and tell you what went wrong. In Kerbal Space Program, it is quite simple to spot errors by experiencing them. And then, it is equally simple to fix that error with a small upgrade - say, an improved booster, or some extra batteries. Eventually, new problems will appear - and you fix those too. And through this trial and error, you get the perfect rocket at last.This is where the game suddenly becomes truly magnificent. For quite a lot of time, I didn't have any idea how to get my crafts into orbit. So I created a proper rocket, tried to figure out what went wrong the last times, modified the rocket accordingly, and then gave it a shot. Minutes later, a satellite is safely in orbit around Kerbin, telling me interesting things about the atmosphere and cheerily transmitting signals down to the surface. Obviously, I got a massive confidence boost because of this. You can probably guess what happened next: I put together a Saturn V-ish rocket and tried to send some (un)lucky Kerbals to the Mun. It didn't go as planned, to say the least: They all ended up burned or exploded, mostly the latter. So guess what I did? I went back to the drawing board, created a better rocket, took it through extensive testing, and then the day came. It was my own July 1969. Jebediah and Bill were now Neil and Buzz. And guess what? The Kerbin flag was planted firmly on the Mun, and my brave little Kerbonauts returned as heroes, becoming the public favorite for a future mission to Duna. But that's another story. Moving on from stories of trial, error, success and joy, it's time to look at what the game has to offer. As you've probably guessed by now, it's about building rockets and sending them into space. The wide range of parts, physics, planets and celestial objects allows you to create your own little NASA. Probes, space stations, capsules, landers, rovers and airplanes are all possible to design and cr- fly as you please. Why the ""Kerbal"" in the name? Well, this game takes place in a fictional planetary system with smaller planets, moons and distances. The Sun is named Kerbol, and orbiting it is Moho (basically Mercury), Eve (basically Venus), Kerbin (basically Earth, with humans being replaced by green-skinned, adorable Kerbals), Duna (basically Mars)...Yeah, you get the idea. The game has lots of planets and moons to visit, most of which are fully explorable. The game modes? You got three different modes, suited for different playstyles. Sandbox is simple: No progress, credits or reputation (we'll get back to that), but every rocket part and all upgrades available at no cost. If you enjoy building whatever you want with no consequences, Sandbox is fitting. Next out is Science. It works similarly to Sandbox, but with another interesting factor: You have to research and unlock new rocket parts by doing science. ""Science"" can be anything from taking a ground sample outside of your local space centre, or landing a rover on a distant planet to do geological surveys. The more interesting, the more science. The final mode is Career. In this mode, it's money-earning time. You start off as a small space agency with sheds instead of hangars and no capability to reach space whatsoever. So what do you do? There are three things that you need to focus on. First of all, science - we've already gone through that. Second, money. This is self-explanatory; earn money, buy rocket parts, build bigger and more expensive rockets, and upgrade your facilities - but how to earn money? This is where Reputation comes in.To put it simple: You earn Reputation by doing cool stuff and not messing it up - take a tourist into space, land a probe somewhere, et cetera. If you do mess up, you lose Reputation. Here's the fun part: Higher reputation means better Contracts. There are plenty of corporations that are willing to give you some money if you can satisfy their demands. Complete a contract, and get more Reputation, Science and money. Fail a contract? Yes, you guessed correctly. Now let's move back to space exploration. Let's say that you've done all your preparations, signed the necessary contracts, and launched some nice stuff into space. You got some satellites here and there, and even some Kerbals screaming for help at the Munar surface (let's pretend you have a rescue ship underway). Now what?Well, there's mods. This is one of the many areas where Kerbal Space Program really shines - mods. The game has an active, engaged modding community, and you can find a mod for just about everything. There's a mod that allows you to place a wall near your space center and have those pesky Kerxicans pay for it. Seriously, there is. But i'm not here to talk about that. Mods available include, but are not limited to: part sets with massive fuel tanks, engines and more; intricate, advanced space capsules for all your exploration needs; plugins that allow you to time your maneuvers, get better at docking or put things on autopilot; visual mods that give you enhanced skyboxes and magnificent atmospheres; whole new planets altogether that expand your frontiers greatly. And more. I could probably talk for hours about the various mods that are available, but I won't. I'll just say that most of them are amazing. If you're buying this game, make sure to grab a few mods. If you already have it, but don't use mods: Why?! If you have mods: Get some more mods. Mod it till it breaks, as some people would say.There are plenty of things that I have omitted from this review - mostly because I want to end things here. I could probably talk about the magnificence of docking, the beauty of well-placed orbital maneuvers or other things that could make a NASA engineer smile gleefully. For now, though, i'll advise you to place yourself firmly into the capsule and go into space. To summarize: Kerbal Space Program is an excellent space game that provides great experiences, combined with interesting gameplay and great mods, all while being a highly successfultake on sandbox, exploration and simulation alike. I can absolutely recommend it. "

												This game. Oh, this game. I had a review that i posted back in October 2014 that i deleted in order to post this one for more accuracy. The game reached full release yesterday, so i deleted my Early Access review for the sake of accuracy when i posted this one.First of all, i want to make this absolutely clear that this game is not easy. I put this here due to a thread i saw a day ago of a man demanding his £30 back because the game was too hard, and he had no interest in ""3d oval orbits, etc."" While this was a gross lack of research on his part, and mostly his fault, i still thought i'd put this here. Especially with the new aerodynamics model, this game is the closest thing we have to an accurate spaceflight simulator.This game is about launching small, disproportionate green men into space....In theory. That's how it works if you're good at the game. (Like me! (humblebrag))If you're bad at the game, like most newbies, it ends up being more like launching small, disproportionate green men a few thousand metres into the air, then atmospheric drag pulls you back to the ground and kills said disproportionate green men. Unless you believe they're plants, like i do, then they just probably regrow somewhere.Your first step will be learning to orbit, then going to the Mun, then Minmus, then basically wherever you please. The game allows you to construct rockets or planes, then fly them. There's tens of parts to choose from, and lots to do in the game, if you have a bit of patience. The game has numerous tutorials and scenarios to help you out with the basics.I don't want this review to drag too long, since everything i would tell you here is better explained by people like Scott Manley. (Check out his channel on YouTube if you're interested in this game! He has a few tutorials there, also.)TL;DR this game is great and if you have an interest in space you should get it. Wait for a sale if you don't want to shell out £30 on it. Also do not forget the fact the game has a demo that you should most certainly get if you're interested in the game. Last i checked the demo is WAY outdated, though, so don't see it as a complete representation of the game.UPDATE: I should stress that you need persistence. If you fail, try and try again. Don't give up!			"

Early Access Review
								With the level of improvements they've made with each point release, I imagine KSP is going to be the most awesome game ever made by time 1.0 comes out.   With the latest, .23, we see some massive load time improvements, far less lag with high-part-count vehicles, tweakables *in the ship editor* and best of all, only one of my mods had issues, but it didn't crash the game - it simply didn't function at ""go time"".  That's already been fixed, it just hadn't been released officially as of this time yesterday.If you like space ship games, you will want this game - it's pretty damned hard if you're coming in with zero experience with rocketry, calculus and / or orbital mechanics.  You'll walk away with some if you put in the effort in career mode in this game.  I have a far better understanding of how something gets into orbit - and far more respect for the men and women who engineer those feats.  If you like educational games, this one is for you as well - it's not for all kids, but I could see a bright middle school or high school student picking this up quicker than most adults.  And adults could all learn a thing or two by playing this game - NASA engineers play this game in their free time.And most importantly, if you like to tinker AND play video games, this game was quite likely made for you.  The mod system is incredibly simple to work with - but if you know the right languages, you can make whole new features in the game!At any price, $10 or $60, this is a game worth every penny - and it's not even done yet!UPDATE for Beta 0.90: Since this review was written, Career mode has been added, the old Career mode renamed to ""Science"".  In addition, further features have been added - Contracts, better joints, new parts, way easier navigation and the career mode actually feels like you're helping the Kerbals march their way to the planets!  You have to balance science with your contracts (money!) and grow things carefully.It truly is educational in every sense - engaging, teaching and adjusting.  This game is whatever you want it to be - the mod ecosystem is growing and with CKAN, it's even easier to install and remove mods with a push of a button.  Check it out if you haven't yet!			"

												I dare say that no other game features such a high-quality blend of sandbox fun, rewarding challenge and educational value. Realistic but fun, awe-inspiring but cute, this game ticks many unique checkboxes and should have a place in the collection of every gamer or fan of simulation games.

												This game is awesome. Seriously, it's really, really awesome. And it teaches you physics. So you pass your exams. Win-win.I feel like listing the pros and cons. Because that's what everyone else does. And it gives you a better idea of the game.PROS:- Physics: Explosive stuff explodes, stuff that looks like a plane flies (mostly), spaceships fly like spaceships, stuff that looks like a rover WILL flip over.- Visuals: The graphics are not as good as some games, but they are definitely good enough. I particularly like all the small details, like the way the RAPIER engine puffs before going out, or the cockpit details, or the little ridges on the engines, or the way the landing gear closes up.- Career Mode: Feels like you're really running a space agency, and you really feel worried when you crash a rocket into a building and don't have enough money to rebuild it.- Sandbox Mode: It's also nice to be able to say, ""Stuff it, I can't afford this, nor can I wait long enough to invent really powerful rocket engines! Give me everything for free!""- The way spacecraft just feel like they 'work': The difference between the different engine sizes, the weight distribution problems, the new aerodynamics model, everything theoretically 'works'. My spaceships don't actually work. They explode.- The difficulty: This game is hard. Very hard. But only if you make it so. If you stick to low-altitude flights and don't try to go to Jool straight away, this game is very possible to play. And slowly, very slowly, you'll get better, and be able to get to Jool.- Small green beings: Kerbals themselves are very cute. I want one. Anyone know where to buy a Kerbal Plushy?- Mods: When 1.0 was released, I deleted all my mods and started afresh, so I don't know if they still work. But in Beta, I was greatly enhancing my experience with mods like BDArmoury, B9 Aerospace, KW Rocketry, Chatterer (A completely useless but nonetheless fantastic mod) and Infernal Robotics.-Performance: This game doesn't need a supercomputer to run. I can run it fine on a six-year-old MacBook Pro, no problems. I do have the occasional lagspike when a lot is happening at once, and the framerate tops out at around 35 FPS on a good day, but it certainly ain't unplayable.Cons:- Difficulty: Yeah. I know. That was a Pro as well. But as I said earlier, some things are very hard. Like getting to Jool.- Lack of an autopilot: The game could do with someone who could fly. Because for a long time, you won't be that someone.- The load times: This game has a lot to load in, and it takes a long time.- Lack of stuff: This game has a lot of stuff, but could do with more.- Problems with adding stuff to wings: Elevons, Landing Gear, and engines are really hard to fix on properly.- Lack of smaller pre-built wings.So in conclusion, this game awesome. Really, really awesome. Totally fantastic. I love it.Thanks for reading!EDIT: I need to update a review of a game I nominated for the Steam Awards to get the badge, so I will say this: I have nominated this game for the 'I thought this game was cool before it won an award' Award.

												What starts out as a simple, often hilarious; almost lego-like rocket/spaceplane builder has an astounding depth when you look into the possibilities. The game features a great incentive for advancing your ambitions, science. Science is spent on new technology and parts for bolder missions, and is earned by pushing your boundaries. First, you can explore around you. Take samples, and crew reports from your cute crew of little green simpletons, then maybe you take a simple rocket to outer atmosphere for the first time, take a crew report and get home alive with a nifty parachute.. and Bam! More science. A new part, and the plot thickens..KSP begins as a goofy tinkering tool with rockets and develops into a full-blown space exploration and research SIM.Getting a rock sample from the moon may be one of your hardest gaming achievements, as it was for me, but doing it brings reward like little else. The planning, the development and trial/error makes KSP a great learning tool. It's even NASA approved. It uses real world physics and simulated drag for winged aircraft. It uses realistic orbital-mechanics for planitary manuevers, and players use realistic many real-life elements mission planning. Buy it for your kids, buy it for yourself. They'll enjoy goofing and experimenting; they might even get serious about it. Same goes for you; you will enjoy at least a few experimental flights/missions. Especially if they end in a giant explosion, as many early flights will. After that you might have a success or two, maybe a simple contract or research mission turns out to be easy and you start learning. Soon you'll have dreams of the stars.*****			"

								Kerbal Space Program.All you have to do is belive. You put in the effort, you succeed. Have faith in your project, and you will emerge victorious.HAHA. Just kidding. Most of my ships blow up before I even activate the engines.But really... This game... is the ultiamate sandbox. Anything it can't do, mods will make it do. For example, here is a list of some achievments to acomplish:*Damage a ship without even taking off*Blow up a ship while taking off*Crash into another ship while taking off*Launch shrapnell into the Kerbal Space Center*Blow up the Kerbal Space Center*Blow up nearby rovers*Accidently launch your take-off rockets upwards like a missile*Shoot down a satellite with said missile*Have satellite debris crash into your refueling station*Have said refueling station and attached ships fall into Kerbin atmosphere*Have said station and ships burn up in atmosphere and/or impact a solid or liquid surface at over mach two...and...*Forget about your Mun lander as it crashes into the surfaceThat list can be acomplished in once launch.Now, explain to me why you aren't installing it already?

												I've never written a review for a game on steam before, but I'm making an exception.Kerbal Space Program is a wonderful game, hands down, there have been problems underway.This game takes a lot of time to get good at, to understand how to do stuff. From getting above atmosphere or your first orbit, or landing on the Mün. Every one of those are achievements and something to be proud of. It is a game that is both challenging to get into and very satisfying when what you builds works as intended (Some explosions are okay).I'd recommend everyone who is looking for something new in their games to try this.

												So there I was, sitting in the metal death machine engineering came up with. My heart racing as control are counting down from 10 (not always in the correct order). It was my first flight, I didnt know any of these guys, and just right before I stared to cry the lead pilot Jeb told me, ""I've done this thousands of times over, you'll be fine."" There I was, sitting in this rocket, then just as control reached zero, the whole machine started to vibrate violently and we accelerated into the blue sky. I thought: ""Wow! This is amazing, I'm going to Duna!"". Then right when the ledgendary Jebadiah Kerman hit the big red staging button to go to stage 8, things took a turn for the worst. All of the sudden a huge bang shook the craft, fire everywhere, I saw my fell astronaut brethren fly through the sky from the exploded rover 2. Then a few seconds after the first explosion, another happend, and a stray booster scraped alongside the hull only to destroy the parachute. So there I was, freefalling in a metal can, I look over to Jeb and what I see is a smiling maniac with nothing but fire and evil in his dead eyes. Seconds before impact with the harsh unforgiving ground, I suddenly appear back at the launch pad.10/10 Would revert back to launch pad again.			"

The best simulation game ever!I played this game before it came on Steam, and I really love it!So I tought I should make a review because people need to know the hard truth about this game.First of all, let's take a look at the graphics..The game looks like some kind of a cartoon, which makes it really cool.I shouldn't have done it in any other way, it just made so unique.Than we got the possibilities.This game has an enormous amount of modifications you can add to your game, by easily dragging into a folder..With the mods your game get so much more intresting to play, with a million possibilities.Even without modifications the game is still amazing to play, with many things to discover.There is even a multiplayer modification which, of course, makes it posible to play together with friends, or just random people, and it's soo cool!The developers of the game are amazing too, they listen to their players and add suggestions to the game.Or sometimes add stuff to the game that has been inspired by amazing modifications.You can easily play this game the whole day without noticing the time flying, every time your ship crashes you are challenged to make a ship that actually can fly to the moon, and if it doesn't work you try again, and again and you guessed it AGAIN!Some people maybe think this is annoying but I think it's a good side of the game, instead of beating the game easily, you are challenged every time, in this way to get more into the game and learn more and more about real life space missions.You even got different things to do, you can do training missions or other kind of missions.You can start a carreer, play in sandbox-mode or even play in science mode, which makes it possible to both do research on planets for science points, and make ships using all the parts u want without unlocking them.You can go to soo many different planets, which are made so cool.They all got things like drag and stuff based on real planets, however some are changed a bit because it's still a game.For example, taking of at Kerbin - Earth requires you to have a ship with quite some power, while taking off at the Moon is much easier because of the gravity.There probably are some bad sides of the game, but I actually didn't discover those yet.However if you are using modifications they may sometimes don't work quite well together and sometimes make your game suddenly crash. - But this isn't the fault of the developers so don't blame them.If you want to see someone else's perspective of the game you should check out some other reviews, but my advice is to really buy this game if you like the things you see.I would also recommend to watch some gameplays on YouTube, and maybe if you want you should search the internet for Kerbal Space Program Mods to see what kind of modifications you could add to your game when you bought it.I will definitly keep playing this game for a long time and if I needed to give this game a mark, it would absolutly get a 10/10!

												As an engineer who was quite into astronomy as a kid, I LOVE this game, and it probably couldn't have been any other way. I mean : it is about ACTUAL space travel, how awesome is that?I'll recommend it, but there is one thing I can not stress enough : IT IS NOT FOR EVERYBODY.There are basically two ways to play that game : either you build crazy rockets in sandbox mode and you see if your random construction somehow achieves orbit OR you actually try to become a good (in-game) rocket scientist and launch a planned payload to a specific destination in the solar system.And to become such a rocket scientist  you will either need :College level math and physics, as well as a huge excel spreadsheetTo read and follow tutorials, and have a huge patience with trial and errorAnd... that's not exactly the conception of ""fun"" or a ""game"" to many people.Just to give an idea of why you need the ""school stuff"" : this game expects you to know what newtons are. (And no, those are not clones of a guy who took an apple on the head XD) It expects you to count speeds in m/s rather than km/h (just as a scientist does). You must also understand the concept of relative vector speed in a 3D environment... and many other things.The game features tutorials fortunately, but they only give the basics and you'll still have to learn most of the game by yourself.And even though the game simplifies a few aspects from reality (like for instance oxygen and astronaut's mental state management), on what it actually simulates it is ruthless : no fuel left after a 3 hour mission (for you, in the game, years have passed)? You miss your entry into the gravity field of a planet? You didn't launch your interplanetary mission on a correct date? Well, enjoy your newborn space debris! No way out of that except loading a past save. And this feature is not available on the hardest difficulty by the way.You might say : if you run out of fuel, it's because you messed up and you're bad, so it's normal to be punished. True.But this is why you pretty much need the math and the scientific expertise : to actually calculate if you have enough fuel BEFORE the mission, while taking into account a margin of error as well (because your manual-piloting manoeuvers will never be perfect).If you're fine with it, following a tutorial will allow you to build the spaceship suited to your mission and not worry about that. But I also believe it is kinda missing the point of the game.However, this scientific grounding and this high difficulty also come with a good side. Which is : when your plan unfolds as planned and you actually succeed, my God is it satisfying.I usually don't take screenshots of my games, but here when I actually managed my first moon landing, I just took so many. Because for once a game had made me feel proud. Yes, PROUD. And I have to say, it's the first time it has happened (at least to such a degree).The Kerbal Space Programl WIKI is very well made can help a lot by providing you with already-simplified mathematic formulas, preventing you from having to demonstrate those yourself. It could help people less familiar with math and physics to achieve more with the game and actually feel proud as well. The game also features lots of mods, and some are actually all about helping you to do all this calculus. It can replace the custom spreadsheet for those who do not wish to make one.If you don't look at any wiki and don't use any mods, then the challenge is phenomenal, even for an actual scientist, as the game throws you out there with minimal data.You might actually like a science and math challenge. If you think you do then buy this game. you won't regret it.If science, math, and ruthless difficulty are not truly your thing, there is the option of playing this game as a ""lego"" game where you build crazy stuff and see if they work. You could actually learn a lot about science and astronomy while you do that, so it might be worth it. I know I wouldn't enjoy playing ""randomly"" like that and I can't recommend it. But who knows, maybe you don't mind.Just be aware of one thing : unless you do some science and math (or have it done for you, but is that the point?), you'll never land that miniature base on the distant moon of the planet Jool... But hey, maybe you are actually totally fine with that.			"

												I bought this game a long time ago. I still beleive it was well worth the money. I have yet to explore the whole solar system yet alone the galaxy. (VERY good mod support via CKAN) Oh, and it is also one of the most educational games ive ever played. taught me more about physics than my entire highschool physics class =) The only negative I can think of, is the insane learning curve. Many people need to spend hours just figuring out how to get into their first orbit. But that is just one of the things that you must be willing to do in KSP.  Aside from that, very highly recommended.			"

												After playing for 72 hours...The funnest part of this game, is building the rockets of any design I can think of, testing them. (Go to launch... topple over and go boom... darn it, try again...)The graphics are pretty good. Some reason the crew is hard on my system when building the crafts, had to turn them off.One thing I do not understand is why your craft is desroyed even when hitting water at 5m/s via parachute, only thing to survive is the cockpits. (not a game breaker, just know the water is off limites in the game)... Patience is required while playing ...It takes a long time to get across the oceans to land your craft at desired locations. You have to be careful when using the speed up if flying a plane. It can cause you to loose/gain altitude without touching the controls.The arodynamics of the game are increadable. Durring one of my missions, altidude required for testing an item had put me in space, I managed to test it, but was out of fuel, and still orbiting, I almost restarted but chose to see if the close path was close enough to barely skim the atmosphere, and sure enough, angled the heat sheild to push the module deeper into the atmosphere, reducing orbit considerably, the next pass was slow enough to actually stay in the atmosphere, again, angled it to push it in deeper. The angle was so good, I was able to open the chutes at about 1900m and land on top of a mountain.Neucances of the game, the physics engine does something strange, causing the ship to stop flowing with the rest of the system, the ship dangles there, it's orbit doesn't move, but the planet does, if left alone long enough, the orbit no longer orbits the planet, but the ship still hangs there. Other times the ship suddenly disintigrates right after a ""warp time"" menuver. More than one occation on a load, the vessel is well belloe the 0m mark, on water it breaks the ship into pieces, and only specific pieces float to the surface. On land, only the pieces that register as above 0.000m is not instantly destroyed. These sorts of things make it difficult to play career mode. Occational crash to desktop, without known reasons, sometimes it says it has crashed, and to tell them about it, yet doesn't say what to do with a folder. I got the game through steam, will be nice when they have an update to fix known bugs. (Even so, I still recomend the game.).... Bottom Line ... I am enjoying the game. Devs keep up the great work.After 2 years, and still playing the game from time to time, I am wondreing if there will ever be an Android Tablet version for this game...			"

An army of kerbalnauts, workers, and e̶s̶c̶a̶p̶e̶d̶ ̶w̶a̶r̶ ̶c̶r̶i̶m̶i̶n̶a̶l̶s̶   rocket scientists are at your disposal. Send them to a golden age or to their deaths by designing and piloting any craft you can imagine.It has three game modes:∆	Sandbox- players have access to all parts and unlimited funds, no objectives - do what you want!∆   Science- players have no budgetary restrictions, all facilities are fully operational(its not a trap) but must research and unlock parts by taking observations during missions, conducting experiments with scientific equipment, and recovering craft and crew after missions. (NASA’s wet dream)∆	Career- budgetary restrictions apply, must research parts, must upgrade facilities to unlock functions, can accept contracts for pay and other bonuses. (Most immersive experience)The game also features tutorial missions, scenario missions/challenges, and a wide range of difficulty options and settings.Controls are easy to understand, yet fairly difficult to master. Some players might wish to use an auto pilot mod such as MechJeb, but I would recommend getting a basic grasp of controls and basic maneuvers before using MJ. The basics :∆	Mash space when things go wrong∆	F5 to nvr 4get∆	F9 to I’m comin’ back MurphI highly recommend watching Scott Manley’s tutorial videos on YouTube (he is Montgomery “Scotty” Scott’s great great great grandfather) I recommend this game if:∆	Space exploration fascinates you∆	Engineering fascinates you∆	Science fascinates you∆	You cried during Interstellar∆	You cried during Contact∆	You cried during 2001: A Space Odyssey∆	You cried while reading 2001: A Space Odyssey∆	You cried while watching both versions of Cosmos∆	You hate the Star Wars prequels∆	You want to fight moon Nazis∆	You are a moon Nazi∆	You believe man went to the moon∆	You think Kubrick helped fake the moon landings ∆	You like Michael Bay moviesI do not recommend if:∆	You have no patience at all∆	You are dead∆	The Star Wars prequels are your favorites∆      You cry during Michael Bay movies (except The Rock)10/10 - would slip the surly bonds of earth again			"

Early Access Review
								One of, if not THE best early access games on the market.The updates are fairly frequent and always add something new and exciting.The devs are always willing to listen to the community to and will often hire popular modders to work on the game officialy, incorporating the mod into the game itself (with some changes for uniformity and game balance).The game itself is excellent, and although it can be challenging to beginners, that's mstly due to the accuracy that space is portrayed in this game. It almos perfectly emulates zero-G environments and orbital mechanics. Despite this , once you understand the basics, the game is simple enough to reward experimentation, yet challenging enough to require it.I cannot recommend this game highly enough.At time of writing, verion 0.9.0 has just dropped, oficially bringing the game into beta.

												Orbital mechanics for fun and profit. It is the best game. If you need a hand getting started look up Scott Manley on Youtube, he has an excellent series of tutorials and miscellany on KSP. Alternatively just play in Sandbox until you make things which don't explode immediately (or things which do ...for science). Note: You may actually end up learning science so you can get better at this game.			"

Early Access Review
A bit about the game and developers.Kerbal Space Program is a space travel simulation game developed and published by Squad. Kerbal Space Program is their only game for now, and even that one isn't out yet. All of the review and game footage that you will see in this review is from ALPHA! Things could change when ever Squad feels they want something new.About Gameplay.As I said earlier, Kerbal Space Program is a simulation game. In it your objective is to build up a space craft and fly it into the space. You have a lot of different parts to chose from, with which you can create your space craft very unique! And It's very simple as well. All you need to do is Drag and Drop the part where you want it to be, and woala, you've got yourself a small aircraft. Of course, you do need to think about the laws of physics, and It will take you a couple of tries to even manage and get into the space! You need to think about how many engines should you take, how much fuel, how big should your ship be... And if it's too big, you should put it into couple of smaller pieces and just launch them into the space one by one.That sounds very simple, doesn't it? Well I'm sorry to brake this down for you.. This game is insanely hard! Just imagine, you need to set up the space craft just perfectly! Then you need to set up the valid commands (what engines start first, then which ones fall to the ground while the new ones start, and so on and on), then you need to think about the gravity. You need to make your space craft go straight forward into the air until it reaches about 10 000 km. After that you should turn around 45 Degrees. By that time, you're almost out of the gravity's reach. But that is not all of it! Once you get your space craft out into the orbit, you will probably lose all of your fuel. So then you need to launch more fuel from the ground. Simple, right? Nope! By the time you get into the orbit, your other part of the space craft is already orbiting around the ""Earth"" (i forgot the name of the in game planet, I'm sorry!) so you either have to catch up with it, or make your fuel fly the other way around. Very hard, but fun!Once you have finally put your ship fully together, you can travel to the Moon, Mars, or where ever you want! As long as you know what you're doing, and as long as you've got enough fuel left. Don't forget that you'd like to get your crew back, right? We need them to be heroes after all! And I think that the game wouldn't be so hard if it had a better tutorial. Tutorial teaches you how to fly a ship, and how to assemble it on the ground, but it doesn't teach you how to assemble it in space, it doesn't teach you how to land on the moon, nor anything else. That's the main reason why this game is hard. And I think that once the developers finish the tutorial properly, the game will be much more loved in the public! I, sadly, never managed to get out of the ""Earth's"" orbit and go to the moon. I managed to get half way there once, but that's it, hehe. It's just hard.Graphic and AudioGraphically speaking, the game looks great. This game is made by the Unity software, and it's amazing what Squad made this game look like. It has a lot of nice details, the land looks pretty decent, and the space looks amazing. Water, though, looks pretty bad. But once again, this game is just in alpha! The songs are pretty good too, but after too many hours, they get a bit annoying. Not so big problem though!Pros, cons and final grade.Pros:- Very fun building game.- Ability to make your ship look different from all the other ones.- Ability to travel around the space, and go on any planet in our solar system.Cons:- Lack of tutorial.Overall grade: 8/10.To explain my grade - It would be 9 if the game had better tutorial system. This game is extremely fun, but very hard to learn, so better tutorial would be very welcome. It would also be 10 if they put the Kerbal customization into the game, and if they added multiplayer into it! It could be very hard to do, but I'm sure it'd be awesome, hehe.Extra info:  I really loved Kerbal Space Program, and I will keep on watching the game progress. I will review it once again once it comes fully out, because I'm sure that this game will still have a lot to offer! I support Kerbal Space Program!Thank you for reading my reviews! Don't forget that I'm usually posting new reviews on my blog weekly and you can check them out here:[/b] http://midnightwolfie.blogspot.comThank you![/b] "

Early Access Review
""That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind""Neil Armstrong (1969)... 3-2-1-0 ignition and liftoff! Kerbal Space Program is a space-simulator which is able to inspire, because the possibilities are so endless like the universe. There are two modes (state in the alpha), the career-mode where you have to complete some goals, research for better rocket parts and so on and you have the sandbox-mode where you have  all parts from the beginning and where you can set your own goals. An orbit around ""Kerbin"" (corresponds earth)? Fly to the ""mun"" (corresponds moon) or one of the other planets? Build a Lander and land somewhere? Or build a rover and make a trip on the ""mun""? It lies by you! A successful launch is even an special goal for the first time. It's harder as it sounds. While playing, your physics-knowledge will increase, you will see what i mean. You can explore many planets, moons, comets and asteroids which each have their own challenges.Mods:You will find lots of mods which make the game unbelievable. More parts for rockets or space-stations, better atmospheres for your planets and moons and more. As well as other games, the mods aren't free of risk but for me there were only a few game-crashes after hours of playing (>100h).Early Access Status:It's nearly perfect, so you have the feeling to get an full game. Some Special-features like an multiplayer will follow. So don't be disappointed if updates are slow in coming.To bring it to the point: Absolutely stunning game! 10/10In summary:  Pro Contra   + funny Kerbals - not suitable for low-performance pcs   + lots of Mods   + unbelievable and unique atmosphere   + a huge sun-system to explore   + lots of possibilities to build stations, vehicles and more PS: I just wanted to write a short review, which brings the essence of the game to the point. I hope it will help you in your decision. "

												Well. It was about time I got to writing a review about this game. I think I can accurately say the positives and negatives about the game.  with my 600 plus hours into it. And heres what I think. First review as well, for my first game I ever bought on steam: seems fitting. [h1[Pro's[/h1]Very realistic, for the most part. You have to know what you are doing, and learn how basic orbits work and what not to really learn how to play the game.Funny. This is that other part. The game isnt perfect, and you can mess around all you want with it, and do some silly things, like launch kerbals from the moon: not land and then take off, and not in a ship, but literally launch the kerbal from the moon. It was fun.Satisfying. Once you set foot on the mun (moon equivalent), then a nice lil bit of joy and happiness rushes over you. You feel this giant accomplishment. And this does dwindle after every other landing, even on other bodies, but it is still there. And once you actually land back on Kerbin, thats almost as sweet.Customization: Build rockets and stuff however you want: just need to make sure they work, engineer.ConsThere isnt much inherently bad with the game. The only problem with it is this: personal drive. You have to want to go to the mun, Duna, or other bodies, or create that perfect plane that can take off from kerbin and go somewhere in space without a hitch. If you dont have that large drive, then the game is boring; No sense of direction, nothing to do really, things of that nature. So if youre gonna get the game, make sure to ask yourself: Can I set my own goals, and actually achieve them/want too?EDIT: I did forget to mention the new career missions that you can do in career mode, thanks to one person who saw my review. Those can definitely extend the life of the game; I personally did not find them too much fun, but they are indeed there, and are fun for many others as well. :)My personal opinionI have not actively played Kerbal Space program in just under 2 years or so. One of the updates wiped my save, unfortunately, which made younger me mad and not want to play it anymore. Now, I just dont care anymore to really play it on my own. I did what I personally wanted to do, which was to land on every planet, and a few moons, and make a space station. I did that, and I feel like I beat the game. Now every time I go back, its all just ""Ya! I remember doing that"", but then I just go play something else. I tell people that I love this game, and I truly do. Its just I already beat it for me. But I will still gladly play it to show friends the ropes, and just to make sure I still know how to do it. Should you buy it? Yes, if you like sandbox space games. This is probably one of the finer ones out there. But make sure you have the drive to do it, otherwise you will stop playing it before you achieve anything. All the people that love this game have that drive, and are the ones that still playing it, that reach higher hours than I have. And I commend them for it. They have that drive that I have lost, for now. Buy the game though: Its fun to watch things explode :D			"

												So let me say right off the bat, this game will not be for everyone, But you more than likely know before you read this review if the game is even close to up your alley.  In career mode, It takes a patience, common sense. There is alot of trial and error. I had seen alot of the reviews and decided that I was going to not visit any guides or wikis, Which made the game much more gratifying knowing I figured it out on my own.  After nearly 100 hours into the game, im getting ready to restart career and impose a hardcore mode on myself.  As stated on the main page of the game, this is early access, therefore still alot missing from the game, you almost have to make your own fun out of it ATM. But even with features still missing, the game is alot of fun, I always consider a game worth the money if I get a dollar a hour out of it, this game far surpasses that, even off sale.  The physics of the game are very solid and very unforgiving, just like it should be. The amount of stuff  you can do is only limited by your imagination.  From orbiting a planet, to a complete Space Station around the games version of Mars.I must say too that I am a bit worried that the updates have been so slow to come out, I got the game a few days before the asteroid missions and the sale (doh).  Come to find out that was the first update in something like 3 months.  That being said, I have also seen in rviews that the modding community is awesome, so that may make up for the lack of updates in a small way.  Becuase of my self imposed blackout on anything that could be a spoiler, i have not looked into the mods myself.  But after I get tired of my hardcore mode, thats my next stop.  Any questions, feel free to ask in the comments section.Edit: I finally had to look up how to transfer fuel.  Spent 3 hours clicking on a docked craft trying to figure it out. :/""THIS GAME IS:10% LUCK20% SKILL15% CONCENTRATED POWER OF WILL5% PLEASURE50% PAINAND 100% REASON TO DOWNLOAD THE GAME!""I saw this on another review of another game, and it was so true, i had to steal it. =P			"

												If you like space, engineering, or just building crazy things and seeing what happens, you will enjoy this game. You will love this game, and it will love you back. This is quite possibly one of the greatest games ever made. My first moon landing experience 4 years ago was life changing, and I say that without an ounce of shame. This game will inspire you, challenge you and reward you like none other. I can't say enough good things about this game. It is pure magic, and there is nothing else like it. I give it a 100% perfect score in my book, and with the size and quality of the modding community this game will keep you busy for thousands of hours.			"

												As a 30-something year old person with little education but a love for science, space, and engineering, this game caught my attention while in alpha a few years ago. At that time, I knew 'of' the equations and methods used to get things into space, albeit not grasping the details to any extent. They were not familiar, but also not foreign. I opened KSP, and joyfully set to building what I thought would be a simple, but effective rocket. Ecstatic when completed, I excitedly smashed the button to launch. The view of my creation on the launchpad gave me chills. With shaking hands, heart racing, I gently pushed the space bar. The rocket ignites with a powerful firestorm. For a fleeting moment, my eyes found Jeb in the bottom corner of the screen. He was terrified. Panicing, I center my eyes on the screen, fingers ready to steer my way to space and victory. Six seconds into flight, the rockets begins to rip apart, parachute deployed and pulled taught from force of the rocket's climb. Rocket parts scatter in the aftermath of an explosion. I look to Jeb, preparing myself to see his corpse, mutilated and burned. On inspection, I see he survived. The look of panic on his face has become horror. The rocket's capsule is tumbling end over end, climbing in altitude. Muscles in my arms spasm as my person slips into shock, my mind reaching for help, begging for training and emergency reaction to kick in. Floundering, tears in my eyes, I desperately begin to smash buttons on the keyboard. My head is locked on the screen, eyes vigorously searching for a button to fix everything, to save Jeb from his certain doom. My heart sinks as seconds pass and nothing seems help, all of my fingers are finding buttons and pressing. The capsule apexed and started its decent, tethered to Kerbin by gravity's unrelenting pull. I lock up, panting short breaths, staring at the screen. I cannot blink. I cannot look away. The capsule strikes the ground. A dialog appears on the screen, confirming Jebidiah's death. I have since killed many more kerbals, slowly learning the ropes. I understand more about rocket science than I ever expected. I have had successful missions to the Mun, Minmus, Duna, and Jool. If you are brand new to this game, the best advice I have is to NOT turn the 'snap-to' feature on when building things in the VAB, and start killing kerbals. You will be amazed at what you learn.

												Best game ever. Just look at my hours. Planning, building, and flying an awesome ship, like a space shuttle replica or a fully reusable space splane gives you the biggest sense of accomplishment when you burn through the atmosphere and touch down at the runway. Or rescueing a kerbal mark whatney from Mars (Duna) or doing a flyby of pluto (Eeloo). Or building a replica of the international space station one shuttle launch at a time. Or catching an asteroid, bringing it into low orbit than using it as a refueling base. My personal biggest achievement was doing a full recreation of the movie The Martian. Be warned. VERY steep learning curve. This is quite literally rocket science after all. Career mode is very hard for new players. You will hit a science brick wall if you cant do moon flybys without manourvre nodes. But theres some cool scenarios and theres always sandbox mode. Mods! Theres lots of mods and they almost always play well together these days. When I first started there was a max memory limit which is now thankfully gone thanks to 64 bit.Essential mods: Mechjeb, Kerbal Engineer, KIS, KAS, Trajectories, Interstellar fuel switch, Tweakscale, Editor Extensions Redux, Kerbal Alarm ClockGraphical mods: Stock visual enhancements, Scatterer, PLanetshine, DistantobjectPart mods: OPT, KASA, MRS, Kerbal Reusability Expansion Cool mods: Rasterprop monitor, Vessel viewer, Docking alignment IndicatorFailing, blowing up in the atmosphere, and forgetting to add parachutes is just part of the fun. Ive only been playing  since 1.0 and the updates just keep making this game better and better. 99% of bugs ( we call them krakens) have been squashed. The only thing which needs to be improved is the part physics. Dont get me wrong, its gotten so much better since 1.1 and 1.2 but it could be better. Currently if you have more than about 250+ parts being rendered, the game slows down to about 15 fps on my GTX 980. Very large ships take a while to launch and docking a large shuttle with an even larger space station requires patience and precision. Just be careful to build ships without too many unnecessary parts and you will be fine. "

												I have much more hours in this game, I bought it before it was even on Steam. Kerbal Space Program is a space-agency simulator where you control the agency itself and the actual Kerbonauts (astronauts). There are three gamemodes, career (you manage the actual agency with funds, popularity/approva, and research tech), science (same as before but just research) and sandbox with no limitations but there's almost no agency mechanics. Although because of that sandbox may sound like a lesser mode, the agency mechanics are really secondary.The main gameplay is being the actual Kerbonauts and performing the mission, which you yourself can determine or you can take a contract. However building the rocket (or spaceplane) is just as important as actually flying it. There's a whole solar-system for you to explore, complete with asteroids and moons for some of the planets. Some of the planets even have irrational orbits, and some of those have moons with an irrational orbit to the planet. The game is realistic enough to be somewhat educational but loose enough to be a very fun game. The game is somewhat difficult due to the loose-realism, but that is a good thing for myself. I'd rather a game be too hard (this game definitely isn't) than be too easy. Everytime I start a new save, I learn something new along the way everytime. Whether it's a more efficient way to get into orbit, faster way to dock, or even a way to use less parts for a rocket. I always learn something new, and I love that. Also, KSP is one of the few games ever to exit early-access and actually be complete with no major bugs. That's dedication.			"

								What a truely amazing game!I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone even remotely interested in space like gaming.The core game is really great - but the modding community, and available mods for this game, adds value to this game unlike anything I've ever exerienced.This game has 3 modes (sandbox, science, and career), each having it's own unique experience. After spending a little bit watching some of Scott Manley's videos on youtube, you'll be well on your way to creating your very own space program. You can literally design every detailed aspect of your spacecraft, accomplish things in space, and have endless hours of fun. Iliterally can't stop playing this game...seriously! If you're wondering whether or not this is for you, go check out Scott Manley's videos on youtube, and get a taste of this masterpiece that is KSP.It's not rocket science...well okay, actually it is. But after spending a little time on those vids, you'll be well on your way.			"

								Kerbal Space Program not only slices and dices, but it shakes the conventions of gaming up with this glorious take on running your own space program. Houston, we don't have any problems here because with Kerbal Space Program the imagination runs wild like Hulk Hogan in 1991. Make no mistake that if you do purchase this game you may have life changing experiences that include, but are not limited to: creativity, frequent trips to imagination land, and thoughts of becoming an astronaut yourself. If these conditions last for more than 4 hours please consult Kerbal Space Program.**This game should be supported by people who enjoy space, sandboxes, and early access games that are actually pretty well done in their current state.

								Am now qualified to join NASA.Honestly though, this game is amazing! You learn so much about how space travel is done in the real world. This game has already taken so most of my playtime ever since I got it, and no doubt it'll continue to do so for a long long time. It's so fun to build your own aircraft, rocket, space station, rover, etc and make them work.And when you ever get bored(which is not possible, but on the vigintillionth chance you do), you can look for mods that add parts or gameplay elements, having great modding support and an awesome community.And this is still in beta, and looking at the developers, it can only get better.If you ever get stuck from the steep learning curve, you can watch some tutorials done by Scott Manley.Why are you still reading this?

(+hundreds of other mods like SpaceX rockets and other real life rockets and engines and graphic improvement mods.)Seriously, this is one of the best games I've ever played.

												While writing this I have almost reached my 700th hour and that does not even include the ones I played offline, so I'm probably more near the 800th hour. Nevertheless, this is one of the greatest games I've ever played. It's difficult, yes. But not as difficult as it sounds or appears first. Watch Scott Manley's tutorials on youtube and with a little practice and patience you will be able to do all the cool stuff you can imagine. I don't want to misslead you, it can be a rly hard and even a little frustrating during the first couple of hours, but it's also so damn rewarding once you got past that initial learning courve.So what does this game offer? A huge sandbox experience with lots and lots of content that has been build up and polished for about 4 years! You want to build a rocket? a (space)plane? a shuttle? a station? a moon (mun) lander? or a probe that travels across the whole system to reach the gas giant far out? Than do that! No one is stopping you! Your imagination is the limit, as much of a cliche that might sound like. But it's true and if you don't believe me, watch showcases of people on youtube. There is everything from Star War's podracers to real life replica missions. And if you fail a couple of times, there is nothing bad about it. The game manages to make failures fun. How? Cause you see stuff spinning, crashing and exploding in ways you couldn't even imagine. This is the unique experience of KSP that I've been enjoying with the greatest community I've ever seen. If you have a question, than simply post it on the forum. There are so many experienced vets out there that help each other and especially the new people with theire knowledge and skill. It's a rly unique group of people that has kept the forum alive ever since the buggy first steps.You might ask yourself where the hell you might take the inspiration from to build new stuff after 100th of hours. The answer is simple. KSP is easy enough to be fun once you get used to the basics, while still being acurate enough to build real life replicas from the Apollo and Space Shuttle Aeras to modern missions and designs like SpaceX's reusable boosters or Virgin Galactic's space ship one. It's all within the possibilities of this sandbox. And if you want something more SciFi orientated? Then get a mod like interstellar or near future and you will get everything and more right at hand. Even for the type of player that enjoys a harder and more realistic simulation type of game there are easy ways to adapt the game to be just that. The moding community of this game is just huge. There is everything from physics driven algorithms that simulate hypersonic reentrie effects to adding whole new planets and solar systems. There is just so much content out there that you will literally never be able to see or play it all.Long story short, after playing this game for years I sudenly felt a need, driven by nostalgia, to write this down and promote the best investment I ever did when it comes to a game. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did and still do! Cheers			"

												I started playing this game during the Beta and it quickly became the greatest game I've ever played and still is. I've played 600+ hours and I've hardly scratched everything you can do in this game. I can easily say, without exaggeration,  I'll be putting another 1000 hours if not more into this game. Games these days seem to go onto the market at 60$-120$, if you include all the DLC or pre-release shannanigans, for about 4-5 hours of enjoyable gameplay, 20 hours if your lucky. With Kerbal Space Program they're not even charging 50$ with a guarantee of continued FREE updates. I can not express enough the level of enjoyment anyone with any amount of interest in space exploration will get from this game. If your like me you'll get hooked on this game and before you realize it you'll have put in 100 hours of gameplay and be working towards setting up mining operations on any number of distant worlds, complete with orbiting space stations and/or colonies. Did I mention you can capture and/redirect asteroids then do whatever you want with them? Yes, that does include mining and/or building bases on them. What you do in this game is only limited to what you can imagine and build to get the job done...... unless you run your agency into the ground first of course. BEWARE THE KRAKEN!!			"

								Release Update: still great!everything i said during early access still applies, and this game is definitely still worth getting.Highly Recommended! also if you played during early access its worth checking out again. lots of new features, including completely revamped aerodynamics and heating physics made me start over again from scratch, and im loving every minute of it. blown up quite a few rockets learning the improved physics, and poor jebediah burned up in re-entry after losing control and facing the heat sheild the wrong way :'( , but ive learned a thing or 2 along the way and recently got my first ship into stable orbit and back safely. its also worth mentioning that the new aerodynamics physics allows for vastly improved space plane gameplay. i actually built, flew, and safely landed my first plane before getting my first rocket into stable orbit, and with way fewer attempts; something i struggled with, even in sandbox mode with everything unlocked, during the beta.also the con i mentioned in beta is still there but is easily fixable with mods :)Early Access Review:ive had some bad experiences with early access games and told myself never again. my freinds however convinced me otherwise and im glad they did. this game is just about to enter beta, but it feels like a pretty solid game already. the gamemodes feel complete and the engine feels solid. ive had a tremendous amount of fun and have yet to explore all it has to offer.  im currently in the process of trying to build a space station for refueling so my ships dont have to carry all the fuel for their entire mission from launch. im also trying to get my team thats on the ""mun"" home with all their science data intact (my design didnt include enough fuel to get them all the way back from the mun), so now im setting up a retreival mission. the game is merciless, but its realistically so, and i actually consider this one of its strengths. you learn something with every attempted mission. also, while the learning curve is steep, there are also tutorial missions that are actually very helpful. you can check them out right off the bat, or you can do like i did and blow up a few rockets first, but they are actually very helpful tutorials.as good as it is its still an early access game and as such you can expect to encounter a few bugs and glitchs. the only bothersome one for me at the moment is that stage rockets that you release during launch disapear after a certain distance so you cant recover them for recycling. that said kerbal is one of the few games thats doing early access right. updates are fairly frequent and the developers pay attention to the communities comments and complaints. when an update causes an obvious annoyance thats easily fixable, theyll follow up shortly with a hotfix patch. I feel confident, based on the developers track record thus far, that during beta any issues that remain will be resolved and the game will receive the polish it deserves. its also worth mentioning that theres already a thriving modding comunity for this game that adds additional features.

												Kerbal Space Program is truly something unique.How do you market a game about rocket science -- the default analogy for ""something extremely complicated"" -- to an audience big enough to justify your budget? Well...there's a lot of little things that make it playable to many people.First of all, it's a make-your-own-experience sandbox. Just like Minecraft (before there was an End), there's no final goal, no objective arrow. It's just you, an bunch of spaceship parts, a few kerbals, a custom solar system, the infinite expanse of space, and explosions. Lots and lots of explosions.Second of all, this game about rocket science isn't about ALL of rocket science. There's quite a lot of liberty taken with the laws of physics, all in the name of simplicity. You don't have to worry about fuel flow, or life support, or the speed-of-light delay. All of that is benched in favor of less subtle things, like orbital mechanics, atmospheric shock-heating, and (look this up; it's practically KSP 101) delta-V and Tsiolkovsky rocket equation.But here's the best part; all of these ignored facets of space travel can be added into the game. KSP has a very robust and active modding community, and I'm sure enough mods exist to make the game as realistic as you could possibly demand. Life support? There's a mod for that. Several, actually, in varying degrees of difficulty. Fuel flow? Part of Realism Overhaul. Speed-of-light delay? Check out RemoteTech. There are even mods that replace the stock solar system with our very own, real system, and even mods that add entirely new, dreamed-up systems. (I highly recommend starting out with no mods, then adding them as you become comfortable with what you already have.)Really, Kerbal Space Program is great for the same reason Minecraft is great. It expects nothing in particular of you, it just wants you to do whatever comes to mind. If that means strapping a hundred boosters together as randomly as possible and watching the fireworks, that's fine. If that means methodically landing on every planet and moon one-by-one, that's fine. If that means brutally murdering your kerbals, well, heck, they're just as surprised to be alive as you are, so go for it.			"

												Imagine you are the head of NASA and everybody that works for you willingly steps into whatever ludicrous idea you can come up with. Will you send them off to the heavens to explore the far reaches of the solar system or lead them to their demise in a fiery explosion on the launchpad? The choice is yours...This game deceptively teaches you rocket science, orbital mechancis and physics amongst all the wonderful explosions and stunning destinations.The Trial and Error makes learning the game entertaining and fun! (Lots of explosions and lost Kerbals to be had).For the first several days of playing, I had an ICBM Factory as opposed to a Space Program. Many Kerbals died. A few Youtube videos later (Thanks Scott Manley!) less Kerbals died and with a grasp on how things worked, they began to prosper.The reward and feeling of accomplishment you get from this game is unlike any other I have ever got from a game. The community for this game is enormous, friendly and constantly active, Youtubers churning out their own stories, tutorials, successes and failures. Developers creating thousands of mods, Forum users pushing the boundaries with weekly challenges, and more.In regards to mods; you can add things like:-New Planets/Moons-Life Support/Cryogenics-More parts, more parts, more parts ....oh yes, lots and lots of parts-Colonization/Habitats/Bases/Space Stations-Boats/Submarines/Planes/Vehicles and everything inbetween (Even more parts!)-In game tools to give you all the information you would ever need-New and Historic Missions/Contracts-Combat/Weapons-Visual beautifications/eye candy/textures-Malfunctions/In flight repair and damage control/Emergency Escapes-Complete realism overhaul...and many more.You can play this game any way you dream.Absolutely Stunning Game 10/10.

												I have spent so much time on Kerbal Space Program.  This is one game I keep coming back to after years of play.  The sandbox nature of the game combined with the numerous parts available leads to endless possibilities for Rockets, Planes, Space Probes, Boats, Trucks, Cars, and really anything you can think of.  Take the base game and add mods like Infernal Robotics and Tweakscale and you have so much more to do.  Then add an additional 150 mods from CKAN and there is literally no end to what can be accomplished.  10/10			"

												Kerbal Space Program was the first Early Access game I ever bothered to try and it turned out to have been a great decision; KSP has evovled into a stunningly fun and creative game that packs not only surprisingly well-done physics together and perfectly decent graphics with infinite replayability and different game modes but also a small dose of witty comedy.I think an important thing to realize with KSP is that, yes, Kerbals that live on planet Kerbin (essentially the astronauts that you get to have inside the space crafts you build) do have a ‘minionesque’ comical look but in no actual way does this really ever affect the simulation aspect of the game - it still packs in a pretty hardcore simulator with the actual ship resources like fuel, electricity and mono propellant having to be carefully managed during advanced missions. Successfully piloting a craft and docking with a space station is seriously no joke. Flight dynamics are also very realistic with you actually having to have at least a rudimentary understanding of how a rocket or airplane works in order to have one you designed actually ever get off the ground.All in all this provides a game that has you spending hours designing a ship straight out of your imagination using a very wide variety of parts in order to accomplish any mission you could think of like launching from Kerbin, landing on the Mun (moon) and then returning those happy little guys back home. All of this happens while constantly having chuckles at the witty ship part descriptions while in Build Mode or the quirkiness of the Kerbins that you're having go on EVA's outside your space station.Mod support is huge and makes the game essentially extendable to anything you could possibly ever want from a space sim. If you like space sims you will like this, trust me.			"

												Two space pilgrims are dead. This is one of my most noticeable achievements in a PC diversion. Clearly lamentably the two Kerbals - an entire sorts of negligible green outcast men who feel like an unholy blend of the Associates from Detestable Me and the Irken race from Interloper Zim - are dead. I made sense of how to keep them alive through a large number of calamities, contributing hours ensuring to their survival presented to the brutal components dim of space. Test missions were flown; tests accumulated consistent data; rockets would decrease to leave the ground and would explode or dispatch and a while later rapidly tip over in light of the way that the change wasn't right. These two passed on in light of the total data of a thousand frustrations. Additionally, it was exquisite since they kicked the container crashing into the Moon. Conciliatory sentiments, the Mun. It doesn't for the most part cover it to express that Kerbal Space Program is a space sim. For a specific something, paying little mind to how honest to goodness things get, notwithstanding all that you're playing in a universe of negligible green child's shows, which the entertainment never really obliges with its amazing physical credibility the further along you go. Nevertheless, for each something that vibe cerebrum bowing and sciencey, there's still a smooth sentiment responsiveness, like the way that endeavoring to plot a flight way that spots you in hover with a substitute planet is essentially a genuinely dubious and correct session of Bop It. The preoccupation beats that characterization as a consequence of that sentiment relentless revelation and improvement. Conferring a blunder never felt like a train, just as the preoccupation had set an incomprehensible obstacle before me and chuckled as I whipped furiously at it. It felt like improvement. Frustration is a teacher here, one that challenges you and doesn't exchange off by giving every one of you the answers. Regardless, it is certainly an instructor that requirements essentially for you to find light. In light of present circumstances, endeavoring to nutshell Kerbal Space Program doesn't include clear ""You win in case you arrive"" targets. To the degree I can tell, the delight never stops, and an entire close-by planetary gathering persists there to be explored. What KSP values above all is consistent quality. Though every one of your analysts and pilots are insignificant green men, the entertainment is actually human. You advance basically by being adequately striking to try accomplishing to some degree higher, making your species' scope of noticeable quality just to some degree greater with every attempt. In case you make sense of how to break the world's speed record, you're set up to have a go at accomplishing the upper environment and recording how the air is up there. If you arrive, then maybe we can put a satellite extensively further. In case the satellite can get up there, maybe a space explorer can. In case we can accomplish space, we can accomplish our closest planetary neighbor. The main thing that is critical is that the experience is never misused. Whether you transmit the data using a radio wire you associated with your bus or you make sense of how to arrive safely and the data can be recovered physically, Mission Control gets the experience, showed up under a clearing point of interest of ""Science"" in-entertainment. If the mission bombs marvelously terribly, it is beneficial the length of you see why. Clearly, most of your time in-preoccupation is spent in the spaceport on a steady experimentation mode endeavoring to collect a claim to fame that can do correctly what's required for the present mission. The beguilement wouldn't take your breath away apparently or aurally - arrive, sea, space are all decently textureless and lacking, even with each one of the specs twisted up, and the sounds are about the same, with the soundtrack besting out at ""vigorously impossible to miss"" instead of amazing. All the torque has gone into making the fine engine inconspicuous components terrifyingly confusing. In every way that really matters every part of a spaceship's arrangement is spoken to here, with really many diagram options and moving parts to gather - from fuel tanks and rockets to the glow shields for reentry and the decoupling devices for supporters. Besides, would do well to consider each and every piece of it or without question as you're imagined, it will flop marvelously before you even watch the stars. It's mind-boggling, however starting close to nothing and including new tech onto powerful structures is the place rapture is found. The honest to goodness making methodology is earth fundamental, regardless, in light of the way that every part is basically joined to your specialty like Legos. There's a colossal number of tweaking instruments available for the more picky player, yet it takes a long time before they get the opportunity to be unmistakably fundamental shades of perniciousness. Kerbal Space Program offers guide Easy to-Hard inconvenience settings, yet when in doubt, the bona fide inconvenience setting is for all intents and purposes figurative. The Sandbox mode opens up each available part in the delight so you can just waste time and make the most point by point, insane arrangements conceivable. The Science mode grants you to secure concentrations for each new leap forward achievement; you can spend those spotlights on the Imaginative work bent tree, which is the place you win more prominent and better parts to use. The Calling mode is a full scale space program experience where money is, really, a challenge and extraordinary general evaluation, open blessings, government contracts, and developed out tech are required to before you can even remain to send space adventurers on a flight. This is the most ""gamey"" it gets, with contracts addressing clearly described missions you can perform to get the most out of every flight. It's direct going, yet it's conceivably the most satisfying in light of the way that each new progress is earned. You will miss the mark at this beguilement. It will incapacitate you and it will stress you, in the meantime, when in doubt, it will quiet, quiet, and energize you. Inventive muscles will be reached out here that aren't augmented all the time by diversions, and more personality boggling minutes require a sort of zen past being essentially snap arranged for a stun strike. In reality, even dissatisfaction gives a lesson. Notwithstanding how huge or little the achievement, whatever else that ought to be conceivable is compelled just by your imaginative vitality. To be sure, even with its cartoonish entertainment factor and erraticisms, Kerbal Space Program has a for all intents and purposes holy respect for the minor miracles required in space travel, and even at its most troublesome, it justifies that respect thusly. (All reviews are recouped from the Internet and piped through a movement of identical word instruments three conditions both for amusingness and to extra time. In my religion, this is known as Art(TM), yet you can call it ""Threewording"")			"

												Fantastic game, in general. The game at first is very complex, and if you honestly don't have any past experience with applied physics, you might need/want to look up a lot of tutorials on YouTube (Scott Manley is your friend!). With 750 hours on the game currently, I still haven't done everything there is to do in the stock game, and with mods, you can make it as easy, hard, realistic, or fun as you want.Though, for all players, new and experienced, I HIGHLY recommend pacing yourself. Go slow, don't travel to all the planets right away, because it is possible, but it's also no fun if you have no goals to set for yourself. I have over 700 hours on this game and I still haven't even tried to land a probe on Eeloo (farthest and most eccentric planet in the Kerbol system), so if you want to get the most fun out of this game, don't blow it all in one go!

												Kerbal space program has one of the most steep learning curves i've ever seen in a video game. It took me over 2 hours to learn how to get into orbit (this was before there was tutorials and your only salvation was scott manley), and by that time my periapsis was 60km and my apoapsis was 47000km. This game allows you to either make outrageous rockets and crash them into buildings, or choose to play it seriously and be frustrated for the first 20 hours. If you ever wish to pick this game up, it is extremely fun, which ever play style you choose, and pushing through the difficulty and landing on these far away celestial bodies was one of the most rewarding gaming experiences i have ever had; it kinda reminds me of defeating a boss in dark souls. Just remember when you first start playing that IT IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT AND YOU WILL FAIL MANY TIMES. I spent 400 hours playing the game and im still playing it. Without a doubt i highly recommend it. *Also one of the most valuable tips i can give you is to use 'F5'; it saves the game at certain points and thus you can try your landing again if it fails.

												Kerbal Space Program is a beautiful game.Of course, I don't mean that in the graphical sense. The graphics aren't amazing, but I'm running the game at low power. It's what I expected. The physics are absolutely on point, though. I've learned a lot about space in my 50 hours of play. It does require some skill to pilot and trial and error to figure out which designs work. Timewarp is a handy feature. Youtubers like Scott Manley were godsends.So far, I have landed on the ""Mun."" I will be playing for many hours more.10/10			"

												Build. Fly Dream.One of the best sandbox games in this decade of sandbox games. You are given a whole star system open to exploration; Mun, Duna, Laythe, all these planets are yours, except Eve, attempt no landing there. However each trip has new challenges and the game does not hold your hand through them you will run out of fuel, burn up in re-entry, and explode and explode and explode. That rush you feel though when you finally plant that flag and safely return to Kerbin is incomparable.This is the gateway drug to space. Nasa, Esa, and Roscosmos should pay squad for recruiting their next generation of scientists, engineers, and pilots.			"

												If you've ever dreamed of launching your own rocket, or wanted to figure out how to keep ships in orbit, or wondered how hard it REALLY is to dock with an orbiting station with intricate and precise maneuvering, or aspired to land a craft on the remote moons of a gas giant while sweating your fuel reserves, then buy this game and play it today. (Spoiler: Landing on planets is HARD, Docking is HARDER.) With a wealth of mods, a great developer team and a rabid fanbase, this game is truly wonderful. It appeals to the explorer in all of us, if you're the type of person where the journey IS the destination, then this game is for you. Definitely not for those who prefer PvP shooty-type-stuff. Luckily I count myself among the former and can rate KSP 9/10 - highly recommended.			"

Kerbal Space Program. If I could sleep with a video game, this would be it. KSP is beautiful in almost every way! I can blow up my Kerbals on the launch pad and try and build a boat out of struts (I can't), or if I want to I can land on alien worlds and watch alien moons rise.It runs on my Mac, making it a game that can run on anything short of a rotary phone. Really, any game that can run with an i3 processor and is this GOOD then should be a yes in everyone's book :DThe real fun comes when things go wrong. If it seems to go right first try, it won't. I think the best moment have come in failure. Once I killed Bill, Bob and Gwent Kerman after landing to rescue another Kerbal on a far-away moon before realising I was on the wrong side of the moon. While attempting to get back into orbit, I lost my velocity and plummeted into a xeno-ocean. Xeno - sea? Xenocean? I don't know .-.In addition, this game has no cons. The stock game has plenty or shortcomings, but the modding community is the most diverse community in existence for a game on Steam...You want clouds? There's a mod for that.You want to eject you Kerbals and watch them parachute to safety? There's a mod for that.You want to fly them up in an AI-flown spaceplane then shoot an AMRAAM missile at them from a ground base, then watch them jump out just in time before landing perfectly on top of the mountains? There's a mod for that. Well, actually about 12.Don't bother with that astrophysics degree, play KSP. If you are considering buying this game, then HELL TO THE YES!Like 124 / 10			"

								One of the most addictive and exciting games I've played in recent memory and that although it is not even in beta stage yet. So wonder what is more to come from this. But if you like Space games, like building rockets or space planes and send them out to explore the universe this is definitely the game to get. Even after over 30 hours of playing I still scratched on the surface.  I wished this is what Spore space stage should have been. With Kerbal Space program you could lots and lots of fun in this one, but beware this can be a real time sink. I also recommend watching some of the tutorial videos online to help a bit with frustration at the beginning when you just don't get your rocket into orbit!			"

Teach yourself space. Become the rocket. Be one with space tape.This is the way of the Kerbal. Jebediah would be proud of you. If he wasn't currently stuck on the Mun beside the wrecks of a lander and 3 rescue missions.Be sure to get the Chatterer mod.			"

								There is simply no shortage of places to go and things to do.Once, I put a pirate ship into orbit.  A pirate ship.  In orbit.  Hell yeah, it had cannons!  It could sail the stars as Odysseus sailed the seas, but curiously enough couldn't float upon landing in an ocean.  In this way, I discovered the need for testing.Another time, I built a large, mobile glove-shaped buggy out of airbags that was designed to safely catch spacecraft that were landing at significant multiples of the speed of sound.  Sifting through the wreckage of that first test revealed serious flaws, but that's just the sort of can't-do negativism that further engineering tweaks can and will overcome as you play KSP.  Soon, the crack engineering team realized they could save millions by just installing an airbag or two on any landing vessel itself.  En garde, gravity!Another time, I dropped a jeep on the Mun that landed on its side doors, trapping the Kerbals inside.  My OnStar insurance coverage did not extend beyond the atmosphere, so I launched a rescue mission to flip the Munar jeep.  Then, I toured the Munar craters in a jeep.  The rescue team had no way to return home and no other plans, so they hopped in for the ride.  Yeah, riding dirty in Kerbal Space Program.300+ hours in, and I've only begun building space stations.  I've only landed on a handful of planets and moons.  The call for exploration lures me ever upward, even though in my first ever rocket launch, I didn't know better than to not walk out the capsule door mid-flight.  As I fell back to the surface, my body aglow in the flames of reentry, a thought crossed my mind: maybe I should develop a large, mobile catcher's mitt for situations such as these.KSP is a game in which you decide where to go, what to do, what to make, and how many boosters you need to accomplish all of these things--much research has been done on this very subject before you arrived, and the data has always pointed toward ""moar.""KSP is challenging to learn--truly challenging.  It is also so, so very rewarding.  You WILL learn a lot, and you WILL explode.  Often, and, at least as you take your first tentative steps skyward, with great consistency.   But one fine day, as you become the first Kerbal to step on another planet, you will remember.  You will remember the first time you made it to space as the hook that did not let go.  You will remember your first orbital docking with nearly the same sense of relish as the first time you made love.  You will remember landing on the Mun--not crashing, but landing--and the look on that brave Kerbonaut's face after looking around on the Munar surface and realizing you had neglected to make plans for bringing him back home.Next time, you note, you will be more prepared to cross another item off the list of things that can't be done.

												Why are you still not playing it? This game is as pivotal to sandbox games as was minecraft , but in a completely different department - depth.Simulated solar system, chance to experience and learn real (almost - still cut some corners - no la-grande points, orbits are mostly radial without additional simulation after a swing, but none the less) rocket science.Sense of achievement with this game is as huge as in dwarf fortress, when through error, misery, failure, countless tries you finally get your ♥♥♥ to <s>mars</s> Duna. And it only goes up from there.And then there are mods. My. GOD. Modding scene for this game gone above and beyond: You want attachment systems? Sure. You want to mine? Since 1.0 - embedded, but there are also kethane and open resource system. You want to build rockets on distant planets - sure - Extraplanetary launchpads got you covered. You want even more? How about warp drive and additional systems mod? Want more realism? TAS Mods got you covered with food, water and waste resources. Want working actuators? Infernal robotics got you covered.I got more than 600 hours of gameplay out of this game (300+ on steam, 300 prior) and it still has a little bit more to offer, and with newer mods coming around - it is always fun to occasionally get back to it. This game is like a good song or a good movie - memorable, can be watched/listened a dozen times and never gets old.So, once again, why are you still not playing it?			"

								Kerbal Space Program offers an immense amount of tinkering away at spacecraft that fail and fly.  Spending a few minutes slapping something together that barely gets off the ground can give some satisfying laughs. But when you've spent a good bit of time perfecting a craft and getting to the many milestones (getting airborne, breaking atmosphere, maintaining orbit, landing on The Mun) you'll have so much pride in yourself for accomplishing something that you'll feel like a rocket scientist.  The physics at play in KSP can allow a previously failed launch to have a chance of succeeding next time so taking several attempts is rewarded (don't give up).  Trial and error is what drives this game and if you love the idea of ironing out the wrinkles in your design and watching it pay off, then you won't be disappointed at all in KSP.  Let your creativity and problem solving skills run wild!			"

								Rocket Science! Explosions! Fun!Kerbal Space Program (KSP) puts you in charge of a space agency (think NASA) whose goals are... actually that's pretty much up to you. The game's career mode will give you missions you can accept, such as ""get a rocket into orbit"" or ""land on the Mun (Moon),"" and you get rewards for doing so such as research points to unlock more modules, prestige to do... stuff, and monies to pay for things. But really you can do whatever you please. And outside of career mode which structures your objectives and gameplay to an extent is a sandbox mode that lets you do as you please without worrying about unlocking things or having money for them.The game basically has two main aspects (three if you include the Career Mode stuff described above): building stuff to send into space, and then launching that stuff and making it do other stuff. Designing successful rockets (and later on spaceplanes) can be a bit difficult, since you have to worry about stuff like the weight, the power of the engines, maneuverability, and more. The 1.0 Update plans to add a tool that will let you see potential problems with your designs before you actually try them out, but until then you basically just have to wing it and hope that your designs don't crash or explode in a spectacular manner.Once you have your designed rockets (or spaceplanes), then you get to launch them and perform whatever ""mission"" you have chosen for yourself. You have to fly the craft yourself, which often requires great precision and timing. Assuming you don't just crash and die horribly, your biggest concern is fuel, and running out of it at a bad moment can make you go back down towards the planet (you did attach a parachute, right?) or leave you drifting in space unable to return home unless you can find some way to rescue them.This is not an easy game even on easy difficulty settings, but it is one that can give a real feeling of accomplishment when you make successful designs, achieve your first orbit, make that fateful landing on the Mun, and much more. It gives you an appreciation for the difficulties that real world space agencies face when planning or performing such missions.At the time of writing, KSP is still in early access, though its full release is not too distant. Regardless, this game is fully playable now and stands as one of the best early access games ever to make it to Steam. If you are interested in Science, and specifically space exploration, then you really should check this game out. Actually... if you like games period you should try this out. There is a demo, though it is of an older version of the game and therefore has far less than the main game does.Difficult, often frustrating, and yet an excellent game that makes you feel great when you succeed at something in it. :3			"

												Kerbal Space Program is probably the best Early Access game out there. Yes, it's even better than DayZ. It's an amazing game, and I don't even purchase simulators. If I buy a game from a genre I don't like/care less about, then you know that I knew something was up with the game. I'm not much of a Early Access guy, but this game was quite an exception.GraphicsThe visuals, unfortunately, are pretty weak so far. The textures look like those from games where the textures are glitched and it's all blurry. The Kerbonauts are also not much better. However, the graphics look nice on occasion, so it's not bad everywhere. Not much to say about visuals in this game.GameplayThe gameplay is much like a simulator (which it is) where you build a ship and launch it, and with the proper ship, you can either get to the Mun and beyond, or crash and burn and possibly kill Jebediah Kerman. And if you DO kill Jeb, then I will find you and make sure that neck of yours makes a mighty fine snapping noise as you collapse to the ground. Anyway, the construction is solid and is easy to learn. Just be warned though, you will need to know the basics to physics if you want to make a decent ship. To add on to that, the pilot controls are also solid and makes the game more difficult in a good way. Why else do you think I enjoyed FTL, Super Meat Boy, Dark Souls, and all of the other throw-your-controller/keyboard-at-the-wall simulators? The only con to the gameplay is that the learning curve can be quite steep and requires lots of blood, sweat, and tears (Okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration) into the game. But, we'll get into replayability later.StoryThe story? Well, there is absolutely no story in this game whatsoever. No trace. There's a small amount of lore, but that's it. The story to this game will NOT be counted towards KSP's final score.AudioThe audio is decent, but the noises keep looping and it sounds repetitive and it needs lots of work. However, I love the songs a lot, so that'll boost the score quite a bit for this game.ReplayabilityThe replayability is very, very, very, high. This is one of the few games on Steam that could easily take 1000 hours of your life, sitting on the throne alongside Team Fortress 2, Dota 2, Skyrim, and a few others. There is so much trial and error in the game that for you to actually get to the Mun, it would take you hours after hours after hours. Look at the other reviews' hours. I only have a small amount, but let's use common sense: Most of the reviews have over 1k hours logged into the game, so what does that mean? Does it have high or low replayability? That's what I thought. The reasons the game is highly replayable was explained in the Gameplay part of the review already.VerdictIn the end, Kerbal Space Program is an impressive and difficult space simulator. Despite a few flaws, this game is well worth the price and is worth buying, Early Access or not. I highly recommend the game. Why waste your time dealing with connecting into servers and getting captured by bandits all the time in DayZ when you could build a bunch of ships and then watch them all burn to the ground after failing miserably and then decide that if Jeb dies, you need to restart the launch or else I WILL FIND YOU- I mean, you will get sad. Oops. Graphics- 5/10Gameplay- 8.5/10Story- NONEAudio- 6/10Replayability- 10/10.:7.7/10:.+Monsterous amount of replayability+Funny ways to watch your ships crash+Solid piloting controls+Simple-to-learn but hard-to-master construction+Great songs-Required experience at physics and other things to understand the game-Mediocre visuals-Small amounts of audio, loops sound boring			"

								This is: - how to do edutainment - a demonstration of the power of adding a little personality to an otherwise dry and difficult challenge, making failure hilarious instead, and success all that sweeter - sufficiently gameified that you can get to the moon-analogue and back using a wobbly stack of exploding things, steering with WASD, and do it within a few hours rather than years of meticulous planning and precision engineering - sufficiently accurate in the broad strokes that you can get a really good gut understanding of rocket science and orbital mechanics, and one of the most notable Lets Play-ers (Scott Manley) has a couple of physics and astronomy degrees - absolutely thriving with mods to push it further into either direction if you so desire (and as a pure utility, Kerbal Alarm Clock is excellent for managing scaling up to multiple concurrent interplanetary missions) - far, far more rewarding than a ""level up!"" screen when you set yourself a dot in the sky to visit, and finally make it there and back intact - an early access game which is worth the (inevitable sale) money for what's already been made (writing this as of version 0.23), not some nebulous future potential - why I have not had any ""free time"" for the past month - JEBEDIAH KERMAN, THRILLMASTER			"

But this game is really much more than that - You actually colonize the space with Your own custom built space stations, planetary landers, planetary bases, rovers and anything Your imagination can create. And the ""building bricks"" are based on real world counterparts - no teleporters or stargates here. Should this game have a story like Mass Effect and space trading economy like X3 series, it would be my dream game come true.I would highly recommend this game to everyone who dares to test his own creativity in building sophisticated craft that can actually fly and land on distant planets and moons.And You will have to land there if You are playng campaing mode, because that is a way You gather more science data for Your scientists and You will need that to learn better components for Your spacecrafts.This game has also a huge modding comunity already that have created a lot of content that can extend a stock functionality.There are also tons of tutorials on Youtube that will explain a game in detail and a dedicated wiki to learn more.Try not to be distracted by appearances of those kerbals - they will share Your passion of flying high and far away and they will show their appreciation if You do things right! :) Have fun and fly safe!

Early Access Review
								Imagine, if you will, any alien race on another planet.  Image them looking up at the stars and trying to reach them.  We went through our own space program in the 60s, and we got a taste of what it means to leave your own gravity well.  Well, certainly we can't be the only species trying to do this.  Playing Kerbal Space Program makes me feel connected to every other species attempting to leave their home planet.  It's not just us on Earth, but everywhere.  KSP makes me feel like I have NASA in my backyard and can throw together a rocket and try it out whenever I like.  I recommend this game for young and old alike.  If you like rockets because they're cool or because you remember Neil saying those memorable words, please play this game!			"

												This is far and away the most entertaining game I've ever played. Which is not to say that an FPS isn't more exciting or anything, but because of the stellar physics engine and the game's foundation in real-world orbital physics, I have never had my brain more taxed while learning to play a game. And because of that, when you finally do succeed in a Mun landing, or even your first Kerbin orbit, the amount of satisfaction is just insane. Because it's not *just* about better reflexes, or a stronger sense of strategy—You succeed in KSP based on *actual knowledge* gained during gameplay. (And many, many hours of tutorials and failure...)So yeah. Get it. It'll satisfy all kinds of nerdery in the best way.			"

												Thought about Space and stuff, bought this game.Learn actual science like orbital mechanism.Build rockets and shoot for the stars (Moons).10/10 - IGN ""It's OKAY.""Okay, I think it's time for me to have a serious review. Here we go.This game has one of the most helpful community ever. Its modding potential is unlimited after the release of 64bit game, and just the community itself is worth buying the game.Even without modding, the stock game itself is already marvelously designed and delivered by Squad. It worth hundreds of hours of gameplay.With the orbital model of Patched Conics, you can apply many real-life maneuvers like exploiting the Oberth Effect. You can play the game without KER or Mechjeb 2, as you can just use the third Kepler law to calculate most information you need just by the apoapsis and periapse. Of course, it is also easy to play just without all the fancy math, just with lower efficiency ;)I would personally describe playing the Kerbal Space Program as an interactive learning experience. It is one of the best learning experience I've ever had, as it requires me to learn the real-world science. I would have to thank Squad for creating this incredible game, as it opened the door of aerospace engineering as well as astrometry. With the introduction of KSPedia, it is now even easier for new players to get into the game. In many senses, with the help of Realism Overhaul, Kerbal Space Program is a simulator. I do not care what people say about how ""the Orbiter"" is the only real space simulator, as Kerbal Space Program is one of the best indie game, hands down.EDIT: CKAN saves life. Seriously. If you are trying to play Realism Overhaul please use CKAN. It saves time and eliminate human errors.			"

												Boiled down to it's very core it's a physics symulator. Under that catagory, it's the best physics symulator out there. Go to another generality, say it's a space game. It's the best space game I've ever played. Go specific, it's a game where you start on one big potato, and explore other potatos in space. It's unique, it's physics-ey, it will teach you about space, and it's got mods flowing from every crack. 10/10, this game sets a really high bar, and then jeb flies a rocket all the way up to that bar, then runs out of fuel on the burn back to Kerben.

								Kerbal Space Program is one of the best sandbox games I've played, even though it is currently in development. You are given unlimited possibilities in a number of settings, be it orbit, on the surface of your home planet Kerbin, or even on another heavenly body, such as the cleverly named Mün, or Duna, a Mars like planet.  On the sandbox aspect, you are given loads of different odds and ends to do as you please with, and the only limit is your imagination.  Things like replica space-planes, and huge space-stations await you in this new universe. Don't expect to be a pro right away though, as fifty-one hours into the game even I still have mishaps. The KSP community is incredibly supportive however, and there are great sources for help. If you get bored with what the developers give you, it is made incredibly easy to add plugins and part-packs to the game, with a website called the SpacePort. KSP is a great game for all ages, too, because unlike the theme nowadays of shoot-em-up and gore, you are challenged with expanding the frontiers of your own race of little green men.			"

												First game on Steam I've been willing to take time to write a because I feel this game deserves it. Yes it's a long review, however again, this game deserves it.GAME DESCRIPTION:You own the Kerbal Space Program and your facility is equipped to launch various rockets off the launch pad or aircraft off a runway to send items in orbit, dock with orbiting stations, travel/survey/land on other planets, conduct science experiments, take samples and materials from planets/asteroids, build bases on other planets, or just explore. Campaign mode allows you to start with very basic rocketry equipment and buildings in which you can accept contracts that offers rewards of money and science you can use to purchase upgrades of buildings and research additional items to further your mission capabilities. In addition, you can hire new Kerbals to your crew that includes pilots, scientist, and engineers and advance their effectiveness with each successful mission. If you'd like to skip to the good stuff and jump right into the action, you can play in Sandbox mode which already has everything unlocked and nothing cost money. Sandbox mode also allows you to save your progress so you can always comeback and continue sending things up in space. PROS:+The unbelievably accurate physics and mechanics are always fun+Near endless possibilities of various rockets, satellites, space stations you can build. +Can send fueling ports, stations, satellites, or rockets in orbit and let them orbit in real-time while you build something else to dock, refuel, rendezvous with it, etc. You could do this 100s of times and have thousands of things orbiting whatever celestial body you chose. +Can be played as a sandbox type game or campaign +The solar system is insanely vast. If you were not not speed up time in travel, travel time is very accurate. 2 days to get to the moon and years to get to the outer planets (in near real-time). Thank God they included time warp lol!+Extremely HARD at first = pure joy and satisfication when you accomplish what you're trying to acheive.+Music is fun and fitting depending upon your location. Beautiful galatic music plays in space+Beautiful space visuals. Although I'd recommend a few visual mods to enchance this+Minimal bugs/glitches. I've had one crash of the game in 60 hours, however I believe it was my computer :). Otherwise, I haven't ran into any gamebreaking glitches. +User interface for building the rocket is VERY user friendly and makes it downright fun to use your imagination to build somethingCONS:-I feel the tutorials are lacking. While there are some tutorials to help you get started and they're very helpful, There's nothing that really explains what most of the items to build your rocket do. Instead, most item descriptions are just funny little paragraphs that doesn't always explain the item's function. While I do like the comical approach and it seems fitting for the game, it should at least always say exactly what function the item serves and/or why you may need it. Or, there should be a tutorial on every item and it's use (like what batteries, docking ports, thermal reactors, decouplers, etc. do)-While I did state in the pros there's endless possibilites of what you can build, I still feel almost all items available are still lacking in variety - such as engines, fuel tanks, lights, batteries, RCS pods, science, structural, and aerodynamics to name a few. Mods do ease this and offer many more to chose from, however I've found many mods to be graphically glitchy and some I've found that do work I felt should've been included stock in game. -Campaign contract requirements are VERY aggravating at times. Sometimes they make no sense and feel out of place. For example, one contract has you test a specific rocket while submerged in water...really? So you have to launch, navigate over water, land safely in the water, and then boost your rockets while submerged - in which they do absolutely nothing other than just burn out...just weird, but ok (yes I realize some planets have water). Some people may like this, but I've found no use for contracts like these.  In addition to the above, I feel the contracts cause the campaign to way too slow and become frustrating due to them being tedious and many being repetive that require you to test the same item, but it just changes the requirements making it a pain in the ♥♥♥. For example, one rocket you may have to just test at 50,000km...easy enough. But then another contract will be offered to test the same item, but at 52,000km, not in orbit, and within 450-500m/s. So you may be at 52,000km but if you test it at 501m/s or 449m/s, you fail. Quite aggravating and again, this may not be a con for some, but I feel tests/contracts like these are a waste of time spending hours trying to get everything right, making the campaign move and feel VERY slow and near non-rewarding. OVERALL:That said, if you like space or anything space related, get this...period. I've played 75 hours and I've litterally scratched the surface of what you can do. I've managed to place items into orbit, build and dock stations, orbit satellites for research, and land and return from the moon. However, I still have yet to learn building rovers, advanced science stations, traveling to other planets, etc.  When I zoom out after I've traveled to the moon and look at the solar system, it's insane how large the solar system is. It makes it look like I've just merely accomplished stepping out on my front doorstep - even though the in-game and real-world travel time was days. This game offers thousands of hours of gameplay and I've not come remotely close to losing interest. It's no doubt the best (if not only) realistic space-mission simulator with nearly an endless amount of possibilities and customizations. It lets your imaginations run wild. However, that said, be warned it's a simulator that takes patience! If you lack patience, this is not for you. But if you have patience, when you finally accomplish what you want the feeling of satisfaction is like no other! RATING: 8.5/10-1.5 as I do feel the campaign could be a bit better if it offered better contracts making it easier to get into, some item choices lack variety (again, alleviated with mods), and item's descriptions, tutorials, and purpose of use is severely lackingEdit: Thank you Kevin for pointing out the saving process. It's not described anywhere in game (that I could find), so thank you for that.			"

Short Version: Wonderful engineering game. Great challenges, countless hours of fun, very satisfying experience. The more effort you put into learning how to play the more rewarding the game becomes. I believe that KSP is an absolute must-have game for anyone who likes building things.Long Version: Pros: Challenging tasks that require significant planning and engineeringI've probably spent two-thirds of my game time simply starring at the vehicle assembly window planning and tinkering with my space ships to get them to perform a specific job. This game heavily rewards forethought and competence. Wide variety of vessel components that can be combined in virtually limitless waysAfter you've unlocked most of the tech tree (or in sandbox) you have a lot of parts at your disposal. With some talent and imagination you can craft some astonishingly clever (and beautiful) space craft. Intuitive and flexible ship building systemThe one thing in this game that doesn't take 20 hours of research to be competent with is the vehicle assembly system. Even a complete novice can launch the game and start sticking parts together (learning the parts is another story). But like everything else, there is a skill to it, and it rewards learning advance techniques. Players are encouraged to ""eyeball it"" and fly their rockets manuallyPersonally, I like that the game wants me to fly by the seat of my pants and guide my space ships by hand. It is very rewarding to learn orbital mechanics and figure out how to maneuver my rocket. Endlessly mod-ableThe developers spent some time to make almost every aspect of the game open for modding. Thanks to this effort there is a very healthy ecosystem of mods that can change the game to your preference. EducationalWhile not the primary focus of the game, you will learn about physics in space. Orbital mechanics, delta V, acceleration and mass, just to name a few.Cons: Vessel physics is really quite badWobbly ships that act like they're held together with rubber bands. For a game which is basically a big physics simulator, the one place where the physics engine actually matters completely falls short. This can be seriously frustrating when it destroys rockets for no obvious reason. The game chokes on large or complex shipsEarly on you will notice that there is a ""Part count"" number shown when building ships. Later on you will learn why. When you reach a certain number of parts (the number varies based on computer performance) the game starts choking and has major FPS drops. If you're building a very large space station you may find that it becomes nearly unplayable as you add more components. No tutorial or basic flight school to help new players become proficientThis game has an exponential learning curve. Unfortunately new players have virtually no in-game resources to learn basic flight proficiency. Just accept that you're going to have to do some research and watch hours of youtube videos before you have a chance of even reaching one of the moons. Little to do on other celestial bodiesWhile the addition of resources has helped greatly, nine times out of ten, after spending hours designing your vessel, carefully planning and timing your flight, and painstakingly setting down on another world - you will step out, look around for 10 seconds, then hop back in and fly home. It's really rather anti-climactic. "

								KSP is like Dwarf Fortress but with less dwarven fortresses and more space!It´s a game where you decide what you do.You could build a space station, a base on the Mün, a VTOL to cruise on the planet Kerbin, a network of sattelites, some space fighters to destroy previously build stations or something completly different.Also, KSP is damm hard. You can´t even get into orbit without knowing what you do. A degree in space could help!If you´re somewhat connected with the KSP community, you will learn tons of new terms like Kessler Syndrom, Hohmann transfer, apoapsis, periapsis, prograde, retrograde, aerobrake, gravity turn and many more!

I have probably played no less than 1000 hours of this overall, as after a while I moved away from my ""vanilla"" steam save and began going nuts in RSS. Highly recommend this game for anyone who's curious about how it is that the aerospace industry works; yes, it's very unrealistic in some aspects (such as the fact that Kerbin seems to be twice as dense as osmium), but the incredibly diverse and lively modding community more than makes up for any of those concerns. This game is as hard as you want to make it, and as realistic as you want to make it, with the single exception of N-body mechanics. That, however, is something that everyone will have to suck up, if only because time warp would no longer function usefully.			"

												After 40 hours of play, I finally managed to land on the Mun. After spending a couple of minutes there, and the mandatory flag planting, we headed back to Kerbin. I was about to bask in the glory of Mun landing, but upon descending, somehow the parachute was not enough to slow down the crew module for a safe landing.Needles to say the 3 brave Kerbals came back from the darkness of space just to end their lives in the darkness of the deep sea.

												An amazing flight/space simulator, with amazing depth and detail, as well as vast scope. From building space-pleanes(and not-so-space planes), to hi-tech rockets to land on everything from the mun to Dres, as well as do orbital science, this game is a incredible space program simulator. In addition, it is fully modable(and has a huge modding community with hundreds if not thousands of mods), and has cooperated with big-name groups like the ESA and NASA. I highly recommend buying this, and i can only say, there is no such thing as to many struts, and check(and then RE-check) your stages. And then check them for a third time, just to be sure........Easily, 11/10Addendum:With the update to 1.0, this game only gets better, They redid the atmospheric model, tweaked all the parts to be more realistic, and added tons of new parts to the game. And of course, if its something they didnt include, you can be sure some modder on Curse or the KSP forums made a mod for it. It is so expansive, i cant even go over all of it here. Check out Scott Manley's YouTube channel for in-depth learning on how to play, and just get right into it, it is well worth the buy, and the time. 20/10.			"

								I bought this game during one of the Steam sales a year or so ago. I did not start playing until 3 days ago. After 3 days playing, I'm at 21.7 hours. -Am I playing because I couldn't attend Space Camp back in the day?  Yes-Am I playing because I'm still waiting for NASA to give me a response to the Astronaut application I sent them?  Yes-Am I playing because the Johnson Space Center in Houston has blocked me from attending ""Meet an Astronaut Friday""?  Yes, but please don't tell the authorities!Great game! You get to build your own space craft, satellite, Lunar Lander. You can go to the Mun!  Honestly, one of the best things about this game is the fact that you can build your own space craft and THEN optimize your craft to try and conquer the galaxy. A problem solving game at it's finest!

												From the papers of Wojak Feel 2/26/1962:I have enjoyed every second of the 220 hours that I have played of this game. I have built over 2000 spaceships for the Kerbals so that they can get to the various planets in their solar system. It is a process of trial and error in building these spaceships since they tend to fall apart quite easily and when they do it has catastrophic results for the Kerbals manning them. I have conducted inventory this past Tuesday and I can report that as of this past week 26,000 Kerbals have lost their lives in service to their planet. The families of these Kerbals receive my deepest condolences and I am putting forth a motion with the Interplanetary League of Kerbal Nations (ILKN) to aid in providing financial reimbursement to help with funeral expenses and life insurance claims. In watching these brave Kerbals and Gerbals lose their lives I have inadvertently discovered a new passion. Killing Kerbals is to date the most exhilarating thing I have ever done. I thoroughly enjoy watching the life slip out of the eyes of these Kerbals as they are crushed under structural beams after the collapse of a separator ring or as they suffocate after the cabin is flooded with carbon monoxide due to an engine malfunction. I am therefore issuing a call to arms to the rest of the galaxy. This vermin has lived under us for long enough. I will petition the various solar systems to supply me with the necessary forces to complete my mission of mass genocide. I see the future as a joyous one where, having crushed the Kerbals, the various nations of this great galaxy of ours can rise above the shattered remains of the Kerbal Empire and join hands as a beautifully diverse master race. This is the promise I make to you my listeners: I will thoroughly destroy the Kerbals and everything they hold dear. I will be the scourge of the Kerbal Empire and will not rest until every last insignificant spec of Kerbal scum burns and I can take my place as king of the ashes. I swear by the staff of Jehovah that by the time I die, I will have destroyed every last trace of the Kerbal Empire and its commonwealth. I will meet every Kerbal I find without mercy or remorse. I will expend every resource I have to wipe the Kerbals off the face of every planet that they inhabit. No matter where they run, no matter what loyalist swine that they cower behind, I will seek out and destroy them with brutal efficiency. There will be no leniency, no forgiveness, no chance for appeal. The empire and its corrupt senators will be a stain on the face of history and even after their obliteration I will work tirelessly to make sure that this stain is thoroughly bleached out. I am also announcing the re-militarization of the Koprulu sector once the arms embargo is lifted. The annexed Kerbal colony on Duna will be used as a base of operations for this re-militarization and I am currently in negotiations with the Aldemari Republic to supply several Minotaur-Class fleets for the rebel navy including battle cruisers, frigates, and capitol ships. We have hired many privateering firms including the famous Black Sun crime syndicate to undertake raids on the Kerbals' trade routes. These privateers should not be needed for long however, as I have issued a galaxy wide decree that whoever does not cease all trade with the Kerbals by star-date 66155.3 will suffer the full extent of my power. In order to destroy the Kerbals we must also neutralize the solar systems allied with them. The Kerbal allied systems as well as their hired mercenary groups are as follows: Kairon, Flaxo, Kelnar, Ara Aquarii, Aquila Icarus, Calesius prime, Zodiac-355, Oculus cloud, Xm-934, and BBA 19J. I will give each of these systems a chance to pledge allegiance to the rebel cause before they are utterly destroyed. In order to disarm the vast Kerbal military I have issued arrest warrants for over 3000 Kerbal army officers. Further I am offering a reward of 600,000 xaljats to anyone who manages to apprehend the band of outlaws known as the Kerman Brothers. I will see Commander Jebediah Kerman of the 35th Kerbal regiment brought to justice for his crimes against the United Galactic Federation and will use the planet destroying laser currently in development to obliterate his home world of Kerbin prime while he watches. I can assure you that he will not be able to talk his way out of this punishment like he has so many times before. He will be helpless to save his planet just like I was helpless to save mine. In conclusion, I will impart with you the famous last words of Admiral Jorney Kerman before I flayed him alive at the Battle of Kelnard's pass: ""I really wish I wasn't here right now. Uh oh now my skin is gone."" "

												This game is absolutely amazing.This game, however, has one big problem.This game is not challenging enough, nor is it dangerous enough.I mean seriously, it's space, stuff is supposed to go wrong. The only time anything bad happens is when I forget to put on a part. The planets have no storms or anything that happens on them, they're just bland balls of ground and water with no real dangers. Everything runs perfectly as if God himself made every single part that you put on your spacecraft, and the only issues are the assembly flaws created by yourself in the VAB.The game is amazing, it's just BORING now. Not enough challenge, no danger, no action whatsoever. The only time kerbals die is because you miscalculated something or forgot something or are trying to figure out something by trial and error. There should be actual dangers that you must deal with, such as storms on all the planets with atmospheres, especially Jool because it's a gas giant and so that aerobraking becomes risky, make things spontaneously malfunction and go wrong (I have Dangit and still nothing bad happens, it's just a ""part lifetime"" addon). The only challenge with this game is trying to get as much DeltaV on your spaceship as you can fit onto it with the best Thrust to Weight ratio you can get (and making sure you don't forget the parachutes). Some people like that. I don't. Does that mean I don't like the game?Of course not. Buy it now. Or I'll kill your dog!(kidding)			"

												Never in my life would I have thought that I would ever learn things like prograde and retrograde, apoapsis and periapsis, orbital mechanics, delta-V, decouplers, aerodynamics, the relationship between centre of thrust, centre of lift and centre of mass. And never in my life would I have thought I would have so much fun in doing so.This game has a very steep learning curve, but part of the fun (and frustration) is experimenting and trying out new ideas - and failing, and then failing again. But once you reach the eventual success of designing a vessel that could complete that pesky contract, or completing your first orbit, or successfully landing on the Mun without toppling over for the seventh time, it feels like all those hours repeatedly failing (and having fun) had really been nothing.

												For anyone that enjoys a challenging learning curve, building stuff that works and is interested in spaceflight this game is a must have.I have played this game a lot, and I can only reccomend it. There is a staggering amount of things to do, and more ways to go about accomplishing these things than can be listed.One thing that really strikes me is that there is always room for improvement. Sure you can build a humungus rocket to go to the moon, but maybe you are like me and like a challenge, so instead you take the time to perfect the rocket and get there and back with barely any margin.With KSP Squad has managed to make a remarkable game, one of a kind, and one that will be played for a long time. They continously keep updating the game with new content, tweaks etc., the community is great and the modding community in particular is stunning. Some of the Devs even have their own mods, pet projects etc. and the general quality standard for mods is incredibly high.KSP's aerodynamics are too simple? There is a mod for that!Bigger rocktes?  There is a mod for that!SciFi looking parts?  There is a mod for that!In depth colonization and resource system? Non-OP Space age technology (fusion, plasma etc)? Real scale everything? Realism? Beautification?  There is a mod each and every one of these and far, far more! And CKAN makes it ridiculously easy to install them all.TLDR; BUY THIS GAME			"

								I'm one of those people who never bought a game, relying on piracy for almost 15 years. KSP changed that.During more than one year of playing it and perhaps even 2000 hours of game time collected, I've never regret the spent money.As this is a work in progress, it can't be fully evaluated, but judging by the current status, it has crossed the line of just having a potential to become big. It really became big.Its Unity engine doesn't allow it to be very flexible for the developers because the bottleneck is Unity itself. Nevertheless, the game graphics is visually appealing.This is one of the most stable WIP games ever. Crashes are very rare even if one tweaks the game using various plugins and mods.It's educational, it's open to expanding by others and the community is fantastic. One of the most peaceful communities I've encountered online, probably due to the fact that such games aren't generally appealing to aggressive types of people.There is still much work to be done, but I already see this as one of the games that will become important in the history of computer games.

								A must have for space/rocket fans!KSP provides a large set of components and functionality with a relatively bug-free simulation of physics. I've read reviews mentioning repetitive crashes or the lack of Steam Workshop integration, I personally had 2 KSP crashes in all my game time (77 hours) so that is fairly alright. The mod installation is as simple as putting the mod folder into your GameData folder, that's it.Talking about mods, the mod support seems to be great. I've never looked into modding it myself, but since there are mods adding mineable ressources to planetoids or doing complete mapping scans from certain orbits there is a lot of room there :)Who do I recommend this to?""Engineers"": People that like to Trial&Error in games, that like taking challenges and eventually mastering them. In KSP, the difficulty of these challenges depends on you (i.e. sending two rockets with station segments into orbit or try it in one turn, which is more cost efficient etc etc)""Organizers"": People that love doing stuff as calculating orbits (orbital period, ""best suitable inclination"" and so on), Thrust-To-Mass Ratios and all the tons of numbers you find in rocket science :P""Pilots"": People that have fun with coordinating a vessel in space near a fragile station to it's docking port ;)Most of you will be all three of them, but interestingly you can lay your focus on whichever you want.Also the humor of the game is amazing, so from my side:A BIG YES to Kerbal Space Program!(PS: If you decide to buy it now, check out Scott Manley's KSP tutorials. He's kind of the iconic figure of KSP tutorials and it will make your first hours a LOT more understandable)			"

								One of the best simulation games out there, by far better than pretty much any other space sim game I've found. Beats the Buzz Aldrin new release by galaxies. Devs are responsive, mod community is great. Even great guys on Twitch streaming how to do things. This is just in beta now but it has so much you can do and with the mods out there you can quite literally make it as easy or hard as you want. Want to worry about life support? Sure! Want to have nasty heat reentry problems? there's a mod for that! And they keep adding some of the best mod elements to the game as well, and are constantly improving it. I recommend this to anyone almost. Sure no shooting but they do have a mod out there that lets you build things with bombs and the like and there /is/ a multiplayer mod so maybe? Ha!I'd say it isn't rocket science but it is! But it is accessable rocket science. :D			"

								Have you even thought, ""man i wanna go to space yo"". Don't lie, you have.Kerbal Space Program here says, ""ye man you can go do whatever in space yo""Both beginners and advanced players can easy start out in this game. It's simple, stick rockets on some capsule and press space. Or, y'know, create a multistage rocket that docks to a space station orbiting the planet to refuel and then land a science rover on the far away planet, and then create a return mission in order to recover the science found on the body and use it to further your research. Easy. I mean, it's only rocket science, right?			"

								I'm a space enthusiast. I saw a video about KSP which depicted it as a silly and unrealistic game that made fun of serious efforts to explore space. Thankfully, my curiosity got the better of me and I decided to give the game a go. I'm glad I did.This is a game where I can design, build and fly spacecraft designed any way I like. The game is set in a fictional solar system filled with analogues of planets and moons of our own solar system. I can recreate past and present missions, learning how to land on KSP's Moon analogue, or construct and dock with a space station of my own design. I can also act out proposed future missions by visiting KSP's Mars analogue or other planetary body analogues.The game is not yet fully mature. We do not yet have realistic re-entry heating. We are not yet able to establish bases to utilise in-situ resources. These features are in development and will be implemented in due course. The next feature we are eagerly awaiting is an overhaul of aerodynamics and implementation of payload fairings and cargo bays.KSP is realistic without being inaccessible. I'm currently on 1434 hours played without installing any mods.			"

												People always talk about making games that are both fun and educational, lets be honest, most fail for one reason or another, not Kerbal! Kerbal space program, Coming in I didn't even understand how much I didn't know about orbital mechanics! But Kerbal space program unravels these secrets in a paced and comprehensive order and most importantly, its fun while doing it. Everything from the designing the rocket to performing the actual mission, you don't get near space the first few tries but you feel yourself improving every time, and every stage feels awe inspiring. My first Apollo style moon landing was a highlight to my summer for the sense of acomplishment it entailed. Even faliure can be fun, run out of fuel to early? mess up your design and realize after you make it to Duna?(mars), figure out what parts of the mission are salvageable, what science can still be performed. My first mission to Duna ran out of fuel before making into orbit but I was able to use the rotation control rockets to alter my path just enough to fling around its moon and slam into Dunas thin atmosphere to slow myself down. It's that kind of clever problem solving that brings the most satisfaction sometimes.			"

								The more I play this game, the more I love it. Really, not enough good things can be said about this game. On the surface, it's cute and funny. Go a little deeper and you will find a surprisingly complex and intelligent space simulator, where you will learn something new every time you play it. Honestly, I'd pay twice the price for this much fun. $22.99 is a steal, and 300 hours in, I'm looking at 7 cents per hour for a hell of a good time. The mod community is also very vibrant and adds literally anything you can imagine: new paint jobs, altered physics, communication, fusion-powered engines, warp drives, hyperspace, and even asteroids.

												I came to this came on the wave of Reddit hype a few years ago since then, I have: put it down, deleted, reintalled, flung mice around my room, printed off screenshots and actually shouted in triumph upon landing on the Mun.The worth of a game, a film, of art in general comes down to the emotional response it elicits. KSP has caused me actual ♥♥♥♥ing trauma, total euphoria, crushing despondancy, childlike wonder, intellectual overreach and many other feelings beyond mere words.Building a rocket, blowing up said rocket on the launch pad, fixing the staging, running out of fuel before circularising, consulting our Lord Scott Manley, circularising, achieving orbit and just staring out the window at tiny Kerbin before burning retrograde and coming back home. To recommend this game, is to recommend the spectrum of life's emotions.			"

												This game is very unique and extremely fun. It is very challenging, but also extremely satisfying when you accomplish something. In addition, it quite expands your knowledge about physics.There is no other game like this, but in some ways it bears similarities to Dwarf Fortress - both games have sharp learning curve, are extremely difficult beyond the very basics (albeit KSP is pretty forgiving) and the lesson you learn from them is that losing is fun. KSP simulates physics very well, it includes objects burning when reentering atmosphere, different gravity on various bodies, and the whole solar system is actually simulated (planets and asteroids orbiting Sun, moons orbiting planets), while the game is a sandbox allowing you to do whatever you want. Do you want to fly to the Moon? Sure. Do you want to do research on an asteroid? Sure. Do you want to take that asteroid down  to Earth? Sure! (But it's not gonna be easy!)Oh, and you do actually learn some physics in the game. You have to. This, however, lets you understand space exploration and why is it so difficult and takes so much time. After all, in KSP you get to do a lot of stuff yourself!The game doesn't have any drawbacks either. Perhaps some rare bugs or crashes, but very few. Other than that, the game is flawless.It's not just the best space game. It's actually one of the best games ever made. I recommend it to literally everyone. Download a demo to try it out first and fly to the Moon.			"

												In Kerbal Space Program the player is tasked with managing their own space program. This generally involves building some sort of craft capable of a specific task and/or reaching one or more bodies in the Kerbol system. It has multiple modes to cater to different playstyles, a simplistic but harsh physics system and a lot of parts for you to choose from when making your contraptions. The gameThe characters you control, named Kerbals, are cute and most definitely insane. They are the heart and soul of the game, and they seem to like danger a whole lot more than being alive. The brilliance of Kerbal Space Program lies in the way you approach problems. You’re guaranteed to fail almost every time you launch a new craft, and while on paper that doesn’t sound that fun, the game’s revert button allows you to recover from all the launch mistakes and the quick save feature allows you to recover from fatal mistakes on your longer missions. I’d say that most of the fun even comes from your misfortunes: having to send out a second rescue party to send the first and the people originally in danger is something that never ceases to amaze.The fine printThis game is fairly easy to learn, but it will require a lot of commitment to truly grasp everything you can do in this game. While simplistic, the physics are accurate enough to provide a fair representation of ‘true’ astrophysics, and because it’s so close to real life it shouldn’t take too long to understand what is expected of you.The scaled down solar system means you will be playing in a lot shorter sessions than you’d otherwise have to, but this game is still very long. Missions can take up to ten hours and beyond. This is most certainly not a game that you can just hop into for a bit. This does mean that this game’s value is insanely high if you’re looking for something to spend a lot of time on. There is no clear end-game, so if you enjoy the game enough you could end up playing it forever.This game is really easy to mod. So any problems you have with it can be solved by installing more mods, and they often also add content: anything from EVA construction to colonisation to FTL drives. You name it, there’s probably a mod out there for it.The game’s performance is good, with a few bugs here and there. None of them are gamebreaking though, and most of them are due to the engine. I’m hopeful of what Unity 5 will do for this game, but even with Unity 4 this game will run on a lot of systems. Because the game isn’t a graphical powerhouse it actually runs quite well on laptops, but the processor does need to be good to handle all the physics. Summary+ High value for money+ A large amount of parts to choose from+ Simple yet fun physics- Long play sessions- A few bugsConclusionWhether you like building insane contraptions, setting up missions to places far away, or just have an unreasonable obsession with space you will find a lot to like in this game. And who knows, maybe you’ll even pick up a thing or two about how spaceflight works.			"

The learning curve is steep and the tutorials aren't very good (though youtube has all the tutorial videos you could want) but it's rewarding if you stick with it and once skills are learned, like orbits, landing and docking, they become second nature.

								This is seriously one of the greatest creations of the modern era. Design, build and fly your rockets into space, the moon and beyond. With multiple planets and accompanying moons to explore. Build space stations like the ISS or a moonbase, all with docking capabilities. Then take your little Kerbals out for a space walk and plant flags at your landing sites. With a massive and very active moding community, the only limitation is your imagination.Recently added was the career mode, where you start off with limited parts to build with and you have to venture forth doing science experiment to aquire science points to unlock new or improved parts. You can then build bigger and better vessels, so you can go further and do MORE SCIENCE!!You buy this game right now!			"

								If you are even slightly considering buying this game, then stop thinking and just do it. You will spend countless hours hurling Kerbals at the stars and hoping they'll stick.One caveat though; the secret knowledge of prograde and retrograde, apoapsis and periapsis, radial and normal, is hard-won and not for the faint-hearted. You will fail, gloriously, many many times. You will rejoice over every successful burn, and agonise every time you send a hapless Kerbal spinning off into the infinite night. Good luck, brave adventurer, and remember to add plenty of solar panels.			"

												KSP is a game in which you run a space center, build spacecrafts, launch them and fly them to explore the Kerbin system. Your space empire could be built on a plethora of crew sacrifice, and it will be tedious process to learn to fligth freely. But nothing could bring you so much sense of achievement than standing on the soil of other celestial objects. Only the most intellectual and hardworking one will be awarded.The most attracting portion of this game is building mindblowing spacecrafts and flying them in the space. When you play in career mode, you will have to consider whether it could fly your crew members back to Kerbin safely and whether you could afford it. Every spacecraft is a essense of your mind and your knowledge about astronomy, physics, aerodynamics, etc.10/10 Play this game and kill Jedebiah again!			"

								I bought this game, I don't know, a week ago, I've already put 60 hours into it and loved every minute. It's seriously amazing. There's incredible freedom in sandbox mode, you can design nearly anything you can imagine, as long as you can make it work within the constraints of the physics engine. Worth it! The developers haven't abandoned it either, they're still updating it.			"

								Kerbal Space Program managed to do something that many games are unable to do, they can make me come back to it after being forgotten in 6 months.This game is ludicrously fun, it's got education in it aswell, you can fly rockets to the outer rim of the Kerbol System, Fly SSTOs to docking stations and then proceeding to land in the arctic, Drive rovers over mountains and make sucky boats unless you put Vac. Co. Air intakes on the under side of it, all of these things can be simple or ridiculously complicated (As in, you build a spaceplane, it looks awesome and when you put it on the runway, you start the engines only to find that the plane does the immelmann maneuver and crashes into the ground in a fireball as soon as it gain flight.)There are also a lot of very well hidden easter eggs on other planets that are really hard to find without some videos giving you co-ordinates, one of the easier easter eggs is the monolith near the Space Center, it appears to be nothing more than a dot at a distanceYou can succeed in this game and feel greatly achieved, with getting all them new modules with the science that you're going to get, or you can fail miserably and have a massive laugh with the 100 megatons worth of volatile kerosene going all over the place, destroying whole parts of the Space Center, until eventually a hell kraken comes and snatches you into space (This a bug that blacks out the screen and frazzles the altimeter)Straight 10/10 for me and likely many others			"

If you are interested in space travel, and astrophysics, try this game!You might learn something. Or, if you are already an expert, you can see with your own eyes how these things really work. Of course, not everything is modelled perfectly, for example, you don't have to worry about the heat during re-entry, the aerodynamic drag works in a kind of a gamey way, and I can guarantee you that some of your earliest designs are gonna resemble a soft, shaking sausage instead of a rocket, but at the end of the day, you are gonna feel like you just built a real rocket.If you are interested in original, deep, addictive, sometimes awe-inspiring games, TRY THIS GAME!!When your build your first orbit-capable rocket.Your first spacewalk.When you first reach Mün.Your first modular space-station.When you first flip and crash your rover on the surface of another planet.When you learn about the fantastic stuff OTHER PEOPLE can build in this game.Just some of the great moments you'll experience in KSP.The game might look complicated, and yes, you CAN build some pretty complicated stuff, but the learning curve is surprisingly easy, of course watching some youtube videos help a lot. Graphically, it's one of the most beautiful games I've ever seen. Yes, the textures are not really detailed, the models aren't, either, but when you first align your rocket against the Sun so you can only see a silhouette, with your pilot next to it on an EVA, when you drive your Rover through Mün's canyon, or when you turn the lights on on your shiny new space station are as screenshot-worthy moments as anything ever.The building possibilites are endless, especially with the great mods out there. Of course, so are the possibilities to explode right at the launch pad. ;)Seriously, try this game, playing KSP is one of the most special experiences any game can give.EDIT: Oh, and don't be bothered by the fact that it's still Early Access, the game is constantly evolving, and felt like a finished game even months ago.

								You can spend hours and hours on this game, This is a really fun game and its not at all rocket science but it does require a bit of learning, took me ane entire day to learn how to land on the mun, then next thing you know I was learning how to leave our solar system, with some mods added and some more work I was able to build monstrous space ship in career mode, my advice is to invest in science and launch to space far!looking forward to more update in this game, need more aesthetic overhaul to the planet and MOAR PLANETS!If you do want to play this game and you're really bad, theres a mod called mechjeb, it will play the game for you, if you're lazy it'll do it for you too. The game is playable by anyone even if you don't understand basic rocket science. Though the elites will frown on you don't let that put you down.+ Build your own rockets+ Build space planes+ Rovers check+ Base on planets check+ Refueling station check+ Diverting asteroids Check+ Great gameplay rocket simulation fun+ Hours and Hours of fun+ You can build space stations, big rockets, fuel stations, even lunar stations Hell you can even build a rover and space shuttle.+ Its not rocket science+ Build rockets YOUR way+Amazing mods going on for this game- A bit steep learning curve, takes time to understand at least a day, and more learning to grasp the concept you'll be educated well. This is a negative if you hate learning- Need more aesthetic overhaul, mods help but the game needs that itself- Need more planets  than just ours, space is big and it should be bigger			"

								How hard could it be? It's only rocket science. If the idea of putting parts to build various flying machines in appealing you you I highly recommend you try this out. It's a got a bit of learning curve but it is worth it. To make things easier on yourself you can skip the in-game tutorials (they mostly confused me) and hop on YouTube instead. Scott Manley has a good tutorial series. This is the link for the playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYu7z3I8tdEmqpOkQZCl5SZB5t0vXuxE0You'll probably want to at least make some attempts at flying prior to jumping to the videos as a lot of the fun of the game can come from failure and cool explosions... not that you'll have a shortage of those later. Rescue missions on distant worlds make for some amusing challenges.			"

												My favorite game. There's so much to do, and so many places to go. A whole  world  solar system of freedom and opportunity awaits!You can play in sandbox, science mode, or career mode. In sandbox mode, you have unlimited funds, and everything is unlocked. In science mode, you have infinite funds, but you need to unlock things with science. In career mode, you have limited funds and science, as well as reputation. You must accept contracts from companies to fund your space program, and progress through the tech tree.The game has in-depth tutorials and a guide, as well as different scenarios to try out. The community around the game is great, and Squad (the company that makes KSP) is great. I have seen them implement many things the community asks for, and even bring modders on to the team to help.Speaking of mods, there exists a plethora to choose from. Whether you want to make your game easier, harder, better looking, more realistic, or crazy, there is a mod for you. They include things from graphics overhauls to aerodynamic overhauls to vast quantities of new parts to autopilot systems you code yourself.The game is both simple and challenging at the same time. It's easy enough to build a rocket, but can you make it fly? Can you get into orbit? How about to the  Moon  Mun? What about  Mars  Duna? The answers may be no at first, but you learn. You slowly understad more and more, and after playing the game for a while, the answer becomes yes. And in that moment, you realize: ""Hey! I know how space works! This is orbital mechanics! And I know how to do it!"" It gives you a wondrous feeling of accomplishment, each time you do something new. That feeling barely fades, as I still feel my heart swell a little every time I land on the Mun.So go ahead, give the game a shot. It may seem daunting, but it's really quite fun -- and deceptively simple.How hard can rocket science be anyway?			"

								My most rewarding gaming experience ever comes from rescuing one of my kerbals, trapped on the Mun after a routine science mission had a rough landing, damaging the parachutes of the vessel and rendering it incapable of returning to Kerbin. The rescue mission had to be quick as the life support (TAC life support mod) was running out for Jebadiah Kerman. After rendevousing with the damaged ship in a low Munar orbit, the rescue vessel set about returning to Kerbin with much less fuel than planned. It was tooth and nails as the vessel only just managed to deorbit itself, skimming through Kerbin's atmosphere multiple times before finally landing, all astronauts safe.That is the thing about Kerbal Space Program, everyone has a story about the game which they want to tell. You design your own missions- they go well, success! they go wrong, rescue mission! You design ships and redesign them. You plan your missions, and you fly those missions.The game is still being developed and new features are gradually getting rolled out. And if you ever want more, the awesome modding community has you covered, adding ♥♥♥♥-loads of more content and gameplay, from extra parts to requiring life support for kerbals or even a connection link for unmanned vessels.P.S. I recommend checking out Scott Manley's youtube videos for tutorials and to just see someone who does awesome things in the game.			"

												Still charming, now with extra awesomeness.Construction UI's gotten even more solid and impressive. Flight model and air resistance and heat management are now unremarkably good (that's a good thing).  Many flight controls are still difficult to discover, but the worst of the old flaws are gone (it no longer trains you to rely on the space bar being ""do the next thing"" only to later on make that an insta-lose-but-only-sometimes button). While you're in-game it still won't show you the keyboard shortcuts and you kinda still have to find out about the quicksave key (F5 save, hold-F9 load) yourself before you can go check the keys midflight.  You can't always quicksave.Caveats as of 1.0.2: This game will enthrall you so thoroughly that _hours_ will pass by.  If you don't  quicksave regularly then sooner or later (leaning towards ""sooner"") you'll lose an entire evening's meticulous and irreproducible work.  * Quicksave isn't really for exploring different flight plans, it's for defense against the UI and to a lesser extent some minor bugs. Don't use the hard-mode option that shuts off quicksaves. * Go into the settings input options and shut off the staging function in any but staging mode.  The default setting makes the space bar a pun (but only sometimes): toggle RCS between linear and rotation mode, oh, and also jettison your last engine.  The controls shouldn't be more counterintuitive than orbital mechanics. They really shouldn't. * If you hit the can't-place-a-maneuver-node UI bug, try deleting other maneuvers, farthest away first. That sometimes fixes it for me.Ragdoll Berts and a space program.  Charming, genius, progress requires ambition (it's a sandbox, after all), very demanding but always with clear reason game.  I think this is going to remain my builder of choice for a long time.			"

It's by far the most solid early access to invest in on steam in my opinion.It may be early access but man is it fun! I have played over 342 hours and it's still fun.The gameplay is fantastic, the modding community is highly active, the development is stready and progresses well. The development team is very responsive and engaged with the community and they even have a history of hiring people right out of the modding community to work on the game with themAll in all this is a great time to chip in on this one, sure it's not all there but everything that is works great and there is plently of content in already.It's growing with every update, and the modding community can definitly keep you happy between updates.Or If your looking for a game for kids, this game is great for that to. No violence, fun, and plently of problem solving to keep there brains thinking, not to mention it will teach them a lot about physics.At the end of the day this is the best and quickest developing early access game I have see on steam yet, and it often goes on sale for around 15 dollers.

												KSP is definitely one of the best games/simulators ive ever played and probably ever will play; it's extremily well made in the sense that it never felt as if it was an incomplete game, even when it was in the alpha stage!! With all the thousands of different things to build such as any type of sea/land/air/space vehicle, the sky is no longer the limit, now, the entire universe is the ""limit""! To make the game even better, all the physics are super realistic and actually make sense (this is rare to find in games), so real logic and skill can be used to design and build the perfect craft for any mission you want to go on.CONCLUSION: The game is incredibly fun, addicting and well made, so is worth every penny. You won't be dissapointed with this one! I rate it a fantastic 9.5/10.			"

												This is the story of Jeb KerminJeb wanted his entire life to become an astronaut. He'd look into the stars each night and think, ""One day."" With the arrival of the new Kerbal Space Program, Jeb didn't hesitate. He was the only willing pilot in the lot that offered to join. Jeb traversed dangerous missions of small hunks of metal launched at high velocities. Jeb endured it all, explosions, heat reaching the thousands of degree. Jeb endured.One day, Jeb was offered a special mission. ""We're gonna get you into orbit."" said the commander.Jeb crawled into the rocket, the rocket of Icarus. Strapping himself into the pod, he prepared the final checks before launching once more into Kermin's sky. As he exited the atmosphere and entered into space, as he had before, Jeb couldn't help but feel worry. Something was not right. Looking at his live orbit map revealed a terrifying sight. Rather than circle Kermin, Jeb was destined to sail straight on...into space. Jeb's heart sank as the engines stopped. He had no fuel.Time passed. Days. Months. Maybe a year. Jeb didn't know. His orbit map revealed finally a circle.A circle around the sun. Jeb had entered space at such a velocity, he missed Kermin's orbit, and rather caught the sun.He was to sail past three different planets, including Kermin, to orbit the sun.Jeb felt no pain. He felt no sadness. Jeb looked on at the flaming ball of gas that was his new home. He smiled, for Jeb had the life he always wanted. To traverse the stars, see the planets.Icarus had succeeded. History repeated.Jeb was with the stars.UPDATE: Years have passed. All electricity in the pod have drained. For seemingly forever, Jeb floated high above the sun in a never ending circle. Tiring of the pod, Jeb prepared to make his mark on history.Jeb strapped on his suit and ejected from the pod. He took a deep breath as he closed his eyes, letting go of the ladder holding him from safety. He drifted away, unsure of his destination. Unable to control himself, Jeb closed his eyes as he soared through the stars, drifting both higher and lower than the mysterious Eeloo, on the farthest reaches of the system.A frozen tear drifted down Jeb's eye as he floated away, never once again seeing another planet. No Kerbin. No Mun. Only the Sun.Jeb was unsure of what would happen. Jeb didn't mind. He would endure. He would survive.Or Icarus would win.TL;DR i messed up trying to orbit kerbin and managed to orbit the sun on accident and jeb's flying all across the entire system. today i told him to abandon his pod and just drift away in space.god bless you jebediah kermin.Pics for anyone interested or don't believe meOrbit map: http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/248087970818710036/55ECF3E4067555F056FA6E63A254F1B0840E5CBA/Jeb orbiting the sun: http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/248087970821367339/E47FE9B0564285E7F6DE6A599887F237ED1CFE5B/ "

								I've murdered more innocent Kerbals thank grains of sand on the beach, for reasons as simple as how far will that rocket go with the smallest fuel tank. I could have used a robot but I didn't, I wanted them to die, I wanted their families to know they died, and I made them walk on that ship.Sure some were heroes, but most, most are now ashes that kick off the ground when the next launch proceeds, and maybe, just maybe they will make it back...

								If you like space, science and space science you'll love this magical little gem of a game. It's *not* easy, which I happen to like. I'm sick of games that I can beat in a matter of hours. Kerbal Space Program is hard - hard as ♥♥♥♥ in some cases - and as such it can be incredibly rewarding to land on a new planet, moon, or just build a cool new thing. There are some fairly significant downsides: 1. The tutorials are terrible. Maybe I'm just stupid? I ended up having to figure most of the game out myself and spent tons of time looking things up on YouTube and the game's Wiki. 2. It's a *little* slow to start. Because the controls are a bit obscure at first I wasn't sure I was going to like it. I ended up playing it immediately after buying it, becoming frustrated and shelving it for about two weeks. But I am *SO* glad I gave it a second chance. 3. There're still some weird bugs, but the KSP team seems quite active in working them out. It's still only just now in beta so bugs are to be expected. Unfortunately the worst one I've encountered managed to corrupt my best saves, forcing me to start over after having a nearly completed tech tree.However I haven't had this problem again in over a month now - maybe it was fixed, maybe I'm just lucky.Anyway, despite these problems, the game is ABSOLUTELY worth every penny and I'm incredibly excited for future content and witnessing the continuing development of this game. Obviously as a video game it's not quite the same thing as actually being an astronaut, an engineer or ground control, but it does give you an entirely new appreciation for what NASA, the ESA, Roscosmos, and any other space agency do every day. It *is* rocket science! Just a touch dumbed down for those of us without Ph.Ds :DBuild all the things.Buy all the Kerbal Space Programs.			"

								This game is very hard to describe as it is one of a kind.I could label it as a space program simulator but that really doesn't do Kerbal Space Program justice.Kerbal Space Program is essentially a game about managing your own space program, building your own rockets, planes, ships, space stations, landers, or any silly contraption you imagine really, and taking your poor victims.. err Kerbals.. to the stars! It runs on a semi-realistic physics and astronomy system where you can see every single part of your ship explode spectacularly as your poor Kerbals show their expressions of despair throughout the ride.This is a game about building and exploring the Kerbal Solar System and each of it's astral bodies, about making silly contraptions and planting flags on unexplored worlds.And if you ever want to go beyond the far reaches of the solar system, there's also a plethora of mods already available for Kerbal Space Program despite it being only in alpha stage... Even a multiplayer mod.I haven't sinked as many hours into a single videogame for a very long time as I did with Kerbal Space Program.This is Rocket Science the videogame and is an ABSOLUTE MUST!WARNING SIDE-EFFECTS:You will learn a few concepts of aerodynamics, physics and astronomy just by having fun!

								This is an excellent physics based sandbox game.  Currently, it doesn't have much of a story line or much of a directive beyond ""go to space, do research, get science, research things and go to space again.""  Yet it is still extremely fun, better if you come up with your own planned program.If you don't have a very decent grasp of astrophysics (or even physics in general) then expect to get one if you stay committed to the game. Takes awhile to get used to, but once you do, you'll never go back.I highly suggest having at least 4gb of RAM is you intend to mod this game though, otherwise you will taste the rainbow.			"

								Kerbal Space Program is one of my favorite games. If you are somewhat of a space fan and want to actually build your own rockets, this game is for you! I have spent countless hours in this game, even before it was on Steam. I always wanted somesort of space game where you build your own rockets and take them to space and potentialy other planets, and when I found this game in its early stages, I knew that this whas the game that I dreamed of. I came across this game about 2 years ago by now and even then I coudnt believe the quality of the game even though it was only in version .15. If you are new to the game there are tons of tuorials by now on YouTube, I came across Kurtjmac, he is a awesome YouTuber and so is Scott Manley. Anyways, this game is really fun and I really recommend it, and knowing that there is still alot of developent ahead, I cant wait.			"

KSP is a brilliant little game for everyone from clueless cosmo-naughts to astrophysicists. It's also remarkably versatile, so boats, rovers, and planes are all things too. The mechanics are solid, the graphics aren't too rough considering the game's scale, and there is a vibrant and diverse modding community.Easily one of the best gaming purchases you can make, as long as you don't mind days of your life being consumed by the need to put little green men into space.

												KSP is wonderful, unique, difficult, confusing, elating and all manner of other things bundled up into a deep and long-lasting package. The core of the game is all about building space-rockets, and flying them to the furthest reaches of the Kerbal solar system. Sounds fun eh! Just be aware that this is not some arcade-game were you can just shoot oversized fire-crackers into space. KSP is a full-blown space-program simulation.The upshot of this is that building rockets that really work is hard. If you want to succeed at KSP, you're going to have to spend a lot of time and effort getting to grips with how the simulation works, and in the process you're going to have to learn at least the very basic aspects of physics and even rocket-science that underpin this game.Sound daunting? It is, and in many ways that is the beauty of this game. At first you'll fail and fail hard. You'll build rockets that have no business being in the air, let alone venturing into space. You'll loose Kerbins to the deep void as you run out of fuel or otherwise mess up.But, spend some time reading the community guides, watching some YouTube vidoes on the principles of flight and you'll start to get the hang of things. You'll manage to launch a rocket into stable orbit and return it to Kerbin. Next you'll find yourself landing on one of the two moons that orbit Kerbin. And then from there, the challenges grow.The one down-side to this game is that it really does not contain the information needed to teach you how to play it. You cannot just 'wing it' when it comes to building rockets. In order to get past the most crude stages possible, you're either going to have to already be well trained in physics at degree level, or you're going to have to venture outside of the game and find the information you need to calculate the all important variables you're going to need to build successful rockets.Do I recommend this game? Yes, provided you're up for spending some serious time and effort getting to grips with it. There is nothing else quite like it, and you can learn a lot of interesting real-world physics while learning to play this. It's not, however, a game that will appeal to those looking for more instant fun.			"

October SkyOh! I have slipped the surly bonds of Earth, well Kerbin actually, but more on that later. Whether you actively seek out information on the inspiring missions carried out by the various space agencies around the globe or just catch the odd news report on the latest mars rover or comet flyby, you can't help but feel a certain sense of awe at the ingenuity and creativity that has led to these missions of exploration and discovery.Now we all have the opportunity to experience the glorious highs and devastating lows of running our own space program through Squads Kerbal Space Program. When you load KSP you'll be presented with a choice of three play modes. There's a full career mode where you'll have to design and launch your own missions, invest in research for new rocket parts and complete contracts for their financial rewards to help fund all of this. There a Science only mode, where you can still enjoy the progression of the science tree without having to worry about balancing the books and then there's a sandbox mode, where you can let your creativity run wild without the restrictions of the other two options. Space Camp Taking the plunge with the career mode, you'll first need to choose your fledgling space agencies name and flag logo. You'll then find yourself looking down at your shiny new space agency campus. At present, you'll start with 3 wannabe astronauts, a very limited amount of rocket parts and an even more limited budget. The first thing you'll probably want to do is take a look at the contracts available to you. These have specific requirements which when met will reward you both financially and often with a scientific reward which you can invest in the tech-tree. Astronaut FarmerPick your first contract, ""Launch a craft from your launch pad and achieve an altitude of 5000m."" It's then time to bolt a cockpit to rusty tank of rocket fuel, glue an engine to the bottom of the stack, light the touch paper and step back from the launch pad. If everything goes to plan, your first rocket will fly straight and true (although not very high yet, you're going to need better engines and tanks before you can achieve anywhere near orbital height). Of course if things didn't go to plan, you could be looking a pretty fireball and a smattering of debris raining down around your complex. Let's assume things went perfectly, you're aspiring astronaut has earned his wings and returned safely back to the ground courtesy of the parachute you remembered to fit to the capsule. Not only this but your managed to achieve the required 5000 metres, completed your first contract and received the payment. Now it's time to visit the tech tree and plan your next mission. Space CowboysAs you progress through the game and your missions become more adventurous you will find a full, well balanced and very interesting tech tree to unlock, but for now, we only have a small amount of science to spend, so we'll pick a branch of the tech tree we can afford and see what goodies we get. Ok, so now we've got some slightly more powerful engines, some fuel tanks that are a little less rusty and a mystery goo canister (a science experiment we can strap onto our rocket to generate our own science points so we're no longer dependent on contracts to generate our precious science). You're also not tied to the contract system and are free to set your own goals and undertake whatever missions you can imagine. However each rocket part costs money and at the moment we still don't have very much, so it's back to look at the available contracts to see what else is available and achievable with our current tech. GravitySeveral completed contracts and a few catastrophic failures later and our space agency is about to earn its stripes. We've managed to send various science packages to different biomes on Kerbin, (Kerbin is your home planet, it's an Earth like analogue and home to the Kerbals, little yellow aliens that look more than a little like the characters from the Simpsons). Anyway, we've explored the deserts, grasslands, the oceans and mountain ranges of Kerbin, We've even managed a touch down at the arctic where we planted a flag and everything! Now we are ready!Jebediah, our brave astronaut, is strapped into our painstakingly over-engineered rocket, we've already achieved a stable orbit with this design and now our sites are firmly set on the Mun (Kerbins Moon). The Right StuffOur valiant rocket roars up through the atmosphere, our carefully set staging is working perfectly, we've jettisoned our solid fuel boosters, the sky is darkening, we're in space above Kerbin. A few burns of our upper-stage engine later and we're in a circular orbit. A quick check of our fuel supplies let us know that we ""should"" have enough to make it to the Mun and hopefully back again. A long, carefully timed burn later and the Mun is starting to get pretty large through the cockpit windows. Apollo 13The landing was touch and go, we lost one of our four landing struts as we skimmed the surface but we are down and our Lander is stable. The cratered surface of the Mun stretches out before us. We run the various science experiments on the Lander (the science generated will come in very handy the next time we visit the tech tree). We hit the key to extend the ladder, open the hatch and Jebediah bravely takes a small step for Kerbal-kind. We plant our flag, we write a poignant plaque, we play with our jetpack and we scoop up a surface sample for the sake of science then we're back in our Lander. We look towards Kerbin, small and blue, we're ready to go home, we hit the button to ignite the Lander engines and... nothing. Red Planet The loss of Jebediah on the Mun was a devastating setback, but we've learnt a lot since then. We now have new and improved technologies, we've returned safely from the Mun several times. We have a large orbital space station in high orbit above Kerbin and we're about to undertake our most ambitious mission yet. A manned mission to the red planet Duna (It's Mars guys). This is the wonderful thing about KSP, there is always a new frontier, another challenge to overcome, another horizon to explore.As it stands at the moment, the Kerbol system consists of one star, seven planets and nine moons. You can also discover, track and intercept various asteroids that litter the system. If this isn't enough for you, the modding community for KSP is one of the healthiest and most active I have seen. There are countless mods you can download and use in your game, from texture packs and rocket parts to whole new star systems to explore. A Space OdysseyFrom what you've read so far you may think that Kerbal Space Program is a finished title, this is not the case, it is still very much in active development.It is updated regularly and each patch not only refines what is already there but also brings something new to the table.I've barely brushed the surface of the universe of possibilities which awaits you in KSP.If you have any interest in space exploration then this is a must have game, not a must have game when it's finally released, this is a must have game right now!

												Kerbal has a steep learning curve, but once you've figured out the mechanics, the reward of plotting out & achieving a goal is one the best experiences I've had in gaming in years!In the space of 40 hours, I started off barely managing to launch a rocket several thousand feet into the air. Now I'm fully capable of being able to both create a space faring craft & plot a course to recover a stranded astronaut circling around the orbit of the Mun (Kerbal's moon) over several million miles away.This isn't even scratching the surface of future possibilities I could attempt. I could perform a moon landing. Lift & place a space station into a stable orbit or travel to several of the other planetary bodies in the solar system.Much like an advanced 'Banjo Kazooie Nuts & Bolts' there's very little hand holding with a bare minimum of instruction of how to perform any of these outrageous feats. It takes the right combination of a well designed vessel, a correctly plotted route of orbital eclipses, skillful piloting & finally luck. Once you have all these, it's not long before you're complimenting yourself on a job well done & planning out what your next grand project is going to be.With charming & fluid presentation, extensive & encouraged mod support, atmospheric soundtrack & both career plus sandbox mode included. There's very little this game does wrong.You'll be doing yourself a disservice not giving this game a go!			"

												There is something really cool about this game... But I have a terrible memory and can't quite remember it.  Could it be building your own piece of space debris, launching it with the hopes that it won't quite crash into the surface of the planet, and then setting your kerbal, who is likely quite dizzy or nauseated (maybe even lobotomized), into the surface of the planet and claiming said planet for the glory of SCIENCE!  No, that sounds pretty cheesy... Maybe it was Building a space station piece by piece and then attempting to dock these seperate pieces at precise intervals, only to accidentally fly through the near complete station because you didn't un-accelerate time fast enough to slow down (so much is wrong with that).  No that sounds frustrating...  Oh Oh, I know... It is undoubtedly creating a series of unmanned orbiting vehicles that all orbit in such a manner that they would allow instantaneous communication across the star system of Kerbin if there was any need for such a thing when you are but one of a handful of signs of habitation on your home planet let alone the Kerbin System.   No that sounds tedious...  Oh yes, that is it... it is using your ineptitude at physics to break the physics engine attempting to create all of your science fiction romanticisms like the Death Star, a space boat, a Gundam, Star Destroyer, a Halo Station (or ringworld as I would prefer), any number of space vehicles in science fiction, as well as inaccurate replicas and jury rigged models of today's human cosmonaut program. Well whatever you enjoy, be it making a series of ICBMs and attempt to destroy your own base, or create complex rocketry designs to reach the distant planets, or even capture an asteroid and give Kerbin ANOTHER moon, or even giving Mun a moon (moon-ception)  You can do just about anything you can imagine in KSP.  Except the things you can do in game like COD or GTA, well, except kill people, but hey accidents happen.  Especially when you strap several hundred tons of rockets and fuel on haphazardly in an attempt to get into orbit.So yeah KSP, flight sim, orbit sim, crash sim, not an explosion sim, non-newtonian physics sim, or underwater exploration sim...  I mean, just get this game... its not rocket science... well it doesn't have to be.			"

								Kerbal Space Program, this has to be one of my favorite games of all time! If you have ANY sort of fascination for space, then this is the game for you! You build any rocket, however you like, then shoot it into space, hoping things go for the best. You may build a very realistic rocket, or a monstrosity of science! The maneuvers you commit in this game are very realistic to what NASA would do in space in real life. The game is both very realistic, and very comical at the same time!Crashes and scared astronauts are included!I highly reccomend it!			"

								KSP might honestly be the best sandbox game I have ever played.  Everyone seems to make comments about this games steep learning curve, but the reality of it is, while you are struggling trying to figure out the controls and dynamics of this game, you are probably having a load of fun blowing rockets up and watching your little green men screaming in horror (except for Jebediah, who is always cheering).  Nothing about this games learning curve is a deterrent.  It admittedly took me a couple hours to get the hang of things myself.  But while I was learning, I was having a lot of fun just messing up stuff and laughing at how quickly (or slowly) my launch fell apart.  Now that I feel I have ""mastered"" space docking and world landings, I'm still finding tons of new things to do, explore and try to recreate.  Also, the physics in this game are spot on, all the way through.  Its amazing how much learning this game really seems like it can provide.  I highly recommend this to all.  KSP is addictive, fun, and hilarious.KSP is still in early access.  So there is a lot of new content still coming out, and the community for this game is great.  Some of the community mods I've used have really blown me away.  This game is only going to get more awesome moving forward.  Buy this game and thank me later.			"

								This game is not for individuals who don't like learning things that pertain to the physical realm because this game has all of it: Air Resistance, Gravity, Mass, Impacts the list goes on. You can keep a basic understanding and learn a few tricks to get the most out of the game without putting too much thought or time into learning it but you have to be able to break down at times and understand that somethings you can't always learn on your own with this game. Or if you're a total science, math and space nut you can really get into the math to fully get every inch out of your rockets and vessels so there's something for everyone. Also there's mods. It can be a lot of trial and error as well which makes the game a true challenge.NEVER KILL OR LEAVE JEBEDIAH ON A DESOLATE PLANET HE IS THE ULTIMATEDesign rockets, gather science and do missions or contracts to gain moolah to make bigger and better vessels and rockets to take to the outter portions of the solar system. The game can test your patience at times but if you really like it you will come back every time I gurantee it and if you dont like it you will know.TL;DR: ♥♥♥♥ is way real yo, science be cray and there will be explosions (Science, Real Physics, Hilarious failure's of rockets and craft)			"

								If you don't know anything about the space program or orbit maneuvers, this is a hilariously fun game of attempting to build rockets and often causing massive explosions while your cute little green pilots scream on in horror (except for Jebediah, who is cheering all the way). Laugh at your new build, where you've strapped on dozens of boosters, and be rolling on the floor during launch as you watch everything slowly (or, quickly) fall apart.If you know vaguely of the space program and think learning something about how to get things into space will be fun, this is a science kit in a box. Have all the fun above, plus you'll learn what ""freefall"" and ""orbit"" and ""retrograde"" really mean with hands-on experience. Relive the Apollo missions to the moon (or for Kerbals, the Mun), simulate real NASA missions (or try to and learn much as you stay up all night trying to make your rocket fly correctly). Addictive, cute, and fun.If you've mastered space docking and other-world-landing in other games, you'll still appreciate the excellent physics and the cute take on what is often a difficult genre to break into. The physics are all there and are quite good- you could teach a class using many of the features even in this early beta. With community mods, the physics get even better (or crazier, as you wish). Fans have even programmed automated burn correction programs so you can do a professional job. Calculate delta-vee and puzzle as your probe lands precisely where it was supposed to based on your mathematical calculations- in a game featuring cute bobble-headed green men.			"

												This game has a steep learning curve but once you give it time and start to understand how it all comes together you will fall in-love with it.It is like a rocket scientist decided to make a game one day probably while waiting to build the next breakthrough rocket ship, that or waiting on a new budget to come through. ;)Seriously there is so many things nested into this game it would take many playthroughs just to even scratch the surface of just what all you can do!

												This game is Absolutely INCREDIBLE! This need to be the precurser to Space engineers. I have been playing for quite some time and still the prospect of making it to the mun seem absolutely unachieveable, let alone the rest of the solar system. This game has a tonne of hours in gameplay, complex game mechanics, and it gives you a reason sense of joy when you make you first sucessfull orbit around the planet (which I recently did). I can't want to get a move on so I can start playing it on harder difficulties, which I'm sure will make me want to throw myself in front of a bus... which for me means it's going to be awesome! I suggest this to anyone who likes free building games that have a bit more direction and goal oriented playing. I'm a huge space engineers fan and this fits RIGHT in for me. "

Early Access Review
								There's nothing I can say about this game that hasn't already been raved about by thousands of other people...It's the most polished Early Access game you will ever see. KSP will spoil the very concept for you, because after playing it you'll think that Early Access is just a great way to get already-awesome games at a discount. No. Wrong. The vast majority of Early Access games are severely underdeveloped for even a partial release, and too  often misrepresent how far along they are on the path to completion. Some of them run out of funding or enthusiasm and never even reach completion, or declare ""Mission Accomplished"" and give you a game that falls far below the devs' original expectations and ignores the community's complaints. KSP makes ""Early Access"" into something of a joke, because it's more fun and more functional than anything that Electronic Arts or Creative Assembly have released in the last 10 years. Yeah, not even kidding when I say that.KSP has been a great game that just keeps getting better, and with the start of beta it just goes to another level entirely. Most folks would've been happy with the game as it was a year ago, but Squad is still picking up more and more momentum. They love their project, they're good at what they do, and they're incredibly responsive to the wishes of the KSP community, which is EXACTLY what Early Access is supposed to be about. If you weren't sure from all of the modding community's input that got included in the prior patch, well, here's some more for you. The community interaction is great from every angle, really... Modders get the recognition they deserve, average players get way more than they paid for, and the devs get a game that makes everyone that much happier.People here have mentioned the learning curve before, and it's there, but it's definitely not insurmountable... I know a handful of friends who've just tinkered with the game and gotten into low orbit around Kerbin and called it a day, but they're missing out on the real game. Each new task, each new challenge, requires you to master another skill in addition to properly executing everything else you've already learned. But when you finally get it right? There's a sense of accomplishment that's hard to find in any other game. Getting into orbit, changing orbits, landing, attempting a rendezvous, intercepting a planet that'll take you 6 months just to reach--once you start to string all of it together, the results of your hard work speak for themselves.And like lots of other folks have also said, there's a great sense of accomplishment when you nail a difficult task... but the real hilarity of the game comes from those moments when you get things just a little bit wrong. KSP will satisfy all of your emotional needs. <3But if you're more into stories, here's the highlight reel from my last playthrough after they updated Career Mode...The infamous Jebediah Kerman did most of my early test flights and managed to hog all of the glory. Not to be outdone, Bill Kerman booked a spot to be the first Kerbal to land on the Mun. UNFORTUNATELY, Bill botched the landing and his pod tipped over sideways and couldn't seem to right itself. Now we had a problem--not only was Bill stranded, but we hadn't yet researched a 2+ command pod that would allow for a rescue team.So the heroic Bill Kerman sat in his command pod, on the surface of Mun, eating snacks, for exactly 34 days while we built a ship big enough to take him home and got it to the landing site. We all held our breath as the ship arrived and prayed that Bill was still alive and had enough snacks.Jebediah stole the show again and came to the rescue, and got Bill into their 2-kerbal lander and got them back into space. BUT THEN, something happened.They ran out of gas. Before they got home.The lander collapsed into orbit around Kerbin, with enough fuel to get them off the Mun but not enough to finish the job. So now Bill AND Jeb were stuck in space for another 61 days while we engineered an unmanned ship that could grab them and redirect them to Kerbin's surface. Thankfully, by now, Bill's snacks had been replenished from the latest rescue attempt, and they hunkered down in anticipation of the final rescue attempt.Only... it wasn't the final rescue attempt. Being our first effort at a rendezvous in space, the unmanned ship with the grabby-claw came to within 3km of Bill and Jeb... and then rocketed straight past them into the unknown. It would be almost another month before we set out again.So we sent a SECOND ship with a BETTER grabby-claw, and THIS TIME WE GOT THEM. Our two heroes were yanked from orbit and rocketed home once and for all, splashing down just a short distance from where it all began.*..... This could happen to you. Buy it now.42/10 WILL DEFINITELY RUN OUT OF GAS AGAIN*Story based on real events, see screenshot library for documentation*			"

												Even with the seemingly impossible challenges, and even harder choice of buying a game that might not seem worth it, I recommend it fully. There's so much for you to do on this game, with its realism, and the hundreds of parts it tosses at you when you open the VAB or Spaceplane Hanger. The planets, moons, and asteriods each have their own challenges and perks that differ from the rest. For example, Duna is farther from Kerbin than the Mun, but Duna has an atmosphere, which allows gliders and rocket planes to fly. The rocket parts and aerodynamics are nothing less than amazing, with engines that benifit and hinder you, fuel tanks that carry diffrent fuel sizes, muiltiple prepulsion methods and more. Not interested in rockets? Well, you got a full hanger with airplane parts choking the catalog. You can still aim for space, however, as it still supplies you with rocket parts, in whice you turn planes into SSTOs (single stage to orbit FYI), and vice versa. The exploration factor is nothing less than infinity. You got 7 planets, most of them with moons. They all have special chractheristics in which you either hate or love. Me myself,  having been  to EVERY planet and moon in this game, has not tired out yet. Why? Instead of just exploring, you can colonize and conquer. You got docking ports, which leads you to massive space stations. You can build bases on explored planets to supply fuel or power to passing ships. This game is truly amazing, even the slightest of space geeks will have fun in this. I recommend it fully 10/10			"

												I have been playing this game since 2011 and since then this game has proven again and again the physics and space travel can be amazing fun. From colonizing the vast outer regions of the Kerbal solar system to screwing around and conrtucting massive starships. There are a vast amount of mods for this game and even mods to add more planets and stars to even further extend your exploration. Mods for mining, colonising and just building the most massive space assault carrier. This game is truly worth its asking price. It has lasted for over 4 years and I believe with the communities support it will be able to last even longer. I love this game. Just seeing Jebediah smile after a crash or even whilst he is crashing is a damn awesome feeling. The satisfaction of you first space station in orbit or you first landing on the moon, then planet then first starship is unmatched.			"

								I have followed Kerbal Space Program for a long time and it has gone from a good game to epic! It's tricky to master but you are rewarded every step of the way and it's not even final release! My favourite single player game of all time.Now ver1 is out! Wow... what can I say, it's better than I could have hoped for. Everything that makes KSP so special has been fused together with epicness. I fail to see how you can not love it, the cute little green men, the disasters, the sucess and true freedom. Go whereever you like, build what ever you want, fail, suceed and just have too much fun. If KSP was a drug it would be tobacco. I have to remind myself it's just a single player game because it sits up there with the best games of all time not just single player games.Beauty: Every player who playes KSP will have a different path to sucess or failure. There is no right way in KSP, you build what you can to get the job done. Trial and error and even with 2000+ hours on KSP I have not built the perfect rocket because there is no perfect. If you forget an antenna or a parachute etc your mission will fail but this is how you learn.As for the new ver 1 mining stuff 10/10 it's just so polished as a game I cant praise the game enough, fantastic+epic!

												Oh my Science....This is... BY FAR....My favorite video game of the current era.Those who know me, know I'm a rabid Fallout and Resident Evil fangirl. I can't call this game my favorite yet (Fallout 2 still has this title by a steady grasp) but KSP is a very close follower.To sum up the entirety of this game in a few phrases or memes....This game = NASA + Lemmings.KSP is hollywood rocket science....collect ALL THE SCIENCE!There are 3 modes of play. The first mode is sandbox. You get all the parts unlocked, you can build anything you can think of, and then explode it marvellously while trying to fire it up into space. The second mode, is Science mode. This unlocks the Tech Tree and the collection of science. Parts are restricted by the Tech Tree, visitable through the R&D building. Collecting science unlocks branches in the Tech Tree. This gives you access to more and more parts, until you're eventually at the end of the tree, and its basically like Sandbox mode. The third is Career Mode. Career is the fully unlocked version of the game, requiring you to balance limited parts (locked behind the Tech Tree, requiring the collection of Science), limited money (Rocket science is expensive! Ships now cost money, and you have limited funding. In order to get more money, you need to complete missions from the Mission Control building), and spontaneous explosive deconstruction.The whole point of the game is to explore the Kerbol system. Its that simple. Build rockets, leave the planet Kerbin (third from the sun Kerbol), and visit all you can. The Kerbol System has 8 planets, Moho (like Mercury), Eve (Venus analogue), Kerbin (Earth-like), Duna (Mars rip-off), Dres (Small planet, light gravity, hard to land on), Jool (Jupiter wannabe), and Eeloo (Pluto if it was a planet!). Each planet has its own special features, moons, things to see, and difficulties in visiting.The game has an INCREDIBLE modding community, which I recommend, and the YouTube community loves making crafts and blowing them up. I VERY MUCH invite you to watch Scott Manley's videos for learning Kerbal science and aerodynamics.... skills needed to blow up much less often than before!The game still has its issues... I commonly find the Hell Kraken or ♥♥♥ Kraken (Community known bugs), but this may be due to the mods installed on my game.  The Windows x64 version is horribly broken, but the other versions are great.			"

They've managed to allow as much creativity as it actually possible at this current development level for simulation/strategy game.HOWEVER (it is a big however, i know) before you can actually enjoy anything like building a satellite to orbit around some distant planet, or a two way mission to the Mun - you will either have to learn hours and hours, and hours, and hours, even more hours of youtube tutorials or... cheat.When it comes to tutorials and explaining ""how things work in the game we made"" the developers failed so miserably, so utterly and completely, that you actually have to wonder which audience they intended this game for?Telling a new player to try and land a vehicle near space center - is not a tutorial. Forgetting to mention recently added features like heating and cooling, so they would inevitably burn in the atmosphere is a shocking oversight. Not mentioning how to save up fuel when launching vessels, changing orbits or de-orbiting is just lousy.Bottom line is - there is no comprehensive tutorial in this game whatsoever, no learning curve, no actually useful in game tips, tooltips or explanations on anything. Period.So before you actually can enjoy this game in its fullest (repetitively launching badly designed pieces of crap is just a part of it) - you will have to spend hours learning how the hell you can launch a vessel properly, save fuel, dock, transfer to another object, land, land in different atmosphere, land without an atmosphere, take off, etc. etc. etc.I was expecting them to completely revamp the tutorials and the learning curve - they did not. Because of that i was prepared to thumb it down but i could not. Even though developers clearly do not care about players actually getting into their game and enjoying it without wasting a lot of time - modders do care. There are mods that allow cheating, better parts and complete designs which reduce the difficulty curve significantly. There are also plenty of videos (i recommend Scott Manley) which explain various game aspects in details and manage to be both interesting and educational at the same time. So yeah... while i am very disappointed in developers, the community and modders made this game better, good enough to recommend it.			"

												After having played this extensively in the beta, and now adding plenty of time to that post release from early-access, really all that can be said is how amazingly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed wonderful this game is.Underneath what can only be descibed as a charming, humurous exterior lies an incredibly deep, physics based strategy game that basically leaves you to it. You will fail to get a ship in to orbit dozens of times before you ever make it into space, but that's purely because you haven't figured it out yet, which, when you do, makes it so much more rewarding.Each small step makes way for a bigger step, and then an even bigger step, until you're exploring the entire solar system, putting stations in orbit around far-flung gas giants and somehow managing to make a return trip to the surface of Eve. At the same time, you learn so much about space exploration - when was education ever remotely this fun?A thoroughly amazing game and very much worth of much of your time.			"

								Kerbal space program is a physics sandbox space simulator. You can build ships or planes using individual parts such as engines, fuel tanks, solar panels etc. Planets are almost realistically sized and so is the space between them. You can build space stations, send probes to intercept the moon or some how build a manned base on the gas giant 'Jool'. If you ever get bored of the game then you can visit the space port website where you can download hundreds of modifications to the game, including physics changing ones!			"

								Stimulating, rewarding, enjoyable. KSP provides a Solar System and space technology similar to Earth's. Career mode gives an excellent context for performing ""experiments""(go to place X and press button Y) to unlock better or different spaceship components, and has the freedom to let you choose what to attempt first, or go on free mode. Building a craft and putting it in orbit, going on to land a probe/rover/lander to a planet/moon feels fufilling. On the way doing spacewalks, crew reports, atmosphere/space experiments. It's a very involving game, solving the problems of how to reach a planet, slow down and land on it, and then get back. Ontop of being a fun game, KSP provides an easy way to grasp the concepts of space travel, and it's not overly complicated. Just pick the right parts, and fire your rocket at the right time and direction to get somewhere. Suffers a stuttering issue for many people, but it's not a gamebreaker.			"

												You know nothing about space.Don't you believe me?Try to reach the moon.Did you fail?Right, because you know nothing about space... yet...I'm in SPAAAaace ! This is by far the best space simulation game ever made, but forget space combat : the only fight will be your limited knowledge about space newtonian physics.The base game is very fun, and evolves with every new version in a most satisfying way. Then you can add community Plugins, and gods there are many good ones ! Create a communication network to pilot your probes around the solar system. Map the planets and asteroids to prepare your ground missions. Do science. Then create a gigantic asteroid mining base, a fuel reloading orbital station, and drive your ships even further on distant celestial objects.You will have to deal with the limitations of your science at the beginning to fulfill your contracts, but the more science you unlock, the further you will be able to go in your space odyssey.

												With 80 hours invested into this game I can safely say it's amazing!KSP is an open sandbox space exploration simulator. Your role is a director that oversee the whole operation from fund management, hiring test dum- qualified astronauts, and building your ship design to hopefully reach space and beyond.Story wise this game doesn't have one. They career mode which is decent but it requires alot of grinding to unlock technology to advance your ship. As of my review this game has plenty of content but not enough interactive options. Such as my kerbals stats didn't much at all, no recoloring, or real purpose of exploration other then saying you did What this game lack is backed by a healthy molding community that put a sense of purpose to explore for resource, new ship design and energy source, and weapons!This game is abut trail and error. One mistake can cost a whole mission and most of my botch up mission ended a satisfying ball of fire and explosion. ProsEasy setup and understandExtreme replay valueConstant updatesExploration is satisfyingHealthy molding community ConsPlanet exploration has no real purpose without modsLack of customization other then shipsOverallPick up this game now, it is worth it at full price. This game to me spawn the whole idea of vehicle biudiling simulator with a purpose or mission.MSRP: $39.99Recommend Pick up Price: $39.99, and donate to Development! "

												I have decided to edit my review, in light of (a TON) of new content since i last posted.------------Is the game fun:... its basically a drug.is it easy?: no.  not at all. in fact this will be the biggest issue people have with the game. while Dark souls is hard in a ""quick reflexes or death"" kind of way.... KSP is hard in a ""omg i dont understand this, what on earth is a Pe and DeltaV?!"" kind of way. One of the biggest issues new people to this game have is that well.... its rocket science. and most of us didn't walk into this game with a couple degrees. (though i feel like i could get one walking out)as a result there has been a huge disconnect for many people between the ""what i need to know to enjoy this"" and ""what i actually know right now"". amd this has caused many people to not enjoy there experience, or to quit the game altogether. Now with version 1.1, this issue has been addressed with an in game ""wiki"" if you will.  the rocket science 101, the up goers guide to the galaxy. and man did they hit it out of the park. not only is it super detailed.... i mean like, detailed enough that despite having 1500 hours logged in game on steam alone (dont judge me) i was still able to learn something i didn't know flipping its pages. but it is implemented in a way that makes it not only easy to access, and easy to use.... but basically screams ""use me"". right down to having a built in pause game button into the wiki, so you have the option of flipping a few pages on route to kill time... or to pause the game in a panic as you try to figure out why your 1 rocket just became 5.and yet, with all of that, its still super easy to follow.  I am glad they have finally cast away that looming shadow that has haunted this game for years and fixed one of the last real issues this game faced.and if you are wondering, yes.... the rest of the game is amazing too.

								  A review that should have come a long long time ago.  What can I say about Kerbal Space Program other than buy it.   Buy a copy for yourself, buy copies for your family memebers, and buy copies as gifts for your friends.     Hands down the best money on entertainment I have ever spent.  I've spent more hours than I care to admit to playing this gem of a game and in addition to the sheer joy and feelings of accomplishment this game gives its users you will also find yourself learning a ton about orbital mechanics in a fun and exciting way.   That feeling of accomplishment is so core to the Kerbal Space Program experience.  I can't think of a single KSP player who doesn't have a first docking story or loads of screenshots/videos from their first landing on another planet.  The list is endless with this game.    Another great part of the KSP experience is the community here and on the main forums.  The mod community is large and very active.  Mods for this title will blow you away!!!  So much so that some mods were swallowed up by the developers and the mod developers now work along side Squad.    If you have not yet bought this game I invite you to download the demo here on Steam or from www.KerbalSpaceProgram.com  After downloading the demo hit Youtube and grab some popcorn for the hours upon hours of tutorials and general fun surrounding this game.  If your anything like me it won't take but 5 minutes in the demo before you instantly see the value of this game.    Click buy!!!  You will not regret your purchase!!!!			"

												Kerbal Space Program is a game in which you are basically NASA. KSP embodies the real physics behind launching and flying a Rocket. In playing this game, I have learned more about Aero physics, Orbital physics, piloting, and how hard it is to just get one of your rockets to space and out of Kerbins Gravity. The game combines real world physics with challenging game objectives to give a extremely well done gaming experience.			"

								This is the most freaking awesome game ever made in history of gaming (if you're into realistic space-travel).Although it's really, really hard it gives you those moments of pure epicness which can't be topped in gaming.The triumph after a successful mission makes you feel like you're sitting on top of a 1600 ton rocket only fueled by emotion!!!Explosions both controlled and completely-whack-a-kerbal-out-of-control are the most essential aspect of this game. And explosions are always good.Buy it.			"

								After one and half year since my last review at 0.25, I am pretty amazed about how this game has changed. Careers, more parts, better aerodynamics and heating simulation.What I loved better is the amazing modders. Plugins and parts are always growing better, taking shapes and functioning more smoothly. Ferram4, bac9, Acea, BahamutoD, those guys are just getting more amazing than ever making more and more fantastic mods.Since 1.1 is almost out of the bakery, this indie game is making it's way through!====Previous review at 0.25 [Sept.2014]====Well, after a total of 100 hours of gaming time (steam doesn't count every time I started it directly from the directory), I was proud to say that I am finally a amateur engineer and pilot. In the gaming process, I found this game quite challenging despite earlier easy experience. Generally, it's a pretty nice game though it's still in dev. Much of the game is something like Space Engineer, but this one is quite realistic(if you got some mods installed). Also, the game's setting is a highlight. A vast system of star, planets, asteroids and moons. Impressive if you like exploring. Also, the orbit and aerodynamic is just as great as its inspiring game, Orbiter. The game is developed on Unity platform, and the x64 edition is just realeased and packed with some bugs, severe or unimportant. If it simply crashed or a Oops message appears, don't worry. It's just a bug ruining your game experience. But don't blame the dev team please! They are trying their best to make everything perfect, although it's just a ""Good"" now. Oh, and one more thing, this game is finally entering BETA testing! Mark the day on the calendar, Jeb! You'll never forget it! So that is it, the game for a sandbox gamer, a rocket maniac or a airplane designer; even worse with the 0.25 update, it is also suitable for a sociopath who liked to design and destroy things.  Thousands of mods are available in the official forum[forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com]. If you are intrested in it, try out the demo in the official site[www.kerbalspaceprogram.com].In a few words, this game worths the price.			"

								I really love this game. It is like you are NASA and all of its employees. You get to design and build the rockets, spaceships, and planes and then fly them. I am currently doing missions to explore and land on the moons of what would be Jupiter in the game, and I can still see a lot of content left for me to explore. Once you get into the game a bit, I highly suggest looking into downloading some mods for the game, since it has a pretty strong modding community. This game teaches you geometry, planetary motion, the effects of gravity in space and much, much more. I find myself using my calculator to plan my missions and drawing up mission outlines. Success in the game takes a smart mind and a good plan. I think it is one of the best games I have ever played.I highly recommed it.			"

												Possibly one of the best games to be released in the last 10 years. I have for a very long time dreamed of going to space and this game only strengthen's that desire. Here's my analysis of this game.Graphics: Have improved dramatically compared to what they were back when I started playing. The Mun has changed shape for crying out loud!Gameplay: With the recently improved aerodynamics, The gameplay is superb. Watching your own rocket/spaceplane tumble back to Kerbin is an amazing feeling.Other: Contracts are wonderful. However, they feel a little repetitive in the late game. The tech tree is fun to explore and great for first time players. When multiplayer comes out I wont be surprised if I rack up 2000+ hours on here. If I were a therapist I would recommend this game to my patients because of how great you feel when you finally land on the Mun that required 5 Kerbal's lives to get there, and then planning a rescue mission!The rundown: Buy this immediately.

												Even with the glitches and crashes, I have spent like 1800 hours in Kerbal. Sadly, many things I still can't do, which has left me to improvize around my handicaps, creating crazily oversized and engineered craft, but also at times to go super-duper teeny-tiny. My latest thing is spaceplanes, which can be a real challenge. That and run-on sentences :-)Keeping fingers crossed for the serious update that is in the works.			"

Early Access Review
								I. Love. Dis. Game.  It has quite a harsh learning curve, i tossed this game aside after 10-20 failed launches, But when i came back a week or two later, I put some time into it. The list of mods for this game are endless with some of the more well known being MechJeb(Good for Newbie) K9, Kethane, Extended rocket packs. etc etc, Massive list.  I find myself starting a new game every couple weeks just because a lot can be done differently, I tend to try keep my place clean, Place a flag everywhere i go. Run out of fuel and end up stranded. Send rescue missions. A lot of what this game has to offer comes down to ones own willingness to make it themselves lol.  A few great YouTubers for KSP but i absolutely love Scott Manley, I've picked up a lot of things from watching his video's.  Regardless!, Excellent game, and i intend to play to play it for a long time to come. 10/10			"
