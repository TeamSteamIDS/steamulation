												Here's what you get!* PAW: 1942, plus its Army Air expansion, running in DOSBox, and patched to its latest version. * You do not get the Gold version, which was just the DOS version packaged with a bollox Win 3.1 multimedia launcher.* For those who know their old sims and DOSBox, the digital sound works fine.  Getting PAW sound to work in DOSBox could be a real bear.So, for the game itself:This is a an old classic for Microprose game collectors, old flight-sim grogs (like myself), and the like.  As with all of these retro releases, there is very little here that modern gamers or folks not fond of this genre will find interesting.  (Truth be told, however, I'd rather fly this old sim than, say, later efforts such as MSCFS 2 or Pacific Fighters!)  But for the graphics -- which are that lovely mid-90's smear of big textured pixels -- PAW's flight model is surprisingly good (if actually a little too punishing), the enemy AI is challenging, and there are many scenarios to choose from.Highly recommended with the caveats I've mentioned above.(Note: use CTRL-F12 to increase the DOSBox cycles -- 3000 isn't nearly enough!)

												This can be conciderd a hidden gem(?)For the age of this simulator i am going to have to say it is actually quite realistic.You can change the difficulty from limmited ammo to your pilot getting blinded by the sun.Also the A.I are suburb. enemy pilots are quite a challenge and difficult to shoot. ships also try to avoid you when you are getting close to them! (enemy ships of course)For the flight sim fans this is a must have, get it now it is on sale!1 thing i noticed is that the steam store tells there is no multiplayer,But according to the manual and in game options there is. But it is called Modem flight or something. Not sure how to do that. I tried to take a look but if you figure around a bit it should maybe be possible to use.			"

												Okay...so.  I bought this one for .94 cents.  Which means, I can't complain.  When this game came out I was in my mid 20's.  And, I loved it.  For that time, it was cutting edge WWII fun.  I don't know why more sims aren't covering this genre and theater of war.  The Yorktown, Enterprise and Hornet...against Akagi, Kaga, Hiyru and Soryu.  Sorry if I tore those spellings up Japan.  But I loved this game.  So, when I downloaded I thought that I would get the same buzz I did off it in 94-95.  And......drum roll.....well, I didn't.  Its fun to poke around in the game.  But you have to realize this is a 55mb game.  They did allot back then, but you have to remember we were still loading with 1.33mb floppies.  Compressed this was a 5 disk load!  Graphics set u back, thats the main thing, its just not fun because of it.  It's like looking through a fish bowl.  So buy the game for a buck and tool around for nostalgia's sake, but don't get it if your expecting IL-2 pacific wars graphics...but the campaign is better than IL2!!  I still have to recommend it for a buck!			"

												fantastic game, that shines in historical battle mode........ yet it's another bad port.the sound has always been an issue for this game in dosbox.contrary to some posts i have read here, the DIGITAL sound does NOT work in this port. (eg: machinegun sounds)to get the sound working 100% do the following:1)go to this address and download the opensource JEMM memory manager: ( JEMM578B.zip )http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/dos/emm386/jemm386/unpack ""JEMM578B.zip"" to ""steam\steamapps\common\1942 - the pacific air war\JEMM""your game folder will now look something like this:- dosbox_windows    (folder, contains dosbox)- JEMM                       (folder, contains the memory manager)- MPS                          (folder, contains game)- manual.pdf2)- Open the ""dosbox_windows"" folder- Open ""dosbox_1942_TPAW.conf"" with notepadnow scroll all the way down untill you see the following lines:xms=trueems=trueumb=truechange all 3 values to the following:xms=falseems=falseumb=false- Save & exit notepad3)- Open the ""dosbox_windows"" folder- Open ""dosbox_1942_TPAW_launch_windows.conf"" with notepad- Edit and make sure it only contains the following:[autoexec]mount C ""..""C:CD JEMMjemmex FRAME=E000 LOADCD\CD MPS\PACIFICCLS1942.EXEEXIT- Save & exit4)Open the configuration utility by right clicking on the game from the steam library and set your digital audio tosound blaster 16.5)Launch game & make sure the digital sounds are ticked in the in-game config screen.too bad you pay for a lousy port.hope to have resolved some headaches here, and maybe the dev's are reading as well.greetings to all			"

												1942: Pacific Air War was released over 20-years ago, so it runs in DOSBox. It definitely would be a game for Nostalgic gamers who want to relive their youth playing DOS-based games they grew up with. Visually, it obviously doesn't hold up to the standards of todays games, but you don't expect a 20-year old game to and if you do, you have unrealistic expectations. What I like about 1942: The Pacific Air War is that there are two main parts to the game, the top down overall command and control, and then the 3-D combat engagements. This was ahead of it's time. The game is still fun if you are familiar with the era of gaming, otherwise you might be disappointed.			"

												The game is old, so the graphics are a little shoddy (even at max settings). If you want to enjoy the game: look the game instrution manual up online (so many complex functions you have to control), dont expect a AAA game (amazing graphics, surround sound, etc.) and dont expect to be a one man army. All in all, pretty good game... considering its age.			"

												Just to think back when this game first realest in 1994 it was considered a top microprose simulator!I believe I played it about 20 years ago and didn't get very far but now hate it. waste of time getting nowhere fast and low graphics and sound. Even for some sort of nostalgic kick it was too bad for me and ended up deleted.I guess the actual planes look good if you want a good point about it @)			"

												I bought this game back in the 90's running on my crapp y little 386 with 4mb raam and 120mb hard disk and (while I was only 13) I thought it was the best damn game ever. The the flight sim was challenging, the combat was interesting and the naval strategy was compelling and quite deep for the simplicity of the interface even though I didn't really know what I was doing. This game got me hooked not just on flight sims but strategy and real world history too.Now 20 years on I still remember this game and play it now and again because I STILL have not found a modern game that offers as much as this does. Everything else is either really arcadey or is a grand strategy that doesn't  incoporate the sim elements.Protip: If a studio (I could see Gaijin doing well with this) picked this up and modernised it while keeping all the gameplay and sim elements they'd be on to a winner.P.S. Still the best game ever.			"

												I think i got this for my 10th birthday. i played it for hours every day. when i saw it on steam i had to get it. back in the day this was an awesome game, still is. plays just like it did. i dont remember the graphics as retro (bad) as they are but i think in the early 90s it was high end. If you like old flight sims youll love this. you can play it as a RTS and when your planes get in dogfights or about to bomb you can jump in and fly your self. it really is a good game.			"
