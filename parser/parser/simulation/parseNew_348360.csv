												Doodle God itself in its most basic vanilla form is very fun and presents a good concept. However, this is not what you will be purchasing. I cannot believe the audacity of these developers to no only release alternative free versions of the game and to make me pay, but to also outright con people into buying their stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hints too. I find this absolutely infuriating as I feel you should not make people pay for a free game and then also include the micro-transactions too. It is abhorrent that someone actually gave the idea the go-ahead. Someone at JoyBits deserves a jolly-good sacking. [Micro-transactions have been removed as of late april due to what only can be described as warranted uproar] Also, when you're presented with the sounds tearing through your speakers, you either can turn them off or continue to have your eardrums ruptured. The Steam achievements don't even work (at the time of writing this) and that's without mentioning the annoying ♥♥♥♥ing animation that plays whenever you combine things that takes you straight back to the menu so you have to click a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of things to go back to being able to combine again. This is disregarding the disastrous Hiroshima-style release. It's not every day that a developer forgets to upload THE EXECUTABLE to the Steam servers on release. If this doesn't reflect the attitude the developers have towards this ♥♥♥♥♥how of a port, then I don't know what does. I could not recommend this money-grabbing, eardrum-splitting, outlandish 'Steam version' (totally not a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor mobile port or anything) any less and is logically, physically and practically possible.

												The game started as a free flash game, around five years ago if I'm not mistaken.It was quite good and it did well enough to spawn some spin-offs and sequels.This, unfortunately, is a port of the mobile version, which is marred with microtransactions for hints.It may not be as bad as the mobile version, which actually charged for energy and even content, but it's still outrageous to charge extra money for a game that's being sold.Besides this, they didn't seem to do anything more but port this sucker straight from mobile because there are no improvements and the game is pretty much the same.A very major flaw is that the sound and music can't be reduced in volume.Aka, no sound sliders. This is unacceptable, in this day and age.Not to mention, it's too bloody loud so my only option is to turn it off entirely.Unless the developers remove the microtransactions and implement a sound & music slider, to name a few improvements needed from this, this review will stay as is.

												Doodle god, it's a great game! If you haven't already played it for free that is... I played it when it was a free web game that you could find on the internet for free. When I saw it on steam, I had hoped for more, but it let me down. I'd reccomend you don't buy it, due to the fact you can probably find a website that still has it up for free (most letting you save). The game also has Microstransactions. Understanding that many games have them, but they have you buy hints for new creations. This wouldn't bee so bad if the prices weren't to bad. And especially if you've played Doodle God, Doodle God 2, or Even Doodle Devil in the past, I'd reccomend you don't get this. In the end, I rate Doodle God (Steam Version) 3 out of 10, due to the fact that it barley differs from the web version.			"

												""Doodle God"", has MICROTRANSACTIONS! (Actually, @ up to 20% per DAY, they're really MACROtransactions.) Some of which have to be renewed, for $1US, EVERY DAY! And you have to pay to eliminate duplicate actions, which should never happen in the first place.And hints HAVE to be used, as in the words of the DEV, some actions are ""borderline insane"". So you will have to spend money. Or leave the game and find them on the internet. Or at least, that's the suggestion of the DEV.I will be getting a refund immediately. It's a shame, I really enjoyed the six minutes I played (until I saw the two-page transaction ""menu"".)Thank you.			"

												I didn't learn that this was actually a free game until after I had already purchased (what a dummy, I know). I did have fun with it for a good few hours. It's fun, but it has microtransactions which I would understand if the game were free ... but it isn't. I never had to use them, but they are annoying and in some cases would have been nice to use (I refuse to ever pay for microtransactions regardless of game). I suggest finding it online and playing it for free elsewhere. It really is an addictive casual game for time-wasting.			"

												Every now and then a mobile developer tries to take their successful, beloved mobile game and bring it to a more traditional gaming platform. These efforts always result in dumpster fires of failure. It isn't that mobile games are necessarily worse than their more traditional counterparts, just that different audiences expect differetn things from their gaming experience. People that want to waste a couple of minutes on the ride to work aren't going to want the same exact thing when they actually sit down and play something in their own free time, and Doodle God is just the latest example of that.Doodle God, however, is just a mess from top to bottom. I don't understand how even mobile gamers enjoyed this. If you took a point-and-click adventure game item combination puzzle, and removed the context, goals, story, fun, and coded it entirely in goat's blood, you'd get Doodle God. You start with four elements, and start combining these elements to make more elements. These elements can then be combined with other elements to make more elements, and these elements can then be used to finally get you to the end goal: making more elements. That's all there is to the game. Rubbing two items together, hoping they work, and then seriously reevaluating where your life went wrong.You may think that combining elements to make more elements (made so you can make more elements) might sound pointless and boring, but you're wrong. It's also frustrating too. Unlike most games where you're combining things, the game doesn't really give you any hints as to what you should be making. The game has you making stuff like octopi and ghouls, but other common items aren't in the game's dictionary. However, the game doesn't actually tell you it wants octopi and ghouls, and you just sort of have to guess. This is fine in the early game when you don't have many objects, but at some point you have over 100 at one time and without the game hinting what the hell it actually wants you to make you just sort of have to guess. Doodle God is that annoying partner you had back in college that always wanted to go out to dinner but wouldn't tell you what he or she wanted until you actually guessed it.And to top it all off, a lot of the combinations don't make sense. Alright, so a warrior and a firearm makes a soldier. I suppose I can see that train of logic. But a fish and knowledge makes an octopus? What the hell does that even mean, Doodle God? ""Just gotta keep on reading to the fish...gotta make them an octopus through education... hmm,"" one of the developers overheard an insane man mumbling to himself on the subway one day and that idea made it into the game somehow. Since some of these combinations were seemingly just pulled out at random from a hat, inevitably you will reach a point where you just need to randomly start combining things and hoping for the best. Or you could just wait until the hints refill and do it that way. Or you can close Doodle God, delete it from your computer, then burn your computer on the off chance some of the awfulness from this title somehow seeped its way onto your harddrive. I'd recommend the third option. Or, the vastly superior option, never buying or downloading this in the first place and doing something better with your time like playing any other game available on Steam, going outside, or sitting perfectly still and allowing your mind to slowly deteriorate. Any of those option are better than ten minutes with Doodle God.			"

												Let's list every good thing about this game:1: Some item combinations are mildly amusing.2: The art is decent.Okay, done. Here's all the bad things:1: It's a bad mobile port and the entire UI is clearly designed for touchscreen, and plays awfully on a computer2: At least half the game is essentially advertisement for GameFAQs, because the item combinations are so arbitrary as to be impossible without a walkthrough or brute forcing. The only reason that the combinations are as nonsensical as they are was to sell more Hint IAPs, and it makes the game completely unenjoyable.3: There's a few combinations I found which actually had a different result depending on when in the game I combined them - meaning that I actually had to enter the exact same input twice expecting different results to complete the game.4: The game costs $6 despite merely being a port of an IAP-laden port of a sequel of a clone of a flash game from 2004. You could just play the first Doodle God on Kongregate for free and get an identical experience, if not a better one thanks to a UI that was actually designed for the platform they released the game on.5: A significant amount of these are near-identical to other combinations of items so you can't even complete the game without repeating yourself constantly (e.g., there's ~8 types of alcohol, all of which count as different combinations with nearly any material that combines with any alcohol)6: The game has 4 or 5 different gameplay modes, but I honestly can't tell the difference between any of them. The gameplay loop is exactly the same - pick a random thing, rub it against another random thing, hope the developers concocted some story as to how they fit together, and then rinse and repeat. 7: Every time you do luck out and find an arbitrary combination of elements that makes something new, you get thrown out of the combination screen and into a tedious animation of that new object appearing on a globe. This is mildly interesting the first 2 or 3 times. Less so after the 200th. In a game that's already frustratingly slow thanks to an awful UI and necessity of brute force, it just exacerbates the irritance.Just save your money and play the thousands of free flash games that do this much better.

												Mixing elements to form new ones is fun. Seeing a barren world gradually become populated with some of those newly created elements makes one feel like they're really creating something.Most of them show funny quotes and proverbs when created to add more flavour, and the intro scenes for each chapter are usually funny.Once you run out of the initial logical and fun way to combine elements (and patience), you're mostly stuck using brute force combinations or a guide. Once that happened, it became quite tedious.Puzzles and side games are a nice addition, especially the puzzles. Elements have to combined in a specific manner to form the required final element.Overall, can be quite tedious and frustrating, but it's still a good game. So I'm giving it a 'thumbs-up'.			"

												I enjoyed this on my iPod years ago. As a PC game - as someone who bought it after the whole microtransactions fiasco - it is horrible.They removed the frames which allowed you to see whether an element could be used. The game is, therefore, completely random clicking or a guide after the first 50 elements. How am I meant to guess that 'russian roulette' is an element but, say, 'oxygen' is not?It's dull, repetitive, and lacks any sensibility. "

												tldr - don't buy this game, you're better off playing either the free flash version (Doodle Blitz) or the app, which this game is a port of. The developers disgustingly put in microtransactions, asking players to pay for important functions which should be free from the getgo, and in turn stopped Doodle God from being the good game that it should be.Full Review:To be honest, I am pretty disappointed with Doodle God. It is actually just a Steam port of their mobile app. Seeing as how this has a higher asking price, I assumed that the game would already contain the additional useful functions which you had to pay extra for in the app and free flash versions. Appallingly enough, they still aren't made available to you despite the fact that we have paid a higher amount for almost the same game!! The functions that I mentioned are the ability to have repeated reactions disabled and to show which elements still had combinations available. Now, if you have never played any of the games in this series, let me sum up the gameplay briefly: You start off with a particular set of elements, and you combine them in the hopes of creating new ones. As you create new elements, more and more potential combinations are made possible. At first, its easy to keep track of which combos you have already made, but when you have, say, 75 elements, available, it becomes difficult to continue keeping track. After a while, Doodle God becomes less of a game and more like mere tedium. Doodle God is tagged as being casual, but instead of being that it ends up simply brainless. This is largely due to the fact that those aforementioned functions aren't available to us. Had we been given them, the experience would be MUCH more enjoyable.As if asking us to pay for those functions weren't offensive enough, the developers had the audacity to PUT A PRICE ON ADDITIONAL HINTS. Do you really think anyone would pay money for hints when they can just search up solutions/walkthroughs online for FREE?The only difference between this game and the mobile version is the Tournament mode which is not that fun to begin with due to it being buggy. There is no incentive for players to participate because it gives the top ranked players a useless prize, additional hints. I assumed that seeing as how they are selling it for an increased, they would give players access to disabled repeated reactions and the border guides, functions which you would have to pay for on the mobile and free flash versions.I won't deny, there are plenty of clever, funny moments in this game. However, the microtransactions and the withholding of functions that should be free, left a terrible taste in my mouth, despite being a fan of the series. It had the potential to be a nice, light, casual game. Hopefully the developers see our dissatisfaction with this and changes this, because right now, I cannot recommend people to pay full price for this. Just play the app or free flash version if you are REALLY interested. I wouldn't recommend buying this :/			"

												I really, really, really loved the original Doodle God and Doodle Devil. So much so that I played them through several times. So much so that I wanted to at least like this ""2"". I did not.Yes, the first part ('episode') was fun enough. Makes sense, since it's basically the original Doodle God game. But the fun ended a long time before I finished it. When playing the original, I remember people wanting to see the world being built. Yeah, that was a fun idea. The execution... nope. It's plain annoying to get redirected to see a mindless little twinkle of an animation on the globe after making certain combinations.The episode structure disrupted the game experience. I know this plus this makes that, but I flippin' well can't make it because I'm missing that one thing to unlock episode II. Unneeded. Unlocking the higher episodes your elements get reshuffled under different groups. That's mighty convenient, nothing better than searching Fire for 20 minutes 5 hours into the game. Also, now that you mention it, I really did want to make that disappearing Ice three times.The quests and puzzles and artifacts? Yeah, not really feelin' 'em. The Island one had promise, Inventions was surprisingly fun too. But they all felt like the results of a brainstorming session titled 'so what are we gonna do to make this feel new and exciting? we need their cash. anyone?'.Most people seem to be mad about the microtransactions. I have no idea what they are, I did not come across them. Sounds nasty tho. The pros? I did not pay a cent for this. The person I got this from did not pay a cent for this. I got 30 cents in tradeable cards. For some moments this was a fun walk on memory lane. I still can go back and play the originals for free on Kongregate. See the amount of time I played and the number of my achievements. I feel... dirty. Not recommended.			"

												This is an interesting one. I had played Doodle God very early on as a flash game with little updates, and never played the mobile one. So coming from that it's a huge upgrade with a bunch of stuff to do and is very fun.HOWEVER, while the game itself is good, it does two things that negatively effect it.#1: As you can see from all the negative reviews already, there are micro transactions in the game. They all cost $0.99 USD, cheap, but not needed in the game. While I myself don't have a problem with this because it doesn't effect gameplay at all basically, it's good to keep in mind that it's in bad taste for a game that's already asking for money up front. Just a bad business practice, and if you don't like that don't buy the game.#2: It's a direct mobile port. From the text saying ""tap"" to even the app pop ups saying ""RATE OUR GAME"". While it doesn't run bad on PC and the buttons still feel ok for the most part, it's still annoying that they just ported the game over.In my personal opinion I like this game. I don't mind the micro transations because they don't effect the game, they just make it a bit easier if you want to buy them. I also don't mind the direct port from mobile since the buttons are still ok.As someone who never played the updated version of this game on mobile compared to flash, I think it's worth the 5 bucks to play. I'm currently enjoying myself quite a bit.			"

												I became interested in Doodle God because of my job.  I figured any game that could keep a special needs child entertained and quiet (and not poking his neighboring van mates) during an hour long ride home AFTER being coped up in school all day had to be worth looking into.  The game is certainly mind absorbing, with all the combinations of ""elements"" that can be combined in the main game alone (249 total).  Now add to that all the other ""mini"" games that can be played.  Hours of entertainment, or at least mind absorbing nullness.     For those who do not know about Doodle God.  It is a game of combining ""elements"" such fire, human or zombie with other ""elements"" like water, apple, or internet to make new elements.  In the main game there are 4 stages, ultimately working up to a total of 249 elements.  Some of the combinations are very logical while others are not.  The main game is basically a game of elimination where the player takes a single element and combines it with every other element to see what happens.  Then repeat with a new element.  (Special thanks to MakoSipper and their achievement guide God of Patience.  I am quite certain without this guide I would have never gotten that achievement.)   Beyond the main game there 7 Quests, 14 Artifacts, 11 Puzzles, an on-line Tournament, and an Encyclopedia (a compliation of every element and element combination from all the games (main, quests, artifacts and puzzles).The Quests are specific scenerios such helping Santa build a sleigh or surviving on a desert island.  Artifacts is simply a puzzle where the player takes three elements and combines them to make a particular object like Stonehenge or a Light Saber.  (The best guide for this is Quests & Artifacts by ReivaX.)The Puzzles are more active thinking then simply random combinations.  The player must use the correct combinations to achieve the desired outcome such making a firecracker or a Jack O Lantern. It is easy to make the wrong combinations and get stuck.  If stuck, undo combinations or start again. (I made a visual guide for the Puzzles since there was not one already.)This game is not for everyone, and requires patience, tenacity and perseverance to get through (and/or earn all the achievements which is a different sort of patience, tenacity and perseverance.)

October 30, 2016Doodle God is weird in bad ways. I suppose it's technically a game. Put icons together to make other icons, with some flavor tech thrown in to add humor. JoyBits is at least honest in saying ""Mobile. Social. Casual.""I can't really talk too much about the game, as it is not inspiring to any degree. New icons are added as the game progresses, but it's still simple combos. Puzzles and artifacts are also available, but they play out the same. It's not thoughtful enough to be a puzzle, but the amount of icons prevent brute-forcing strategies. It's almost an easy 100% with guides, but the Patience achievement can be finicky.Doodle God is just not fun, and shows the flash/mobile game roots even after purchases have been removed. I feel like the game is aimed at younger kids, but the content doesn't seem appropriate. There are multiple icons related to sex and alcohol, and some flavor text with vulgar words, so I can't imagine many parents would be happy. If the game is for matured gamers, I can't imagine that they will be intellectually or mechanically stimulated. New content (more of the same) may be added, but bigger changes are reserved for mobile sequels (Doodle Kingdom, Devil, 8-bit, etc) available for purchase. I expect those games will be boring bundle fodder, which is where I got my copy. Don't bother at any price.			"

												This one was a lame time killer.  Basically, you combine two things, and ONLY two things to create new things.  The logic of the combos is crap.  It is likely the creator thought some of the combos were funny, so that makes one person.  You end up just cycling through every combo to unlock more stuff to combine.  For the little time I played the game, I can't help but feel that I came out a little dumber.  You can get more entertainment, sense of accomplishment, and challenge by breaking out the pumice stone and sanding down the calluses on your feet.			"

												It's fun at the start where you only have a few elements to combine and experiment, but as the game progresses it gets very tedious due to the over-abundance of elements and the recipes become nonsensical.Water + Glass = Ice?  Medicine + Beast = Rat? How does a normal human being figure this out by themselves without looking at a wiki or by brute-forcing every combination of elements?			"

Game Visual/AudioThere isn't much can be said about the game's visuals asides from that they're well done. Pretty much the same thing can be said about the game's audio. The visual and audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu.Gameplay[There are two things that I want to point out about this game. First thing: Is that there's already a free version of this game on the internet. Second thing: This game has micro transaction but it isn't necessarily to spend real money in order to play the game.]""Doodle God"" from the developer JoyBits. This game strangely similar to a mobile game called ""Alchemy."" And so the concept should be more or less the same thing.Main Quests: There are four episodes to play through. Progressing through of them is a lengthy process. Due to numerous combination for each of the elements.Artifact Quests: There are at least thirteen different artifacts to make. These artifacts can only made if the element(s) has been discovered in  ""Main Quests.""Puzzle Quests: There are at least seven different puzzle quests to complete. These puzzles can be solved rather quickly than the ones in the ""Main Quests.""Tournament: Online mulitplayer. Compete against other players in creating elements within given time-frame.Encyclopedia: Collection of facts on the elements from the game.There are twenty-two different achievements can be earned from the game. Each of these achievements has certain requirements to completed before they can be obtained.MiscellaneousThere are total of six different trading cards. You only get the three of those cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam's Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and it's Booster Pack Creator.Final thoughts, I felt that this game is good, but it can get tedious somewhat; discovering what is the best combination to create new elements. As for the game's replay value it's low. I would recommend this game but not at the full price. "

												Contrary to all the negative reviews this game has engendered due microtransactions for hints, now removed, I find this game ridiculously addictive.   You can still purchase hints through lightning bolt money, which now is gained primarily by completing missions.  All that said, I have played the game entirely without once purchasing a hint once.  If you want to use hints, they do recharge, which can admittedly take a while.  But that makes perfect sense since if you had unlimited hints, then this would be less of a challenge.The basis of this game is to incrementally combine ""elements"", which initially are air, fire, water, and earth into other elements, and so on, until you have built up to more complex elements like human and tools.  The game consists of four chapters, where in each you need to form up to a certain number of elements.  What separates chapters is adding an extra special element, as well as being able to combine some elements to form new ones not previously available.These combinations are not random.  They are a combination of logic, intuition and humor.  Sometimes you can form the same element multiple times in different ways.  Some elements like philospher's stone, have a property to ""undo"" other elements.  For instance, it combined with vampire, gives human, since vampire was the combination of blood and human.However, I will say the longer you play and the more elements you have at your disposal, the more difficult it can be to make any progress without getting a hint.  There are primarily three types of hints for the main game.  The first, which is rare, simply gives you a new element by combining two existing ones.  I don't like this one since it is just telling you the answer basically.   The second, which is the best, gives you two  groups from which then you know that you get a new element by combining an element from each.  At worst, you can just go through all pairing possibilities until you stumble onto a new element.  This hint recharges each 10 minutes, so it pretty much guarantees it will advance you in the game.  The last hint, which is the main one to use, is that it simply shows a new element that can be formed.  Just by knowing what one can be, gives you the chance to try and figure out what you can combine that could give that particular element.FInally, this game also has various mini games, such as puzzles, where you need to build up to a final element, like Christmas tree, not available in the normal main game, through a sequence of combinations from limited initiali materials.  In these puzzles, some of the combinations you have seen, and others you haven't.  All in all, I find this to be a fairly polished game.  Compared to the mobile version, I prefer the Steam version since it is more clear how many more elements are left to discover for a group, plus additional features such as an encyclopedia of discovered elements and the quotes that can go along with each as they are discovered.  Is this game worth $6?  By no means, but if you can get it part of a bundle as I did, or on sale for $1 or $2, then it is worth a little bit of time and money.			"

												7.8/10 - Spoiler: Human + Human = Sex!I really enjoyed this game; I know it can be found FREE elsewhere, but that's irrelevant to me. I'm sure I got this in a bundle or super cheap anyway and it was a nice add to the collection.This is a puzzle game that really makes you think; it's not really difficult but can be trying since you have to uncover 249 elements! There are also quests, puzzles and achievements to earn as you go. Most of the negative comments seem to be about the price and in-game purchases. You only get a finite amount of hints so you can purchase them, or wait for more free ones, earn them, or look at a help guide... so this isn't a make or break issue.Overall, I wouldn't pay $6 since I know it's Free other places... If I didn't know that it would be worth the full price. Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more. Free Keys and Reviews weekly!

												Steam needs a mixed review option.. Doodle God is a casual puzzle game with a creative mechanics that you will combine 2 elements together to create something new. The game is fun at first but after having so many elements, it becomes rather tedious with trial and error approach to combine things. Besides, some elements should combine but they don't, and some combining elements don't really make sense. The hint system also needs rework to make the game more enjoyable. Still a pretty good experience nonetheless.			"

												Doodle God is an engaging way to while away the time while listening to a podcast or music. Beginning with four elements, you must discover combinations to build your way from Earth, Air, Water, and Fire to Magic and Technology. The later elements are somewhat difficult to devine, as you are not instructed what you're trying to create. It can lead to repeated mindless clicking as you try to combine any and all elements available to you. Nevertheless, it kept my interest long enough to work at completing the game, and some of the unexpected results of element combination were quite amusing.			"

Doodle God est un jeu original où vous devez participer à la création du mondeCe que j’aime dans ce jeu, c’est qu’en plus du côté ludique, il y a des éléments permettant d’enrichir sa culture.Votre objectif est simple (que vous pouvez d’ailleurs découvrir dans la vidéo ci-dessous), il vous faut fusionner des éléments ensemble pour en obtenir de nouveaux éléments. Ensuite, il ne reste plus qu’à fusionner ces nouveaux éléments avec des anciens pour en obtenir d’autres et ainsi de suite.C’est ce qu’on appelle le progrès !

												As it stands right now, this is a great game. I have followed its development more or less from its inception in 2010, and always felt the concept was great, but that there was something lacking. The version now available on Steam addresses my concerns, presenting a full game with several layers of interaction and good ideas put into practice.Without microtransactions to hinder it, the main mode is quite fun to play and watch as your onscreen world develops, but the Quest mode is even more interesting, bringing an entirely new perspective to the game while still using the same core mechanics.If you have never played this game before or if you played a while ago, there was never a better time to really dig your theeth into it.

Ok, graphics are simple and pc port is just changing *.apk for *.exe, but game is fun to play, at least at the very beginning when you start to get some funny elements, after that it becomes repetitive, just click and repeat with all elements on that side to the other until you get a combo... yes, some times, and just, some times you could achieve a new element with some kinda of intuition, but the others are not.Even thouse ""bad things"" i would recommend this game? Yes, at least try it and get some smile with that crazy combos outta there.			"

Pretty good alchemy gameThis is probably the best Alchemy (combining elements) game avalible here on steam. It has tons of combinations so you wont complete it just in few hours. And if you get bored after some unsuccessful minutes in the main story, like u probably will when u have no idea how to combine another element, u can easily get to some of the avalible thematic puzzles and quests - like quest where u have to create Amor - a quest added on Valentine's day. Another plus is, that since this is a paid game there are no really annoying ads to buy more hints like there are in the free version app you can download for example in the windows store. Another plus, it is playable on a touchscreen / tablet. GOOD things:  Funny Nice graphics (compared to other alchemy games) Puzzles, Quests Playable on touchscreen / tablet BAD things:  Sometimes the combination is quite stupid "

												Having read other reviews, it seems that the main criticisms levelled against Doodle god are that a) it contains microtransactions even though you've already paid for it, and b) it's pretty much a port of the mobile version, which is cheaper (albeit containing even more microtransactions)I must say however, that even though you can pay for hints to help you solve the game's puzzles, it's by no means necessary to do so. The hints recharge at a fairly decent rate and so you basically get them for free anyway, paying for them is just a way of hurrying things along and so there's no need to shell out any more cash than you've already spent.True, there is a cheaper version for mobile devices, although I can't verify that it's exactly the same... From what I can surmise the Steam version contains a bit more content and doesn't require you to pay any where near as much for what you basically should already get in a bought game.The above issues aside, Doodle god is actually a pretty decent example of this type of setup. It looks great, presentation is superb and playing it is a pleasure. I love the way that as you progress, your creations start to appear on a nicely illustrated planet and the game consistently rewards you when you get things right. The music is relaxing and never grates on the ears. The only thing I would say though is that there is no volume control, no excuses for that really!!There's quite a bit of gameplay to keep you going, the main quest will probably take you 8 hours and then there are extra quests to do which will probably take you a few more. The puzzles for the most part are fairly logical but some can be a bit off the wall.. For instance Corpse + Electricity = Death metal?? I mean, I get it but.. I wouldn't automagically think to make that one.. It is a game that is suited to playing in bursts of about an hour at a time, but it's pretty addictive and you'll probably find yourself going back to it to catch 'em all.Overall it's quite a decent game for the price and I'll give it 6.8/10, I've had a lot of fun with it, but it's marred by annoyingly unnecessary microtransactions and a lack of volume control. If the developers change these aspects then the figure will rise.			"

												Played this years ago online for free (you can still find it on Kongregate and such). This paying version has a lot of added content: a world map and tons of minor minigames with the same basic game mechanic.The Good:+ It can be fun for a short while to try to combine random stuff, and sometimes succeed to make new random stuff out of them.+ The world map is pretty, and populating it adds a sense of progress.+ Each combination comes with a quote and a link to the Wikipedia article of the item :D Almost feels educational.+ In this version you can look up items by initial. Yay, no longer have to memorise which semi-arbitrary category each item happens to be in!The Bad:- The gameplay quickly becomes monotone, especially as many of the combinations feel arbitrary. Thus it's easy to get stuck, and to get the achievements in any timely manner, following online guides is absolutely necessary. Unfortunately this makes the game even more boring.- The minigames are fun in the beginning, but they have an even greater sense of arbitrariness to them than the main game, items often being in different categories and require different combinations than in the main one. Following guides is even more crucial to get anywhere.- F2P elements (daily visit bonus, limited stock of hints) in a paid game.- Many of the quotes are sexist.Verdict:Unlike similar casual games this is not even a good timewaster, as it becomes boring and frustrating really quickly, and from then on it feels like a chore to go through a guide and unlock each item.

												if you are one of those casuals that like puzzle games that offers very little in terms of fun expierance then I would reccomend this game to you. This offers very little in terms of challange and anyone and I mean anyone can reach top the leaderboard within 6 - 8 hours. Its a game I suggest you play on your phone rather than spend more money to have it on steam.Also I would like to add that the microtransations are comepletly worthless as you can just look up the guide online and comeplete the game or you can just leave the game for a few hours and get your hints back free.

												Doodle God is an interesting and fun puzzle game. The puzzles and combinations are generally good. Some combinations don't really make sense sometimes, but you'll have that.When compared to the version I played on Android a while back, some of the additions for this version can be a little annoying. The world view frequently pops up, taking you away from play in the main game. There are a lot more combinations and groups here, which makes it endlessly more difficult to find something specific if you haven't been using it since nearly the beginning of the game. It also doesn't help that things get moved around in the last section of the game. The only thing that saves this is the search, but the search goes away as soon as you click. It would be nice if I could keep the search open on both sides and drag directly from them.The quests, when done right, will tell a neat little story, such as saving a princess or getting stranded on an island and getting rescued (if you play that one right). They're a nice addition. The added content in general sometimes feels like it's purely to extend gameplay though. It does mean that there's a lot more stuff to play around with and discover in the game.Yes, it offers microtransactions, that you would have to turn on to be able to get. It's only for people that don't want to solve the puzzles. You can get the same stuff by just playing, or if you don't feel like discovering stuff on your own, you can use a walkthrough, which there are many out there for Doodle God.There are several things I don't like about the game, but at the core, it's still a fun and interesting game. The good of the game really does outshine the mild annoyances I find in it, so it gets a thumbs up from me.			"

												Doodle God is a popular mobile game. You match elements and items to create new ones. Although that seems simple the game is actually quite witty and advanced. It really helps to pass the time while waiting in line, taking transit or countless other times you are in your phone.But what is nice is you can now play the game on your PC. It's really stunning. You can easily switch between your device and the app via the upload option. Don't lose track and keep making new things!Don't want micro transactions? Don't rush the game and buy hints. Google also provides free hints if you are that rushing kinda person. :PThe PC version really has a lot more animation, mode and levels to it than the mobile one. Easter mode? Halloween? Santa mission? You will easily pass the time clicking away on these things. I would recommend this game for anyone looking for a fun, puzzle clicking type game.			"

Otherwise the game the 100% completeable without spending additional money.The game itself is alright. 10/10 would buy again.			"

			While not a religious person myself if there is a god and they are even a little like the god showed in this game it's pure proof against intelligence design .		

While not a religious person myself if there is a god and they are even a little like the god showed in this game it's pure proof against intelligence design .Starting with just the four basic elements start smashing them together to discover new elements.  Then take those new elements and smash them together, repeat this process finding newer and weirder combinations.If there was a consistent logic to how the combinations were unlocked this could be a reasonable puzzle game, however after the initial basic ones it all goes off the rails and becomes the the worst part of adventure games: combining stuff inside the inventory.

Frustration, pain, and lots of fun will come from playing this game as you create the world. I did notice that there were a lot of new things comparaitvely to when I played Doodle God on my iPod Touch and there was more content (i think unless i didnt get very far on my iPod Touch). Overall, this game is very fun and is worth a play especially if you haven't played it before.Rating: 8.4/10			"

												Warning! This game has microtransactions and they will attempt to bleed you dry! The game uses a hint system where you can pay money for hints for how you should combine elements to make new elements. You get some free hints handed out to you like coupons, but they run dry super fast. This is not really something that belongs on Steam if you ask me, but I stomached it... But only until I completed the first episode! For guess what!? The episodes are gated behind artifact puzzles where you have to combine 3 elements to create an artifact. The problem with these artifact puzzles is that it matters which element is placed first, and the order makes no logical sense, and to make matters worse the hint that is supposed to help you by telling you which category the elements belong to places the group order all wrong. So the hints are borderline non functional in these puzzles, and oh boy are these puzzles contrived and convoluted, practically forcing you to buy the hints! And the interface changes to a long list of elements in alphabetical order instead of the previous element groupings, making it a pain in the ♥♥♥ to find the element you are looking for or to scan them at a glance. This was the point where I got fed up with the microtransaction system... And here I thought the build times in Godus was bad, imagine if the houses in Godus required you to complete a borderline functional puzzle with some hints not even working... I have requested a refund, but I doubt I will get it...Shame... I really liked the flash game, but this is a damn scandal and I bought the game so I have a damn right to complain! I asked Steam for a refund, I just hope they will grant it... I played for 4 hours(the time it took to get to the puzzle) so it doesn't look good for me... :(			"

Not a nice thing to do.			"

												So, lots of people are mad at this game cause of microtransactions. But hey, look carefully at them. You have an option(!) to buy in-game hints, in case you stuck. These hints you get from time to time eventually (and free), you get them as daily rewards (also free) and you can win them in multi-player (also free). Not to mention that you can simply google the Doodle God Wiki and use it to complete the game without any hints. And of course you can actually THINK and complete the game yourself. So, why are these people SO mad? Maybe because they are SO dumb and cannot play puzzle game without hints, which they actually bought? Nobody forces you to buy anything, the game can be freely completed without any additional payments.Apart from that - its a nice puzzle game with good and sometimes hillarious gameplay. I strongly recommend it to all puzzle-lovers. Cheers.			"

												Doodle God is a Casual, Addicting Puzzle game. The game is all about logic to create items and to advance.People think this game is bad because of Microtransactions, WRONG! Microtransactions are there just if you actually want to get more hints or whatever else. But it isn't the case. You get hints from time to time. but it is your choice if you want to spend $0.99 on hints the game dosen't force you, and if you are stuck you can look up how to craft something on the wikia page of Doodle God.In the reviews, i've seen that people say you can Play it on a website or download it on your phone and that the company of this wonderful game is just trying to make money, which is true they are but you chose to buy this game on steam maybe for leaderboards challenges or whatever, I used to play this game as a child and I loved it because it was so fun.Pros- The game is large, with challenges, missions, and 4 chapters of main game.- Graphics- Whenever you create things it adds it to the world.- Leaderboards and tournaments.Cons - Microtransactions (Personally, I dont care)- Little Settings, I would like Resoultion settings, volume control.Overall Score 9.5 / 10 EDIT MICRO TRANSACTIONS REMOVED AS OF APRIL 2016			"

I hope they make it harder.I don't understand all of the complaints about in-apps. Its not a big deal to me. I passed the first 3 episodes without having to buy anything. There are no paywalls or in game currency either. Overall I would say the PC version is a good crating-puzzle game. I like it!			"

												First of all, it's meaningless to care about microtransactions when they're A: Not at all necessary to use them. If your stuck, you can simply use google, or try different combinations. And B, the game does not push the microtransactions at you. It's a meaningless detail in this game, unlike so many others. Don't review negative just because your an imbecile.I first played this game on an ipod touch, and much has changed since it came out. But the basics are the same.You combine various elements to create new elements. In the beginning you have fire, earth, air and water at your disposal. And then it's up to you to create just about every element there is in the game. And there are many. And almost every time you discover a new element, you will also read a quote that's related to the element at hand.The main game spans over four episodes. The Beginning, Technology, Modern Age, and The World of Magic.As you combine elements and creatures, tools and buildings, the once barren landscape beneath you comes to life. Snow and grass begin to cover the landscape, and animals and mythological creatures roam the world. This game looks good, and much attention has been put into the art that's basicly everywhere.Without saying too much more, I'd like to point out that there are also six quests, which work as individual mini-episodes, with a focus on a specific area. Save a princess from a dragon, counter the sins of doodle devil or 20'th century inventions.There are also Puzzles, which are even smaller, and possible to fail. (and start over)There will probably be more content for this game, and since they've released it for free for so many, why is it wrong to allow them to actually sell their game to the people who are willing to pay?But yeah, you can probably find this game for free if you look for it.More than aight/10			"

												Great game! Highly addictive! It tests your wits and analytical (deductive) thinking. Whenever you discover a new element, you get a funny quote about it. Lots of fun.			"

												Great fun, and the game has come a long way since I played the earlier games of Doodle God and Doodle Devil over at Kongregate. A fun game, with a good mix of puzzles and some comedy. You might even learn a thing or two too ;)			"

												There is no reason for the reviews complaining about having to pay to play. I played for almost 2 hours straight. Paying just refills the hints quicker but hints can be found online if you want to do it that, I don't. Also it isn't too hard to figure out what and what can do stuff. Most my elements were made without hints. And the hints refill quick enough on their own. Stop being stupid and giving bad reviews to a good game because you are too impatient to wait for your hints to refill. This is a fun and awesome game.			"

												This game is OK, but a bit frustrating.  I'd describe this as a cute time waster that has a diminishing level of enjoyment as you play.  Certain combinations are not available early in the game but open up later, so you do find you are repeating matches to see if they form something later.  There is not quite as much 'logic' in the matches that I would expect, so as you get into the game it feels like it's just about making random combinations over and over again, rather than a puzzle of what goes with what.  (The game Alchemy does this much better.)  What Doodle God offers includes better graphics, a sense of achievement as you complete chapters, quests etc.  The story driven challenges are a nice twist too.			"

												Got this game in a humble bundle. I played it way back when it first came out of iPhone and it has held up pretty well over the years. I do find the seperation into chapters a little confusingly unnecessary, but it allows the game to go into two different directions, so whatever floats your boat. It does get repetative though. What was easy to do on a phone with swiping one element to another is a little bit slower and more tedius with a mouse. The puzzles and quests were really fun, and (with help from guides) achievements are all pretty attainable.If you can see past its flaws and enjoy a game that is quite repetative in nature, then Doodle God may be for you. If not, definitely avoid it as it will probably be another title that ends up collecting dust in your library.			"

												This is a real mood healer. I love the vivid colors and the clouds rotating around the earth. I would like to be able to save to wmv the video presentations of one's progress. Also: I love this musical piece and I would like to hear other equally as peace generating atmosphere music.			"

												This game is Okay for its price. It is very interesting for the first 1 or 2 hours, but it will become less attractive as you play longer. This game allows you to create a world with your creativity, but does not allow you to zoom in and see the details ( because the world is nothing more but a picture of globe).After all, this game will be good enough when you are looking for some relax. For the people who think this game is trash, I would say: It is only $5 and what do you expect?			"

												This game is essentially what the Free game called Alchemy is, except it adds voice, and fills in a 2D world / universe as you unlock elements and a few ""game-modes"" which start you off with a selection of elements and you have to reach an end result in addition to having a somewhat more friendly UI.It supports 13 languages.I received it in a bundle otherwise I would've stuck to the free mobile version or the free Alchemy game. I'd price this game no higher than $1.99 and I can't refcommend the game until the issues below are resolved.The bad:Not all of the elements make sense. The price may be a bit high for a mobile game. It doesn't detect Steam so you can't use any of the Steam features such as Cloud saving / loading and it threatens you that you need Steam running to even play the game; luckily it doesn't close the game because of this bug...Limited options.You can't control the volume of sound / voice / music; only toggle them which is a major thumbs down.Some of you who ""shelter"" / ""protect"" kids from the truth may appreciate this, but I haven't seen much of anything I wasn't already aware of at 6 years old albeit I was at a college level and fluent in 2 languages: Kids safe mode?

												This is an obvious mobile/tablet port which has had the bare minimum done to make it a PC game.It does have a nice friendly graphical style, and when you start off the gameplay of combining elements does make some sense. The further you get in though, the more obtuse they seem, and you end up relying on hints or a guide.However I did enjoy this, and while I feel it isn't worth the full asking price it's a fine addition to a bundle or other cheap deal.

												Doodle God is a simplistic puzzle game where you, as God, must create the universe.  You start with the four basic elements of nature (fire, earth, wind and water) and by combining them you must create items ranging from oceans, volcanoes, rocks, plants and animals to humans, tools and weapons and eventually machines such as automobiles and rockets. The developer markets this game as requiring logic and ingenuity in order to succeed , but it's really little more than a guessing game where you'll frequently find yourself using trial-and-error to find the right combination of items needed to progress. I do believe that Doodle God was a great idea when it was first released as a free online game many years ago, but I don't believe this version offers enough additional content to justify the price.
