												This is a terrible game, not even Pre-Alpha quality, filled with so many bugs it was PAINFUL to play the first hour I did. - Game graphical bugs and glitches so apperent, they could have walked up and hit you with a stick.- Music cuts out alot.- The Objectives are so vegue, good luck finding anything for them.- Spent the first 30min trying to get the second Objective to clear, due to I hadnt found a nessisary Trigger that was not even remotely needed to start the next objective.- The fatigue and loosing consiousness mechanic is broken, and so fast that you have little time to get to be able to get your fatigue back up before you have to start all over.Over all, this game is no where near 15$, I wouldnt have tried to finish this game if it were FREE			"

												If you reading this you either are contemplating buying this and looking for more info, or you're equally as likely someone who bought this game and is trying to figure out a fix for the absolutely abysmal performance. My advice as someone who bought this title months ago is: DO. NOT. BUY. THIS.There have been performance issues since the very beginning and not a single thing seems to have been done about it except constant ""well it works on our pc's"" and a single patch that noone who was complaining about issues seems to find did a damn thing. Dev responses have dropped to literally nothing on most. Oh but they will respond to anyone new asking how the game runs and then tell them that their have been no complaints after this first patch WHEN THE COMPLAINTS FROM BEFORE IT ARE STILL VALID AND HAVE YET TO BE FIXED.If you already bought this game, I advise you to request a refund from steam. Do NOT give a developer who is this distant and clearly doesn't give a damn your time or your money. Anyone who has been complaining along with me for the few months, supposedly steam is giving refunds for older titles with special consideration. I suggest giving them a shot. I personally won't because even though I feel ripped off I still will accept the bad purchase I made.Hopefully this stops people from being burned.			"

												No...just no.  The poor optimization, not-so-fluid animations, and the constant crashing made me quit the game five minutes in.  When the developers decide to fix the game and make it playable, I'll be happy to revisit it.  For now, it's most certainly not worth $15.  Play the free game that came before this (One Late Night) on Desura instead.http://www.desura.com/games/one-late-nightEdit: Gave the game another go after being informed of a patch.  The crashing as stopped and the average FPS went from 20-30 to 30-40, so the game has improved some.  I still find the animations to be a bit mechanical (not fluid or natural) and the headbobbing while running makes me extremely dizzy.  Both Amnesia and Outlast have better graphics, clock in at $20, and provide 4-8 hours of gameplay, so I'll hold off on further judgement as far as worth is concerned until I can determine how long this game actually is.---

YouTube™ Video: One Late Night: Deadline Gameplay/Commentary with Facecam - WHAT WAS THAT 

			Views: 651		

			I play a horror game that needs some work. I don't know if it was just me but this game was very confusing and seems to be not working properly. When the optimization is fixed I will revisit it.		

Edit: I played the game after it has been updated and the main issues have been mostly solved, Optimization is still a huge issue but this time it was actually playable on lowest settings, You now have a clearer idea as to what you have to do thanks to the objectives tab and you no longer get launched up in the air when you use a vending machine. The graphics is an issue for me though, I don't know if its because I had to keep the settings at the lowest level or what but when I came into contact with the janitor he had no eyes and his face was strange looking. I go into greater detail in my revisit video below.

												Ok. Just tried playing more to  give this game another try. Still♥♥♥♥♥♥ the graphics even on the highest setting are atrocious and glitchy. the lights blink in and out of excistance depending on the angle you look at them. items spawn only right as your about to bump into them, and the lighting looks like someone borrowed the bloom out of oblivion and then doubled it. Running is worthless, it is actually the first game to get me motion sick, as when you run your vision locks straight a head aside from some sharp V bobbing.  When you go to get a soda from the machine or use a keycard it just seems to choose a random position and then flail around. directions for the game are almost non-excistant, ""Find out what the scream was"" or some other objective. first thing you find is a locked door and you need a keycard. opened every stupid drawer, door, cabinate and whatever else with no luck before i quit.The design just doesnt look good either. Sinks in counter tops, when  you open the cabinate under them the cabinate is empty. Not even showing the sink sticking down into it, pipes, or anything, so evidently the water just pours into another dimension. In the halls pillars stand in the middle of the walk way, meeting rooms are more cramped then closets, and for some reason, several of the bathrooms have the toilets blocking the door. The controls are dreadful, as mentioned with running, they are clunky and clumbsy otherwise, the mouse at times seems to drag as if the batteries are dying, or zip about like a humming bird on cocaine. trying to select something means getting it EXACTLY int he middle of the screen, which is harder then it sounds as your just sort of guessing and fighting the mouses grand maul seizures. I'll admit, i quit after only a while as it was unplayable, in the controls were horrible, and even worse IT WAS BORING!! So hearing of how its suppose to be scary, (the only thing that i saw was one of the hallucinations from System Shock 2, a much more interisting, tense, and scary game thats only 10 dollars here on steam) i went and watched some videos. Ghost hunters has more scares.Now, i dont mean to rag on the developer, took a risk and put a game out. Just seems it needed a bit more polish and planning. But in all truth and honesty, i cant suggest getting the game.			"

												Even ignoring the absolutely HEINOUSLY bad optimization (and trust me, it's BAD - this game is jerky on a Core i7 with a GeForce 9800GTX, struggling to maintain 30FPS on MINIMUM settings), the game is glitchy beyond belief. Activating ""keycard scanners"" zooms your view straight into the nearest wall (I guess the ""idea"" was to zoom the view to the keycard scanner, but welp), and the elevators simply do not work (the first one I tried seemed to have a wall in front of it, the other one just spit me out in the middle of the lobby, as if I glitched through a wall and a floor). This absolutely kills whatever interest the moody (and actually fairly-well voice-acted - a nice surprise) opening helped ignite.It's absolutely unfathomable that a developer would consider a game in this state ""ready for release"" - and beyond that, actually insulting to me as a consumer. Definitely would recommend avoiding Black Curtain Studio's further games.			"

												Black Curtain, what happened?Honestly, I'm actually disappointed in you. One Late Night was amazing, I loved it, so when I heard they were making a sequel, I was really excited. Then one day I saw it had released and immediatly bought it. But it wasn't what I expected. Horrific frame rate, menus I couldn't close, unclear objectives, everything. I very rarely say this, but this game was bad. I tried to be optimistic, but the game is so broken I just couldn't deny the truth. This game would not, and could not, live up to the predecessors potential. If you do read this, Black Curtain, I do have something good to say. The voice acting and story (as much of it as I could find) was great, so why did you focus on story only? This would have been better as a book, because books don't glitch out or skip load times into a level you already passed. Maybe if you remake the actual gameplay, so that it's functional, I would consider playing this game again, but for now, this is quite literally the worst game i've ever played. WORSE than Ride to Hell: Retrebution or Air Control, because those game are hilariously bad. This is just...Depressingly bad. You screwed One Late Night up.			"

												I loved One Late Night and was excited for its ""sequel"". I immediately bought it on release expecting the same results from the first game, but that turned out to be a big mistake. This game does not run smoothly at all, and I knew that my GTX 760 didn't stand a chance after people complaining that thier GTX 980 couldn't even break 30fps. I have little to nothing to say for the story, since I never got the game to run smoothly. I forced myself to play through it at around 9-12 fps and noticed a few bugs here and there. Even if you were a fan of the original One Late Night game, I'd reccomend skipping this one...			"

												I'm going to summarize my time spent playing this game.I started out in a rainstorm looking at the protagonist. The camera zoomed in and crashed into his head a la Goldeneye 64. After the AI walked into the building for me, I was in control. My objectives told me that I was to go to my office. I sprinted to the third floor. I say sprinted, but running in this game is the speed of slow walking and walking is the speed of an elderly person recovering from hip surgery.Upon reaching my office, I picked up a paper from the desk and spent the next 5 minutes walking around the office trying to figure out how to fax it to the client. Eventually, I figured out that I wasn't standing in the exact place I needed to be while clicking the fax machine and it wasn't registering. With that objective complete, I went to make some coffee. Coffee machines function as save points. However, in order to save, you must watch the coffee brew in real time. It's great standing in one spot for 30 seconds, unable to move, while a fresh, hot cuppa joe brews for you. As I was about to take a sip, I heard a scream from the second floor. What could be wrong?I plodded to the second floor and stepped through a door, wandering the hall full of pitch dark offices, searching for what made the sound. Oh no! A spooky witch! Oh, it's gone. Back to walking. I'm getting tired. I'd better go drink some soda. Oh, the door is locked and I can't get back to the vending machines. I spent the next 10 minutes searching random desk drawers, each step slower than the last until I finally passed out from exhaustion and died. Fantastic.Pros: + Nobody is forcing you to play this game.+ Characters have noodle armsCons: - Terrible framerate- Mouse sensitivity is either way too high or way too low.- Pop-in loading and invisible objects abound- The worst lighting I have ever seen in any game- Everything elseAvoid this game at all costs.

												RUN!!! Run away for gods sake! RUN as fast as you can because the gliches and frame-rate will find you and they will steal your 10-15 dollars with NO regrets!!!Away in all seriousness, this game is abysmal and toxic at that. I ,like I can assume that many others did, bought the game with much cherishing under the intension that it was going be similar to the style of the original game. I can however testify that this game is so different and terrible. No matter how good your computer and graphics card may be, they still won't be able run the game properly and this is because the game feels unfinished. It's like the developers made it 30 minutes tops and decided it was too much effort so they said screw it and published it in hope to make a quick buck. I honestly feel robbed of my money. I rather play a game like Superman 64 because at least it would run at a frame rate higher than this game. Not to mention that that game recieved a rating of 3.4 by IGN which in my opinion is a higher rating than this game deserves to recieve. DO NOT buy this game, save your money for a game that works.

												Maybe the story is good, probably it's not. The game is not playable cause bugs, terrible hitboxes, fps and a lot more are horribleMostly the game seem to be a patchwork to show of an architectural design, cause this seem to be the only thing that was really worked out,the furniture looks like it was stolen from an IKEA furnishing programm, no background exist, so it looks like this office building is right in nowhere.if you use a very (very very) good pc u might be able to work around the fps problems, but then u have to deal with slow movement speed and will get lost in the building cause in the most cases you can find a way around locked doors through the fire escapemaybe u even get stuck in a room cause u are just not able to pick up the key on the floor.graphic glitches between overlays and glass may be the smallest problem the game has.the most horrible thing on this ""Horror Game"" is that i've paid money for it.

The graphics are not very good (still enough to do their job at game's environment) but they aren't optimized and drain a lot of resources from your card, also you have to be in a specific point near the objects to interact with them, you can't do this even if you're pointing the view and they're highlighted.

Yes, the game has flaws graphically and some major game-breaking bugs, but this game was made with real care. shooting this game down calling it one of the worst in gaming only discourages this and other new developers from trying their hand at making games.

												You know since so many people are downing this game i am going to say the opposite.It had it's issues coming out sure it was running terribly but now the game runs fine and everything works.For a indie developed game i have to give this game a 10/10. Great story it picks up after the first game left off.AAA graphics and the game runs fine. I have nothing bad to say about it. The game is constantly updated bugs are fixedthings are being improved. So all in all i am going to be playing this game over and over.			"

												This game is intresting and scarry. Unlike most horror games it has alot of substance and detail the game runs perfectly for me on low graphic  settings which dosnt take away from the game and it still looks really good. Don't know why people complain there are only a few bugs but nothing game breaking. People who have played the game should try the new content update			"

												I want to say at front that I don't recomend bying this right now due to the framerate issues people seem to be having, but I recomend to wait for a while for a patch if it is patchable.Now that  that's out of the way I still enjoy it. I haven't gotten yet to the scary elements of the game other then one scream from a woman but the office building sets up the chilling mood and a believable enviroment for the story to take place upon.I managed to encounter some minor bugs aswell that while not game breaking can break the immersion a bit:Clipping issues when using the soda/coffee machine, some animations a bit off (pressing buttons that aren't there, might be because of the low graphics that I had to run to play the game on a reasonable fps) and the lift leaving me to the top of    the elevator shaft. Still the mystery of the game intrigues me a lot and with some small polish to the game, it would rate very well on my books.If you want see some gameplay here is my  video of the game. "

												After the Update 1.01 its running fine on my system. The atmosphare is awesome! i really like the office building and all the places there.Also the soundtrack and sound effects are really cool and matching to the horror scenario.It takes the strong parts of the first game and add some cool new features.But there is one thing thats really annoying and destroys the gameplay, its possible to glitch throughlocked doors. but iam really sure that will be fixed soon :)			"

												Yes, I would recommend this game.. When it gets a few updates.. My gtx780 would get around 15-20 and rarely sink to 5 fps at the highest settings.. If you could fix this.. the game would be more enjoyable and fun to play, cause the framerates really hurt from time to time... Overall the game is fun, and i had a few jumpscares here and there.. hehe.. one more thing.. It's a bit pricy to be in this early stage.. Thanks, if you are reading:)			"

												Review for new update:+ Way better frame rate, can go up to 40 frames easily+ The annoying little bugs throughout the game have been fixed+ Now playable - Still a few bugs and things need to be fixed - Still needs a better objective viewer because you can only see one objective at a time- Character gets drowsy too quickly which can cause lots of problems+ The story is very interesting+ It is extremely creepy when it needs to be which makes it a great horror experience + Amazing graphics+ Can be funny at some points of the gameI'm recommending this game because if everything is fixed this can be an amazing game.If your not sure if you want to buy it check my first look video out:

												ok, barely played it.BUT!No one has written a review since the january patches and I feel this guy deserves some credit.Sure, there are some weak animations, and it's a little buggy, but I found it runs nicely on my GTX750 (framerates are good on Nice setting, in my opinion the game feels smoother with the mouse sensitivity turned down, but maybe that's just me). The head bob is annoying but it's only when you run. All the really bad stuff has been fixed. I gave up on this game multiple times within minutes and now i'm looking forward to getting some more time in with it. It's running rather nicely.Now, it's not fair comparing this to amnesia or outlast as this is a one man show HOWEVER I can understand since it is priced rather high for what you're getting.If, on the other hand, you've played the first one, you like it, you're not too stingy with your money and like a good horror game (cuz we all know how many bad ones there are) So far this is not a bad game at all.I recommend it with reservations, but I also am very pleased with how much work the developer has put into fixing these issues.

												I would recommend you to buy the game, but don't play it yet. I have medium-end specs, and the game runs at 6-30 fps on lowest graphics. My computer can handle games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive at medium-high settings, this game has framerate issues. Would recommend, but not until a patch is released.			"

												I've seen some youtubers playing this and thought I would give it ago. And I did see the bad reviews. I didn't even get a chance to get into the game at the moment, due to the mouse doesn't seem to be working with the game or the game doesn't want to use my mouse.  I can move around the in the game, but I can't turn to look at things which is gonna be crappy as I won't be able to access doors and such. I'm gonna wait for another update and give it go then. I'm not going to jump to disliking this game or saying this negative.			"

												Warning: Spoilers Ahead!Hello. First, I would like to point out that I originally gave this game a positive review because I thought several graphical issues like low FPS would be fixed in update 1.1. However, this does not appear to be the case. While many things were changed in update 1.1, there are still several issues with this, like being able to fix the vending machine BEFORE you find the phone (which, there is no objective as far as I know to getting the phone before you go to the room in which it is in, so it is already hard to find), which completely messes up the storyline and what the heck you are doing. Also, I am almost certain I save in a certain spot, and it takes me all the way back to where you first get coffee on the third floor. (Though I could be wrong.) However, that being said, 1.1 also brought many new elements to the game, like the scary man appearing in new places. However, the lady constantly appears in the office when I try to use the fax machine, which can get annoying. All in all, the game is NOT bad. However, it needs to have several things be fixed and tweaked, along with the graphics issues fixed. Until then, I would wait for this game to be fixed.This next section only applies to the people who are giving this game lots of hate.While I am dissapointed with this game in several ways, I am also dissapointed to the way people have reviewed this game. For example, reviews such as: ""Just Nasty!"" (Yes, that is a quote.) are offensive to the developer of this game. Yes, while he does need to work on several things on the game, it doesn't give anyone the right to be rude about it. (To be honest, the ""Funny"" review function on Steam was a mistake.)			"

Product received for free
												This game could be great. It has a nice graphic, nice soundtrack and even a good voice acting.However, a HUGE perform issue makes it all useless. On the lowest graphic settings  I can barely get 20 FPS... also, the step SFX is awful (and you'll hear it through the whole game, so its a big deal).Besides that, looks like it could've been a really great indie title, as the setting is promising. Looking forward for a performance fix to trully enjoy this game.			"
