												You would be stupid to not invest money into this game, it really change my career as a fashion designer around and now i make around 75k a year on doing what i love best.			"

												The short answer: this is not Style Savvy AT ALL.Longer: surreal shovelware knockoff of America's Next Top Model/Project Runway set in an 'episodic' format. Game is broken, you may need to tweak files yourself to get past a nasty crash bug on episode 5. If you're familiar with XML and/or can edit a .TGA, congrats - you can mod the game and fix that bug. Also, it'll let you create custom attire.None of the above-mentioned facts will make the game FUN, however.			"

												I can't really recommend this. No matter what you do they vote the black girl off first, and the character models look like The Sims 1, but up close. Clothing selections range from quaint to ludicrous. When you look for 2012's 2008 Fashion Game of the year, look elsewhere.			"

												0.9/10 - If I had a daughter... She would NOT play this![Post Review]This Ghetto game wouldn’t record my playtime even though I invested 20 painful minutes. I wasn’t going to let this prevent me from telling you how bad this game was. (My Fix) On the startup it will show “running” for a few seconds… at that time you immediately click the “X” button and hold it for 5 additional minutes. – Figuring this out was way more fun than the game.------------------[Original Review]This game was on my list so I finally decided to bite the bullet and check it out. I mentally prepared myself to design outfits for the next hour or so; but I can't do it. The graphics are mediocre for 2008 and we are lacking some real content here. Sound and Playtime doesn't work.The problem that can't be overlooked is this; a game focused on outfit designs has to have a massive plethora of options to choose from or some kind of editor. This game only has around 100-200 valid outfit combinations such as only 20 pants, shirts etc... LAME. How am I supposed to WOW the judges picking from 20 options. Basically, you ""design"" outfits and put your creations against other designers in a runway competition. The judges will rate the outfits and send the worst designer home. (Me) There is no gameplay, just pick out your totally cute outfit and watch them walk the runway.Worth nothing; they should pay us!

												Pros:+Some diversity in models+It's got a variety of game modes+Customizable models from foundation to eyebrow shape+Tons of options when creating clothes, down to the textures, designs, and colors+It doesn't always crash..Cons:-Everything not listed in Pros; gameplay, UI, graphics, audio,  literally everything else.-For some reason you can't give models black hair? The only hair colors availble are blue, blonde, brown, purple, and red.. wtf?-Crashes/freezes fairly oftenIf you want a fun game based on fashion, photography, and runways with good graphics and great gameplay, I highly recommened Jojo's Fashionshow 1 and 2 If you want a fun game based on creating clothes for runways I recommend Barbie Fashion Show for the PCThis game is neither of the above and is incredibly underwhelming. I could not look past its horrendous fashion, outdated graphics, tons of unappealings options, no tutorial, and completely abhorrent UI.  "

YouTube™ Video: Let's Short Play Episode 3: Mission Runway 

			Views: 93		

			Let's rock that tumor jacket! Alternate title - Mission Run Away Right Now! follow my twitter for video updates! https://twitter.com/mirta0001 can be found in steam store here:...		

here is me getting trough the game while trying to actively fail.Now let me get into detail as to why I will not recommend:1. Graphic quality is very poor. Having in mind that this is a dress up game made in 2008, graphics really matter and I expected better.2. I have no idea how do the judges judge. I don't know what I did right or wrong. Each level is a guessing game. I would have expected the jacket that I chose to fail me, but some levels it seems to be rated amazingly well, in others, so so. In fact I do not know if it's even possible to fail.3. Did not find any sound control.Obviously the intended audience is much younger, however I still recommend picking anything else over this.Also while this wasn't the intention of the creator of the game, but because how the game launches, only that brief moment while it launches will it count you as playing it. As you need to play the product for 5 mintues or more to review it, but it's nearly impossible to get steam to recognise that you're playing it, it's kind of impossible to leave a review!			"

												Are you looking to break into the fashion industry? This game is a one way ticket to stardom. The lessons you can take from this are rich and plentiful. Bask in its practical tips and learn how to match zebra print hats with rainbow eyeshadow to make your own train wreck Lady Gaga impersonation! Accessorise the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of your creations! Mission Runway has a lot to teach you about life, as well. You think it's coincidence that the red bag doesn't look good with the bedsheet dress? It's no coincidence, it's because you're an evil person. Let Mission Runway teach you the error of your ways and repent before it is too late.Best graphics since Freecell. Mute the music.Join the revolution; look like a 6-time sex change pig in a dress on its hind legs. Oink oink, motherf****r.			"

												Beautiful, smooth, fast-paced, charming, this game has it all. If there was an over-world it would rival Ocarina of Time, the combat system is very similar and in many ways an improvement, the art style is both macabre and manic, like you would expect a sequance of dreams to be, Alice contols satisfyingly and her varied abilities make her seem strangely both helpless and empowered. My only quip is that the game feels the need to remind you every 5 minutes how to play it... but atleast theres no Omochao with an obnoxious voice or any of that.			"
