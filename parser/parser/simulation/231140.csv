												This is one of the best city simulations out there, especially when looking strictly at games with good graphics. That said, it is not without its flaws.The Good:- Lots and lots of replayability. You could get lost in this game on just a single city for weeks.- Your cities interact with each other to an extent. You can trade things like water, fuel, industry, and office services amongst the cities you create. This allows you to specialize your cities, such as creating an industry giant that feeds industry goods to your cities where you want to avoid polution, such as a resort town.- You can point and click your way through everything. Given how many options you have for roads, buildings, etc, the menu is easy to use and allows for quick access to everything.- The game feels like a semi-sandbox during normal play, as there isn't really many restrictions in place (and you can switch the building restrictions off in the settings).- As you build up your city, you get to a point where you realize it isn't just about building anymore. Management becomes a much bigger deal. One of the biggest management challenges is transportation, and that adds something to the game that I find quite enjoyable, making it a bit deeper than it might look on the surface.The Bad:- Some of the mechanics for laying out streets (especially bridges) and buildings can make things a bit frustrating.- The whole Cities XL series are just reboots. They look the same, play the same, and feel the same. This makes for a bit of a hidden ""good"" I guess in that you shouldn't feel the need to own them all (I do and don't have any reason to play any of the previous ones).- They removed the online function that the original had, rather than making it work. The idea of being able to have cities existing in a ""truly global"" world definitely had an appeal.- The developer is lazy. The failure to make online work, some small problems and unfinished features, and the mechanics that are still issues still unaddressed after so much time just speaks to the lack of care the developer has for its work and reputation. They did ""fix"" things to a point where they weren't really game-breaking, but it still sits in my mind that they seem to want to skate by at this point (especially given how much effort they put into trying to create a great alternative to another ""CitySim"" game).If you really like city management/builder games, this gives a good balance between the two and should be able to keep your entertained for quite a while. If you can catch it on a sale, then great! If not, you just need to decide what your dollar is worth. As far as putting a dollar value on fun, you have to do that for yourself, but even with the flaws, the value was definitely there for me given how much entertainment I have gotten from it. Decidedly beats spending the money on gas, a ticket, and some overpriced popcorn and soda at a movie theater for me.			"

												i increased my score a couple point to try to offset the trolls and griefers that wrongfully malign this otherwise great game. and while its not worth a 10 its definitively not a 0!. i would say about a 7 and with all the stuff on xlnation.net perhaps an 8!please understand that this game has a bit of history. over 4 years ago a small company named monte cristo developed and released it as massively multiuser online game. unfortunately less than a year after they went broke due to low subscription rate and were unable to finish the game. soon after focus acquired the writes and reworked it as a single player offline game and released it. since then making minor fixes and about once a year they have been releasing new content dlcs.as you can imagine the people who originally purchased and subscribed to cities xl unlimited edition, the mmo version from the now bankrupt developer, are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off that they got stuck with a dead game after only being able to play with it for such a short time.so they troll steam forums and even this site complaining about the long defunct developers and about long ago fixed bugs and basically spooking people away from buying the game.many do not even own or play this game, they just own the other game and since the servers have all been shutdown for that game long ago can't no longer play it. yet they refuse to upgrade to this game, basically wanting the new developers to basically give them the new game.here check out the facts for yourselfhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cities_XLi own and play just about every city sims/builders that is out therethis is great game, loads of fun, runs great, have played it for hundreds of hours.even better if you go to xlnation.net you will find hundreds of mods for it, everything imaginable and a very active community over 40,000 members!i also want to say that there is no serious memory leak or programming issue like some people are posting. what issue that people are having is that the game allows you to build huge i mean huge cities, ive seen some with population over 90M and basically they do not set limits other than the hardware you have. so as you add more and more buildings and roads and the cities get larger and more complex sure its going to use more and more memory until you run out of memory and until your cpu/gpu cant handle the size of the cities and complexity and the framerate goes down. It's hard to put in words just how large and complex your cities can get, they can look so real that you can't distinguish screenshots from real world images of some of the worlds largest cities. in fact i cant think of a real world single city that has a population of over 90M. so what you have a people with low end hardware trying to build cities they can't support. and since its a 32-bit application, like most games, the cities can only get so large and complex before you hit the 2-3gb limit that windows imposes. the trick is to balance city size and complexity and not try to build cities that don't make sense and would not be practical even in real life.so yes the game is a 32-bit game with the game logic running in a single thread, but most other games out there have the same limitations. the only difference between those games and this game is that this game does not impose limits on you like simcity or tropico or anno does. also this games lets u pack the density of the cities to real world levels and beyond. in this way its more a city builder than a sim i would say.having said that the game, like all other games and software, does have bugs and issues, but luckily they are for minor and can easily be ignore of worked around.

												+/+ Graphics are great for a city building game.+/+ Most game mechanics are well executed.+/+ Great UI.  Very easy to pick up and learn.+/+ Cities can interact (i.e. trade) with each other.  This allows you to create specialty cities.+/+ Large maps.+/- Not as difficult as SimCity 4.+/- Not much different than previous Cities XL games.+/- Includes Steam Cloud, but lacks other features such as achievements and the workshop.-/- Lack of variety in graphic style.-/- Not map editor or terraforming options.-/- Roads & highways can sometimes very picky about how you place them. -/- Game slows down once your city reaches a certain size (very processor heavy game).-/- Developers have a bad reputation and have gone out of business.  Don’t expect new patches.-/- Unfixed bugs and broken features.Verdict: 6.8/10.  While Cities XL Platinum clearly fails to surpass SimCity 4, it does offer a unique and fun take on the city building/management genre.  If you can put up with the late game slowdowns or don’t care about creating larger cities, then I can easily recommend Cities XL Platinum to you.  If you expect more, you will be disappointed.  Don’t spend more than $10 and you’ll likely be happy.Update 9/7/15:  Buy Cities Skyline if you want a city builder.  This game is no longer worth considering.			"

												I'd love to give this a thumbs up, here is why I won't:The game is great! Its fun, realistic, and you can create economies. Its definitely the best city simulator I have played.But. And this is a big butt (*snigger*) Its so bugged and glitched out that after a little while it becomes impossible to play. Too many aspects of the game have bugs that are game breaking. For instance (and this is the most frusturating) after a while, trading with the AI company is beyond worthless, its actually harmful to trade with them because the glitch makes it that you have to pay to get rid of your goods, as if they were plague infested. I don't mean pay as in like a tarriff, I mean as in you pay as much to sell your good as they should to buy it. If you can't trade you can't expand, and if you can't expand the game is done. Fun, but broken. Please fix. Until then, don't buy this game.			"

												Cities XL is a great city builder, if you're willing to deal with lag.  Short and sweet, this game is what SimCity 2013 should have been, released a year earlier.  The game scales extremely well, allowing for truly MASSIVE cities to be build.  It has a billion different building types, large amount of road variations, and entirely different themes for all of them, depending on where you want to build.Now, that's all great, other than the fact the actual developer for the game is dead and long gone.  It's got the same problems cities XL 2010 had, and will continue to have them forever.  Those problems are potentially game breaking for anyone willing to invest a lot of time.  The major bug that gets near everyone is the fact it's single threaded.  The game will not use more than one core on your computer, so no matter how well the rest of your system is, a large city will cripple you to single digit frame rates.There are a few other much more minor bugs that people complain about, however I haven't come across.  Overall, I find the game to be very satisfactory.  I've gotten pretty large cities before the single digits hit, and even then it's still fairly easy to play.  For a veteran and novice to city building alike, I highly recommend this game for at least a short try.  It's just a shame there is no more development on it.			"

												This game has the potential to be far greater than SimCity ever could be, considering EA's corporate greed holds it back so much these days. It features enormous cities and very easy-to-use interface systems to create a city EXACTLY the way you want it to look even with road-following decorations and multiple ways to plop out zones, then zooming in and ""walking"" around if you so desire - the level of detail is astounding, and I've personally been playing this series since it's predecessor, City Life, came out back years ago. The game has a major downside though - it's outdated 2005 graphics engine is a 32 bit engine not optimized for multi-core. No matter how good your PC is, the game is limited to only using 1 core and up to 4 gigs of ram - 2 gigs by default, editing the config file is needed to crank 4. This means large cities on even the toughest PCs will lag like all hell, while your PC shows virtually no sign of wear, often running far below 20% of max capacity. Community guides even state you have to quit and reload the game every hour and possibly even change your graphics settings far below what your computer should be able to support just to keep it running in larger cities.Specs arent the issue for those of you claiming I have a bad computer - I run a hex core 3.5 ghz intel i7, have 64 gigs of ram, and 2 nvidia titans, and yet I clock as little as - well, 0 FPS at times. I have also tried it on a laptop running a quad core 2.7 ghz i7 with 32 gigs of ram and a GTX 680M with the same issues.			"

												I will recommend this game, but be cautious. This game gets insanely difficult, and fast. Once you get access to basic utilities, like water, power, and oil, it can be so easy to bankrupt your city by trying to offer all of these to your city at once. This game runs on supply and demand. If you're producting a lot of oil, and your city can't pay for it (not that your city won't demand it; they just won't be able to pay for it), your city will lose money by extracting more oil than what it can pay for. This goes with about a dozen different resources the game takes into account. You can also have not enough resources. This makes things rather complicated, because you will always run into a scenario in which your city needs more resources than it can pay for, even if you trade with other cities. Your city will always be plagued with problems once you get to a significant population. Traffic is always a problem. Always. There is no way to really mend the traffic problem. The tourism also really doesn't make much sense to me.However, I recommend this game because it's kind of realistic. You can't make everyone happy. You can't ""pre-plan"" your city by making interstates in a town with 200 population. You have to build your city up and then create those, causing you to have to re-route traffic and demolish structures so you can work on your interstate system, which is a headache I bet most leaders in transportatioon have. You will have to have a ghetto and also a rich population. Your citizens will get bored. The game is also beautiful and zooming into ground level gives a lot of awesome views.			"

												Nice graphic, not bad gameplay, awful optimization, so just when your city grows(and it happens over 5-6 hours), playing becomes impossible. Despite the hardware you have. It just will lag. And nothing can be done with it, nobody plans to patch it. Every year this game is sold with great discount, and naive customers throw out their money. So I highly warn you against purchasing this game.			"

												Picked this game up in a humble bundle for a few bucks, and man am I glad I did.  After the disappointment of Sim City 5, this game totally scratches the itch.  A bit less tedious, and has a very impressive feature of zooming down to street level instantly to see what the city looks like from the citizen's view.  Pleasantly surprised to find Sim City has a successor.			"

												Incredibly detailed and complex city planning and management game. Not for everyone. For those who wish to build a dream city with all the challenges of managing a city, or for civil planning student, this can be quite rewarding, watching your city grow.One draw back, however - the check point system. Once an earlier check point is loaded, it automatically erase all progress after that point and overwrite any later check point, forcing you to start again from that point. It also doesn't help that it is quite easy to accidently load a check point, causing many wasted hours.			"

												I had so much hope for this game it's unfortunate it fell right on it's face I'm only fortunate that I got it during the christmas sell and didn't spend too much on it... Where do I begin?CONSSo the game will work fine for the first hour or two but after that you should have a pretty good sized city the problem is this is where the framerate drop begins. Where this game does justice is that it calculates EVERYTHING unlike sim city which will take shortcuts. Unfortunately this means the game is very CPU intense and WITHOUT multithreading this game is a total mess. Once you use up that first core of your CPU that's all you get. It's like a trip back to 1998. Despite the new name and repackaging the game doesn't incorporate much more than it's previous installments. The same 5  pedestrians and the same buildings with very few added on.Lack of any map editor or terraforming option means you are stuck with the same maps over and over again. The only terraforming option you do have is flatten ground wich can be next to useless and won't let you do much. Roads are very picky on their placement and highways are buggy as hell (tested them out using cheats). When cars get to an on/off ramp/section they stop moving. this creates conjestion on highways when you should be none. Bridges are difficult to create in a way that looks appealing and can take several tries and much wasted time. PROSLarge open maps of which the only limit is how fast your processor is.I could say more but if this didn't convince you to spend your money elsewhere nothing will.			"

												This is a city builder you'll have to adjust to. I'm a Sim City die hard; So I naturally like drawing my own zone sizes and knowing what will deveolp and what size they will be. This game has pre-designated zones/ blocks. So everytime you want to place one home you will place the same size block over and over (no zoning). But it does allow you to drag and drop the size and quantity of blocks you want in a zone. It also has a nice road building feature where you click to start a build point, click again to anchor, click for another anchor point, then  double click to end.Plus when it comes to building your city, you must unlock all of the features per city in order to build as you wish. You start out with very basic zones and access to all road types.My biggest annoyance about this game is the achievements. While you play, it will pop up achievements, in a huge gold bubble right across your screen. And if you've earned many at once, they're all listed at once so you can't see anything. And these achievements are repetetive and are unlocked per city you build.It's still an enjoyable game, though. Less difficult of the city builders.			"

												I have been a fan of build and manage games ever since Populous came out on the Amiga, after that came Sim City (they were both relased 1989) and then kinda got tired of them or should I say, i grew up, Sim City got more bells and whistles, Monster invasion and crap never appealed to me.Cities XL Plat is a hardcore city building game, it's realistic to the point nothing in a city can ever be stagnant or it fades away, the better the city the faster the problems, trying to fix to many issues, gets you new ones.As many of these games its about keeping a balance and anticipating where once you grow your new problems will arise.I read some negative reviews cant say I agree with any of them, as a city building game its really fun and probably has 50-100 hours of gameplay before you feels it has nothing more to give you, Sim City has more bells and whistles, but this game has hardcore realism, it reminds me of Banished.Stability i am not sure about, no problems at all so far, intel/nvidia, nothing special.

												Let's face it; this is quite similar to all the other city games; so there is not really that much to say on the gameplay.I enjoy play this game, because it is extremely simple. You start, get your buildings unlocked and wait that people get in the city; then they start to demand jobs, and you create industrial areas; then you unlock the skilled workers (office people), and once they flock in your city, you give them some office areas, and so on until you unlock the whole array of buildings.There are plenty, but mostly they are the same type, just with higher density. It is fun to see how the city grow, but at one point you hit the wall, where you have no more money to continue to grow. The biggest flaw of this game is that it give you plenty to start, but then it doesn't teach you how to get revenues. You may want to try various tactics before you get what you expect; this is time consuming at times, so the newbies may get surprised to see the city grow so fast, and then see that they can't do anything else because the money coming in are barely covering for the structures that you have (in particular public structures take quite a lot of resources...open few hospital and you will see the bill!).Gameplay is fun; not sure why peopllpl don't enjoy the game...if you expect to get a masterpiece, keep in mind that not even Sim City from Maxis was able to give you a decent experience. The game is worth the discounted price, but if you pay it full price, you may be a bit disappointed.Performances are great; some framerate drop happens here and there but no crash nor problems that cause you to get stuck. Graphics are great; compared to Sim City from Maxis and most of the other city games. Zoom in at street level and you will get a smile on your face.City size is not an issue, and you can trade too, which is something interesting to do; here you don't have meteorites but you have to deal with class balancing; waste management and overall keep an eye to not make a residential area close to a dump and expec that people won't complain.AI is quite good too, looks realistic, and respond to changes; although keep in mind that it is still a sim city AI type, so keep that in mind.OVerall, if you never played Cities XL, give it a try, it is worth 10 bucks. If you want something super polished and optimized; there is actually not really that much out there, beside Cities Skyline, which is another good game but it is not leap and bounds ahead of this.6.5 out of 10 for me.

												The vacuum left by the SimCity series after 4 was a perfect opportunity for another developer to swoop in and claim the city-building throne. After all, as venerable as it was, SimCity never actually ventured into full 3D, and the rare competitors that did could never match the quality of the core simulation. Eventually the folks behind Cities XL stepped up to the plate, and while it ticks all the right boxes for a fine city builder, it also leaves a lot to be desired.XL's pitch was that you could finally build the modern city of your dreams, as huge and sprawling as you want. To that end you lay roads, zone for residences and businesses, provide utilities and services, and manage the finances of your burgeoning burg, just as you would in a traditional SimCity. All of this is rendered in full 3D, with skyscrapers rising from the hills and valleys of your map, all while little cars and even people traverse your network of streets. From that perspective, it's pretty much what anyone wanted from a SimCity 5.But Cities XL is more than just a copy of the old formula. The familiar residential, commercial, and industrial zones are split into types that demand specific resources of each other. Homes can be zoned for unskilled workers, skilled workers, executives, and ""elites"", whatever that means. Industries can be anything from farms to factories, tech centers to office complexes. Different industries require different proportions of worker classes, and then produce goods for your shops and trade outside the city. Some resources are limited by the map, such as having specific agricultural zones for farms or fields for oil. Not every map has every resource, either, so use of the trading system becomes necessary as you expand.New buildings such as larger services and higher-density zones unlock at certain population levels. In a strange twist this happens at specific ""ticks"" that actually make XL play more like a turn-based builder than a real-time one. You can set the amount of time between each tick, but until it rolls over nothing will really change in the city. Income, trades, unlocks, and changes to building status are all held until the next tick. Honestly I found speeding up the ticks more useful than playing slow because it keeps the money rolling in at the pace you need to expand.And boy howdy, will you be expanding. The specific balances of workers against workplaces is so fragile that you'll constantly be zoning new houses and factories to keep up with the alerts pouring in. This isn't the lazy suggestion of SimCity's RCI meter, this is the constant threat of businesses going bankrupt and citizens streaming out of your city. The way Cities XL is designed, your city will never be at peace or even equilibrium. You'll always be lacking something, and forever be pestered to fix it.That brings me to my chief complaint about the game, the feel of it. Stripping away the complexity of the zoning and additional systems, you could almost mistake XL for a SimCity if not for the incredibly cheap feel of it. Every single menu is a simple blue gradient with text misaligned on it, like a developer's first mock-up of a UI. The building menus have teeny-tiny tooltips and titles, leaving you to rely on the blurry icons to figure out what you're building. You have several zoning tools at your disposal but they all map out fields of square zones mashed against each other at awkward angles or in boring grids. Sure, you can make curved, complex roads, but why bother if you're just going to be snapping cubes against them?In the end, the shoddy presentation and the unnecessary complexity doom Cities XL to languish behind even the earliest SimCities. The graphics can't even save it, cursed with washed-out colors and bland models for even the largest skyscrapers. You can make enormous, sprawling cities but they're just going to be grids (or knots) of ugly, samey buildings, with little to even differentiate offices from condos. And honestly, if you can't build a city you can admire, there's just no point to building.			"

Cities XL Platinum Review - Rating: 2.8/10General ImpressionCities XL Platinum is a… pretty damn horrible game. No offense, but from outdated graphics, camera issues, bad gameplay, and several other issues, I cannot recommend this game. The graphics and the textures are relatively outdated. The atmosphere isn’t that kind of exciting either, it’s not that interesting. The audio and the music are pretty boring and repetitive. The gameplay gets boring really fast, and also it feels pretty uninteresting. The game doesn’t have a story either. The user interface is simple and nothing special about it. The controls are clunky; I don’t like them. The engines aren’t great either, the game still has some bugs and flows, which shows that the developer doesn’t care of their own game at all. The mechanics are repetitive and boring. There are also even other issues, read them in the negative points. Overall, Cities XL Platinum is an overpriced game, with nothing special in it, which I highly recommend skipping, from my point of view. Just pick Cities: Skylines instead, it’s more expensive with just 4,99$, but it far out weights this game.Positive PointsHas a bunch of maps to play onDecent user interfaceA tutorial is availableNeutral PointsA story would have improved the game a lot, along with some missionsTrading cards, Steam achievements and Steam Workshop would improve the game as wellNegative PointsOutdated graphics and texturesUninteresting atmosphereBoring audio and repetitive musicPretty terrible gameplayClunky controlsSome flows in the enginesBoring and repetitive mechanicsThe camera issues are annoyingThe street-laying function doesn’t work well, neither the bridge-laying oneIt misses a map editor, a huge disadvantageA misleading trailer, hahaha, nice one, dear ""developers""No terrain forming options? What the hell, and you put a 19,99$ price tag on it? Along with the many other issues?The developers have already left the gaming industry, don’t expect this game to be fixed, that’s already a strong reason to not recommend it "

There are too many issues though.I still rate it 3rd for me after Simcity 3000 and 2000.Beware of the compatability issues, performance issues, bugs and illogical things (the save menu WTF).The city building is solid and all the info you need is available. Sometimes the city's management information is a bit hard to find, but it's there. You don't have to lay down power lines or water pipes, which I didn't like at first, but got used to. The roads can be curved in any way you want which is really cool.The game is easy at first and the tutorials are good (not voiced though), but there is a big difficulty jump when your basic utility facilities aren't enough for your city anymore. The city will start to demand more electricity, fuel, water and waste disposal very suddenly. Also when you start building high density stuff the demands go up quite a lot.The game also seems laid back and fun instead of taking itself super seriously. Just like Simcity 3000 did (And Simcity 4 didn't). It doesn't mean it makes the game any worse as a simulator, but more fun to play.Graphics look really nice and are freely rotatable and zoomable 3D. You can tilt the view upwards/downwards with only 2 presets though.I can't really get why some people complain about the graphics.You can zoom in to see the details, which I didn't really care at first, but I found it's really cool to see your cities from the street level in the ""postcard"" camera mode.Sounds are what you'd expect in a city builder and music suits the game nicely. The intro song does play a bit too much though.I have not run in to any compatability issues with Win 7 64bit, but there are many people reporting them on the forums.And the to the negatives:The game runs fine when building a small city, but when the city size reaches 500k people or so it brings any computer down to below 10FPS in some situations (like making bus lines or zooming way out).It runs only in single threaded mode, but also must be optimized poorly. Some tweaks to the game files help, but not enough to make building big cities fun.There are some bugs like sometimes the trading does give or take more money than it should, some special building names or descriptions not showing up properly and one or two sounds not playing properly (police station is one).And then there are these logical issues. When you click a diskette image in the menu that is labeled ""Save"" and in the following interface click a save thumbnail, it LOADS the save instead of saving (there is a confirmation dialog, but it's too easy to just click ok). Also it overwrites the autosave instantly at that moment.There are more of these issues, but they're just annoyances, not wasting hours of city building!			"

												Snagged this in a bundle. Does not look like much from the outside, but that is like judging a book by its cover.It is essentially an offline Simcity, so you can have all the fun you want with no internet. Consider getting this if you enjoy ""Tycoon"" games like Zoo Tycoon and Rollercoaster Tycoon. To add to this, you can trade with neighboring cities, thus adding another way to get even more money. A must have.			"

												I bought this game in desperation despite all the negative things I heard about it.The game is not bad. It has tons of nice features, different buildings, good details, a decent engine. BUT, it lacks one very major feature: management. You don't need to manage your financials in this game as time isn't a constraint. Once you make a few houses and industries your flowchart turns green and you can skip forward to get tons of money. You don't lose anything by doing that. Just like the first Sim City from 1990.Unlocking some buildings over time and making some old ones obsolete when time goes by would easily solve the issue. There can easily be diminishing tax returns from old houses or you might have to renew buildings over time. Unfortunately in its current state the game is not challenging at all.I don't want to give a negative review because of only one issue and there are no other city sims playable but they definitely have to solve this problem.

												Cities XL Platinum is a tough game for me to rate. I don't have any of the crashing or errors I've seen mentioned anywhere. However, I'm not really impressed with it as a sim-game. Lot of neat details and things to do that improve on SimCity4, yet it feels half-done, or at least kind of indie-ish, despite this being the 3rd iteration of the series.Found this game to have a lot of potential and some great features, especially the progression of unlocking different building and zones which stop your from getting over whelmed and over stretched at the start. However it has some funny quirks and weird problems which do stop the game from flowing the right direction. Still any fans of city building games will likely get a lot of time from this and is enjoyable for the most part.Certainly the game engine is capable of some magnificent looking cities, and overall the gameplay feels pretty solid. But there are some issues present that hold me back from giving a more firm answer.Graphically excellent. Easy to learn. Manual is appalling for a game where you need to understand what's going on inside the system to do well. Game soon becomes repetitive and limited. The problem is that the internal systems are fairly basic. Fun for an evening or two, but I found it hard to play beyond that.			"

												Ive played Cities XL since the very first one came out, and spent over a hundred hours in the series. Its a fantastic game, don't get me wrong, but there is a massive deal-breaker. The game's engine has been the same since the first Cities XL, and it doesnt utilize Multi-Core, and it can only use 3 gb's of RAM. Once you get a large city going the game will start to lag, and then it will get worse and worse. So after having a completely stable economy and large city, it will be lagging so bad that you wont be able to play your city anymore, even with the most powerful gaming rig.			"

												For its quality, the game should be called Cities XL M - Early Access (alpha).This game was fun but very disappointing. The save feature doesn't work and the game is too slow with even a small city of <25,000 people. I saved my game multiple times with different names while I was playing. The game eventually slowed down so much that it was frustrating to play. I saved again, quit the game and restarted it. When I restarted it only a single autosave from hours ago remained. This game does not meet the barest standards of quality.			"

												Hey, it lets you play single player without an internet connection or server log-in. 10/10But seriously, I wish I had found this game before I sunk tons of hours into Sim City: DRM Edition. Cities XL is robust, beautiful, has crazy amounts of freedom, and city plots that are absurdly gigantic. Anyone who is a fan of city building sims owes it to themselves to buy this game. I hope some day down the line I recover from my SimCity burnout and can come back and really dive into this awesome game.			"

												A good strategy game. You build your towns and make them growing up. However, you can not ""connect"" your towns, except for trade, because you can only build one town on each map so the game can become boring.... . You have no multiplayers mode and no steam achievements, only the steam cloud can be used and you can take some screenshots. In your town, you lead everything : traffic, money, jobs, constructs, activities of the citizens, etc etc... there is always something to do or check. As well, there are alot of different maps. Some of them are very difficult, because of a lack of resources for example. Anyway, it's a pretty nice game with however some little negative points that can deteriorate the overall impression about the game.70 / 100			"

												Don't let my low amount of time on this game fool you; it's basically the same game as its previous iterations; this is just the one now solely available on Steam.  I put dozens of hours into the 2012 edition and got this for about three bucks.Now then, that said.  Is this game anywhere near as good as Cities: Skylines (my 2015 Game of the Year)?  Of course not.  Not by half.  But there's more to it than that.See, XL has one thing Skylines doesn't; a beautifully interconnected resource economy that makes building specialized cities so much more rewarding.  You can build a breadbasket city on a map with a ton of fertile land, an oil town, a manufacturing center, a tourist paradise...and the oversupply in one city is demand in another.  Is the trading sim as robust as Grand Ages Medieval or any of Gaming Minds' maritime trade sims?  No, but it's not supposed to be.Skylines is the builder I reach for when I'm after a ""classic"" SimCity-like experience.  I go for XL when I want to build something on a bigger scale, more like a nation than a city (in that sense, ""XL"" is an appropriate word for it.  Extra-large, indeed.)As I write this, it's on sale for four bucks.  Anything from about $7 downward is a good value proposition for any game in this series.  It's not as good as Skylines (not much is), but it's still worth playing for what it gets right.			"

												After the big disappointments the last 2 Sim Cities were this game is just what you need to scratch that city planning/building inch. Once you get the hang of it, and understand how the supply/demand and resources work in this game you are set to do pretty much anything you want. The mode where you can handpick any buildings is the best part IMHO, something I always wished vanilla Sim City 4 had.			"

												At the time of writing this review I do not yet own Cities XXL or Skylines, so for me, this is the best city builder I have in my collection (which includes Banished, Anno 2070, Cities 2008, Tropico 4, as well as RTS builders like Red Alert 3 and AofE) ... and I love it!The graphics are incredibly beautiful and you can zoom in right up close to the action (like Google Streetview) to capture some amazing screenies of your city. Day or night, it is very entertaining to check out all the wacky goings on of your inhabitants. You can select a car, pedestrian, truck, or train and follow it around the map. Travelling along the train tracks will allow you to explore the world of tunnels and underground stations you have constructed.There's a lot of micro-mangement of all aspects your city (including trade between other players and cities youve built) - some may not like this aspect of the game but I find it quite enjoyable and challenging. This is a massive game with lots to do to keep you entertained for endless hours.There are plenty of gigantic maps and hundreds of buildings to choose from. Additionally, the Cities player community is quite extensive and there are countless mods to help you construct the city of your dreams.I bought this game on special ($15) long before XXL was released. I hear there is little difference between the two games, bar a few bug fixes, performance improvement, and a couple of new buildings. I think if you are on a tight budget and can grab this version on a super sale (say $5) then it is still worth buying if you can't afford Cities XXL.			"

												Long time player of SC 4 here, heavily modded (keep it mind when reading, I ll be biased in that sense). Also, if anyone is color blind read 2 straight (there is the game breaker).I really, really tried to like Cities XL. I tried it more than 4 different times. I really love city building games but I always felt CXL was unpolished and unfinished. My game breaker were always the same 2. 1- Roads and road layout. I am used to a grid like set up from SC 4, I can admit that. But I was never able to get used to not being able to make at least some consistent griding (it was always off and wouldn't stay stright and parrallel, so in the end I had less building space on one end than in the other). That wasn't that terrible. The REAL ISSUE was that I had to manually demolish each and every building to build a road expansion. And given there was no grid for reference placing was always odd. An avenue would not sit on one side as any 2 gridded element might but in the middle, taking up some space from adjacent building. And given that I had to expand a lot this was a nuisance that meant demolishing huge parts of my town just to fit a small avenue, casuse I had no idea what space it would take. If you are used to superposition building (that is to say, build on top of something else and the game make necessary demolishing) be advised, it won't work. (There is a mod that helps partially with this: you dont need to demolish a road if you want to replace it with another one of the same size, the rest of the issues remain).2- Lack of colorblind-friendly interface. Road traffic is codified in red, green and yellow strips over the roads (changing zoom distance makes it a little bit more clear, not that much). I am color blind, I can tell up to a point the difference between these three colors, but it is really hard for me when the colored area is as small as in some cases is. And there is no easy way to have the camera move to the problematic zone. You have to use the map to navigate using the color scheme I mentioned above. Also, when you click a road stretch you get the info on that specific stretch, including a colored ball with the usage. The ball is completly impossible for me to use but if you hover over it you get (at last) a readable tooltip saying usage in percentage. This a too repetitive task to be so hassle ridden, so each and every time I uninstalled the game and went back to play SC 4 that gets this fixed in some simple steps such as using blue-green-yellow-red for traffic congestion (not perfect but it helps a lot).3- Transportation options are really lacking for any SC player. Check the list, many sensible choices you may want may be missing.Very specific reasons but some may agree they are important. On the up side, farm building is quite fun.			"

												I can't say I like this game a whole lot. I'll admitt I like the options for laying down zones and roads. What I dont like about this game is all the hand holding and guidance starting a city by telling you exactly what the city needs at all times, locking out utilities and public services. What I really hate about this game is the way resedential zones are split into a class system... last I heard you can live where ever the hell you want if you can pay the rent. Persoanly, I rather play Simcity 4 rush hour, I like city planing and building more than than what ever this is.			"

												Owned this game since it first released and was excited for it 2 years prior, following all the developer diaries intently.This game is terrible. it was one of the largest disappointments as an excited Sim City 4 player, even after buying each new version they released after the first.Every version of the game is the same, with an extra bunch of buildings that don't add anything new and unique to the game. The largest overhaul that they brought was probably an interface colour change and that's it. Numerous bugs followed each version, including:Alt tab crashes the game even in windowed or fullscreen windowed modeIncorrect income/expense statsUtility buildings not working at all after being placedAbsolutely stupid traffic issues, like cars not moving at allThere was originally going to be a fantastic and innovative multiplayer system where player's cities would be able to negotiate trade deals for resources and different education leveled people from their cities to fill jobs requiring workers, and players being able to communicate with eachother on a global map screen, seeing the cities expand without having to go through loading screens like the newest SimCity.They quickly attached a Pay to Play wall on it where you paid a minimum of 10 dollars a month to access the multiplayer features, and then removed the multiplayer aspect completely after 2 months of release for the original game.They kept the trade negotiation system however, but you only trade with an AI that has an unlimited amount of resources which you trade for your monthly income, and vice versa with your own resources.The first 3 versions of the game had absolutely no road building assistance if you wanted to make straight roads or squares quickly, and relied completely on the tools and putting a lot of time and effort into it creating straight lines properly.I had very high hopes for a next generation City Building simulation from Focus Home Interactive and this the was complete opposite. Please don't put your money into this franchise.			"

												A quality game that is worth buying despite it's flaws if you are a city building enthusiast.The MegaStructures are a great feature that encourage you to make numerous cities with varying specialties.KEEP IN MIND: There is a known issue with this game where it slows down over time as well as when your city gets extremely large. This should not be a surprise, however, as a city wth 250,000 citizens with jobs and traffic requires more caculations then an empty lot. That being said, there is some ""work"" that needs to be done to work around a few known issues where the game becomes really slow and choppy when left running for extended periods of time. (A quick google search will resolve those issues.)Also, as with any city game, if you have an older graphics card, a slow processor or a lack of RAM, you will have troubles with a sprawling metropolis of 250,000+ citizens.Though it does lack the ""driving mission"" feature of SimCity 4 Rush Hour, this game is a superior rendition in almost every sense of the word to SC4, is highly moddable, gorgeous looking and comes with a solid sound track to boot. Resource management, city-to-city trade, a very diverse and yet easily managed Supply and Demand system, traffic concerns and the need for things like Holidays, Hotels and Food makes this a more detailed and realistic Sim City without the old technology and feel of Sim City 4 nor the various drawbacks of SimCity 5 (or Origins or whatever the hell they called it.)A great pick up for a city building enthusiast. Coupled with the fact that I got platinum for dirt cheap because I owned CitiesXL 2011, it was a must buy.Suggested Purchase Price: $10 or less.			"

Quick money generation without age or natural disasters. Buggy as all hell but Cities XXL is the same game with all the bugs fixed. If you dont mind the bugs, this game is the best of the genre.

												A good game, and fun from the very start of gameplay. The tutorials are very good at explaining how to use MOST of the features, however some require some experimentation to be able to master. Overall, a good game, however the optimisation is not the best, and the game can get very slow with framerates when you start to get larger cities. I would say that this game is better than a possible alternative Sim City 2013, of which I have played for a considerable time more than 100 hours. This game has got one way streets, a vast range of landmarks, and a good menu structure, and I would recommend it to all people who like city planning or building simulators. I would give the game a 6.5/10 due to the lack of optimisation overall.			"

												Not sure why this game didn't get good reviews. I have only played a few hours but can tell that I will get alot of enjoyment out of this game as long as it functions properly as my city grows. I see that that might have been an issue for a few players.  I like how there are a lot of options for buildings and zone types and alot of control on what gets built goes to the player instead of being random buildings. You are able to direct which type of resident goes in whatever area you wish. You are also able to build different types of farms which I thought was pretty cool. I have played all the simcity games, cities skylines and cities xl. I am actually liking this one the best so far mainly because of the many building options available.  Only time will tell if this will be my favorite, but it was definetely a good purchase for me.			"

												If you never played City Builder games before this will certainly make you busy for a few hours.  It's not a bad game if you want to try out how some basic mechanisms of these kinds of games works. If you are looking for a more creative stuff though, which has more designing and city structuring elements then It's not for you. Pros: - Nice smooth graphics- Pretty easy interface- The tutorial is quiet good. It really teaches you the basics- The road and housing construction is pretty easy if you're just play the game for economic stuff. Cons: - fps problems- The game itself is buggy- Lack of design tools and the freedom of drawing- No multiplayer			"

												I wouldn't recommend picking this up.So you get to build a city and all that, sure, but it's outdated in the way that it's old graphics are far too demanding, it's bad that some fixes recommend quitting every hour and then firing up the game. Terrible lag due to poor optimization all in all, and there was also the problem of a memory leak.In the end, I think the recent SimCity might beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of this instead.But most of all...Cities XL is boring. It feels like a very 2D city builder, it loses the touch fast.City planning means nothing, can build however you want as long as you have the money in game.There aren't any indepth features, save setting up bus lines and metro lines but they work.And most of all it just keeps demanding you build more and more, and upgrading is a hassle, since all of them are so far apart, it really is a ♥♥♥♥♥ when you want to upgrade your residental and having to figure out with was your uneducated or your skilledhousing.And speaking of unlocking, oho, it is the worst, you get four levels of residental, uneducated, skilled, executive, and elite, these all unlock as the population increases, and all them are so far apart, so despite the fact this game says 'go to Hell' to city planning, you gotta end up planning this, which creates issues.I really don't recommend this, there are much better city builders on Steam, and with the release of Cities XXL, which was XL repackaged, I wouldn't expect anything good from these devs.			"

												Most likely the best city building game ever made!!This game is like all the other Cities XL games.They are stupidly complicated, beautifully designed with some amazing features that really really drag you into the game, and make you feel that what you've created is well worth it.  You use a money cheat in the game, fine... It does not mean anything because the city goes on money coming in and not the money you have, it is super hard to get a proper city going and when you actually get going I bet you will feel amazing because you've physically created something that is well worth it.This is the best city building game ever made and I own ALL the cities XL games, and I wish they added a multiplayer elemant to it.

												Let me start off by saying that I thoroughly enjoy this game. At the time of its conception, Cities XL Platinum was a decently good city builder comparable to SimCity. The huge maps and tiny details were fantastic aspects of a mostly bugged game, however. Frustrating? Yes. Industries are very difficult to balance, not impossible, but nevertheless challenging. Cities XL is not an easy game by any standards, which makes it satisfying to overcome the ingame struggles. Every move requires thought. Expand too fast, your entire economy may just collapse, people will be dissatisfied, and you'll be left with blocks of vacant homes. There is a plethora of selection when it comes to maps. Each having their own resources and physical features that can make or break your soon to be sprawling metropolis. The UI is awfully buggy and quite confusing. There is a bit of a learning curve to be had which is a good thing, in my opinion. I purchased this game years ago for 10 dollars on a Steam sale and I think that was a fair price at the time. However, with newer and more refined city builders like Cities Skylines, there's no use in buying Cities XL, unfortunately. With regret and disappointment, I cannot recommend this. I want to so badly, but it's too filled with bugs and unresolved issues that I simply cannot.~Krystal~			"

Disclaimer :This game might lag a lot after your city has passed 300'000 inhabitants. I didn't experience this because I stopped to play before that point, as I got enough of the game after 10 hours.Review :Interesting & decent city building, although with less charm than the old Sim City 4 (2003) ; it is however more realistic, as planting a couple of trees between your industrial zone and your residential zone isn't enough to clean the air, so it requires a more thoughtful approach to build a functioning city.But there's a big issue : most companies require high ""quality of life"", but neither the tutorial, the manual nor the in-game heat-maps explain nor show what it is ! Looking on Internet, I found a guy theorizing it was a mix of air pollution and noise nuisance.Nonetheless, I'd still recommend the game if you can get it with a discount (if you check the other reviews, it seems the concurrence is better, but a bit more expensive ;-) ), as it's pleasant enough for a while.Pros :- Decent visuals- Can build non-orthogonal cities- Advanced planning required to build a functional cityCons :- I started to have some slowdown with my city reaching 300'000 inhabitants- Different buildings that do the exact same thing and need to catch the tip during loading to know that- Very perfectible GUI usability ; eg: the road selection always go back to the cheapest road, instead of showing your last selection ; some description text missing ; etc.- In-game Ads for a famous french supermarket chain... :-/- Crashed a couple of times in 10 hours of play- A lot of things lack of clarity, and it can get hard to understand some aspects ; eg: the silo enhancing the farms efficiency requires freight ; but shouldn't it actually create the freight it needs if the roads are there ?- It's hard to build a polyvalent city, as the game is designed to make you create several cities that will trade with each other (and I don't have that kind of time ! ;-) )			"

												This is a great game for any city building fan that desires to have a more in depth and harder simulation on building an entire world, not just individual cities. In CitiesXL you are intrusted with the task of populating an entire world featuring over 60 city locations (more can be unlocked via mods). The objective of the game is to develop a world where cities work with one (via trading resources) to help sustain each other in the world. You will have cities that produce and export food and industry to cities that produce and export oil and electricity. In the same token, your oil and electricity producing cities will export to your food and industry production cities. It is so in depth that you can set which city exports to which other city, the amount of export that you are providing also can be set. A lot of people consider this game to be dull or lifeless, but that is not so. This game is not for the casual gamer, it is for the hardcore city building gamer who wants a true challenge in building and managing an entire world of cities. For me this is the best city building game in the market. Far better than Sim City even.			"

												Game is clunky. Upgrading existing stuff is a huge pain, and causes you to delete existing stuff rather then allowing you to upgrade it. Because you need to delete existing stuff, if you're not careful the entire city can get thrown out of balance. The area of effect for the schools and other utilities is really bad. The roads auto-snap is very poor, so even if you try and make a grid layout it gets screwed up. If you try and trade but click a wrong button, the game will instantly detuct an insane amount of trading tokens from you, whichs put you at a huge deficit. This bankrupts most of my cities. Yet the game so relies on trading you have to go into the trade menu, which is hard to read and makes it easy to make mistakes. And the game runs like crap.			"

												BUY CITIES SKYLINES INSTEADThis game could be great, but it isn'tI bought this a while back for full price and instantly started to like the feel of the game. The layout at first is promising but then unfortunately it is a slippy slope downwards. You start of with huge areas to build cities on, which other games namely sim city could do with looking at. But after that it is mainly negative. The game itself is easy enough to plop things down, but the unlocking and class system is ridiculous. It isn't clearly mapped out who works where, and you spend half of your time trying to make sure a factory is operating normally. The class system could work if it was thought out better. The tourism etc falls in the same plan. The game becomes clunky, and to start with you have to build farms to produce food to eat, these are often out of the way of your peeps and have to be rather large, and it costs a fortune in building the roads to them.I have played this for enough time to say it warrents a thumbs down.My advice......buy cities skylines, it's easier to use, more fun to play, and more importantly it has mods to make the game stand out. the people in the workshop make some truly outstanding mods, and the best of all, you can edit the in game assets yourself to make the game as easy as you like.

												I'm a big fan of city builders - I spent countless hous enjoying Simcity 300, and then 4. Seeing the negativity around the latest Simcity, I was hopeful when trying Cities XL, but it just frustrates me in a lot of little ways. For one, it plays like it's in beta: text on the UI gets cut-off awkwardly, there are weird texturing issues with roads fairly regularly, it feels like it needs more polish. And this is a game that was first released in 2009, and has had 3 re-releases including this one! I've no idea what they've been doing all this time.For all the efforts at making you vary-up your cities, with different resources available in different areas, specialising is difficult - I needed fuel, so decided to start a second city just for that, and found that oil-extraction isn't unlocked until you have a fairly large city built.There was nothing pushing me to expand, and no real consequence to failure. My man city has nowhere near enough power, with -5 electricity tokens, and yet it doesn't really matter, and things carry-on as normal. It's trivial to make a city profitable.I'm also not a fan of the art style - the lighting makes everything quite grey, and it's hard to tell different wealth levels apart. It all just ends-up a bit bland.I'm sure if you're after a game that lets you be creative with building, you'll enjoy it - you can individually decide exactly which building goes where, and the curved roads are nice. But as a game, it's a bit lacking.			"

												Really awesome city builder, completely recommend to anyone who wants to build an amazing dream city of their own to as customizability is insane. also not to mention one of my favorite aspects too is the mods which if you do get this game GET SOME MODS theirs a site called XL Nation and they got add-ons beyond imagining from the community. they got buildings, plopables (props and scenery), even some mods that allot stuff like free camera and even adding features in your city that were not in the game at all like Promenades, air and sea ways and even railways, bus and bike lanes, and the list just goes on. So for this city builder all I can say is some stability issues like what past people said like if your city gets too large lower your graphic levels unless you want major lag. other than that though it’s a great city builder, maybe not the entire best but also a real nice sim city supplement for those disappointed with EAs recent release too or just for people looking for a more modern SimCity like game to adapt to if they wana try something different. 8/10			"

												This is a really excellent city simulation game but...It does have some issues.I will totally recommend this game fully to anyone looking for a city management game. This one is great. Especially given the alternative.Ambiance is great. music is appropriate and enjoyable Graphics are great even given the age of the game.There is also no real pressure, unless you create your own. Take your time, keep yourself a rural farm town, or expand as fast as possible into a buzzing metropolis.Choice is yoursHowever it is very repetitive and unimaginative at timesIt also lacks in any type of real tutorial. There are technologies that are unclear how they work or where they should be placed. You can find the answer but it is cumbersomeThe game locks certain tech based on your population which while good ends up making it feel more like a paint by numbers rather than a dynamic city planning experience. It also makes it quite difficult to lose, as money feels like a non factor in early buildingAlso as another reviewer mentioned, the roads will drive you nuts. They are horribly glitchy which makes your neighborhoods look like a 4-year old planned themOtherwise a very enjoyable game			"

												I was actually expecting this game to be pretty bad considering some of the other reviews I've seen, but it turns out this is one of the best ""city-builder"" games I've come across. It does have its share of bugs but they are not crippling to the point of frustration or unplayability. I was not familiar with this franchise so this is the first ""Cities"" title I've played. I must say that I am impressed. The only major negative fact I can say about this game is that it is a SERIOUS memory hog and will bring a low end machine to its knees! I'm playing on a three year old gaming laptop and things don't get too laggy until my population closes in on 1 million residents. Usually shutting down and restarting gets things running smoothly again. My overall opinion of this game? This is what SimCity SHOULD have been! (EA, take note!)			"

												Not really platinum, better than SimCity, not City Skylines. Buy this game from other sites with a discount, not worth 19.99 euros.I`m writing this review by comparing Simcity and Cities XL Platinum (yeah not the best deal).Positive- more space for expansion- no dlc`s- no stress with internet connection, Simcity servers some times fails to sync correctly- the street view is way betterAlmost Negative- by default is a single core game and it lags, but there is a workaround for this, found on Game Debate written by Paulo Proenca on 02 August 2011http://www.game-debate.com/news/?news=928&game=Cities%20XL%202011&title=CITIES%20XL%202011%20-%20MULTI-CORE%20SOLUTIONStep 1: Open the task menu. (ctrl+alt+delete)Step 2: Go to the ""Process"" Tab.Step 3: Locate the process ""CitiesXL_2011.exe""Step 4: Press the right button of your mouse and select the option ""Set afinity"".Step 5: Chose only the first core and press ""ok"".Step 6: Do Step 3 again but this time select ALL the cores.Cities XL 2011 should now take advantage of all cores. It's freaky but it works. Happy city building!Notes: This might also work for other games with this bug.Negative- saving the game to steam cloud is a bit slowly.			"

												Think Sim City on a much larger scale. Goes a bit more in-depth as well without being overwhelming. Includes managing work for different classes of population (Unskilled, Skilled, Manager, etc), many different types of exports, and best of all provides a ton of room for you to expand your city. If you prefer a more simplistic simulation, then go for Sim City. If you want a bit more depth, definitely go for Cities XL.			"

												I was hesitant to pick this one up when I saw it was on sale. I did my research and found many outlets and users complaining of the technical problems that inhibit this city builder of it's theoretically almost unlimited potential. I decided to pick it up anyway, and it was a great choice despite these issues.It's important not to downplay these technial issues, as they exist and are glaring. The game is still recommendable despite them however.But here's the key: If you're willing to jump through a few hoops, this game can reach it's potental. The CitiesXL community is friendly and helpful as well as ingenious. Looking at the official forums will tell you how to modify the .ini files and point you to some RAM fix programs you can download. These fix the vast majority, if not all, the problems. Let's face it, you own a PC for gaming, why wouldn't you be willing to modify some .ini's?These technical problems were borne out of some real shortsightedness on the developers' part and are not to be excused. However, since they will not fix the issue anymore, we might as well do it ourselves. The good news is the hard part is already done by the excellent community. Do some digging, and the results will make this game well worth it. With these problems fixed, CitiesXL the most fascinating, complex, and impressive city builder out there.			"

And I can easily say this is the best city building game ever.And I had never experienced an annoying bug. Don't look to my time at Steam, I played Cities XL 12 and this probably more than 400 hours. And tell you what, if someone say this game is bugy so don't buy it, then answer einstein, which game we should buy? The other game which 'cities' are smaller than smallest village?

												This game is what simcity was supposed to become before that last debacle.It's not wihout its flaws. When your cities start getting large, the game tends to become quite laggy. There's a fix for it (partial fix, anyway) that you can find online, but still, seems like the devs could've sorted that out for us...The towns/cities you make could have a more clearly stated connection, by actual roads and stuff, ala Simcity, rather than the 'implied' ones that are there, but they do connect in terms of economies, resources, etc...As one might expect with a slightly 'smaller' dev, the interface is a little clunky, but it gets the job done.Overall, it's a game that has managed to occupy much of my time.

												This game had so potential. I like the idea of constructing a city from scratch, but this game just doesn't cut it.The graphics are nothing special for these days.Sometimes you construct a special building that doesn't do nothing.But what really pisses me off is that the game lags pretty bad and it's not just with me.

												The game is fun at the beginning, when you are just starting to get a small village going; fun road designs, easy placement, none of the hubbaloo. It's really intricate, catchy and well-designed, then the problems of the big city hit you. It becomes near-impossible to manage, even for an experienced city-sim player; everything goes downhill from there. I'd really only recommend to hardcore city-sim players.			"

												Cities XL is one of my favorite city simulation games. This game looks and plays great. Build the city of your dreams without the feeling of restriction.The tutorial included in the game is perfect for getting new players started and I suggest any new players check it out before jumping into your own creations.I didn't find any problems with the building tools and found them responsive and easy to use. The micromanagement isn't too mind boggling but lets you manage what you need for your city without much hassel at all.If you are looking for a Sim City game then this is the game for you.			"

												Absolute waste of time. Do not buy this game.It starts out pretty cool, you can build highways, houses, bridges, and right from the start pretty much start making the town the way you want it to look.BUT.Remember those highways that you started out with? You get upgrades as the game progresses. As you build more structures and expand the town into a city, residents complain more and more about traffic congestion. Okay, just remove the old highway you had when you first started out, and replace it with a newer, more-cars-per-minute highway, and that should fix it, right? Wrong. When I tried that, the better highway was too wide, I would have had to remove all structures on both sides, and basically start over to fix the congestion. Guess I could have just built a bit more spread out, but IMO this kind of crap shouldn't be an issue in the first place. Structures should just auto-adjust to whatever highway you're slapping down to replace another.Another issue I had, was that (after deciding to try again after the above happened) I was really trying my best to lay out the city properly, and I'd just kind of stuck my city hall down near the edge of the map so I could go right to planning highways. Then later I tried to move it (and I have been able to on other saves), and for some stupid reason, after it was bulldozed I couldn't place another. Completely froze my game, no one moving in, no one moving out, no complaints that there was no town hall and the city can't fuction (that's what usually pops up when you remove it). I feel stupid that I just completely wasted my time, AGAIN, with this cheaply-made game.You can look up tons upon tons of bugs that exist in this game, and I'm sure there was a workaround for mine (not interested so please don't flame me), but really, just save yourself the frustration and buy something else. It's completely not worth it.			"

												It's fun, but I can't recommend it.Once you get to the point of managing a huge city, problems appear that are unsolvable. No matter how much leisure buildings you build, your citizens will not be satisfied. No matter how many landfills you build, your citizens will not be satisfied. Sometimes, entire sections of the economy do not develop despite whatever efforts you make. (For example, in a city that had no agricultural area, it was impossible to develop retail that theoretically covers other goods as well, and in another, heavy industry, manufacturing, offices and high tech constantly screamed for more of the others while none were being developed because they wanted the others to be there in the first place.)On the good side, it looks good, is easy to get into and is satisfying until you run into the impossible-to-solve problems.The game has potential, and if tweaked could certainly be a very enjoyable experience, but it ultimately got on my nerves more than anything.

												I got 15 hours out of this game, and enjoyed it as a 5/10 city builder. Unfortunately this game has serious reliability issues, and I can no longer play this as it crashes on startup. Ive done everything I can find as a fix from online forums from many people with the same issues, including verifying game cache, reinstalling DX9/other exe's with the game, deleting all the saves, complete uninstall/reinstall. It still crashes on start. As it stands i'd value the game at £2. Do Not Buy at full price.			"

												Almost feels like the Simcity 2013 we've waited for as (many of us have played) SC4 fans.  Much larger maps than SC2013, better gfx than SC4, and plenty of community mods out there (though not anywhere close to what SC4 has).I really was gung-ho into this game... and then that's where the problems started.  What problems?  I don't know, it wouldn't tell me.  It just told me people were unhappy... so I gave them things to do.  Industry wanted offices, but the offices didn't want to build, citing quality of life.  My quality of Life info-graphic in the information overlay panels, said it should have been fine.  I even had a modern-looking industrial park surrounded with parkland like IRL.  I don't know how I could have improved things at this point, so I opened more roads out of town, where it'd allow me to.  I also started trading, exporting goods, figured as with any REAL city that'd spur industrial development and hence income... nope.  It sure made the city some money, most of which went back into funding infrastructure and city utilities like POWER, WATER, and FUEL.  My cities, every one of them, seemed to start to fail at around 890,000 residents.  I provided bus lines when traffic got too bad, that cost a lot of money for my city (as it doesn't provide any income due to bus fares, I found that quite aggrivating and unrealistic by itself).  So I looked into other options, to build alternate roads... that option was out, even with all the park-space I left (up to 20% per development, and reverse-frontage lots didn't save me even with new-residential-construction work in my IRL past) to save space to add in larger roadways.So I looked into other options such as trains and high speed rail... OOPS, THERE ARE NONE.  FAILURE... FAILURE FAILURE FAILURE!  Alternative transportation IS OUR FUTURE!  WHERE IS IT?   There's a subway, but it was telling me I had to knock out any building or park land that occupied it's path, so it was next to useless, having to knock down the whole city to build a subway that there'd be no one left to use it!  That was aggrivating to the point where I gave it the alt-F4 salute and haven't played it since.  It was such a nice breath of fresh air to be free of the simcity 4 grid once and for all, but it does not come without it problems.  There are road mods, highway mods, and other cool things available to help you with this game - even a no pollution mod to help fix some of the quirks that break your cities... but they could do nothing to save me from being traffic'ed to death.  I never hit a million people.  Maybe I just stink at this game, but I came away knowing that while this game will be loved by many, it needs work, a lot of it.  For the price they charge, you should opt for the new XXL version if you don't own this game already, as it's pretty much just a re-build of XL (this game) with a few new features.  Could I recommend this game?  No, no I cant, go get XXL if you don't own this game yet, as it supports multicore (which EVERYONE can use by now, it's 2015).  It's a good game don't get me wrong, but my biggest issue with this game is that I couldn't figure out from what it told me beyond who wanted to move into the city that I should be building housing for, is that what problems needed tackling.  Why is my industry vacating and leaving 50% of it's space empty, and not wishing to build, no matter how far I knock down taxes?  Why are the people truly unhappy?  Why are they unhappy with the commute, it's a CITY, it's going to have congestion, no matter how well you do on it.  I can cram over FOUR MILLION people into a large tile on SC4 (and am quite proud of it), but I can't seem to crack a million on this game without pulling my hair out (and getting lagged out once or twice, but that requires only backing out to world-view and going back in, easy enough and seconds on a modern SSD raid setup).  The new game (XXL) is said to improve on these lag-facets and some of the bugs, while some remain, I'd much rather send you along to the newer XXL version than to spend money on last-year's model (XL, this game).  If you already own this game, XXL is not worth the upgrade unless you're a die-hard that wants multiprocessing and a few other options.  Some of the pros if I haven't listed enough of them are decent size maps (XXL has even larger ones, reportedly), and abilities to build off-the-grid if you want, and blueprints to adhere to if you choose to... My biggest issue with this game is the lack of trains, the lack of high-speed rail, and the difficulty of building a subway system.  I am sure that many people may criticize my feelings about this game... but honestly, while I really want to love this game, the first two dozen hours brought me much pleasure, the last several hours (maybe another dozen), brought me only pain and discomfort I can only liken to a stomach virus.  It takes the fun out of the city-building/management challenge when you're playing blind - not knowing what is killing your city - not knowing what is wrong and how to fix it appropriately before your city vacates.  I want a better excuse than quality of life... that's BS.  Take quality of life out of why my offices won't build where they're needed, and maybe you'll have fixed this game 50%.  I want alternate transportation... THIS ISN'T ROME!  We have trains/bullet trains/monorail/maglev is coming out now... let's look into the future, this is a game, not real life, DEVS - USE YOUR IMAGINATION! Also, When I start my city, or even before, Why can I not make my own map?  Why is the terraforming so limited... it does not even change the gfx of the map overlay (e.g. if you flatten out part of a ravine, it'll still LOOK like a 2d ravine is there even though it's flat)... we want more terraforming options and better map-feature-change feedback.This really IS deep down inside a GOOD GAME, unfortunately, the enjoyment of many is cut short by a lack of good positive feedback, as I might as well be having all the read-outs in GREEK, or be playing a racing game with the monitor off until the race is over.  Focus interactive is on the right track on the new game (XXL), honestly, they're getting better, but the mere fact that to fix this game will require re-doing it from scratch pretty much, I'd hold out and see what lies in store for the future.

The Cities XL franchise and series has such great potential‎ to become on of the greatest city building games in the world, possibly outruning SimCity 2013. However the navigation in the game and the complex system in this is just to much. Sadly not very many people know about Cities XL. So what this means is that there really is no helpful tutorial for the game on Youtube or any website. I went through the tutorials (no joke) ten times and I still don't understand 1/4 of the game mechanics or how to create a successful city. No, I'm not terrible at games, but instead of learning from the tutorials, they seemed like they where just telling me a story, rather than focusing on telling the player what to do and why and other ways to do it.  How could this be fixed?1) Add a sandbox mode. Sure, there are the built in cheats, but you are still limited.2) Just make a simple navagation system. AND cleary label stuff like: Heath Services, Police Services, etc.3) Fix the tutorials. Don't make people suffer through a story like that.4) Possibly get rid of a few items, like only 3 classes of people rather than 4 and tell how to get them to stay in the city.5) To much stuff, like luxury items. Just have stuff like parks.6) Better information. I don't know what half of the stuff tells me. ( I guess 4-6 count as #1)Now for the grades.Graphics: 4/10 Crap, nothing more to say.

 No.. Just, no. Potentially this is an amazing game, a true threat to the hegemony of SimCity on city-building simulators, especially after that last pile of dog-excrement 'Simcity 5'. Apart from some minor imperfections there is just one excruciatingly annoying thing about this game, and that is the lag issue. It starts out alright, maybe a little jittery, but nothing too bad. But when your town starts to get going the lag gets completely out of control. It makes the game utterly unplayable. Stay away from this game! You're better off getting Sim-city 4!!  "

												Honestly, it's hard to play and i don't get the concept here. Are we making a city or are we running a democracy? I mean, sure this is fun for people who are good at stratergy games but i don't think you should put it in big leetters that your games better then any other. There are other games out there but this one is sadly just like sim city 4. Stratergy, building, and then alot of hard work tht requires brain function. I don't think the dev's had any idea that this would impact on how it affects the players and they really need to rethink their based platform and their gaming stratergy and niche. Sorry.			"

												This is not a bad game, but not as great.Here are my pros and cons:Pros:- Unique road styles- Has many road options such as curved roads- Decent graphics engine- Larger maps than SimCity 5- Decent maps- Better than City LifeCons:- Not many road styles- A bit buggy and glitchy- Some maps are repeated- No planet editor (It'll be cool if I could switch the maps to different locations)- Confusing trade system and gameplay- You can't use diacritics like à, ê, or ö when typing in city names (at least that's the case with my American computer), which really sucks.Overall, its a decent game. But I wouldn't call it the best game ever.			"

												Compared to other city builders, Cities XL Platinum is a bust. Pros: The huge maps make for plenty of building space in your city.. That's literally the only pro...Cons: TOO MANY! the game hates it when you attempt to build any medium to large city. The games even become unplayable. The time put into creating this must have been about 10 minutes. There is little variety, texture quality is bad, and traffic sucks multiple balls.  If you're looking at getting into City Builders, don't start with this one. Try any other choice.My top city builders:1. Cities Skylines2. Simcity3. Everyother City Builder4. Cities XLMy grade: 4/10			"

												I bought this game after playing Sim City 4, and I can't express in words how dissapointing this is compared to Sim City. It doesn't perform well, and the interface I found to be a bit of a kluge. If you are used to Sim City 4, don't buy this game. If you have never played Sim City 4, play this game if you want, but when you get tired of it then move to Sim City 4. After all these years, Sim City 4 is sitll the definitive City building game.Yes, I said Sim City 4, not Sim City 5. SC5 has horrid DRM and small cities, and if there are server problems you can't play your own single player game. Don't buy Sim city 5 - get Sim City 4 instead.			"

												This game is an example of love can do to a product. It shows how the original developer dreamt of big things and tried to fulfill that dream. Unfortunately, love is not enough as this product has some bugs (not game breaking, but Focus Interactive aquired the franchise in 2010, it's time to fix them, right?) and the User Interface is bad, very bad (text get's cut sometimes, and font is just plain ugly...)On the good side:* Graphics are good* Fun to play, mostly* It has a nice street view if you like that kind of thingOn the bad side:* The User Interface is the worst I've seen in my entire life* Sometimes you have to close the game because it has some kind of memory leak that makes it unplayable after a while* Bugs like houses don't get connected to the road, so you have to remove and recreate them.Overall, if you like city simulations, this is not a bad one to get.

												It has the basics, It is simple and easy to play, almost too simple, it is in no way different to any city building game i remember,Although there are massive maps, hundreds of buildings, traffic and other problems and the ability to construct several cities across the world.8/10 Good game, but dont buy it when it is at full price			"

												You can see I recced this game but let me tell you, it was a tougher than average choice.  This game is beautiful.  It is thoughtful and more complex than similar games like simcity.  You can make some amazing cities and there is a vibrant community of modders adding new content to make the game even better.So what's the downside?  The game slows down very badly with larger cities.  It's not that I have an old computer than can't handle modern games.  Nope.  My computer is top tier.  Maybe the games designers got too ambitious.  I don't know the cause.  Some say it's a memory leak and others deny this.  Whatever.  When your city gets up in the millions of people the game will get so slow that it is barely playable.  You can mitigate this a bit with the configuration settings.  Restarting helps also but only temporarily.  Thats the worst problem but it is a major one. So why do I reccomend it?  Becuase despite that crippling fault, this is an excellent game for people who love to build cities and see them work.  If it didn't slow to a crawl when you built your masterwork city of 5 million souls than this game would be, hands down, the best in the genre.			"

												This is the best city builder game out there. The best thing about it are how big the maps are. I have over 250 hours on this and there is nt much of a story or achievments, I just play it because of how much you can do. They have a good amount of buildings to use and if you want more you may upload your own. mods are easy to get and there are some good ones that make the game even better. YOU MUST GET realistic highway mod because the highways in the game dont give you many options for interchanges and the premade ones take up way too much space.The only real problem with the game is how after a while of playing the game will slow down and get a bit laggy, but this is easly fixed by going to the main menu and back into your game.

												Great game. However the attention to detail was lacking. You can't view resource filters while building. The NPC animation is dodgy, and lacks fluidity. The game would do well to increase variety in all fields as well, specifically building tools, and roads.			"

												I had high hopes for this game, but feel that it lacks the refinement and ""master's touch"" of the simcity series. It is a fun play.. the graphics and music are quite good.. the simulation quality is great.. but there are just a series of things which are annoying that can't be worked around. The building types are also difficult to discern from each other. Once you have built a rather large city, it's all an anonymous blur, unlike with simcity where various building types really do stand out.I still haven't exactly figured out the trading system. Either it is buggy or just not intiuitive.. If you are a huge fan of city simulators as i am, and are bored with simcity, i would say that this game is worth a try. Otherwise, you may not find it very appealing.			"

However I just bought a new computer and now it does not lag too bad if anything it's very minor lag. So if you are willing to risk it buy this game on a sale or something but BEWARE there is a bug and it WILL LAG THE ♥♥♥♥ OUT OF YOUR GAME TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN NOT MOVE.

												As a long time fan of SimCity 4 this game is a decent alternative. I will admit it's biggest selling point is the much superior visuals. I was blown away when i saw that i could actually get down on street level and see my city alive. This game is very pretty for the genre. But suffers from slowdown when you start getting into humongous cities with hundreds of skyscrapers. I have a fairly high end PC that never breaks a sweat on even the most recent games. So this leaves me to believe that the lag is simply an optimization issue with the game engine.			"

												If you like city builders, this is the tour de force.  Forget about Sim City... seriously... forget about it.  Cities XL makes Sim City look like an ancient relic of gaming history instead of a valid contender for the title of City Builder King.  Cities XL is much deeper than Sim ever dreampt of being- with more options, more economic concerns, and a level of interconnectivy betwen your cities that has not been attempted before.  I love this game.That being said, like all city builders, interest in this title does tend to run its course after a few cities, so if I were you I would wait to buy it when it was on sale.  Worth some money, but probably not top dollar as all but the die hard fans will most likely chuck it into the back of their game library after 20-30 hours of gameplay.  Not that that is a bad thing- its always good to have a standby game to return to from time to time and to rediscover in all its glory.			"

												CitiesXL was given to me as an alternative to Simcity 5. And it did not dissapoint. So now and then I still fire up this game and start to build. The possibilities are enormous, and while the graphics are not as good as Simcity 5, the amount of (micro and macro) managment options and map-size make up for it.Recommended if you love city sims.

												STRAIGHT UP, IF YOU WANT TO BUY THIS, BUT THE RELABELED VERSION CITIES XXL! CITIES XXL IS THE PATCH TO CITIES XL THAT SHOULD BE FREE, BUT ITS NOT! CITIES XXL IS JUST A MINOR IMPROVEMENT OF THIS GAME.First off, I'm on windows 8 and have not encountered any of the so called memory leaks, it is possible, but everything leaks a little bit. It ran perfectly well on my computer. Pros - Great traffic designGood graphicsLarge build plotsDifferent types of buildings and densities for each typeMore detail and less childish than current simcitysCitizens are tolerant to taxes.Cons - Trade is absolutly terrible, computer will never make neutral agreements or trades that are a tad against the cpuToken system for trade is complex and not explained wellCities get laggy because of very large size and details, not a memory leak, its just that the city is consuming a lot of RAM to render everything, bad optimizationNeeds system for citizens is weird, more linear wants and needs(this goes up, that goes down)Citizen AI and system is not very good, you can build retail directly across from a house and the house will complain that it has no retail.Sometimes you loose flow control on roads and dont regain it even if constructing a new road the same spotTrading is almost forced in the game, you can move into a region with none of a certain resource and it you cant make the city prosper until you make another one and trade with yourself. If you just want to mess around with flow control and have fun building small to decent size cities, this is right for you, but if you want to make a massive global economy and dominate the world, wait for the new Cities, which is coming pretty soon. I had fun with it in the beginning, but the mid and end game are repetitive and the only change is how you format your cities. I'm saying recommend just on the fact that I do not dislike it enough to not recommend it.			"

												This game starts out really fun, but quickly grows confusing and overwhelming. I found myself facing almost bizarre obstacles that caused me to stop short as I tried to figure out a way to meet the growing demands of the populace. There weren't enough employees. then there weren't enough jobs, then not enough employees, etc. Whatever the balance was, it was difficult for me to comprehend. The game is very interesting especially compared to some other ""city building"" games from a more well-known gaming studio. The maps are quite large. I'd expect that after the player (and myself) could figure out the rather steep learning curve, it would be more enjoyable than I found it to be. Overall, I'd say 3 out of 5 Stars.			"

												Great game. This is one of the best city simulation/builder games ive ever played. You need to try this. Plz dont listen to all the bad reviews on the game. Those reviews dont help at all. Besides, it matters what you think. Not what everyone else thinks. Theres not much bugs in the game though and it runs pretty fast. The main point of the game is like all other city builders. Build a city, balance the economy, provide power, water and other resourses to your city. You also have to keep your income bigger than the expenses. The game gets more challenging as you build more and more and get through the game more and more, but youl get used to it. Overall i give this game 8/10. Try it now! Highly recomend this game to anyone who like city builder types of games.Note: if you really want this game, the next one, cities xxl, is coming out and might want to wait for that.			"

												Apart from the RAM and processing issues this game has with modern setups (yes, this game can run on a pentium 4 powered machine [just kidding, partly]), Cities would be the next best choice for city builder game enthusiasts alike. Though the folks at EA made one hell of a city builder game, Cities XL beats them by the 'Micro-transaction' factor.PROS*Good game*Adds a bit of complication to further enhance city building experience*Garners a hierarchical aspect in society building (which comes along with the city building)*The advisors look nifty as hellCONS-hardware compatibility issuesthe only con I've identified for the game weighs as much as three pros, but overall the game deserves to, at least, be given a nod by city builder fans8 and one half out of 10			"

												If like me you played all the old Sim games you should love this game. The building/zoning features give you so much more freedom with how you shape things. Rather than being stuck to rows and rows of rectangles you shape things out how you want so you can actually be quite creative.A lot of people have written that they had issues with performance/optimisation but personally I'm finding it better than many other games of this genre. It's not a challenging game but then these types of simulation games aren't really meant to be. Definetely a fun and relaxing game if you're into this sort of thing.			"

												Good alternative game to Sim City. I like this one.This game has a twist with the ressources so you need to build many cities specialised in their local ressources (oil, water, farming, etc.) and exchange with one another. Good concept but could be better. Graphics and sounds aren't that impressive but they do the job right.It has everything a city building game needs and the fact I have more than 100 hours of gameplay proves that it's good.My main problem with this game is that it starts to lag A LOT when your city is getting big. Also, you constantly need to switch between cities to provide the ressources.7.5/10			"

Fantastic Alternative to SimCityCities XL Platinum is all that is missing from the new SimCity. It has a good division between city management and designing your city You have a lot of control over how your city gets laid out and in general it is a beautiful game.I would honestly say the only two things missing are the ability to run it on other OSes like Linux or Mac and the fact that its not Multiplayer. Of those two that I actually mark against it in any way is the fact that it is Windows only. We can hope that in the future they release it for other platforms.			"

												Cities XL will allow you to make your dream city but only with the help of many mods. After being in-game for a while, there is a noticable preformance decrease that forces you to restart the game and even then it does not help that much. Mind you I am running it with an i7 3770k, 16GB RAM, and 2x 670 in SLI.  I am only recommending this game to people who are not afraid of getting your hands dirty and modding the hell out of the game to make it fun and playable.			"

												Casual city building game, I like it. The difficulty is not compareable even to plain old first SimCity. The big advantage of this game is that the interface is better and there are lots of statistics to analyse.One big disadvantage is the poor localization into german. The translation itself is good. Problematic it that most of the translated texts are longer than the original ones and simply get cut off before the end because the boxes they are written in are too small. Luckily I found out the game can be switched to english language via the steam menu.Apart from that there are still some annoying bugs existing: Residential area building state they are not connected to roads although the area and the surrounding roads were created automatically with the corresponding tool. Weird.I'd give this game a rating of 65/100.			"

												Compared to other city builders, Cities XL Platinum is a bust. Pros: The huge maps make for plenty of building space in your city.. That's literally the only pro...Cons: TOO MANY! the game hates it when you attempt to build any medium to large city. The games even become unplayable. The time put into creating this must have been about 10 minutes. There is little variety, texture quality is bad, and traffic sucks multiple balls.  If you're looking at getting into City Builders, don't start with this one. Try any other choice.My top city builders:1. Cities Skylines2. Simcity3. Everyother City Builder4.

												I'm just going to compare this directly to sim city 4, next i'm going to get cities skylines and give that a try.What I didn't like:- I can't just rezone an aera to a higher density. It has to be deleted first.- I can't pave over a road with a larger road. It has to be deleted first.- It's somehow my problem if people are bored?- The class zoning system is just dumb.- the delete tool is a fairly large area, you cant just delete a single block.- bridges are a pain.- resource managemnt is annoying, given that I can only build in a few areas cant we assume that the rest has cities capable of producing food, oil, water, etc. Why are my cities limited due to what only I can produce.- all buildings must be on a 2x2 square, cant fit into smaller areas.What I liked:- better graphics.- the ability to design bus routes.I guess my problem is a long series of minor annoyances than any large overarching issue.

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, IT DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE.Here are some reasons.    The original game is woefully flawed with terrible screen tearing and CPU issues. After a bit of play, the game slows and slows until it becomes unplayable due to a horrid memory leak.    The developer of Cities XL went under and the IP was sold to another company who does not have access to the core game files to fix these problems, so they release the same game every year with a few new things included.    Cities XL requires you to create and use and activate an account on the Cities XL original website...which does not exist anymore. The site can be found, but it's not where you'd expect it to be, and it is difficult to find, and activation often does not work.IWANTMY$20BACK!!!!! "

												Let's face it; this is quite similar to all the other city games; so there is not really that much to say on the gameplay.I enjoy play this game, because it is extremely simple. You start, get your buildings unlocked and wait that people get in the city; then they start to demand jobs, and you create industrial areas; then you unlock the skilled workers (office people), and once they flock in your city, you give them some office areas, and so on until you unlock the whole  array of buildings.There are plenty, but mostly they are the same type, just with higher density. It is fun to see how the city grow, but at one point you hit the wall, where you have no more money to continue to grow. The biggest flaw of this game is that it give you plenty to start, but then it doesn't teach you how to get revenues. You may want to try various tactics before you get what you expect; this is time consuming at times, so the newbies may get surprised to see the city grow so fast, and then see that they can't do anything else because the money coming in are barely covering for the structures that you have (in particular public structures take quite a lot of resources...open few hospital and you will see the bill!).Gameplay is fun; not sure why peopllpl don't enjoy the game...if you expect to get a masterpiece, keep in mind that not even Sim City from Maxis was able to give you a decent experience. The game is worth the discounted price, but if you pay it full price, you may be a bit disappointed.Performances are great; some framerate drop happens here and there but no crash nor problems that cause you to get stuck. Graphics are great; compared to Sim City from Maxis and most of the other city games. Zoom in at street level and you will get a smile on your face.City size is not an issue, and you can trade too, which is something interesting to do; here you don't have meteorites but you have to deal with class balancing; waste management and overall keep an eye to not make a residential area close to a dump and expec that people won't complain.AI is quite good too, looks realistic, and respond to changes; although keep in mind that it is still a sim city AI type, so keep that in mind.OVerall, if you never played Cities XL, give it a try, it is worth 10 bucks. If you want something super polished and optimized; there is actually not really that much out there, beside Cities Skyline, which is another good game but it is not leap and bounds ahead of this.6.5 out of 10 for me.

												I love city builders. This one felt different when I first played it. I was only use to Sim City 4 and previous versions. All the roads in those games where straight and not really as good because they where straight. I enjoyed curving all my roads and bridges. It added more realism to the game instead of just plowing through the world you can actually go more with the terrain. Curve around a hill or just softly turn through soft rolling hills. It was useful to build highways in a loop around my cities. Get this game if you love city builders. Enjoy Cities XL.			"

												Sekhemre Khutawy Sobekhotep (appears in most sources as Amenemhat Sobekhotep; now believed to be Sobekhotep I; known as Sobekhotep II in older studies) was an Egyptian pharaoh of the 13th Dynasty during the Second Intermediate Period who reigned for at least three years c. 1800 BC. His chronological position is much debated, Sekhemre Khutawy Sobekhotep being either the founder of the dynasty, in which case he is called Sobekhotep I, or its twentieth ruler, in which case he is called Sobekhotep II. In his 1997 study of the Second Intermediate Period, the Egyptologist Kim Ryholt makes a strong case for Sekhemre Khutawy Sobekhotep as the founder of the dynasty, a hypothesis that is now dominant in Egyptology.[1][3] His tomb was discovered in Abydos in 2013 and was assigned to a king Sobekhotep I in January 2014.

												Tricky, this isn't a ""recommendation""I bought the game, so you don't have to. Cities XL Platinum is essentially a DLC for Cities XL 2011  that includes the 2012 content. Oh, and yes... That's the reason why they give you 85% off if you already own either of the two older version (2011 or 2012) because it's the same exact game, but with added content. Same lag, same engine, same intro, same music, same everything... Just saome added new building, new maps, and what not. My recommendation? AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Why'd I buy it? To prove for myself that for the second time around, they haven't really fixed anything important. They just repackaged the game with a new name and sell it as a whole game with the added new content.			"

												To be blunt, the UI is best described as clunky; the rendering performance suffers despite there being little action (or content for that matter) on screen and is best avoided.  As a game it would be best described as a fusion of Transport Tycoon and SimCity with CityVille-style ""characters"" to help you - at least in the tutorial - and are there to be pseudo-amusing and give you the help required.  Needless to say they fail at both these things, if only in the execution of the latter.I bought my copy as part of a Humble Bundle where, in effect, it only cost me a the equivalent of a bag of crisps.  At a sale price, it might be of interest to some of you out there and I am of the belief that there is an entertaining game to be had *somewhere* in this, but the money may be better spent on a multipack of crisps instead.

												Cities XL isn't a bad game, in fact, it has done some things much better than Sim City.I think the economics of Cities XL are a lot more advanced and interesting than the economics of Sim City.  However, other things are less inspiring.  Something about Cities XL makes it less fun.  I think its because it is more of a sim and less of a minecraft.  What I mean by that is that in Sim City I can build a massive and beautiful city the way I want and do so fairly quickly.  Cities XL makes you really work for your creations.  My other complaint is performance, on a fairly high-spec PC it still has performance issues.  This isn't any differnet than the Sim City titles that have been released in recent years.At the end of the day, I would rather play my Dos-Box Sim City 2000 I bought from Gog.com.			"

I wanted to like like Cities Skylines, I realy did but I find the gameplay mechanics clunky, and it's hard to get a small city going with possitive cashflow.  In Cities XL you don't have this problem, and it's rewarding to make progress and unlock things for your city. This (and XXL) are by far my favorite city sims, this is the modern day sucessor to Sim City 2000 and 3000 that I wanted, and I felt the need to post this because people are always blathering on about how great Cities Skylines is.

												Well if your really in to city builders I would say this games worth about 5-10 bucks because the level of difficulty content and all around expectations should be fairly low.  This game is best for people just getting into city builders not for the more experienced it seemed the trading and lessier centers were the hardest thing to do.  In about 3 hours I managed to have a city of about 300k people and about 300+mil in my first play.  So in summary easy, good for people just getting into city builders, lacks content, and fun but not a great game.Keep in mind I also have 1000+ hours into anno 2070 and the learning curve on that is a lot larger.

												After playing it for about half an hour, it started to bore me. This is one of those games where it tries and fails to copy simcity (atleast thats how i feel) It all fealt the same, and i think simcity did it better to say the least. If you want to become an city planner, then i recommend it. For those who want to play a game for fun, i don't recommend it. Is it worth 30$? The awnser is a plain no. If its anything less than 10$, for instance on a flash sale or on black friday, it's a game that wont truly dissapoint. Although, a fair warning. This is a game where you need to spend a while on it in order to understand the basics. Its a lot harder than it looks.			"

												DO NOT buy Cities XL Platinum. I repeat DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.Firstly, the interface of this game is horrible. They may show you extravagant images over at the screenshot area but those are without the interface. It does not look professional at all. Even the tutorial guide with the in-game characters explaining how the game works, it does not at all seem in the least bit a professional game. The storyline does not even gel well!Secondly, this is a ripoff the good ol' SimCity. I must admit that SimCity 5 that just got released this year has its many flaws that Cities XL Platinum could be much better at (eg. Population issues). However, SimCity has been around since 1989! Do you not realise how much the developers of SimCity have improved the game up till how it is today? I have a feeling Cities XL Platinum is just a unprofessional, fast production and cheap ripoff to point out the flaws of the latest SimCity 5. And in itself, there are many flaws such as weird controls and a lousy interface. What's more, lag increases as more zones are built.Lastly, it's not value for money even at the Autumn Sale. Usual price would be $29.90 which is not at all worth the price for such a lousy game. Now it's $10.19, please don't be enticed to buy it! Get the SimCity 5 instead! Or get SimCity 4!That's all I got to say about this game.			"

												Glad I purchased this on sale. The game dynamics are simple and predictible making the game rather dull... Build factory, add housing for workers, make workers happy by adding some decorations, rinse and repeat. No real strategy to it. To make matters worse some of the game play is outright unrealistic. For example, I build a farm on the outside of town, no reason for any traffic to be on the farm roads outside of a couple of farm hands. For some reason the game sends 30 thousand people driving out of town to the farm clogging my farm road so I keep getting messages that traffic is terrible. Bridge building is like hearding cats, complex and tedious. The game contridicts itself by saying more housing is needed for workers and in the same breath it says that workers cant find jobs. Some buildings will not connect to roads, you must destroy them and rebuild them because of this glitch. The only road upgrade is to make it a one way which is a pain considering you cannot build wide roads from the start because they are locked. Good luck getting rid of traffic jams. I can go on and on... I am glad I only paid 6 bucks for this, I would be upset if I paid more.			"

												Cities XL Platinum, is a truly appealing, immersive, visually stunning, and unique game, especially for gamers whom has a passion or interest for the city-building genre. Yes, the technical performance issues are slightly annoying, but for me personally, this did not significantly impact on the fact that I thoroughly enjoyed this game. If you learn to adapt to the flaws, and look at it as a positive, odds are youll probably find yourself spending many, many, many hours on this game, perfecting your city step by step and shaping it into the city of your dreams and imagination, just like me.The large map space available to build your city on is a great asset and the game mechanics is generally easy to master and understand. Perhaps, the best thing I like about this game is the fact that when you put into your city, your passion, your time, your efforts you'll see that reflected in your finished city, and the subsequent feelings of intense pride, inspiration, and satisfication is quite something. And even then, you'll always finding yourself going back to your cities and experiencing the awe-inspiring realism that is your created masterpiece!! In short, I would have to say Cities XL Plantinum is without a doubt, one of my all-time favourite games and would recommend it enthusiastically.			"

												The Game in this version seems to be totally bugged. My sister has a normale CD-Version that works just fine.The Platinum Version here I couldn't even play 1 hour before I was so annoyed that I deleted the hole game from my hard drive.Examples: - Options button when game starts doesn't work. I wanted to turn off the sound, it was simply impossible, it only worked  after I started the game and used the menü there- World Map buttons for cities didn't work, every time I chose a map it jumped to some rocky map no matter what I chose. Choosing over the list on the side worked, but not even after the city was founded it was possible to start it on the world map.- some buildings are missing in the menü it seems (incinerator wanted some recycling center in the vicinity, but there was no such building in the list, not even after I tried to unlock all buildings with the cheat)....I don't really have any more motivation to write about this game, no idea why this platinum version is so much worse than the normal one.....

Also, the game crashed on my first city. It is not very different from other city simulation games. However, sometimes is hard to know what to do.

I'm not kidding when I say that your city can reach a NYC level of scale (though not population-wise, since it does that thing that all city-builders do where it makes population way lower than it seems your city should be able to accomadate).Bad:-I'm only exagerrating a little bit when I say that it has the depth of a mobile city-builder. There's virtually no challenge from the get-go and I was almost expecting to have to tap buildings for coins.-When your city gets to a certain size, the game will start to struggle with processing everything and you'll get lag. Personally, the lag I dealt with was nothing too bad, but I didn't grow my city as much as other people did before I got bored and stopped playing; I heard many people say that the lag gets unbearable at a certain point.Those are the four main points, the things that'll really make you either like or dislike it. I know you see the red thumbs down, but I'm not not recommending it, per se. If you think the pros outweigh the cons, then you should totally buy it. I wouldn't have recommended this game to my past self however, because this game is a little too shallow for my taste.			"

												Not a favorite of mine. The controls are disappointing, the UI nearly counter-intuitive. The in-game guides leave a lot to be desired. Though this game can be used to create some beautiful cityscapes, there are other games that do the same while providing a much more enjoyable experience. Just go buy Cities: Skylines instead.			"

												Cities XL Platinum is a interesting city building game that strikes a decent balance between fun and challenging.Positives:- Good supply/demand balance.- Fairly deep resource system.- New buildings and things to strive for early-to-late game, including notable landmarks.- Nice interface, allows for new users to jump right in.- Ability to trade between cities allows for specilization.- Very 'pretty' with easy zoom and camera functions.Negatives:- Ingame lag when playing for 1+ hours, building 'fastlanes', and on large cities (restarting the game helps).- Horrible road snapping, especially when creating an intersection with little room. The road curves instead of going straight.- Later game is very difficult to play without having at least Expressways on major throughfairs. The problem is that these are not unlocked until at least 100k population when your city is fairly large (using low population residences). I can plan ahead for larger buildings, but it is hard to change street sizes without completely rebuilding the city.- Confusing/annoying traffic model. Why wont citizens use the new bypass i built to avoid that terrible intersection? This makes larger cities 1mill+ hard to handle.- Fast Lanes suck. These need to reworked. Fixing snapping and placing interchanges would help. Shortening interchanges would help. As it stands i ignore them.- Pollution model is very aggressive.Note: Would not recommend purchasing if you own other Cities XL titles.			"

												Yes I would recommend this game to anyone who likes citybuilding games that try to go a little deeper into the economical and financing aspects of citybuilding. The graphics are also quite nice, you can make really beautiful cities.The main issue is, that the game is not progressing, i bought the original Cities XL, and then bought the platinum, which was a total rip off. It's basically exactly the same game. Same goes for the new Cities XXL game. Buy only one of them, don't care about the rest as it's the same. Another major downside of this game is the bugs. It's really filled with minor although really annoying imperfections. It seems as they rushed to finish it, and it looks like a permanent beta-version...Choose cities skylines instead!			"

												The game is crap. Terraforming or whatever is very bad. And if you are in a mountain area, you can basically do nothing with the roads because ""the slope is too steep"" and putting buildings down is worse than clawing your eyes out with forks. Save your money, as for the first SimCity is better than this. Even if they are giving this game for free, don't get it. Buy SimCity or Tropico.

												I had played this game for maybe a month and I loved it. The cities that you could build were amazing and massive. Sure there were some issues to start but I could work around them. I have always really enjoyed city simulators and have played Simcity 4 for many years and have played a lot of Simcity 5. So as I was saying, this game was starting out really well for me, but then it stopped working. I have read every forum out there and have spent a year trying to figure out what could possibly be wrong with it. I have now come to the conclussion that Cities XL is broken and a complete waste of my money. I have followed every step on the forums to fix it and there has been no change. So until Focus Entertainment can get things together and come out with a working version that wont crash and waste your money, I will be saying goodbye to Cities XL, possibly forever. If you are looking for a city simulator stick with Simcity or I have heard that the City Skylines game is fantastic so you may want to give that a shot, which is what I plan on doing.			"

												This game has its ups. For sure. But it really gets frustrating when i spend a nice few hours building a badass productive rich town and want to save then accidently loading an older save and I lose all progress. I've done this about 3 times now and it unmotivates me to continue playing. This problem is a major yet simple development flaw and it sucks. It would be MUCH more better to have a basic lame menu with save or load instead of having both in the same department to screw me. Other than that great concept but really i could find a better game thats much more better optimized as well. Sorry but I'm giving this my first red thumb down. Hope this gets patched or updated.

My sister has a normale CD-Version that works just fine.The Platinum Version here I couldn't even play 1 hour before I was so annoyed that I deleted the hole game from my hard drive.Examples: - Options button when game starts doesn't work. I wanted to turn off the sound, it was simply impossible, it only worked  after I started the game and used the menü there- World Map buttons for cities didn't work, every time I chose a map it jumped to some rocky map no matter what I chose. Choosing over the list on the side worked, but not even after the city was founded it was possible to start it on the world map.- some buildings are missing in the menü it seems (incinerator wanted some recycling center in the vicinity, but there was no such building in the list, not even after I tried to unlock all buildings with the cheat)....I don't really have any more motivation to write about this game, no idea why this platinum version is so much worse than the normal one.....

												Cities XL Platinum is at its core a solid city management game. Despite the several irritating glitches, the game plays fairly well, with occasional FPS drops. City management isn't difficult at all for anyone who has played a game of similar style before, however, for someone new to the genre, they may find it difficult to get a grip on this game for a short while. While the broad focus of this game is enjoyable, the one thing that started to become extremely annoying after some time was the focus on the needs of individual areas of your city. At first, it's easy to manage personal happiness, but after some time, it starts to get annoying. Parts of the city often do not respond to numerous attempts at improving leisure and shops satisfaction. It often takes at least 5-8 shops for me to get one area to be satisfied with the shops in the area, and then I get new messages telling me to decrease retail because it's too hard to sell. Trading with various cities is also a task that is more complicated than it needs to be, and it starts to become yet another tedious part of this game after a while. This game seems to want to educate you more on the boring, redundant part of city management than the actual entertaining, meaningful part. Cities XL Platinum was a nice break from EA's money-grabbing, but it's a game I can only handle so much of at one time.			"

												The limiting factor in this game is that it is optimized running using a single core. In short, if your system unit is Quadcore, this game only uses 1 core. This game runs well for the first 20-30 minutes with a population of 70,000 to 100,000. However, the population growth increases the demands for it to run. Then, it lags horribly as the population increased to 200,000 more. One fix is to restart the game but it only takes 10-15 minutes before it lags again really bad.

You will get messages consistently contradicting each other and itself.The overall stability of the game will begin to falter after 30 or so minutes of gameplay - due to a lack of proper coding to make calls to the operating system to reserve memory for the game.It is broken beyond practical compensation (you would need to consider having competent technical skills in order to make this game work for you.).

												This game is flawed. It is better than Sim City 4 in many ways, but it is flawed in that it was built many years ago for single core systems. The main thread of the game handles most everything and becomes overwhelmed with you city gets to be about 1/3 the size of a city's maximum footprint. It doesn't matter how many cores, how much RAM, or what kind of video card you have. Everything is bottlenecked by the single game thread which will max out a single core and bring the game down to an unplayable single digit frames per second.If it wasn't for this one show stopper issue, I would recommend this over Sim City. It is a shame they don't rewrite their game engine to work with multiple cores.			"

												Cities XL Platinum, is a truly appealing, immersive, visually stunning, and unique game, especially for gamers whom has a passion or interest for the city-building genre. Yes, the technical performance issues are slightly annoying, but for me personally, this did not significantly impact on the fact that I thoroughly enjoyed this game. If you learn to adapt to the flaws, and look at it as a positive, odds are youll probably find yourself spending many, many, many hours on this game, perfecting your city step by step and shaping it into the city of your dreams and imagination, just like me.The large map space available to build your city on is a great asset and the game mechanics is generally easy to master and understand. Perhaps, the best thing I like about this game is the fact that when you put into your city, your passion, your time, your efforts you'll see that reflected in your finished city, and the subsequent feelings of intense pride, inspiration, and satisfication is quite something. And even then, you'll always finding yourself going back to your cities and experiencing the awe-inspiring realism that is your created masterpiece!! In short, I would have to say Cities XL Plantinum is without a doubt, one of my all-time favourite games and would recommend it enthusiastically.			"

												Glitchy, poorly coded, neither spell checked nor beta tested (clearly) and the slow pace of unlocking buildings is unnecessarily restrictive. If I had access to more options earlier, I think I'd realise how little there is early on and stop playing sooner.			"

Just purchased this on sale for £4. Let me tell you, if I had paid retail (£19.99) I would be very annoyed right now.Good Points;- The graphics are fairly good- Large open maps ranging from mountains to small islands- If you can manage to build one, bridges and tunnels look good- Allows easy mod installation- Quirky animations of citizensBad Points;- After I first installed and opened the game it immediately crashed- On second attempt to start the game the audio worked, but displayed a constant black screen until it crashed- Since then I've experienced about 4 random crashes- Once you have layed out your city's roads they are hard to update later on due to buildings, so planninh WAY ahead in essential- Bridges are VERY awkward to contruct as the method is somewhat glitchy- Can't build a road underneath the water level even if far away from any lakes/rivers, so no tunnels under water- Cannot build an overpass over roads, or atleast not easily- Plot placements can be awkward and glitchy in certain places- Although there are a good selection of buildings, often they are repeated everywhere- Not really an actual challenge like SimCity may offer- To unlock new buildings requires more and more people, so takes a long time to even unlock transportation like buses or even larger roads like expressways to cope with high volumes of traffic later on			"

												Theres a lot going for this game. A lot more freedom and choices with the location and buildings. More natural road construction, the use of roads that automatically build themselves is wonderful. But the User Interface, good lord the UI. The trading system is one of the most confusing things I have ever encountered. You can only trade with cities that you have so be prepared to have a lot of save files. And you can't trade with cities in the red, so if one of your cities isn't doing so well, you can't trade anything with them. I wish I could say I could over look it, but I can't. It's just too awful and unnessecarly confusing. If the trading system left and the money system was like SimCity, I would recommend this game, but I can't right now, if ever. If you were looking for an alternative to SimCity, look elsewere. This isn't it. I regret buying it.			"

												( 4 out of 10 )This lacks a lot of the (user interface) features. It's very choppy, looks like it was built with MSpaint, and game play is very close to Simcity4. I've played every city game you can buy, this one adds a nice touch to it, but then again, buggy, and isn't a clean interface. The game play itself is alright, nothing to write home about, I might check out the XXL version since its being released, however I have not played this one for too long, as you can tell, and I probably wont, as a new user, there is many better alternatives than this version. Hope they really revamp the new one, cause this needs a lot more work to it.			"

The Sim City alternativeYou want big regions with different levels and areas? Here you go. Like Sim City 4, Cities XL features different landscapes where you can build your town and manage the infrastructure.You have many different buildings, roads, special buildings and maps. You can make cool cities with different specialisations and you can trade between them. Think regional! Not only about your own city.You can waste many hours into that game, but the bad side is that the engine only supports one core. So even with an high-end Intel processor like a 4590k you will reach the point, there this game is unplayable because even your 5,5 GHZ OC i5 gives up.So under that circumstances I can't recommend that game. It's fun, but your fun is limited by the poor engine.A cool city builder, but due the limited performance even on powerfull intel processors with high single core performance, this game will lag like hell with a medium city.4/10 "

												This is a really fun SimCity-type simulator. The graphics are pretty, the music is enjoyable, and the game design is easy to get used to. However, the game also seems to be quite buggy, so once your city reaches a certain size, the program starts to slow down. For that reason, I've never even been able to finish a game properly (and yes, I easily met the system requirements). So as much as I hate to say it, I don't recommend this game. I'm hopeful that the upcoming Cities XXL will feature better programming and not have the annoying slowdown problem.			"

												doesnt lag on a 2014 Intel core I3 on my Toshiba satellite (Laptop). has good gameplay but you must make money by turning up the Taxes & the UI is a bit confusing at first. if you dont like  Buggy Games then head for Sim City 4 or 5 (unofficially) or Cities Skylines or Tropico 4 Steam edition.... its not very buggy. has lots of space to play on. there is no reset world button so if there are no places left on the earth (in Game) then you must reset your game & there are no more Mods for this game as the In game Mods Button takes you cities-XXL.com where the mods list is which is no longer avalible because of the release of Cities XXXL. Cities XXXL seems to be Cities XXL but with a new UI & a small amount of new features according to people on the Best Net who have reviewed this game.....			"

												The Game in this version seems to be totally bugged. My sister has a normale CD-Version that works just fine.The Platinum Version here I couldn't even play 1 hour before I was so annoyed that I deleted the hole game from my hard drive.Examples: - Options button when game starts doesn't work. I wanted to turn off the sound, it was simply impossible, it only worked  after I started the game and used the menü there- World Map buttons for cities didn't work, every time I chose a map it jumped to some rocky map no matter what I chose. Choosing over the list on the side worked, but not even after the city was founded it was possible to start it on the world map.- some buildings are missing in the menü it seems (incinerator wanted some recycling center in the vicinity, but there was no such building in the list, not even after I tried to unlock all buildings with the cheat)....I don't really have any more motivation to write about this game, no idea why this platinum version is so much worse than the normal one.....

This issue is still present in Cities XXL (Feb, 2015) from what I've heard because they're using the same engine, which is quite jewish imo tbh.  Buy Cities Skylines or Anno 2070 instead.			"

I've deleted the appcache folder, turned off firewall and antivrus, uninstalled, re-downloaded and re-installed and get the same error.  I will never buy another Steam game or from this developer.  Ripoff!			"

												love the game, but, it lags like crap at times for me and my spec FAR exceeds the minimum requirements D:AMD FX-8350AMD R9-290X32GB RAMand it stutters when zomming and screen tears when moving around.... if the game was optomised more no doubt it would be even better...other than those little issues, i love the game, but, be cautious :) one wrong p[lace building could send you sprialling to hell			"

												This is just a buggy mess that wants to be way better then it really is. In fact it is so buggy it cannot preform basic economy equations and will tell the player that it should perform an action that will cause the city to go into debt and leaving the player confused why this is happening. I also had so much lag and crashes once I managed a big enough city and my computer can Fallout 4 no problem on High graphics setting.			"

												Get Cities: Skylines instead. It is better in literally every single way. All of them.This also has severe problems with using RAM, it only uses 2GB of RAM and to get it to use more you have to go into the config. files and change it. It will automatically revert to 2GB after a period of time. Seriously, just buy Cities: Skylines. You have no excuse to own this over it.			"

												Terrible game, poorly opimised so the frame rate drops as soons as the population gets even remotly large. The maps are huge, but you can never get close to filling even half of them! Get Cities:Skylines instead of this mess. Cities XXL is almost exactly the same game as Cities XL, so avoid it too.			"

												( 4 out of 10 )This lacks a lot of the (user interface) features. It's very choppy, looks like it was built with MSpaint, and game play is very close to Simcity4. I've played every city game you can buy, this one adds a nice touch to it, but then again, buggy, and isn't a clean interface. The game play itself is alright, nothing to write home about, I might check out the XXL version since its being released, however I have not played this one for too long, as you can tell, and I probably wont, as a new user, there is many better alternatives than this version. Hope they really revamp the new one, cause this needs a lot more work to it.			"

												Buggy and glitchy from beginning to end. No rail (a deal breaker for me) and creepy gnome people on the streets of your cities. Virtually unplayable when a city gets too big. Do not buy this game or any other games that ctrl+c ctrl+v this game (ones with extra X's in them come to mind). Did I mention the creepy peoples?			"

												1/10 Would not buy again. I think as far as basic mechanics go it does function, but it's just so unpolished and terrible. It looks like a student made this game. And they were so careful to take screenshots that are misleading, it's offensive.			"

												Review from an irl urban planner:Went through the tutorial and found it annoying. Then started building my own city, got frustrated with the interface and roads, quit, and never opened the game again. One of my worst experiences with a city builder.Don't waste your time with this. Get Cities: Skylines instead.			"

												Basically sim city 4 mark 2. It's a good city builder game that you can do fairly well at without getting super hardcore about, but with plenty of additional features to keep the micromanger happy too. It's a decent sim without any major bugs I was able to find. I don't really have much more to say on it, overall reccomend if you like this type of game in general.			"
