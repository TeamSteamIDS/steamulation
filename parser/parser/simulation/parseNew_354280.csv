												Disclaimer: I got a free key for beta testing.Nice, family friendly, tower building puzzle game, which gets quite difficult in the upper levels - or I am just too dumb ^^			"

												Yeah it's released finally and I like this game! To build up my tower with all this different parts is fun and to see how it works against gravity and natural forces is also great. The defend could be challenging sometimes but after a while there is always a way :)Of course I am not yet through every level but so far I would clearly recommend it.			"

												Its nice to have such games you can just play in some spare time and quit when you feel like it.The game itself is quite challenging. At some points it realy got tricky.A nice feature is the guns mechanic and enemies attacking your turret ( highly praised my turrets! )Till now I had fun with this game and can recommend it to everyone else.

+ The gameplay is pretty basic but a lot of fun. You try to build a tower to a certian height and make sure it's stable enough to stay up for around 10 seconds. + A number of challenging obstacles you must overcome, like little toy trians that try to knock your tower over, wind, earthquakes, etc.+ This game is very nostalgic and makes you feel like a kid again. Especially if you enjoyed building tall free standing towers out of blocks.+ While the majority of the game you build towers, there are other modes where you construct bridges to get a car across a canyon, or defend a tower or city from enemies.+ Love the elevator music :)+ The physics are actually very realistic and work correctly. - I felt like there should have been a larger variety of blocks and items to use. You are a bit limited in creativity by having a select few while under a budget limit.  "

												I bought this game under the misleading title of ""tower defence"". It's a 2D tower building block game with clunky controls and a horrible UI. And there are only 32 levels which would take maybe 2 hours to complete. This just reaks of amateur. For the price I'd usually say you can't go wrong, but in this case, save your money.			"

												the game seems really fun and its neat how you can stack things and ballence things to meet the target needed to progress to the next level the graphics are also nice for the game style . also the game itself does not take up a lot of room eaither whats good ...... mmmmmm my only issue is that people may get a little bored at the start of the game but it looks like its fun at times			"
