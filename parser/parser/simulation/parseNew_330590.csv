												I've played a lot of spaceflight simulators, and I've never had more fun than I have with this one.Piloting a larger ship just *felt* good, the science fiction technology was unique, the missions were challenging but fair, and it had a surprisingly good story with some branches and morality choices involved.I can't speak to any technical issues with this version ... it worked on my box for the first couple of missions ...  but the command scheme and graphics certainly are dated at this point.

												Sadly, I can't recommend this game.  I loved playing it back when it came out, and had hoped I could relive that experience, but that was not to be.  Game constantly crashed when entering the lagrange point in the second mission, and no patch could be found (nor should one have been needed, frankly).  I'll be happy to buy it again if I can be sure it will work.			"

												One of the few space games that even makes an _attempt_ at semi realistic space flight. The way your own ship is so intricately modeled is a nice touch too.Even got some alien spookiness if you're in to that kind of thing.Difficulty spikes are a pain.			"

												This game was fantastic in it's time, and it honestly holds up quite well. The realistic space-flight physics are impeccably designed, and that really is what the core of the game is about. There are no unskippable cut-scenes, allowing you to take in as much of the story as you like, and get to the ""good part"" of the game as soon as you wish. The story moves along quickly enough to keep you interested, allowing you to take missions in the order you prefer, as they become available. A solid game of the golden age that holds up well to the test of time.However, gameplay aside, there are issues with the Steam port of this game. As many have noted, there are issues whenever trying to fly through a Lagrange jump point. You can pilot your corvette up to the very point of the jump, at which point the whole game crashes. It's very disappointing to be able to get just a taste of this fantastic game, but to be stymied at one of the core game mechanics.5/10, Steam.			"
