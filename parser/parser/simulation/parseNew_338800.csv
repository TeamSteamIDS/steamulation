												My Review Link: http://ellivr.github.io/Seven-Kingdoms-2-HD-Review/First I want to say no, this game is very different than AoE series, Starcraft series, Rise of Nations, this game has different ""vibes"" than those and is both unique on its own way.This game brings back memories. I used to play this game alot when I was high school back then, along with my father. I played both 7k1 and 7k2, 7k2 offers more features, more civilizations to play, as well as it allows you to play as the Frythans, which you cant do on first series. If I remember the only thing that 7k2 missing from original 7k1 is, there's no naval aspect on the game, no sea at all. There's two main species that you can play: Human or Frythans (Monsters). Each have different playstyle. As human you need to watch for mineral resources, village loyalty, and stuffs. Human has 12 civilizations, each of them have their own unique soldiers, and their own deities which you can summon them. But as Frythans, you have to massacre humans for Life Points, you don't need to care about minerals (Unless you are minotauros), no village loyalty they pay tributes to you as long as you set up lair to control the village. There are 7 kinds of Frythans, and again each of them has their own unique units, their own unique structures. You can mix all of these by having a unit that different from yours, surrender to you,, you can have access to theirs tech tree. And yes, this game has high replayability value.The only thing that I hate is, no option for windowed mode.My review is short and might have missed some part, if you are interested in this game I suggest you to watch the gameplay video on youtube. Thanks for reading, hope it helps with your purchase.EDIT: They have released patches to support windowed mode =b			"

												The production values are a bit dated, but don't let that fool you.  There hasn't been an RTS like this since 1999.  It's been praised as sort of a ""Thinking Man's Age of Empires,"" and that is a fair description.  Instead of mining for resources, you must tax your citizens and trade at markets.  Instead of creating units at barracks, you must draft those same citizens at forts and place them under a capable general to train.  Slipping a few spies into enemy ranks can turn the tide later on - imagine your enemy's face when his most trusted general defects to your side with half his men!  And of course there is always the war against the Frythans - spend too much time fighting your human enemies and you'll both be sorry when a horde of monsters comes charging in...Or you can just play as the Frythans and build an army of gorrillas.My only criticisms are that at the maximum resoltion the game seriously hurts my eyes.  Maybe it's my moniter or my settings.  Either way, it plays just fine for me at lower resolutions.  Sound and visuals are a bit dated and some of the sound effects in particular are very generic.  Despite all that, it's a worthy addition to anyone's library.  It puts the ""Strategy"" in Real Time Strategy again and makes you think, scheme, plan, and negotiate your way to victory instead of spamming units or racing to the end of some tech-tree.  Check out the other reviews, and you can see that the game definately has some staying power despite its age.			"

												I like the music, this game is still challenging. Some of my friends have played the first part of Seven Kingdoms years before. Sure, the graphic can`t be compared to latest high end games. But all other is finest art. For me, this game is a diamond in this genre. This rts ( indie strategic simulation ) part is one of the best games i`ve ever played before.short review: ( positive criterion ( + ) maximum 5 ) - single and multiplayer - no achievements - finally in HDmusic: +++++ (5/5)graphic: average (3/5)gameplay: +++++ (5/5)tutorial: ++++ (4/5)  "

												Seven Kingdoms 2 is my favourite RTS game ever and this HD version added some much-needed higher resolutions.7K2 originally came out in 1999. When compared to the major RTS game of the time, the Age Of Empires franchise has better quality graphics and more detailed combat with the sheer number of unit types and combat options at your disposal (however in 7K2, you can control multiple nationalities at once, allowing you to use their unit types for war and opening up more combat possibilities)Both franchises are great, but if you want a game that is more about empire building, with amazing diplomacy, strategy, espionage and economy management on a national scale; look no further than 7K2.For those interested and want to know how it compares to Age Of Empires, here's what you have in Seven Kingdoms 2:- DETAILED LOYALTY SYSTEM: Rule your kingdom by fair means or foul. Each person/unit in your kingdom has a loyalty value that's affected by your decisions. For example, if you're an evil ruler, be prepared to control towns that may want to rebel or soldiers who try to defect to another kingdom- MEANINGFUL AND INTRICATE DIPLOMACY OPTIONS- EXPANSION: SK2 includes towns that are independent of other nations. Expand your kingdom by taking over these towns through gaining their trust or by tyranny.- MULTICULTURAL RULE: Control more than one race at a time by taking over independent towns of other nationalities.- PLAYABLE MONSTER RACES (called Frythans) that greatly diversify strategy and gameplay- DETAILED ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT: mine, manufacture and distribute 3 types of resources, establish trade routes between towns and nations, establish a tax system for your towns- EXCELLENT ESPIONAGE SYSTEMS (agitate, assassinate, counter-spy, create an incident between two nations, steal technologies and bribing)- RPG ELEMENTS: Each unit (soldier or civilian) has their own name, as well as combat, leadership and loyalty stats that can be improved with more experience- HEROS: rule with legends such as Genghis Khan, Hannibal Barca or Alexander The Great- A randomly generated campaign storyline that is different each time you play it (although it's somewhat glitchy at times...)This HD version is essentially the same game with some higher resolution settings and some patches to gameplay.I've seen on forums that some people have had problems running the game, thankfully I haven't had any of these issues. Add me if you're interested in multiplayer. Let's get some games going!			"

												Decided to write my review, not sure if it's alittle bias though since i owned the actual old CD version before steams time so have racked up many hours before hand but here i go.Pros: quite simple in most cases since one of the hardest things to understand (Espionage) can be set to ""already researched"" so there is less to worry about. even the settings when setting up games is rather straight forward.The many choices of individual start races gives you somewhat freedom of choice, especially since with abit of inmatch work you can include other races into your army anyways.And the Fryhtans further reinforce this race choice since there is a huge difference between them and their tech.The single player campaign is long, slowly progresses in difficulty and well thought out, and it even comes with a scenario maker to make your own missions.Cons: theres always some no matter what game.Multiplayer setup even though has been updates is still rather dated since it lacks a lobby but uses manual input, good i guess if you enjoy keeping it a private game, annoying if you want to play with randoms.Small balance issues between races do exist though i wont list them i'll just say that there are 3 main ones that are pretty obvious, this will hopefully be worked on in a balance patch.Conclusion:Pros out weigh the cons and the cons can even be fixed in later updates which the game DOES see some occasionally so it's not a dead steam hosted game like some other HD remakes are *rolls eyes away from some specific ones*and it's currently £3.50 (which is like $4?) hardly a big splash for a game that has personally entertained me for years, and seeing it being worked on and patched again shows it was still worth the effort.so overall i recommend this one for those fan of RTS's even if its graphics and system are abit outdated, good games never get old.

												I'ma go Fanboi real quick. This game is phenomenal, like one of the original 4X games with armies waging over giant maps. Who would've thought ancient civilizations and monsters fit together so nicely? Still has espionage, diplomacy and military features that modern games don't have. I Freaking adore this game and you will too. Now get out there and murder some Frythans. Fanboism done.

												I will never give up loving this game. Played a lot when i was a kid. I'm happy to see it on steam and very happy to see enlight software still active. About the game: The most detailed, most cleverly designed and most entertaining strategy game even in 2015 :) But still needs some updates. Firstly, i can select my army with shortcut ( select army then press ctrl + number so you can select your army with this number ) but i can't reach them when i double press on it. And, after send my army to fort or lair, the shortcut disappears. (Edit: Devs fixed it. Thx Enlight) Also there is no shortcut for buildings. It would be great if some buildings has shortcuts like Mage Tor. Second, the rain sound is so loud and occurs frequently. It's annoying sometimes. (Edit: Devs fixed it. Thx Enlight)Thanks a lot developers for this masterpiece. Actually a lot more things to be done but hope to see them in SEVEN KİNGDOMS 3!			"

												This game does so much right, it's an amazing rts with rpg elements. No other game makes you really feel like you're running a kingdom more than SK2 does. One of the best games of of all time for my money. This was the first PC game I ever played, and I still have the original disk from 1999. I first played it at a friends house, and left thinking it was the best game ever. For a good 11 years, this was my favorite game of all time until I discovered Company of Heroes. My dad and I used to fight over who got to use the good pc just to play this. It taught me to wake up early on my own, up at 4 am = no dad on the pc. Ironically, that later served me great working in coffee shops.			"

												OK, I had to change my initial ""review"" of the game...First of all, new patch fixed the frame rate issue, now it's stable 90+ FPS.Second, and most important, the devs read my negative review, and then took the trouble of informing me that there's a new patch which fixes the issue I'm having. Kudos for Enlight Software, I wish you all the best guys.Buy this nice little piece of gaming history, whether here or on GOG.So I changed it from thumbs down to thumbs up!My original review is below the line...______________________________________________________________________________Seven Kingdoms 2 was really a great game. And still is because it aged well. However, this so-called HD remake is not so great. I have 10 FPS in game on a computer which runs new games pretty well. It doesn't matter if I play in 800x600 or 1920x1080, FPS remains the same. Odd thing is when I scroll the screen, FPS rises to 30 but drops back to 10 when the screen is still. Maybe it's the drivers, but I'm not willing to tamper with older versions when everything is OK in other games.So, if you want to play Seven Kingdoms 2 - go to GOG and buy their original version.

												This is truly one of the finest and most unique fantasy RTS games ever made. Incorporating not only elements of conquest, but economic, scientific and (my favorite) espionage-based gameplay truly make this a remarkable game. Couple that with dynamic campaigns on randomly generated maps and you have a game you could play for YEARS (and I have!). This HD re-release completely took me by surprise, but I don't mind buying the game a third time, it's just that good.			"

All the meanwhile maintain an easy to learn streamline approach to the game.This is basically the RTS version of Civilization, except its way more fun.			"

												Seven Kingdoms 2 is a different strategy game than Age of Empires or Rise of Nations. This game is not only about gather resources and building a big army, but also about trading and spying on your enemies. In this game you can take over cities by attacking them with a big army or just buy them out.This game has alot to offer and is really a reccomendation to everyone who likes a challenging strategy game.

												I remember playing this way back on my Windows 98 machine and loving it.  I'm not usually an RTS fan, but I was really into this game for a good while.  Now it's back with HD graphics, so even though my current monitor is over twice the resolution of the old monitor I played it on, it still looks great.  The gameplay is simple, there are lots of detailed ancient cultures to choose from (as well as the dreaded Fryhtan aliens/monsters), and overall it runs well.  I definitely recommend it if you like RTS games.			"

It's amazing how fun is the play system, expecially playing with the Fhrytans, and how balanced and well done is playing with humans. You can summon gods to help you, hire heroes and spyes, use diplomatics in your favour and protect yourself from the biggest monsters out there. Or you could just rip out everything using your magic spells, special atacks or special units from your Fryhtan Kwyzan. Really well made adaption from this awesome old school game to the new generations of PCs.			"

There are a few random exceptions to this and other challenges to get around it.I could go on and write more about the game but theres somethings you just need to learn on your own.I will give you this though, right click on some buttons like bribe, grant, retreat.. give you more options, and right click the options to set them permanently or for all related items like towns.The game has multiplayer too, so bring your friends and see if you can stand the test of time.

												One of Trevor Chan's greatest games, unfortunately the series was ended after the disaster known as Seven Kingdoms: Conquest.A game with many complex systems that is still easy to pick up and learn, but hard to master: an exact formula few games can master, but Seven Kingdoms does. Espionage can turn the tide of battle, and siege engines light the ground with crimson (and pixely) flames. You make more money than Venice, and summon Thor to smite those who dare invade you.Also you can make an army made entirely of termites and bees.Overall, a great game that is being sold for a low priceEDIT: Calling it an ""HD Edition"" is a bit of a stretch, but it adds new features different from the old game, and fixed some of the severe issues (such as the hyper-aggresion of Fryhtans). Playing the game outside of Steam Overlay, like some other old games on Steam, will help reduce crashes.			"

												Hi everyone,I don't always write a review, but when i do it's for an mind blowing game like seven kingdoms 2.I still have the original disc from 1999. I kind of bought it randomly at that time but without doubt, without any regrets.I have played many RTS games over the years but never found anything again wich was as unique as seven kingdoms 2.I mean one of the coolest things in this game is that your units can lvl up in battle to extremely high lvls and become crazy overpowered. The other kingdoms and kwyzans can do this aswell and delivers very crazy battles.You are the king and start off at lvl 100 while your units start at lvl 20. Now, as you participate in many battles with your units they will gain a much higher combat lvl and a better leadership lvl. Your strongest dudes will be the most recognisable ofcourse and you will make generals out of them so they can lead other parts of your growing army.Never ever was i able to create such a bond with my generals and stronger units.The stronger they become and the more battles they have won for me, the more units they have trained to follow in their footsteps in the quest to conquer or destroy everything.The feeling of anger and despair when one of your strongest generals falls to battle is undescribeable!!! xDYou will truly hate th enemy for it and you will be comitted to take your revenge.Without a doubt this only!! is a truly a unique element in the game and reason enough for me to write this review.Imean how awesome is it that at one point you can have this unit of (for example) lvl 500+ and hes holding out against groups of enemys your other units would be killed by in seconds. Units you literally create a bond with!!!Units that you will truly remeber for their glorious battles after they die!! xDEnough about that though :)This also was the fisrt game where i actually enjoid the diplomacy. (mostly when playing humans).Humans are also harder to play since the overall monsters are much stronger then the humans.This is why as a human kingdom you will have to play smarter and start trade treatys and alliances with other kingdoms.Or perhaps even get some frythans to aid you. Not that this is something i would recommend since frythans create new units by spending gold and lifepoints.Lifepoints are harvested when killing living beings. So you can expect that frythans will eventually betray the ♥♥♥♥ out of you and destroy you in seconds if your army is♥♥♥♥♥♥:).Are you up for a chalenge and you like diplomacy? Go play humans and try to beat these frythans. Don't you give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about anything or anyone? Go play the frythans and ♥♥♥♥ up everything that moves!!! and if not? BEND THEM TO YOUR WILL!!!I honnestly wasn't aware of the fact they released an HD version of this game on steam.But ♥♥♥♥ am i exited that i can finnaly spend a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of hours to this fine♥♥♥♥♥specimen of a game.If you like bonds with your units, if you like total destruction, if you like taking revenge on backstabbing ♥♥♥♥♥es that call themselves kings, if you like a chalenge. Then this is the game for you. With all the unique elements i bet you will fall in love with this game if you give it a chance.Also if you don't mind the fact that it looks kinda old ofcourse :).It doesn't make it less awesome i tell ya. BUY THIS JEWEL OF A GAME!!!!!!!!Thanks for reading this anyways!!!See ya ;)			"

												It is really great game. I recommend it. This game is fun, espionage, politicks and unlike 1st game, it allows you to play for monsters. :)Game is not that complicated and has simple mechanics, just manage your kingdom. Trying to balance your budget, managing food so your subjects dont starve to death and diplomacy, so your neibours and monsters will not crush you. It does not seem as much, but it is suprisingly entertaining.However, there are few things, which always bothered me about this game.1st are gods, flying around with different powers, some completly useless, some extremly powerfull. For example, Carthaginian god can create earthquake, significantly damaging half of your kingdom and there is nothing, you can do or Indian god, just throwing few tornados at your cities. Unlike gods with direct attack, gods with indirect attack, are not considired declaration of war.2nd thing is late game. When most kingdoms (usualy excluding Egyptians and monsters) run out of population for armies and research siege equipment. At that moment war machinery spaming starts and big battles are replaced with small skirmishes and spitfires burning everything in their path.Since lately many strategy games are just stupid clones of 20 years old games and lately a lot of strategy games are either 20 hours building games or fast wish to be new e-sport fast♥♥♥♥♥♥This game is nice middle and even with those few problems, you should try it.

												A timeless classic, but too bad it seens kinda forgotten by most, grab this if you want a great strategy game, one of the bests I say.PROS:-complex strategy on every level, from building your town, managing trade and your economy, diplomatic relations, high variety of military units(a standard infantary plus a special unit from each of the 12 human races, including more warmachines that you can make) and one of the best espionage system that i have ever seen.-Graphics kinda still hold on, they made a good job on this HD remastered-RPG like system, all units have 2 levels(combat and leadership and an extra spyng for spies only) that works very well,combat can b lvled on the battle or with a general training the troops on the fort, ordo on the lair in case of the monsters, leadership can be lvled by generals while they are training trops on the fort or leading them on the battlefield. Each unity is kinda unique since all of them have different names plus theres the awesome addition of the hero unities that you can buy out them on your inn or they will seldon  join your army depending on certain factors, and to finish up theres also some artefacts to increment your unitys power.-Easy to understand scenario editor for those who love to make maps-Easy to understand tutorial and to get into it, the game is easy to learn but hard to master- random events can make the game more impredictable(tornados earthquakes, tempests, plagues etc)CONS:-Multiplayer need a 3rd app to get into it(at least for the time being I hope they change it)-unities movimentation and some animations are kinda outdated-AI is kinda dumb so when you figure out how it thinks the game becomes way easier-lack of archivements or trading card for the momment being-the maps are pretty shallow(all are plains that you can config to be fartile with green grass or badlands to be a like a wasteland, plus some mountais and misc.s that you cannot cross or interact)-some civilizations seens kinda underpowored and others more opThe dinamic campaing is also okaish its not bad but its random generated some ppl might not like it(you will keep repeating very similar scenarios on  them)Overall its a great game if you are looking for a great RTS experience even considering its flaws, the game being relatively cheap I highly recommend you to grab it and try it out if you are looking for one of the best RTS, you wont regret it.

												Having played this when it originally came out, I'm glad to say that this is a faithful rerelease of the game. Everything is as it was with the exception of the graphics which have been properly updated. This game is best played in groups as most rts games are, but the variety of play styles are never left out. I would recomend this to anyone who is looking for a great party game to test the skills of their friends/family/piers.			"

												The HD edition of this classic game is just beautiful. This RTS of the '90 era is not well known, but it deserves to be in the hall of fame of the best RTS of all the times.At €.10 is probably a bit pricey for a vintage game, but indeed the money is well spent.PROS:- dynamic campaign with the best units carried in the next scenarios- scenario editor- espionage, advanced weapons- simplified but working economy- every soldier can be trained and equipped with powerful objects- if your king dies, you can pick a new king between yout generals- a lot of different strategies to winCONS:- There is no water (nor ships) in the maps- large units formations are difficult to manage (the battles are a complete carnage) "

												If you played SK2 before and know what's it about: get it! The HD graphics are great and they added a new extra-large map mode, which also brings a nice touch to an old formula.If you never played SK2 before: SK2HD is basically one of the very few strategy games that mixes politics heavily into the fray of warfare. This is a game in which diplomacy counts as much as troop movement. I fully recommend playing with the whole map visible and no fog of war, since this makes the game EXTREMELY enjoyable to follow, witnessing AI battles unfold.You have only 2 types of unit per kingdom + your god. Basic units can be created from the get-go and fill forts, in which they train under potent commanders. After x Combat points they unlock a special attack (usually a range attack or a more powerful melee attack). This system will make your most potent soldiers constantly follow your king as he changes forts, as bodyguards, while the ones with the most Leadership take the role of generals and train the ""greens"".And you will need your king. Since, if he dies, town morale and troop loyalty will plummet, leaving you vulnerable to espionage actions by your opponents. Towns can be convinced to revolt, forts and armies can be convinced to change sides. Diplomacy is the name of the game. You will have to carefully select your friends and allies and join wars with caution. A war will weaken your kingdom and make it vulnerable to new attacks, and the point of the game is to always be strong for the end phase (which is fairly easy in singleplayer, after you read a guide; yes it's that kind of game). Yes, espionage is a potent tool in this game. You can sabotage production, stir an uprising, bribe soldiers/generals to join your side (as spies themselves), capture forts and even hand over the entire kingdom to your side (if, by some miracle, the other king dies and one of your spies is selected as king. There might remain some strangling loyalists, but these forces will soon fall ahead of your might.The two resources (food and money) are managed through economy and agriculture. For economy you need to create markets connected to factories connected to mines. For agriculture,  you need a village  that has as many free people as possible; not as easy as it seems, since many buildings require manpower, which is subtracted from the village work force.Mercenaries are also a vital part of the game. Units and spies can be bought and make for an excellent solution, especially when you have to hold an advancing force while your main army reaches the battle (pro-tip: builds LOTS of inns ob your town outskirts and have a fort full of mercs early on)Like real politics, the most difficult part of the game is deciding when to join a war and on who's side. Jumping in to soon might weaken your kingdom and turn you into prey for whoever will end up victorious. Jumping too late, however, might see you facing a kingdom that is spread over the entire map and who's army outnumbers yours 10 to 1.There's also monsters in the game. They can't do diplomacy (even if they want to), which makes them far less fun but more of a challenge.			"

												Don't be discouraged by the outdated graphics and sound. This game is truly a unique gem and easily forgotten but offers so much even today despite it's somewhat dated looks.In Seven Kingdoms you take control of an human civilization on a typical rts styled map, you can pick between 12 civilizations which all look aesthetically different and have various strengths/weaknesses. Furthermore you can pick a Frythan race, which are mythical and gruesome creatures bent on enslaving everyone. Both factions play very different, where human civilizations are more refined and deep, the Frythans are more about conquering.The game has some very unique mechanics, basically the player tries to take over towns (either peacefully or with force) to increase your population. Recruiting them as builders or soldiers from a pool. Diplomacy, wafare, research and espionage are of utmost importance and allow you for different playstyles. You can pick between various approaches to conquer your enemies which is certainly a welcome change, it's a lot deeper than your typical rts. It has some major 4x elements so there are a lot of factors that you have to consider. The Frythan faction is more straight forward though with a heavy emphasis on warfare. The campaign is certainly unique and has some Risk elements, don't expect anything amazing but it's still very entertaining. I definitely recommend this game for the multiplayer though, playing with a friend is a blast.The things that I could critique is the dated graphics and sound assets, but I personally don't mind it that much. It is servicable and still quite good. Also sometimes it can be a bit confusing if there is a lot of activity going on, there are sometimes a lot of factors to manage but luckily the hd edition allows for a larger overview, making it easier to navigate. Which reminds me that this game can be extremely challenging at first, the AI is actually really competent and can easily wipe you out even if you consider yourself an expert at rts games.Still I definitely recommend this game for anyone who likes a somewhat unique rts with a nice twist. It offers variety from other games and runs on every pc. One last thing I want to mention is that the developer is really present and communicates intensively with the community in order to fix bugs, balance game and make it overall a better game than it used to. That is very recommendable and helped me with some issues that I previously had with the game.			"

												I just found about this game searching for a patch for my original SK2 game that I was previously playing. Suffice to say, I immedimately purchased and downloaded this version. I am SO EXCITED to be playing an HD update version of this on Steam with larger map sizes and new features I'm just discovering. Seven Kingdoms 2 was a huge improvement over SK:AA (Ancient Adversaries) with the addition of Hero Units, additional cultures to play, and even the campaign mode. Not to mention, playing as the malevolent Frytans? Always fun! My only complaint so far is that the music is from SK:AA vs. the new music they have in SK2. Other than that, it's the first RTS series I ever played, and I am sure to be putting in even more hours on this version.			"

												Well I don`t know where to start with but will make it to the point.I played this game first when it came out in 90s and got hooked immediately.. spent years playing it and till now with 15 years + since its release I still consider it one of the best strategy games ever and I play it till today.Its unique, everything in it is unique, new principles like spies and focusing more on the governing not gathering, even its music is very cool,I recommend getting this one, I got it new on steam, but I definitely played hundreds of hourse on this one. unfortunately the sequel wasn`t so cool, and why on earth they stopped this frenchise I don`t get it!! its cool, amazing game play and solid one, only con I can think of now is the graphics are not that good, but compared to its time of release was superb as well.

												K after lots of thinking about this game. I gotta say I love it. I played this back when I was a teen and as young and immature as I was I enjoyed it then. I was more in love with part 1 than part 2. Is this game worth the HD upgrade. So far not many feautures are improved. Hopefully they will add better multiplayer support, steam workshop and biger fonts.Pro:-economics is far superior than any other RTS. I always hope other games by now would take their economic model and apply it to other games. Sadly no. I love that you have to build a mine, have a factory to produce goods, then sell it on the market. In order to make more income you have to have diversity in your market either by exploiting more resources your self or trade. Proabably cause Trevor Chan created business simulators like Capitalism which gives him the edge to create  a more realistic economy than tact on markets like AOE. - Diplomacy is awesome. Your other nations will constantly try to pursuade you to trade technology, embargo other nations. No other RTS is this advanced in it. - Espoinage. They have real spys that can steal infomation from competing nations.-Military recruitment. I love how you have to recruit villagers to join the military rather than produce them like a product like in other RTS. They have loyalty meters which means they can turn against you. You also have to promote your soldiers to generals in order to control forts. Forts are needed to bully villagers and recruit peasants in your ranks.Cons-clunky pathfining-Not much improvement yet for a HD version.- Too small fonts for bigger screens- soldier movements are pretty clunky, makes actual fighting enemies not very engagingIf you want an RTS with innovative economy please support this game. Maybe they will make a new one with better graphics, interface and better rock scissor paper strategy. They have a great forumula that will do well if updated to a modern game. This is not a RTS like AOE, C&C, Starcraft/Warcraft. They didnt try to innovate with small unit tactics like Dawn of War2. They ask for grander scale than your average RTS. Proabably Sins of a Solar Empire maybe a better comparison because they try to take 4x TBS elements and place them on a RTS.			"

												Ok, to start off this review im probably going to be a little biased because this is one of the very first pc games i ever played  . So now that is out of the way on to the review. This is simply one of the best rts games ever made because it is realitivly simple to learn but VERY hard to master plus there is a wide choice of cultures to play as plus a fair amount of fryhtans to play as. The replayability is almost infinate because of the random generated campaign, the scenarios, and the scenario creator. In conclusion I definatly recommend this game for the price.Now in all fairness their is one big negative right now and that is the optimization of this version. There is quite a bit of lag everytime you open a menu inside a game and also very rarley just at random times the framerate can drop as low as like 10 frames or just freeze for a second.			"

What I love about this game is:-royal trainable units (transferable between campaign maps) and artifacts-active pause-many nations-maps and campaign is generated, so one can play this endlessly-alliances and there's moreThis is the only RTS game I love, and one of the best ever, highly recommended.

												Very interesting, unique, rich and deep RTS game. It launched in 1999 and contains elements never seen before in RTS games, even today. Just to mention some: units have unique names in relation to their ethnicity and even heroes (people that existed for real, like alexander the great) can spawn. Real time economy and trade. Spies that can infiltrate enemy castles and assasinate or bribe targets. A proper real time diplomacy system. RPG elements, for example units get improved combat stats by fighting/training and equipable items exist. Taking cities of other civilizations gives you the ability to train units of that civ. Units have loyalty and may betray you and many more... The gameplay is a bit hard to grasp, but when you get into it you will love this game.			"

												TLDR: A great and unique real time strategy game with multifaceted gameplay.I already have a copy but I when I saw it on steam I had to get it again just so it's there in my library. You'll need to look past the outdated graphics, the mechanics and gameplay is what makes this RTS stand out.There are some cool unique mechanics that makes me always come back to this game. Firstly, military units have two general stats: combat and leadership. Combat affects the units health and damage. Leadership applies a combat bonus to all troops under that General's command and also increases the rate at which the General can train their troops up in combat. Any military unit can be promoted to a General. When you recruit your military, they start off weak, but through combat and training from general they improve dramatically. Which means, a small group of veterans often can take on large forces of fresh recruits. This makes for some interesting gameplay.I really enjoy the economic aspect of this game. This game only has two resources, food and money. You own towns which generate food as long as there are farmers. Money is also generated by towns via taxes, or via trading. But whats cool is for money, one needs to manage it well as there are maintainence costs. Rather than the usual gather resources and spend it, you always need to keep in mind do you have enough income coming in to sustain your expansion. So you really need to balance your economic versus your military / spy network expansion. Expand to quickly, and you'll go into debt whereby all your buildings start taking damage from poor maintenance and all your troops and citizens start becoming less loyal.Another aspect of the game that is enjoyable is the spy networks you can build. Do not understimate the power of distration during war where you can sneak spies into enemy forts and bribe their generals. Nothing beats having a huge army storm towards your base, only to get the generals to defect to yourself and watch as half of the enemy's army follow their generals and joins you as well.There is a lot to the game and it would be impossible to cover it all here. If you love strategy, RTS, and are looking for unique and fresh gameplay then this game is for you.			"

												Ugh, I bought this. And cannot play it. Guess I'm waiting for some magic to happen and be documented so, I can play it on linux. It's a good game, I've played it for years but, I the full switch to linux with the advent of steamOS. I regret nothing but, I ask that if someone finds a way to get this to work in linux please document and release tge info.			"

												Edit: this is not so much a review of the gameplay but of the HD upgraded Steam version when compared to the original non-Steam base version.v2.10Although improved from its original release (1999), the HD label is a stretch with lacklustre textures basic animations and fuzzy edged sprites.The game now supports larger windows including 16:9 and 16:10 resolutions but the ui hasn't been scaled well and still remains on the small side. (inc. 1680x1050@60hz see patch details for list of supported sizes)Alas, a stutter bug seemingly linked to mouse usage has a signicant impact on game enjoyment the current fix for which is to run via a recently implemented windowed mode... which has its own problems and much smaller resolutions.There are no graphics options beyond the screen settings.Multiplayer is through gameranger, or native tcp/ip, serial or modem direct connections, and doesn't currently integrate steam friends.There are several multiplayer, singleplayer game stopping bugs and desktop crashes reported, see the forums but developers are still working to fixes for the re-release.Directx9 dependency (not bundled as redist)It was a good game, but needs nostalgia tinted glassess and some perseverence to look past the short comings and play this '99 game in 2015.64bit win7, 8gb ram, hd7850 2gb, full admin rights.

												It just doesnt work as it says it will, The Game is great I used to play the original back in the day and always loved it, it was never beaten.But this copy is glitchy, the campaigne gets a run error after 2 maps, the widescreen doesnt work (you have to run in a small window)And the in game mouse controls are unworkably slow. seems like they messed it up by updating it.

												Originally had this game on CD, was excited to see this on here so I bought it right away. Don't get me wrong, the original game is amazing and a great time waster, however this ""HD"" version has a game-breaking ""input lag"" where even a slight movement of the mouse causes awful game lag. This has been a common issue as I've seen a lot of other complaints of this online, however the developers haven't even tried to help. They suggested some random solution that someone had posted on their forum that didn't work for most people, and aside from that one half-baked attempt, there has been no support from them. I emailed them asking for some sort of help or suggestion multiple times eager to play this awesome game but never once got a response, and now of course it is too late for a refund. Don't give them your money, go online and find a hard copy on CD. While you will have to settle for 1024x768 resolution, at least you will actually be able to play.			"

												Now it supports 1920x1080 does that makes it HD? Everything is exactly the same, steam made it easy for you to switch to their overlay that's all. If you're buying this game once again in your life for the multiplayer only then don't do it because it requires Gameranger or a LAN connection and nobody plays it there. But if you're looking for an old school classic singleplayer RTS with easy and lots of non RTS content then this is for you.Edit: Where can you lower the audio? I don't see any options for that.			"

												WAIT FOR A SALEI just want to clarify my negative review.I played this game, and its predecessor a lot. I mean, A LOT. This game was made by a small team, and it shows. No click-attack option. Insanely slow infanty movement.The utter lack of mines. I mean. I played a scenario match. It stated ""mines are what will grant you victory"" or something like that. I found 1 freaking mine in that entire map. It didn't grant me victory.What will grant you victory? A good general, fort turrets, and a bunch of free labor for your forts.This was fun to play strictly for nostalgia, but there is no good reason whatsoever for this price.WAIT FOR A SALE			"

												I'm sure there is someone out there that may like this game but it isn't me. It was my understanding that this game would be more like Age of Empires with more options. You can't even change graphic settings for the game. The music is some kind of cheap midi, the graphics and audio is horrible. If the only thing you have ever owned in your life is an 1980's Atari then you may enjoy this...			"

												I am a huge fan of the original 7K game and have spent countless hours on that game and 7KAA. I knew that this game would simply expand on the graphics and provide a few enhancements in gameplay. Nevertheless, it's a great game still in spite of the dated graphics (and who says dated graphics need to look ugly? It's still a beautiful game in its own way). Why fix something that is not broken in the first place? This is a series that has a focus on the fun aspects of RTS - diplomacy, spying, monster-battling and sheer combat, and not a tedious RTS game where you need to constantly micromanage your economy by routing workers to different resources or keep building walls around your area and still being surprised to find that somehow enemies have slipped through and wreaking havoc on unarmed civilians.Even after a short time of playing, this game has some good additions to the original 7K game, which only expands the genre and in no way takes away from the fun aspects. The best part is you can customize the difficulty at any level you prefer.Be warned, this is an addictive genre if you get used to it. Quite inexpensive and well worth the price paid, in spite of its age.			"

												A classic rts. Features a ton of different races for both humans and monster creatures called frytans. Each human civilization has various unique upgrades and gods that can help them win. Humans needs to maintain their towns happiness and taxes. As well as trade amongst other humans and frytans in order to keep up with upkeep of your builinds and units. Frytans on the other hand require attacking and enslaving towns to earn tribute to maintain upkeep. while seeming a bit easier, you are forced to be far more agressive early on otherwise you will lose money.The AI in the game is pretty difficult. Most of the time you will have to abuse the games stop time mechanic to make several decisions just in order to keep up. The campaign isn't anything to really brag about. It's decent and follows the human group that you pick trying to survive against the frytans and building an empire. Theres really no interesting plot or characters that appear. I honestly can't speak about the multiplayer as i have yet to play it due to the lack of online players. Your chances of playing against someone is low, but the offline gameplay for this game is interesting enough to keep you entertained.			"
