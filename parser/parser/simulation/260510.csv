The GameThe game from the outside looks like team-management for basketball team, like FM for football team. The basic features are there : the team management, the facility management, contract management, etc. There is also training management, finance management, and basic management stuff that should be in any sport management game. The problem in this game is not on features, but on its execution, that is what I have to say. As in FM game, the management aspect in this game revolves on managing your players, notably their training, contract, and general condition. You can also manage your team, which revolves on how to improve your facility, what players you want to draft in this season, what players you want to sell this season, how to gain income from sponsors and tickets, and others. The game also have match management, at least in theory, because during play I always got an error when trying to resolve the match manually.ObservationsSadly, the game don't work. There are too many bugs, too many things unfinished. I am talking about unfinished, not unpolished. For some games (notably tycoon games) some things could be unpolished, looks clunky, but the functionalities are there. A lot of stuff on this game have zero functionality, not to mention lots of game-breaking bugs.Bad UIThe UI is bad. Here are few things that I found as unacceptable :- It's hard to navigate to a particular player. - On the player screen, his physical stats, his offensive stats, and his defensive stats are divided into three different screens, which requires you to switch back and forth to view this player from all angles.- You don't know how much money on-hand you got now. You can view it from the finance overview, but that only tells you about budget and remaining cash after the budget year, not your cash now. - Everything is hard to be navigated. Too access a specific information you have to go 3-4 clicks, while in similar games 1 click or 2 click is suffice.- There are no explanation when you are building something. The game only gives you the cost and the picture, but nothing else. Tycoons can't make decision without critical information, this game fails to deliver information.Facebook?There are options on this game to publish certain team snippets, for example ""Red Sox is looking for a new manager"" in Facebook. Why with Facebook? Is this game like those farming game in Facebook, where we pester other people for help? Bad decision.A lot of things are unfunctionalIf you draft the players, the screen suddenly changes background that you have hard time figuring out the text. There are problems when trying to play match manually, all matches must be played automatically. Why put the button there if it can't work?Art is goodThe only redeeming factor is the art of the facility (one scene only) is quite good. No other arts existed though, because I can't play the manual game, and like tycoon games, art is limited. Tycoon games is mostly about UI, art can be followed next.VerdictNot recommended, this game is unfinished. Unfinished. Unplayable. Not fun to play.			"

												This game had potential but it feels unfinished. Simulating takes an insane amount of time even if you reduce the number of tournaments. You'll spend more time waiting time to flow than acutally managing your team which makes it quite a pain. Also, there are some bugs and unfinished features like the one where you can remove tournaments but the game will still load them from the menu and give an error message if you chose them. And since there is no sign of an update, I'm glad it was on sale when I bought it cause in it's curent state, it isn't worth 10 bucks.			"

												A great old school sport manager.This game will make only a small percentage of gamers happy. But it will make them really happy! Don’t play this game if you don’t like old school manager games. But if you do, you will be really satisfied with the simulation of the basketball world and most of all with the Artificial intelligence of the opponent CPU managers.The game lucks in visuals but it makes up with a huge database that includes all serious basketball action on the planet.Don’t worry about the fake names. You will easily find a patch to fix that online.			"

												This is a higly underatted game mainly cause of the bad interface graphics. If you like basketball and Football Manager series, this is what you need. Deep simulation of basketball and a huge, but huge database. You must see the Tutorial video and read the manual in order to fully understand how to play. Unfortunately the interface is not very good but after you learn how to play it is impossible to stop!I strongly reccomend this game for sport manager fans.En Español, ya que soy de Argentina, aprovechando que tenemos una buena camada de jugadores!Creo que es un juego subestimado por los gráficos, la verdad, que si te gusta el basket y la serie de Football Manager, entenderás que es normal: una gran simulación de juegos y una base de datos enorme.Recomiendo que vean el video del tutorial y el manual para entender como jugar; y si bien la interfaz no es la mejor, una vez que aprendes a jugar es dificil parar.Recomiendo el juego a los fanáticos de los juegos de manager de deportes.

												I have loved sports management games for years. Basketball ones are not common, so I was excited to try this one, and even more excited when I saw how huge and detailed its database and game world was. Unfortunately, the game is let down by some basic failings. The accuracy of the simulation is not that good, which is a problem when the game is built around numbers. My team often racks up more offensive rebounds than defensive rebounds,  and hardly any assists (which may be due to the European system).Coaching options are also irritatingly limited. Have a star player and want to give them a lead role? Have a great long-range shooter and want them to focus on those shots? You'll have to set them *every game*; there's no overall strategy screen. In a long season and want to skip some games? You can't even set a depth chart.The database is definitely praise-worthy, and being able to simulate so many leagues across the world is a fine feature. It's just a shame the rest of the game doesn't do it justice.			"

												Very nice for all manager and tycoon game fans. It has a huge database that includes all the basketball action in the world and is not focused only on NBA, which is a huge plus for me. So you can make a career in Spain, Argentina or even Korea.At first I was a little put off by the fake names in the database, but after I found the real names patch from {LINK REMOVED}http://www.wbmfan.webs.com/ the problem was solved.I have been a Football Manager fan for many years and I believe that other sport manager fans will enjoy this game, especially older players that used to play the FM series before the 2D graphic engine was added.

												This is a game for serious sports fans. If you really like basketball and/or other games in the genre such as Football Manager, then you will like this game. It doesn't offer a lot graphically, but it is very detailed as far as managing a team and using analytics to create the best team possible. It can be very difficult, but you can turn the difficulty settings down before launching the game. Buy this if you want a deeply detailed basketball management experience and don't mind that it runs pretty much like a browser game. I have a longer review available on Corrupted Cartridge.			"

												It's an ok game if you love basketball and old school sim games....I love both, and I enjoy this game, but would probably give it a 3/5.Still, a lot could be improved to make this a great game, in my opinion:The load times are incredibly long.The game gives you VERY little control unless you want to coach during the games, I, personally, would rather set up rotations, offensive/defensive settings, etc. and let a computer coach run the game. Instead, you can sim games, but you have no control at all over the depth chart, offense/defense used, etc. Like I said, I want to be the GM, but don't want to do quite s much coaching.There's not really any scouting. This would be an obvious and great addition. In signing International players it would be great to find diamonds in the rough/find overrated guys on the decline. Instead you just see their ratings, which is slightly boring, and also unrealistic.It's a good game. It's interesting trying to build teams in different countries and leagues around the world. But, it could be a great game, and, right now, it doesn't fit that bill.			"

												This game is really terrible. The only explanation I could possibly have for buying this is that I was probably drunk, fairly broke and needed a basketball simulation fix that needed attending. This game would crash every 5 minutes, but that's a good thing. The game is self-aware in that it knows it is not worth playing so it shuts itself off. "

												There's no tutorial. There's no tutorial. There's no tutorial. There's literally nothing in the game that explains what anything is, how you can use it, why you'd like to, etc. It took me a ton of clicking around just to get back to where I could look at my roster. Also a lot of windows seem to have errors where they come up completely blank. The loading time is also extremely long for what it seems to be loading. There's other odd stuff too like it encouraging you to post fairly mundane things to facebook. When you do actually get to matches there's a simulated scoreboard and some text flavor about what's going on, which is nice - you can pick who to put in for what position. It's more fun there, but could still really benefit from a tutorial. It would be nice to at least see tips pop up when you hovered over something explaining what it meant. The user interface just isn't intuitive and, to me, it feels like a lot of build up and number crunching is required for very little in the way of actual fun. It looks like there's a lot of information, and for people interested in detailed management that's probably pretty cool, but it doesn't even feel like a game as much as a tool to jot down the game - if you already know what you're doing and you've played this kind of game a lot maybe that's great, but until it has a tutorial of some sort and explanation of what you're trying to do I just can't recommend it (especially at 10 bucks.) For certain people I can see it being really engrossing, but you'll have to do your own research to figure out how to play it. I've got other games to dig into and it hasn't shown me anything to make me feel it would be worth the time to figure everything out. So if you feel like checking it out on sale (I got it for 2.50) go ahead, just know what you're getting into.			"

												The game commits the ultimate sin of being boring. It's big and deep with all sorts of players and teams from everywhere, but trying to manage things is a nightmare of fishing through screens trying to find what you need, backtracking, going forward again, etc., until you finally just want to play a different game.The match simulation is horrible. I like playing games live, and many other sims make that a fun experience. First, there was a bug that prevented live match play. I found a workaround in the forums but I shouldn't have bothered. There's just some text flashing by, a few sound effects, and little opportunity to do more than manage your lineups.There are other sims out there. Don't bother with this one.			"

												There's a lot to enjoy in this game if you're a fan of sports management sims. It does a decent job of giving you options in developing both your franchise and your players and an AI that's always competent without making you feel like the deck is stacked against you. I live in Korea and was very impressed to see a good data base for the Korean professional basketball league and assume the same attention to detail extends to other non-NBA national leagues. Don't be put off by the fictional team and player names. You can go to {LINK REMOVED}http://www.wbmfan.webs.com/ and download easily installable real name and real player image files for the NBA. The mechanics for playing individual games is modest but enjoyable and while the interface is a bit clunky and the graphics and sound are retro, none of the limitations are deal killers. While the game can't go toe-to-toe with top priced sports management sims, it's excellent value for money.			"

I have played other Tycoon games before but this is just terrible. Do not buy this ( I was a dummy and ignored the other reviewers, don't be like me). The game starts by asking you to create a game (which in itself is confusing), then it asks you to create a team or take control of an existing team -( instructions are not very clear). Once that is done, you are stuck - no direction as to what to do next, play a game, trade for players, build a facility? I tried several times and finally just gave up and uninstalled the game			"

												It's really hard to recommend this game because there is no guide to tell you what you are doing wrong. The tutorial video didn't help me at all. You can lose a game by 40 or 50 points and have no idea what you did wrong. There is no simple way to learn the mechanics of the game. If you have to do serious searching in order to find out how to play a game then that is a problem. I wanted to like this game a lot because I'm a big NBA fan but it's so difficult to even get started in this game. Its really hard to find out if what you are doing in the game is the correct. You can set up, what you think, is a really get strategy and then get blown out by 50 points. Getting to the players. This is the next biggest flaw that I have some of the players, who are based on actual players but with fake names, do not play like the real life counter parts. I played as the fake Hauston Rackets(Houston Rockets) and fake Harden didn't play like real Harden. Never drove to the goal and didn't shoot threes. Fake Parsons didn't play like real Parsons. Was terrible three point shooter and was terrible scoring inside (dunks and layups). There also seems to be no support of the game except for fan based support so that is somthing to be aware of.

												Not such a bad game. Yes, there are bugs, yes, some menus are incorrect or misplaced or the text in them is transparent and you can't read it. And so many missing things, even the most basic ones, like comparing the attributes of one of your players with another player in the world (i haven't figured out how to do that yet!). But, i like the managerial tycoon part of the game (setting ticket prices and expanding the arena) and the CORE of the gameplay, the algorithm of the match, its there, it exists, and its rather good. Still no 2D or 3D representation but only text commentary, but for me its OK, reminds me of the old times playing Football Manager 00/01. Also one good thing is that you can quit the game and save during a match, which is missing from FM for example. Also, the game is rather light with respect to system requirements, the loading and processing times are not so big (even for my low low end laptop). As other reviewers have mentioned, there exist a real names patch and a graphics patch for face picks, so don't be discouraged by the lack of licencing. I would give it a 7/10. Without doubt, a lot of work has to be done by the developers (who are Greek like me) as ti seems like an unfinished product, but the basic framework is set. If you like Basketball AND text sports sims with a flavor of tycoon elements, give it a try and be patient. For all the others, not recommended.			"

												While normally I love this sort of game - this feels hastily thrown together, and if you manage to get it working - it has some major elements missing, even once you get past the installation issues and bugs.1)  Time out functionality - that only works when there's a stoppage of play.  When you have possesion and want to stop the clock - you can't call a TO.  Pointless - why do I want to stop it, when it's already stopped?2)  Inability to slide a player when making a substitution.  If you attempt to bring in say a power forward, and slide your current PF to SF (a pretty common thing) - the fields black out.  It's not possible - you need 2 stops of play to make that move, yet the CPU teams can do it.3)  The biggest deal breaker - inability to make trades.  You can put someone up for ""transfer"" and get cash, and you can use that cash to buy players ... but you can't actually trade at all.  In a sport manager game, that's pretty much a deal breaker.

												Not much has changed since World Basketball Manager 2010 still no soul, boring menues, no depth, little better graphics but more bugs (ever tried to close the launcher? - still not possible - you have to start this awful game to close it). Hoped they have had learned their lesson. :(			"

												The developers did an awful job creating a basketball manager game that wouldnt be bearable even if it has been published 10 years ago. Most in game content is ripoff of their former titles. Icehole did deliver a very bad game.			"

												This game feels like it was created by someone who knows very little about basketball. I am a huge fan of Baseball Mogul/Football Mogul, and many other simulation sports games with this being the worst one of all. The menu system and interface is as boring as the tutorial above. The game feels very alpha and I hope the developers will make this game more functional and entertaining.			"

												I thought I knew what I was getting into after many tycoon and sports manager games, seemed like it might be worth the $10 to fool around with. Not so. It should be called Wait for Basketball Tycoon. You sit around waiting for the game to simulate more than you do anything. Menu's are clumsy at best. Way too low a resolution to get stats on your page. All in all, a nice idea and that's about it. Not worth the money.			"

												""3/10"" According to My Own Rating.Surprisingly low quality for a game this complex. And no, I'm not talking about the graphics. They're very low quality too, but this isn't the kind of game for people who care about it.Nice idea, low quality implementation.Not recommended unless you enjoy having your first experience to be: ""ExceptionWBM ENCOUNTER AN ERROR AND HAS TO CLOSE. IF YOU CAN'T CONTINUE OR LOAD YOUR SAVE TRY TO RESTORE LAST AUTOSAVE FOR THIS GAME.OK""			"

												This is without a doubt the worst game I have ever played. Calling it a game is actually disrespectful to other games. It is sort of disrespectful to nouns in general. Please do not get this. A strategic basketball sim is actually a great idea, but I have board games about Feudal Japan that capture the sport better.			"

												Could be good but won't let me actually play matches and trading is extremely difficult ruining the pure sim model.  Literally doesnt work so have to give the negative on this.  Best quality of game - inexpensive to purchase.			"

												Has anyone ever made it through a single match without the game freezing and crashing less than 10 times?Also this is NOT a classic ""tycoon"" game this is more of a sport management game and a very poor one at that with zero explanation, the worst attempt at avoiding using copyrighted names possible (I had people in my team called Jiremy since the name Jeremy is probs copyrighted by Jeremy Clarkson) and a total lack of immersion.The only blessing is I got this game during a summer sale so at least I didn't pay £7 for this.
