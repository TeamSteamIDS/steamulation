												Ignore the bad reviews if you think this game will interest you.  Its not everyone's cup of tea.  And on top of that, its severely buggy and largely unpolished.  But if you look past all that roughness, there is a true gem in here.  Not many games deliver so well on so much.  It may be one of the best PC games I've ever played.  Consider the following story as a testament to what kind of game this is:I started out an innkeeper in a large city in a large region.  I was doing okay.  I kept selling cheap food and drink in order to open a bakery nearby.  The bakery was also not much, mostly baking rolls for the masses.  But in time I was doing well financially and took some time off to pursue a love interest.The same year she was pregnant and gave birth to my first born son.  I was busy working and she spent less time at the bakery.  Soon all her time was spent between the house and the church.  Neither of us minded though.  My son was of school age and we couldn't afford much.  So we sent him to a guild school to study to join the family business.  The same year, my wife was pregnant again, but this time with a little girl.During this time I was able to afford to be a citizen and was granted the ability to expand my business.  I quickly set up an orchard and a farm outside the gates.  It was hopeful, as the supplies for both the Inn and Bakery were now completely controlled by me.By the time my daughter was of school age, we had the assets to send her to the best school possible.  My first born son, was not the most amitious child and my first born daughter had a brighter future due to our new financial situation.I had another daughter, and another son.  More of the same, I suppose, as I was too busy working at the largely successful Inn and expanding my business to fisheries and livestock.My first born son was a disappointment.  He was born when we were poor and didn't amount to much.  He mostly went to church with his mother and didn't have the skills to follow in the family business.  My first born daughter on the other hand, had the right schooling and was perfectly set up to join the family business.  My second daughter, while successful on her own terms, didn't match the success of the first daughter.  And lastly, my last born child, a boy, was quiet and simply enjoyed school.When my first born daughter came of age to help out, she did with much ambition.  While I worked the Inn, she helped with apple picking and livestock.  She was maybe a bit too ambitious as she managed the workers with the attitude of a tyrant.  But I was happy with the success of my business and I was running out of room to expand, so I turned to politics.I managed to win a low level office for a very short time before getting replaced by a man who had leprosy.  However, my daughter almost entirely transitioned my business empire away from me and was doing quite well.  So I kept at it.  I had money to spend, so I intended to use it.  I began bribing people for votes, and I managed to bribe the king himself.  But, I lost again.While my daughter ran my business, and I was unsuccessful at politics, I had little to do.  So for the most part, I rekindled my relationship with my aging wife.  Also, my character strangely had alcohol in his inventory often, and was no stranger to drinking it on the spot or offering it to others.  On a strange night, I also tried sabotaging a rival bakery by tossing an explosive in the front door.  It was a mistake and didn't do much.While I declined from power and my daughter took over, I failed to notice my last born son.  He graduated from university with a doctorate.  He was a scholar and was a full grown man ready to open his own line of business.  Upon his graduation, he quickly started a bank and hospital in town.  He worked hard, but being the business man in the family, I saw issues.  Two doors down from his bank was a rival bank.  Around the corner from his hospital, was a rival hospital.  He was happy working and keeping to himself, so I took it upon myself.  We bombed them and ran.  I went home to my wife and all was fine.  Except, it wasn't.While I was at home with my wife, my son was working late at the hospital, and my daughter was working late night at the Inn, my daughter, unfortunately lead by her father's poor example, carried out a constant barrage of attacks across the entire city for hours.  Many people died, including many of my loyal bodyguards, and several buildings were so heavily damaged they couldn't be entered for fear of collapse.The tooltip read for me - Corrupt.  My entire life I was a righteous man and in a single day I ruined a lifetime of good.  My daughter however, was labeled a walking nightmare.  A title she wore proudly as she was a violent and cruel woman.A day later I was summoned to trial for my crimes.  And shortly after, so was my daughter.  Fortunately for me, the persecuter was bad at her job and couldn't articulate my crimes well enough.  With experience, I was able to convince the judges that I was not guilty.  My daughter - the judge didn't even show and she walked free.I was done, however.  And now my entire business was in the hand's of my daughter and son.A few short years later my daughter married and had a series of daughters.  My son married and had sons.  She spent most of her time in the Inn, acting as an innocent server as she masterminded violence.  Her first born daughter stayed at home with her father, picking up the skills for crafting.My son on the other hand built up impressive charismatic skills and began spending most of his time preaching.  He opened his own Catholic church and was busy speaking to the masses.  He wasn't as interested in the hospital anymore due to issues obtaining supplies needed for medicine.  That was, however, one of the catalysts for what happened next.Illness spread across the city.  It struck the elderly for the most part.  And the political stage was swept clean.My son saw this as an opportunity to win an easy election and do some good for the city.  So he applied for a entry level political office.My first born daughter's daughter was also of age and opened up a tailoring shop.  She worked in it night and day and was militant, like her evil mother.  However, she just enjoyed working hard.  She committed no crimes and often gave bonuses to her employees to reward them for putting up with her management style.My son had only one opponent to beat for political office.  But to help seal the deal, his sister showed up and gave some bribe money to the king.  He won the vote and was now holding political office.  First it was the Leasing Officer.  Then it was the Guild Master.  Then Bishop.  Then he used his political power to help his sister and neice also win politcal offices.He had charisma and the power of the people behind him.  His sister was a brute with deep pockets.  She kept helping him win and in return, he would give her his vote when she applied.  Together, they made it to the top - Cardinal, Soverign, and my grandaughter was Consul.  Together, they took down bandits, banished rivals, carried out crime and government authority hand in hand.  All while I watched from my estate.  My children took over the city both economically and politcally.  All while in my lifetime.  Not sure if I'm proud or scared.If you made it this far, kudos for reading. "

												UPDATED ON APRIL 2, 2016: I promised to come back to this review after playing the latest official patch more, and I can report that bugs still persist.  Having said that, it is still a big improvement over the last vanilla version, and I can also recommend either Fajeth or McCoy's mods to make the game even more playable.  Both do different things, but both are fantastic.  It is my recommendation that you try both (separately - mods generally can't work together in TG2) and definitely use one of them, especially once you've played vanilla for 50 hours or so to get a grasp for the basics of the game.Onto the review: I will not belabor the point: The Guild is my favorite game.  In this review I’ll try to explain why this is, and where I’m coming from in terms of my interest in the game, and probably games generally speaking.  Hopefully this will help introduce like-minded gamers to The Guild and perhaps also steer some people, if they have different tastes, from the game.I have always enjoyed simulation games, particularly economic and life sims.  I grew up playing what now seem like fairly simplistic sims (e.g., Theme Park, The Settlers, and The Sims) and was fascinated by the seemingly living world of the AI inhabitants in these games.  As I began to enjoy role playing games more, and in particularly Ultima Online, I longed for a simulation game in which I wasn’t in complete control, but instead could actually be one of those small inhabitants in the simulated world.  Nothing like this existed until I played the first Guild game (Europa 1400) and I was immediately won over, realizing that it was as close to a perfect game as I would ever find, short of developing one myself.The Guild is indeed a simulated world.  It doesn’t attempt to be huge like Skyrim.  You are controlling a small family in a single town or on some maps a single town out of up to four.  There are up to eleven other “dynasties” (i.e. families) living in these towns, and they all go about their business without your intervention.  You are not god in this game – you are just a family existing and striving in the middle ages, and it is amazing fun.  It seems there is not one area that The Guild has left out of its gameplay.  You can get involved in politics, your character has a religiosity meter, favor (or disfavor) with every single sim in the game, a disposition based on their criminality or lack thereof, skills, perks (think fallout), marriage, children, trials, duals, and the list goes on.The world in The Guild feels more alive than any game I have played.  NPCs go about their business with a real purpose, and it is all simulated.  They will do everything from sit around town and chat, go to the pub, hire a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, to run for office and command the city guard (who, by the way, are also governed by some degree of AI logic).  In short, the game feels a lot like living in a real, functioning medieval town.In summary, if you’ve always enjoyed god games, economic sims, and life sims, but wanted to be part of the world rather than the controller of the world – wanted to have to work within the confines of human ability to influence the world (e.g., become mayor and change the law instead of using a hand in the sky to smite someone) then this is the game for you.  If you want complete control over the world and all of its inhabitants then you might not enjoy this as much, but I still say it’s worth a try.			"

												It's December 22, 2014 and a patch just got released for this 4.5 year old game. Whomever these guys are that bought this license are serious about cleaning it up, but the thing is it was already a great title to begin with. Yeah there were some translation problems, and ai issues, and general problems like that, but it wasn't terrible.Anyways, this game is just great. You play some male or female person set in old timey overseas land (you get to choose the map to play on), and try to stary a dynasty. You find a spouse, make some kids, and play through the generations. Jobs include stuff from politics, farming, to robbing people. You can make buildings like inns, pubs, churches, and so on or eleminate competing dynasties and take over their buildings through violence or cash. You can select your own stats on the dude or chick you're creating and level up skills through actions, so some rpg elements exist. You got some trading elements in here as well. Own a mine? Send a caravan of ore to the neighboring village to sell, or import the stuff to make your own jewelry factory. Or make armor and weapons and attack villagers with your bandits. You got a lot of options here on what to do as far as playstyle is concerned. It's a sandbox, but you can't just plop buildings down everywhere. Still there's a lot of options to be found and fun to be had by picking this up and giving it a shot. It can be a little daunting to get into, but I ended up having a lot of fun with this and The Guild II. Well mainly vanilla Guild II, but this is just that with more stuff, so if you can decide which version to get, this is the one to grab.			"

The Guild 2 RenaissanceThe Guild 2 Renaissance is the standalone expansion for The Guild 2, which contains all the same features of the same game and then some. Because of this, I will here review the base game along with the expansion in one review.The game is a economic strategy and production manager game, taking place in Europe the 1400s. Your goal is to build a family, a dynasty and an economic empire from scratch, starting with just a small cottage and enough money to build or buy your first little workplace, and hiring some workers. You can choose which direction you want to expand through, be it food production like farms or bakeries, ""Entertainment"" industries like churches and pubs, or maybe something seedier, like robber dens, thieves guilds or money lenders. You can even try your hand at politics! The game has a surprising amount of variation if you actually play it for more than 10 minutes. The game features beautiful music, as well as surprisingly good graphics for it's age and budget. There are however quite a few cons to this game:There are so many bugs in this game, a few of them are even gamebreaking, others are just hilarious. Most of the bugs have luckily been fixed in community made patches, and there is even a small modding community who, now and then, create a few high quality mods.The netcode is also atrocious, and i would suggest only playing multiplayer with friends who are patient and understanding of such problems. It isn't that much of a problem though, as i would say you'll have most of your fun in singleplayer anyway.The Guild 2 is, despite its many, many faults, one of my favourite games of all time, and i truly recommend it to anyone who enjoy strategic economy games, like patrician or the ""Tycoon"" games. What sets this game apart from those games, is the important fact that you only control your family and your buildings, while everything and everyone else you can see are potential allies or rivals.

												Holy Smokes. What a seriously innovative and refreshing game design. This is a serious sandbox game. And I mean GAME. Sometimes sandbox games fall in the trap of having a lackluster or tacked on set of objectives. This game brilliantly balances a free-form open style with a true game-objective win/lose strategy. ""Eliminate your competitors"" - in near anyway you choose (before they eliminate you). Granted the lack of tutorial/psudo-random tip popups to help you figure your way though this almost overwhelmingly unique game play style is a rather large barrier to entry -  but once it all clicks in (See: YouTube), this game is fulfilling and addictive. Buy a fisherman dock, fishmonger your way to riches and aristocracy, marry a young local, wander the back alley alone on a cold winter night, get attacked and poisoned by a paid thug care-of your vilest of competitors, take on the role of your young son - a devious silver spooned rogue - and enact a bloody revenge on  the murder of your former fish monger self.  It is epic.			"

Posted: January 14, 2015
												This is one of the best games I have ever played in my life, and at the same time one of the worst. How? Bugs. I am recommending this game now because it has, miraculously, been granted a new patch (which you have to set the game to beta to get through Steam, fyi) which I am hearing good things about. The old bugs, which may still exist -- I'm not sure yet -- were as follows:#1 - Multiplayer NEVER worked. Even if you connected through Hamachi (the only way to get multiplayer to even connect) the game would desync after 20 ish minutes and your saves would be corrupted so you couldn't even reload and continue. This game is so amazing for multiplayer and this is just a big kick in the gaming nuts. #2 - There are a lot of smaller game breaking bugs...too numerous to mention. I can give some examples. One time, nobody ever seemed to progress in the political field. Sometimes your characters get jammed and won't move. Sometimes you save the game and it gets corrupted and you lose everything. Just weird things that should work just...don't...and it's hard to predict and once it happens you can't just 'reload' to get around it. That being said, I have played through games that were 8+ hours long before getting screwed by one of these bugs (provided you are playing in single player).But this game is fantastic if these bugs are fixed.For one, this game is a mish mash of a bunch of different games. In this game you control your 'family' starting with one guy. It's very RPGish in the sense that each of your family members can level up and apply points to various skills. You can make them better at combat, better at working, better at politicking, etc.You can get married, have babies, and then once they grow up you can control them and expand your dynasty. The buildings you own get transfered down the generations so your hard work with your first guy isn't lost when he dies of old age (or disease, or murder, or getting thrown in jail forever). There are different sized maps but generally a map consits of one to three cities of various size. Each city has their own town hall with their own political arena. You can get elected and then move up towards mayor -- each office you can be elected into has different special powers that can be used to improve your family, or hurt others that are in your way. For example, you can banish someone from a city, or throw them in jail, or cause them to lose one of their buildings, etc. There is a court house and 'law' as well. If you witness someone comitting a crime you gain the ability to testify in court with evidence against them. If you don't like them, you can charge them with a crime and then try to beat them in court. While you can sway the courts with your political favours, the more evidence against you makes this harder so blatently breaking the law or fighting people in town is going to brand you an outlaw and probably killed by the guards or thrown in jail if you comply. There are four major classes and as you marry and have kids you can train them into different classes so that EVENTUALLY you can access every type of building in the game -- but basically, your character(s) each get to be trained in one of the four classes. One is a kind of farmer, one is a scholar that can get hospitals and such, one is a blacksmith type character that can make weapons and tools, and one is a thief that can create thieves guilds and other buildings that set up traps to rob people transporting goods.The game also has a free market and prices rise and fall depending on how much of what is being sold. In fact, if one item is sold a lot in one of the cities and not in the other, you can make money by transporting from one city to the other -- provided you have enough muscle to protect your cargo from any thieves setting up on the roads. Your houses can train guards which you can use as personal muscle, even to overpower actual city guards, or to plot assasination attempts on powerful members of opposing dynasties. The controls can be a little confusing -- there's a lot of menus you have to learn to use to be able to quickly identify who is who in the city -- but it can all be done. When you do build up your financial empire, you typically want to build one of every building and supply your buildings with your own productions. You'll get a mine, and refine the ore for your blacksmith who will make the weapons to sell or use, etc. Some routes are a lot easier to start with than others. I recall that being a farmer won't make you rich, but it's pretty easy to make money with cows. Blacksmiths are very useful but they're hard to make enough money from early on.And I was never good with thieves, but they can be very powerful later on by preventing other players from trading and leaving all the profit to your dynasty only. The game is very deep and for that reason you can get lost playing this game for days. In all honesty, if this game had fixed all of its bugs I would have ranked it one of the best games I've ever played. I am hopeful that this patch has fixed a lot of the bugs and if that's so, I'll probably leave this recommendation as positive. Otherwise, I'll probably remove it or make it negative. Stay tuned!This is a fantastic sandbox game and really unique.			"

												If you enjoy management, simulation, and RPG games, good... This game is all three of those rolled up into a fat burrito.The problem with this delicous and savory burrito, however, is that every once in a while you will bite into a squirmy little bug. Some of these bugs don't taste that bad, and the burrito is tasty, so you hammer down and continue eating. Untill you find a ugly nasty bug that makes your drop your burrito (straight to your desktop (wink)).  But ""darn it"", you will say, ""this burrito has so much potential for fun! I'll presevere through these bugs. Heck, I think I'll share it with a friend!""And you do, you share it with your friend. The burrito tastes even better with a friend (or even multiple friends). Everyone will have fun and enjoy it, but eventually, you may bite into a bug so gross, that it will make you forget where you were eating the burrito so you'll have to start over from the beginning... which, after eating that burrito for a while, doesn't sound as appetizing. Ultimately, this burrito is a wonderful burrito, with much thought and care put into. The burrito allows for you to eat it in whatever way you see fit.  You can find yourself eating this burrito for hours, trying to find the best way to consume the delicous ingrediants. The bugs, and perhaps some uncooked peices of chicken (trade routes), can make it a little harder to swallow.If this burrito is on sale and you are interested, purchase it and eat it. If not, maybe save your money for Burrito 3 (due in 2017). "

It is an older game and the graphics and AI are not the most up to date. 9/10 stars1. Very complex sandbox game that can be played endlessly2. LAN very fun and more stable with latest update3. Stll some bugs. 4. Def worth buyingAdded an extra star after the game got updated again! the bugs for LAN playing with friends are greatly reduced! As well as some of the single player bugs!			"

												""I look out the window and its just THE SUN"" - My friend speaking about ""Sun Up Glid""The Guild 2 is a buggy mess. It has many quirks, bad performance, can crash a lot on some PC's, and multiplayer suffers from irrepairable out of sync errors that can trash a save (there have been some reports of being able to work around this, I have never bothered to try to fix these OOS errors.)But by god, this game is oddly fun with friends.Get a good friend, a couple friends maybe, and host a game of The Glid Poo. If you don't take it too seriously and stick together you can have some of the grandest times ever. My adventures include building 2 banks right next to eachother, learn banking doesn't work and requiring 200 dollar payments from my friend for 2 hours while I went around trying to commit murder. Another time me and a friend amassed a small army of 40-50 guys and destroyed a bakery so I could build another foundry in its place. One of the best times was when my good buddy ended up building 3 fortresses so he could have a death squad to kill every person in the political ladder and become the mayor, and I piggybacked along to become immune to the law.Theres nothing quite like amassing a fortune by pick pocketing, building a ton of daggers and then hearing ""YOU HAVE BEEN ACCUSED"", presumably because you sent ""Smellvios"" to go try and beat up a guard, only to be bailed out because your friend sent 20 mercenaries and thieves after the accusor and then blew up his house. Whether you're monopolizing the skull candle market or seeing if you can take on a peasant out in the countryside, this game provides an unexplainably entertaining experience when you play with a good friend. The absurd stuff that you can do, or that can just happen on its own on top of a fairly good economics tycoon sorta game (if pretty buggy) can result in very memorable adventures to lament on with a friend when you're both on your rocking chairs watching the sun go down 60 years down the line.Get it, get a friend, get some food and snacks and prepare for ""sun up glid""			"

												This is the one you want, not the original.This stand-alone expansion originated as a fan-made overhaul mod for the original game. What results is the same game you get with The Guild 2, only polished much further and with many new additions. If you visit the Rune Forge forums, you'll see that they are still releasing patches (as mods, silly enough) even though the publisher has ended dev support. The community is also still active, with new posts on the forums each day.I'm not trying to say that this game is the best thing ever, but it is definitely the only of it's kind. If you appreciate economics, history, sociology, politics, and the like, and you're looking for a somewhat casual strategy game, you should consider this game among the others on your list. If you're thinking of this as a medieval sims-type game or that you will be able to jump right in and start playing, you're going to be disappointed. This is a thinking man's game, and gamers who aren't willing to put up with bugs and take the required hours needed to fully understand the game will be wasting their money. I'm not saying only serious master-race strategy gamers can appreciate this game, or that people who don't like complicated games have bad taste or are dumb; I just think that the way the game is marketed makes it appear to be much more simple than it really is, and that results in a lot of bad reviews that shouldn't have been reviews to begin with.

												Guild 2 Renaissance is unique in its time, like all other Guild series. It's actually quite complicated but it will hook you for very long hours once you know all the commands and actions. You are born into one of the four classes namely Patron, Scholar, Rogue and Craftsman. Each class is special and has unique abilities.If you choose Craftsman, your job is to make things out of raw materials and sell them to earn a living. If you are a Rogue, you can rob, waylay or kill a person for money or infamy. However, you can be sent to court and get hanged if found guilty. You are not alone in your line of work. You can also hire workers or goons to assist you. As you perform your job, you gain money and your reputation grows. With both, you seek to buy bigger homes and increase your social status until you reach the pinnacle! You can get married, have lots of kids, and when you die, you take over your kids' roles. Along the way, you will encounter resistance from other noble families. There are many ways to get rid of them, of course...There are many scenarios to choose from and there's multiplayer function! I have yet to encounter major bugs but the graphics is a bit outdated but still acceptable. I just couldn't get bored with this game. The only way I stop playing this is when other games beckon me to play them.Overall, I give this game a 115% satisfaction for its complexity and fun!			"

												This is an interesting game that has a LOT of pros and cons. I'll start off with the problems with the game: The game tends to run poorly and you will not be getting the FPS you might expect, there is a LOT of bugs that was not addressed in offical patches, and it is a very difficult game to just pick up and play. There is no ""instant"" action like you might desire, as the game takes awhile to get going. The pros however are a deeply complex system that allows you to run for offices (Dungeon master, mayor, bishop, etc) and each of those offices have fun little perks. Are you the dungeon master and someone is running for your office? Off to the dungeon for a ""talk""...aww, he didn't make it to the council meeting? Guess you win by default! A lot of the bugs can be addressed with the fan patch 4.17B (as of this writing) and there is a ton of other fan patches that address several of the games fault. IF you are willing to put in the time the game can be a very fun, deep, and rewarding game.			"

												Don't buy the whole pack, you only need this one. According to all I've heard. Renaissance is the most complete and patched version of The Guild 2 and it's all you need. It's also recommended you find the latest UNofficial patch, since Steam only has up to version 4.15 which is years old. Apparently the people who made the game weren't allowed to officially fix the thing after awhile. Jowood kind of sucks for support eh?As for the game itself ... I've put about 31 hours into playing this game, and I'm not sure why. I really like the concept, but the design and implementation is mostly just baffling. It sits somewhere between economic simulators like Dawn of Discovery / ANNO 1400, and personal management sims like The Sims. However I don't think it's a good game in either sense; it needs vastly more depth on either the economy-sim side, the war-sim side, or the Sim-side, and as this is a complete game with no mod-support to speak of, that depth is never going to happen. My experience with it is started out just being unintuitive, but I stuck with it. Tens of hours later, now that I know how the game works and am able to pretty much 'win' at it, I just don't LIKE it. It's a lot of work for barely any satisfaction.			"

												The Guild II Renaissance is a game that is most fundamentally about money management. You use your funds to build a number of production facilities - everything from your basic farm to buildings producing high end equipment, armor and artifacts for trade or use. In addition to a typical strategic ""god view"" you control 3 individual characters. You can engage in a variety of activities with these characters like having them run for office, enage in special actions with the buildings they own like goading the workers into action, and so forth. The game starts off amazingly. It's great fun when you first start out and you can effectively micromanage all of your production facilities. Unfortunately, the game begins to fall apart once you reach the point where micromanagement becomes impractical if not impossible. The game provides a number of ways to try to automate your buildings but they are extremely bare bones, and very buggy even given that.For instance, imagine you would like to simply take a product that one facility produces and bring it over to another facility that uses it as a resource, like bringing grain to a mill to turn into flour. The game allows you to setup an ""automatic trading route"" to do exactly this, but what is offered provides marginal functionality and does not work as intended. You can't supply ""up to"" an amount or anything of the like. You can do nothing except constantly send goods with one of three choices in terms of frequency: ""rarely, occasionally, constantly."" What do these mean you ask? I have no idea, the game in no way tells you. The sparse 12 page manual dedicates two sentences to the topic:6.4 AUTOMATIC TRADING ROUTES You can now set automatic routes for your wagons. You can choose single waypoints for your routes and decide what to carry.And even once you do get a trade route setup your transport wagons will occasionally just completely stop working in random locations. It's not for lack of a quantity of resources, or lack of desire at their destination. It's just a bug. Setting the routes up is an arduous process that you'll find yourself doing over and over again for the same route. The other method to deal with an inability to micromanage is to completely automate a facility. This is much more functional, however it is once again incredibly bare bones and restrictive. In particular there is no way to have your own facilities provide their resources to one another. Instead your resource providing factories will sell all of their production to the market. Assuming the transport wagons for your factories that need those resources can beat the AI to the market, they will then purchase them there, losing a substantial amount of money in the process. In a game that is entirely about money and resource management this is incredibly frustrating.There are also numerous other bugs in the game related to most of every action. You and your betrothed set out on your lengthy journey to the chapel to happily get married. Three quarters of the way there she decides, ""You know. I actually think I'm going to go engage in church services on the other side of the world first. Bye!"" Or you'd like to bribe the mayor of your town. You send your character, who can run substantially faster than the mayor to do this. Your character will catch up to the mayor and then begin to slow down to engage in the bribe action. The mayor will ignore this and continue walking, your character will catch up and again slow down. The process will repeat indefinitely until the mayor decides to finally stop somewhere, often many hours later.In general, I cannot recommend this game. It had great potential. I thoroughly enjoyed the beginning of the game, but the middle and endgame completely fall off. However, the company behind the game has been updating this version, presumably due to the imminent release of the Guild 3. This review has been based upon Version 4.2 with the hot-fix applied.			"

												The Guild II Renaissance is a game that really can't be compared to many other games. It is truly something quite unique. A fair warning early on in this review, though, is that the game is ridden with bugs that affect gameplay in a variety of ways and the game itself is no longer supported by its creator, meaning official patches will no longer be released and the patch community is devised of the player base, and that is it.Don't let that daunting news discourage you, though! There's a reason why I recommend this game in stead of calling it a flop not worthy of even having a price tag upon it.There are two particular patches located within the series of tubes that patch from 4.10 to 4.15, and 4.15 to 4.17b (a beta patch well-worth getting), of which make the normally buggy and slightly aggravating game of The Guild II Renaissance something to flaunt when it rests in your game arsenal. It fixes more than just a few bugs and adds some minor content that aids in making the currounding environment in-game more adaptive to your playstyle. Also, on another note, internet servers no longer exist to my knowledge and the game must be run through a LAN set-up if you wish to play multiplayer, for instance with Hamachi. Yes yes, LAN can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥at times, but I have found that a multiplayer LAN session with friends I know all playing this game together is an event we have actually tried to plan doing once every week. It is that good.Now to game specifics. The Guild II Renaissance allows you to play as a few starting professions ranging from Scholar, Rogue, Patron and Craftsman. Your main character will play as this role and each role gives you a particular set of buildings you may construct to further build your little 'empire', or more-so your family legacy, and with each building comes two upgrades that subsequently get more expensive, but also carry better bonuses like more employee slots and upgraded security factors i.e. water buckets to put out fires faster if your building happens to catch fire, and iron bars to make a robbery take much more time to complete. At the time of main character creation as well, you are given the opportunity to set some traits higher than others with a few extra trait points and to choose an astrological symbol that gives you a bonus in a particular trait that is associated with the symbol. You may also choose to be Catholic or Protestant, which can also be changes if your local church offers baptising in the 'opposite' religion. Now off the topic of your main character and on to the other little bits. As I mentioned earlier, you start off with your main character. One can not simply live forever, in theory, correct? Correct! Your character (male or female) must find a partner before his/her years start to come to an end! Together, yee' will conduct holy (or on-the-spot) matrimony and have highly censored sex until a baby pops out the following year. Marrying another character will put that character under your control and will further increase your 'man-power' in the ultimate climb to power. You are also given the opportunity to send your child to a couple schools, one being fairly expensive but also giving him/her more trait points to allocate once he/she becomes of age, and the cheaper one which offers stock trait point accrual.There is so little time to explain all this game has to offer, but if the information I have given you so far doesn't pique your interest more than a little bit, this game is definitely not for you. If it does, however, I -HIGHLY- recommend purchasing it and letting your friends know about it as well! You can have up to 12 player and NPC factions active in one session, so ultimately, you can have 12 players playing at the same time! Of course, the more players you add, the stronger the connection will need to be, for the game can crash. Advice on this issue I can offer is to always save your game if you feel like you have made a noteworthy accomplishment.  "

												It's a pretty enjoyable experience though i tend to play exclusively in dynasty mode. The only thing that can be a bit frustrating is the black death which because the churches are always low on medicine makes it a high likelyhood of death for your character should you contract it. you can micro manage if you prefer or you can set up trade routes and assign escorts to high value deliveries or even set certain buildings to be managed by the AI. The graphics while mediocre don't really detract from the game too much. "

												This review is for version 4.211This was close to being a recommend in spite of the myriads of bugs and the overall clunky feel of the game. The concept is great and this game can be fun enough to overlook the amatuerish production of this game. It is esentially a medeival business simulation that is all about dynasty building. There is a little bit of Sim stuff put in the game as well. You build your wealth by creating business and buying property which produces more wealth. You gain power and prestige by participating in a political system (run for office, support a war, throw a feast, etc). Have fueds with other dynasties and seek to eliminate the competition. There are duels for honor and court cases for justice. And watch your starting town turn into a viberant city and become the main hauncho.There's a diverse choice of classes from the patron (food producers and service providers), craftsmen (construction materials and smithery services), scholars (who run the churches, banks, and alchemy shops), and rogues (who run the shadier operations). Within the classes are more diverse paths that could be taken that mostly deals with the kind of businesses you own.There's a potential for countless hours of fun to be had enough to even forgive most of the bugs and the clunkiness of it if you are patient enough. That is until you run into problems with corrupt saves that will crash to desktop, meaning a lot of lost progress. I'm certain that it's due to improper exception handling in this game. The game will run into problems where exceptions are thrown and there are no instructions in how to handle those exceptions. In those cases, where the game does not know what to do, the game will simply shut down and Windows will close the game (so you ""crash to destop""). There should've at the least been generic exception handling instructions that allowed the game to recover from any thrown exception not covered from whatever exception handling they did put in the game. Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be the case, so saves eventually get corrupted with unrecoverable exceptions. This is really just evidence of the ineptness of the programming team that programmed this game and the insufficient coding behind the game. It gets to the point where it feel like it's not worth playing anymore. This is what is becomming the deal breaker for me.It is this reason why I can't in good conscience recommend it. If you have a real hankering for a decent business simulation, and have a good deal of patience, this game is a good deal of fun. Save often and keep a liberal amount of backup saves, or you'll have a very frustrating experience. Otherwise, it may not be worth the frustration.			"

												Interesing mix of an economic, political, business, and social simulation with rpg elements. Something like the love child of the Sims and Anno 1602. The depth of each facet is at the perfect spot to feel in control of each one but also be able to balance all of them together as well.  The steam version updates to a pretty glitchy version, but a patch is available on the web to fix the most annoying bugs but still buggy enough to be frustrating (for instance the Banking line of buildings are still completely broken).  All in all 7/10, probably not for you if you dislike simulation games, but it does have a more gradual learning curve than other games in the simulation genre for those with a passing interest in simulations that aren't too far in-depth.

												Steam Curator Profile: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/25438273-♥♥♥♥♥♥-Frog-Memes/Firstly I would like to say that I probably have around 100+ more hours logged offline (on the original cd-rom) not listed on Steam. The Guild II Renaissance is a sort of city builder/RPG where you play through any three of your chosen family members. Upon entering the game and choosing your characters looks, stats and class, you will start with nothing more than a hut and a sum of money which varies depending on difficulty. Your objective in this game is to ensure that your family survives against a host of other families. To survive in the harsh medieval world of the The Guild II Renaissance you first need to start a business which is limited to a few choices depending on what class you chose. With a business you are able to generate revenue which may help you run for a political position, get married, send your children to school or build additional businesses. You continue this trend until you outlive all other dynasties. Note: I could ramble on and on about the various components of the game but I chose to simplify it for the sake of length.Another thing about this game is that it is great with multiplayer, (however official servers have been shut down so you'll have to use software such as Hamachi, Tuungle or Evolve). My friends and I have spent many hours on this game fire bombing each other's huts, kidnapping each other's wives, or fighting to the death via fists in the streets. This game does have a host of issues, being that it is a quite old game.- Multiplayer worlds will crash without notice and at random increments (save often). - Characters can get permanently stuck in one spot, doomed to die there.- Carts (carries shop goods) will spin around for no good reason and will spin forever unless you command them.- The intro video will sometimes not appear and just audio will play (this does not crash the game)....and more!tl;dr: I think this game has great potential despite the bugs that it has. This review simplifies many facets of the game, but I encourage you to try it yourself. The game is often around 90% off ($1) and I recommend you purchase it then.Edit: I had forgotten (a rather important) unfortunate part of this game. Gameplay is rather unintuitive and if there is demand for me to write a comprehensive guide for this game, I will.			"

												TL:DR; Steep Learning curve. Old Graphics. Buggy Mess. One of my favorite games. So I want to start off by saying if you're interested buy this version of the game and only this game. This is a stand alone game, and it is the most up to date - bug-free version. Also, getting the MegaMod pack doesn't hurt either, adds a lot to the game and fixes a bunch of bugs. It took me 4-5 times on separate occassions to get into this game. Until I finally found my stride and went deep in, and man I feel like I was missing out. If you've ever played Civilization games you know the term 'one more turn' - well this game gives you exactly that same feeling. Top Pros: VERY economy based - Ever played Runescape or Eve Online? If you ever enjoyed how authentic the economy was then you should have an appreciation for this game. The economy is authentic by AI & you, there is real supply and demand, and the AI naturally imports and exports from city to city. Your business decisions will depend on local supply & competition. Family based - Much like CK this is a family dynasty game - not a city or statist game. You will find your wife/husband, live and die, then subsequently control your family as you desire (up to 3 can actively be controlled) Politics - Politics are hard to get into and can be a bit too shallow in places but deep in others. You can try to gain favor of your fellow towns people, and get high enough social stats and take public offices - and then use your public office to not only make more income but to destroy your competition. Trying to get my dynasty to control the city has been a blast. Court System - You can bring other people up to charges on various crimes, or be brought to court by others (very common place if you play a rogue. The dialogue is pretty lackluster, but it gives a good incentive to play politician so that you have a naturally high favor of the courts - else you'll suffer the fat of my first rogue and go to jail for 5 years. Spy System - You can hire thugs to spy on your competition for evidence of your competitors then use that evidence to black mail them or bring them to trial. You can also have them firebomb their buildings, although if they catch you - you can suffer through the courts. Very fun system. Family Class - When you start you pick one of 4 classes. Patron (food & inns), Crafting (mining & crafting various equipment and jewlry), Scholar (Churches, Hospitals & crazy magical artifact making), or Rogue (Theving, Whoring, Pirating, & Plundering). For your first time I'd say Patron or Crafting is best.Multiplayer - I haven't played it but I feel like I need to mention the fact that this game does have multiplayer similar to the single player. This setup seems to be MADE for drinking games with the buddies.Top Cons: Long Tutorial, and still not enough  - Watch some vids online as well if you have the time. I liked this guy:

Social aspect is very shallow - If you optomize it correctly it takes about a day to court to marry someone. The depth really goes as far as telling the person to follow you and every couple of hours clicking on a random social interaction as cool downs go. The social aspect of other villagers are also similarly shallow, though you get a few more options through politics & items.Badly Optimized - Likely due to the fact that you're running a similation of hundreds of people, businesses & local economies, the game can run pretty badly. Luckily Guild 3 seems to be fixing that issue, Guild 2 wont run well. Bugs - So many bugs in this game, though a whole lot has been fixed with a recent patch (update to latest game) and mods. Be aware you'll have a lot of non-game breaking bugs and a few game breaking ones here and there. Depth - Mentioned in the pros section, there is a lot of sections that are so shallow in certain aspects. Social, politics, & court has such potential. Bad UI - Hard to explain but there are certain quirks to the UI that are difficult to work around. When you're running dozens of businesses there is no real way to manage the trade routes without memorizing them or following them. The business management on the right can't be customized or rearranged - very inconvenient when you have to scroll up several businesses in order to just send a cart to the market. This may be my biggest personal Con. Family Management - Having to due with the Bad UI, the family management system is pretty bad. You can only control 3 people at once but if you don't control people they don't live their own lives to my knowledge.. So you have to switch them out if you remotely care about your virtual children.. Simply put - this game is for people who are looking for a game that scratches a certain itch. For me it I've been looking for a solid realistic business game, for others it may be a local political simulator, for others it may be a dynasty game. If you think this game will scratch it and you have a solid day to dedicate to learning a new game. Give this a buy. Just curious about this game, give it a buy!			"

												Started as a rogue and proceeded to create a crime family built on pickpockets and gambling.Day 2 got accused of crimes so I killed the person accusing me so court got canceled, thus initiating a feud between our dynasties forever.Kept being brought to court by that family so I kept killing the accuser/paying off the court.Decided to get married and gave a kid at 60 after my first family went missing and I didn't pay the kidnappers their money.2nd GenerationPut dad on the streets to pickpocket and earn his keep.That other stupid family keeps trying to arrest me so I have them killed. Defintion of insantity much? Whatever.So seems that family is in the government and can control the guards now, crap. Should have done that myself.. Oh well have close to 50 thieves/mercenaries anyways. Got convicted and sentenced to death even with paying off court, seems the other family was in charge of the courts too, maybe I should have paid more attention. Decided to not go down without a fight and brought all my men to the townhall and waited for trial to be over. As everyone exited I unleashed my small army triggering all the town guards to come running to aid of their masters.The whole of government is dead, with them the entire guard, the entire other family, my main male character and wife and only left with 2 thieves and an orphaned child who hasn't even gone to school yet.11/10 would become a crime family again and destroy town just because other family is a pile of ♥♥♥♥♥♥s.

												My story:Life in our little town was relatively peaceful and slow going.  My wife and I started some small business and supply lines and slowly worked our way up the social ladder. We made our fair share of enemies along the way, due to no fault of our own other than our slowly growing success and monopolizing of the business estates in town. Along the way we had our son ""Ordo.""  Ordo wasn't a particularly special boy.  His schooling was poor due to our lack of funds and title at the time, but he did his best and eventually grew old enough to be handed the reigns of a small bakery.Ordo had a bit of a problem though...he was very clumsy.At the age of 26, while courting his wife, he sprained his ankle on 2 separate occasions while strolling through the town with her, requiring medical intervention each time. Fortunately he never lost her favor (possible due to his wealthy family and her lower class...) and ultimately married her.Then on the night of their wedding, while consumating their marriage and trying for a child, somehow Ordo managed to break a bone. The problem was that there wasn't any medical facility of a high enough level in town to heal his wound. So Ordo, after breaking a bone while boning, shortly after midnight in the middle of winter... had to make the grueling trudge to the big city on the other side of the map to try to see an experienced Dr. He nearly made it... but unfortunately succumbed to his wounds just outside of the hospital.Luckily enough those few hours of marriage resulted in a beautiful baby girl who grew up and went on to college becoming a schollar and a doctor. When she came of age, she built a great hospital in our small little town so no one would ever have to die boning again and no more children would be left fatherless.9/10 would experience awkward deaths again.

												** This would be the perfect game if the bugs were fixed and the automation of production was more reliable. This is a great economic, criminal, clan warfare, sink or swim, castle building, cut throat game except the buggyness that plagues it. If any decent game production company acquired the rights to this game and made a sincere sequel, it would sell like hot cakes, it would be YUUUUUUUUGE. Make games great again! **			"

												My main character started as a humble, struggling tea merchant.Within 30 years he was the head of the most feared and ruthless international crime family in Northern Europe.He and his sons and daughters now control 2/3 of the political system and have murdered/bribed/defamed so many people that they don't even have 'opponents' anymore, they also now have a permanent staff of hired thugs that wait at the church doors every Sunday to greet anyone who has spoken a word against them. They have lost track of how many trials against them have fallen apart because the accuser has 'disappeared.' This game went from 'Sims: open for business' to 'Gangs of New York' real quick.10/10 would murder all of my political/economic/personal opponents again.			"

												You have probably not played a game quite like this one. For me it was a middle ages scum bag simulator. I was a real piece of work. I had pick pockets working the market, robbers stealing from carts, and married a woman who was a scholar and made potions and items from my ill gotten gains to help her rise up to the level of magistrate and would grant my criminal self a pass whenever a good citizen charged me with murder, robbery, extortion, arson, or general skull duggery.This game is a bit dated but the idea of this game and what they did with it, is amazing. They are making a Guild 3 and I imagine it will absolutely blow me away. If you want to get a feel for what it is like to live, love, and die in the middle ages this is the game for you.			"

												The Guild II: Renaissance (PC) - REVIEWAn honest day’s work no less. God bless.Welcome to The Guild II: Renaissance, a game developed by Rune Forge and published by Nordic Games in July 2010. The Guild II: Renaissance is one of, if not the best merchant simulators on the market. Don’t be fooled into thinking this is a review for The Guild II. No, no, no. This is a review for the vastly superior The Guild II: Renaissance. A game where you take the role of a single man (or woman), with only a dream and 2000 gold to start a dynasty that will either be remembered as a respected political family, or a dastardly crime syndicate. All while trying to battle through the technical glitches and game breaking bugs.In The Guild II: Renaissance the aim of the game is quite difficult to explain. The main objective of each game is to wipe out enemy dynasties; however the game is a lot more complicated than that. You have many ways you can wipe out your enemy dynasties, either by death or by reducing their assets to nothing. The way in which this is completed depends on the character class you choose at the beginning of the game. Are you a horribly evil rogue that preys on delivery wagons in order to feed your desire for gold? Or are you a legitimate business owner, trying to make an honest living? Whatever class you decide to choose you won’t be disappointed with the range of content each class has to offer. I found that the easiest class to start out with was in fact the rogue. I could simply assign my gluttonous henchmen into patrol routes where they were automatically pillage any wagon carts that would dare pass my Bandit Lair. In doing this I avoided the micromanaging that The Guild II: Renaissance has to offer. When micromanaging in a Patron or Craftsman role you can use the games auto managing feature. Be warned; this function inside the game is painstakingly awful to use. You will often find businesses not producing anything at all, or buying too much♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and not putting it to good use. Causing you to lose the game if you’re not paying attention. But hey, did I mention you can marry folk’ and give birth to children that will take over your dynasty once you die?! This is without a doubt one of the best features in The Guild II: Renaissance and is how dynasties prolong their lifespan when your original character meets their eventual demise. Each character has their own levels and sets of skills. When you produce children they will inherit skills from both the mother and the father. This makes the games skills and levelling system actually have meaning and a useful purpose. Having such a rich and deep system in a trading simulation game is quiet the feat to have. Another absolutely great feature layered into The Guild II: Renaissance is the ability to climb the political ladder. Each rank in the political ladder comes with special commands that only a person with a certain political prestige can use. For example - the mayor can set the laws in a town while a guard captain has full control over units in the city. Nobody can be trusted in politics, to climb this political ladder you must bribe, assassinate and lie your way up the ranks in order to gain approval by higher ranked council members. Honestly, this is just a great system that I’ve never seen used in a game like this before.In the midst of this great gameplay we stumble across the major problems that The Guild II: Renaissance has growing out of it’s almost too good to be true gameplay. To start this off, the game is a technical mess.  As mentioned before the automatic management of business will only work when it decides to, this alienates a large portion of players that may not want to mess around with the micro-managing, especially if you have 12 banks in 3 different cities. Not to mention this game is littered with game breaking bugs that will crash your game with no warning or notice at all, so you will be expected to save often. Dialogue cut scenes don’t add anything to the gameplay except be incredibly annoying due to the lack of a ‘SKIP CUTSCENE’ button. Often at times you will hear random sounds that just have no place in a cut scene however they just keep playing over, and over again. The multiplayer would have been great to play but it just doesn’t ♥♥♥♥ing work, which is a damn shame considering the potential it could have brought the genre.In short The Guild II: Renaissance is a fun game to be had if you can look past its technical flaws and occasionally bad game design. The maps are great and diverse, and the stories that can be told in this game are endless. Design choices are questionable however the game breaking glitches and bugs are inexcusable. I will be looking forward for The Guild III which is set to be released sometime next year (2016) by Nordic Games. My hopes for the game are that it gives us everything The Guild II: Renaissance had but improves on the visual aspects, while keeping it updated and free from any technical atrocities that this this game suffered from.+ Innovative gameplay+Great dynasty system+Every play through is different-Lack of proper multiplayer -Game breaking glitches and bugs-Bad visuals and animations			"

												Its a great game that has elements of RPG, simulation, economy and lots of strategy. You can play as an out right criminal or try and be a legal businessman or women. You can play with all out force to elimanate your rivals or go a different route by building a economic power thru business and politics. But even then your rivals must be elimanated thru legal or illegal ways. Duels, false evidence or even real evidence and or bribes and blackmail. There are so many ways to play the game its hard not to find a gameplay that you like if you have decided to even look at these reviews.Now with that said. If you decide to play there are a few must haves. Base game from steam. 2 patches, one from steam 4.21 or 4.211. Get 4.21 via steam and 4.211 from   http://www.theguild3.info/filebase/file/27-the-guild-2-renaissance-patch/. I usually get both from that site. After that its highly suggested to go with either legacy or megamod. They are highly suggested to get rid of the bugs that occur with base game. If your not use to them its very easy and worth the few moments it takes to read on how to install. Even thou that the game was released in 2010 these 2 mods are being updated and even listen to and or add reasonable suggestions by us players.If you are still on fence I would suggest to look at some videos on youtube. If still on the fence follow and wait for discount. If you feel the graphics are not to power of the current games, the possibilities far out weigh that. If I havent sold you on this game yet follow The Guild 3, Its currently being developed and from what I can see is farther along then many of the betas and early access games that I have tried or looked at. And they havent done that because they looking to release a solid game. And may be the game you are looking for.....cheers			"

												This game is fun only if you have the patches and some mods. if you dont have the patches it will run  fine just crash a little more. I would recommend this game to friends as I have been playing The guild 2 when it first came out and I had the actual hard copy of the game. Now I bought this one and it's way better than the guild 2 so If i were you I would buy this one over the guild 2.P.s. this one just has a few things added to it.			"

												Ridden with bugs and the game is just generally clunky BUT.I got a lot of enjoyment out of this, especially when playing with a friend and combining our efforts to sieze total control of the Hansa, the centre of trade for all of Eastern Europe, through political power moves and economic sabotage. But even yr multiplayer has been taken offline, so you'll have to use a LAN. This game is good, despite the developers having left if for the crows.So, recommended if you're willing to put up with a bit of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ If not, I admire your self respect but this game isn't for you			"

												In the interest of being as helpful as possible in explaining what youre getting into with this title, I'll first try and explain why you might want to play this game in despite of the bugs and poorly fleshed out gameplay mechanics... The guild II Renaissance is absolutely worth playing if you're the kind of person who's seen everything the genre offers and is looking for something new. The way this game handles strategy feels very unique. Yes on the surface its a business management/tycoon style game but this is a game where you also get to throw the legal system at your opponent which was something that I found to be pretty awesome. So in addition to your standard 'right click' to attack commands, you also can also instruct your goons to follow anyone and see if you can witness them comitting a crime so as to take them to court and force them into one of a varriety of punishments...The various classes you can play in this game play out very differently which is also somewhat of a small saving grace. The patron handles food production and the survice industry while the craftsman can do production of more valuable finished goods as a focus. The rogue and the scholar however are very different. The rogue can perform extortion, rob from merchant shipments, pickpocket, and all manner of general thuggery. The scholar can build churches and banks etc and are particularly good at handling court proceedings.You can run for various offices in government, each giving you unique powers you can use to mess with your oponents. You also need to find a wife and have kids to ensure your dynasty stays healthy. The game simulates courting your would-be wife as well... which just adds to the depth.So having said all that, yes its a buggy game. I havent seen a game breaking bug yet though, the game just sort of feels unpolished in a software sense sometimes. In addition to that, its definitely unpolished in the character animation sense... Sometimes the animation is good and sometimes its ""WOW how did that not get fixed"" bad.I also said that its true that the gameplay mechanics sometimes feel a bit overly simplified... I want to be clear here, this game is very broad in its offerings but I think due to that, some of those offerings seem a bit minimal. Take courting a potential wife for example: Your options after you single someone out for courting are: Compliment, Gift, Hug, Beguile and Kiss and with the exception of 'gift' they all do basically the same thing unless youve used the same command recently, so effectively the challenge is to remember the last thing you did until she falls in love with you.... (Man, if only! Am I right guys?)Take the court system. Awesome idea, very fun, even though it too is simple. Essentially while your skills play a big part, all you can do in court is present your evidence and recommend a suitable punishment. So there could have been a whole lot more done with this but it does serve its purpose in basic function.I should also mention that I jumped into this game for the first time just recently and I found that it plays quite well for an old title, I'd say its aged well given that I was way off in my guess as to how old it was.For anyone looking for similar games, I'd strongly suggest checking out Partrician 3 or 4 - as well as Railroad Tycoon 3 specifically for interesting strategic mechanics... I dont want to get off on a tangent here but in RT3 you can buy a bunch of your competetor's company stock and then sell some to trigger a stock devaluation and then make an offer to purchase the company outright (purchase price based on outstanding share value) so as to get a massive discount on the company merger costs. It is not too often you see games like these. Pick em up!TLDR: There's a ton of interesting and unique things you can do to mess with people in this game if you can handle a game thats rough enough around the edges to earn it trash reviews.			"

The Guild II: RenaissanceI am ashamed to admit that I am only now discovering this gem of a game.Pros:Strategy, adventure, role playing & political intrigue all in one!Incredible replay valueAlmost too many options and paths to choose fromCons:Downright evil learning curveA micromanaging nightmareLots of minor bugsIf I were to compare this game to others, I'd say it's a combination of 'The Sims Medieval' and 'Stronghold' which results into a wonderfully complex strategic medieval life simulator. You can choose to begin as a humble farmer, a dashing rogue, a dedicated craftsman or a studious scholar. And that's just your day job! You can become involved in politics if you so choose and possibly, with enough effort invested, becoming a member of the ruling class.All of the above, and more... if you have the patience and determination to learn how the game actually works. There is a tutorial provided, but it's unfortunately lacking in content. Weather it deliberately leaves out so much so we can discover fun little actions ourselves, I don't know, but you will spend a good hour learning how to actually play the game even after playing through the tutorial.I'd like to have had more character customization. Unlike 'The Sims Medieval' your individual avatar is quite limited in appearance. I can understand this considering your initial character is going to be among the first to die; leaving you with his offspring and offspring of their own to continue building your empire. When it comes to your dynasty, as it grows in size and scope, it becomes a micromanaging nightmare. There is an AI option for your businesses, but I find it to be less than satisfactory; which results in me having to run each and every establishment I own. It rapidly gets obnoxiously tedious.There are still quite a few bugs present but none of them, in my experience, seem to be game breaking. They are, at worst, an annoyance. Overall there are a few things I would have like to have been different (character customization for one), but for the price this game is an absolute steal.  "

												Most people will not give this game the time needed to really appreciate it. The games official genre is a 'historic economy simulation' but there are so many other things that can be done...Basically you pick a class (Patron, Scholar, Rogue or Craftsman), each class has its own line of goods it can produce - the twist being that most products rely on a good or component from another's class to complete its higher end goods (ex; Armorers need cow hides from Patrons to complete leather armor; Churches need lumber from woodcutters to produce their parchments).But then there is another section of the game where you can rise in political power; its seat you hold has different perks (ex; Guild master can control finance; Head of church controls the tithe; Head of Law can set the severity of trial outcomes) each of these positions can be used for your own personal gain like sending people to the dungeon for a week's time which causes them to miss a court appearance where they might potentially get you convicted of a crime or making them miss an election where you can take their seat). You can also hire henchmen as security, to burn down your rivals' business...all sorts of wicked stuff.This all comes at a price, which is time. Everything takes time, naturally. Crops take time to grow, then takes time to process crops (raw materials) into, say, wheat flour which would then be used to make bakery items, church items, etc. This brings into play the economy of supply and demand, where if you're smart and resourceful enough, you can corner the market for really large profits in any particular city. Then of course there are the rogues who rob, kindnap and plunder everyone, everywhere.In short this is a very ambitious game that covers alot of different genres...successfully. The problem with this ambitious project is that it comes at the cost- the price being eye-candy. To say the graphics engine is dated is almost a compliment, but anyone who can appreciate all the stuff jammed into this game will (hopefully) understand that games that are really pretty to look at are really shallow in gameplay.The game is awesome and very deep, but it's also not for everyone.THE GOOD- Innovative blend of role-playing, real-time strategy, and economic-sim genres- lots of detail and a great medieval atmosphereTHE BAD- Repetitive gameplay- Really heavy on micromanagement- Limited character interactionDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE			"

Find a mate and produce an children who then be sent to different schools or apprenticeship to become like dear old Mom or Dad or another profession.Buildings and production chain are a huge part of the game. Run for office, sabotage other candidates and/or bribe influence to secure your seat. Each seat has it's own perks and abilities. Run for Pope if you want. In somewhat the same vein as Evil Genius.

												You know a game is great when you start playing at 10pm and then look at the clock and it's 9am.For the vets out there you know what this game is about but if people still buy this buggy master piece for some reason, here's a sloppy review.It's a game all about money management with elements of a RTS later in the game (Earlier if you start as a rogue)You protect your buisness from savages (Unless you're a rogue, you are the savage)It's a hard game (unless you're a rouge.) You have to make sure your competition doesn't out sell you on the markets, and if they control the raw resources then it's GG. You have to manage a complex system of supply chains for maximum profit which earn you the coin you need to buy titles. These titles will allow you a higher standing in society and more places of buisness. After a bit you become self sustaining and money is no longer an issue. What the issue is now is the rogue dynasty and the 2-3 minor families that decided theiving was the best way to survive in the world. So, how do you take care of them, you'd think it would be as simple as just amassing your body guards and thugs to go wipe the heathens out right? Wrong, this game has a politics simulator as well. If you go murder the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in cold blood then the guards will happily oblige and do the same to you. Then you'll wake up a few days later in court with the green bar of death hanging in the death penalty punishment. SO how do we take care of these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, eh? WE USE THE CORRUPT NATURE OF POLITICS LADIES AND GENTS. You too, a commoner, the being of an empire just above a serf with the most basic, basic, basic protection with the law (You can charge comeone if you figure out their plots.) can actually rise in this political ladder. Those titles unlock the chains on positions so you can run for them. Once you're high enough you can become immune to punishment, THEN you go take your rowdy thugs and kick the bandit's arses. (Becareful though, guards will still put you down unless a family member controls them.So overall, this game has some of the best content i've ever played. It's buggy as hell as I mentioned before, nothing game breaking though. I'll give the game a solid 9/10. Buy it, if you have the funds to get this game, and are dedicated to learn the immense curve of it, you'll love it too.			"

												(starter tips at the end) People say life is thrown at you without instruction, now truth be told, your mum and dad give you some direction. Apart from that you are on your own.This game is not your mum and dad, you are on your own. If you die, if your dynasty fails, if you go bankrupt....that is your fault. Unless you watch a walkthrough, google a walkthrough, occasionally right click in game to get a brief idea of what you are about to do or become a true gamer and live and learn....you are on your own.I spent the last 2 year's playing this via download from another site and then downloaded it through steam for ease over my multiple laptops. This game is harsh. This game requires business acumen, political skills, guilt free consequence to climb to the top of the political ladder, gaming skill and overall patience for bugs (download patch 4.21).You start with a man or women you have created (similar to the sims), choose one of four jobs (Patron, Rogue, Craftsman or scholar), choose the amount of other factions you play against (some similar to your chosen profession, which mean competition). Choose a map and town to start in and away you go.....life. Some starter tips:- Establish your bearings - Build a business - Buy a title- Court and marry a partner - Produce heirs...lots of heirs (some will die of disease, some will be killed and some will fail)- Level up- Apply for office (politics) - good luck if you win- Grow your business further- Have more heirs- Spend money on your heirs to go to school and get an apprenticeship - Invest in more businesses - Climb the political ladder - survive...this is life  "

												Be sure to use mods that help with some of the in game bugs, and is fully updated.The game is so under rated it is unreal.Major learning curve, but sooo worth it.Hundreds of hours worth of game play here guys. For me, this gem is going in my top five games of all time.My one gripe is the lack of polish, and sh-it AI building managment. Some crummy bugs also. Which would normaly be a game killer playing any other game, but The Guild 2 has sooooo much to offer in terms of content, and it is so unique, that I cant help but look the other way. Mainly because there are ZERO other games like this.It is A good game well worth putting several hundred hours into. If they had fixed the above issues, The Guild 2 would be a ♥♥♥♥ing MASTERPIECE!

												I highly recommend this game for anyone who is a fan of 'starting from the bottom now we're here' types of games.  XDIf running a successful business either through market mainupation or sabotaging your competitors isn't enough to stroke your ego then you can climb the social ladder and become the Mayor of the town, taking full advantage of nepotism to fill all the council seats with your children, securing your family's control of the City.  Muah ha haaa!I never had the opportunity to play it when it first released but it has aged like fine wine.  They don't make games like this anymore but I'm hyped for the third installment!			"

												This is one of my favourite games, yet I'd only recommend it on sale. As others have pointed out, the game is insanely buggy. These bugs aren't just cosmetic, minor issues, they can often be gamebreaking. Characters get stuck somewhere and have to be left for dead, saves get corrupted, multiplayer sessions go out of sync... the list goes on. If you do get the game, save often.To provide some context for that situation, this game was not created by the developers of the original The Guild 2, yet they were forced to use much of the original code, which was a gigantic mess, and just as buggy - if not more broken - than Renaissance is. The ""new"" developers actually continued patching Renaissance on their own time, without pay. But of course, they can't re-write the code from the ground up, so the game is still incredibly messy.When you get past the bugs though, you have one of the most ambitious games you could imagine in front of you. The game is eco-sim, RPG and dynasty manager in one. To start off, you pick between one of the four professions. You can either become a Patron to own farms and such, mostly creating food and other basic materials or running a tavern, become a Craftsman, who processes those basic materials and can gather some basic resources himself (like wood and metals), become a scholar, who either owns a church, brews certain concoctions or lends people money, or lastly, become a rogue, who comes into money by relieving other people of their own.As you can tell that already opens up a lot of options. While doing that, you gain experience for anything you do, whether you work in your shop/mine/farm/etc. or pursue a love interest. Doing the latter will sooner or later lead to marriage and the foundation of your dynasty. Get funky and spawn lots of children who you should send to decent schools to start them off with more experience and once they reach adolescence, get them a decent apprenticeship to determine their profession. At this point, things open up a lot, because you can have three people in your party at once, which means you can effectively have three quarters of all buildings and jobs available to you, diversifying your income.What do you earn the money for? Paying for education of your children, buying weapons and armour to fight duels (if you want to), upgrading your residence and workshops and most importantly: politics. By bribing your way into the local council, what stands in the way of you becoming mayor? Or eventually king? For that you will need to pay a lot of bribes and buy a lot of titles.There's a lot of nuance and a lot of detail in this game, but as I mentioned, bugs can often stand in the way of those many options presented to you. I remember in one of the games I had (I think it was on version 4.20) the council was so ♥♥♥♥ed up that elections were basically a dice roll. If you think your game is ♥♥♥♥ing up, try the beta patches or if you're already doing that, try playing without them. Your experience may vary considerably depending on whether you use the betas or not.			"

												This game is full of bugs. That being said, I  haven't sunk more hours into a sim/rpg as i have into this in years. While the game isn't perfect, there are a lot of unique ideas being implemented.Start your Family: Create your character, male or female. Choose their profession and start your dynasty! Find a spouse and  ensure the survival of your clan!Crime and Punishment: Are you an outlaw? a brigand or a pirate? Beware! Your crimes will NOT go unpunished! The stocks or the dungeon? Banishment to a neighboring town? Or execution? ""...but I'm innocent!""Run for Office!: Start by running for the local executioner's officer! Climb your way up to mayordom! Can you become Monarch? Destroy the competition: Hire spies, fabricate evidence, cheat lie steal and murder. Or simply outlast your enemies. Play your way.In all this is a great game. A real gem. It's just a little cloudy from a lack of polish.			"

												I have so fond memories of The Guild from years back. I loved the game and its sandbox glory. You could build such an empire over the years, you could own everything with enough patience. You could wipe out your pathetic rivals like the vermin they were. But now that I installed it again, the flaws I once could overlook have really grown with age. The game is slow, navigating between your buildings is a pain, and automation is completely useless. The AI assistance is awful.But the concept is good. I would gladly have purchased a clone of The Guild if it was bug free and seamless. This title is, sadly, a  moaning, sluggish shadow of its potential. Leave it buried.			"

												Usually I wouldn't like a minor update to the original game, but it fixes a lot of gameplay issues. Not to say the game doesn't have any problems, but everything seems more polished. The original Guild 2 was a game with a lot of potential and a lot of problems (and bugs). Renaissance still has some gamebreaking bugs, but the gameplay has been improved. For example: you can now set up trading routes so you don't have to spend time sending out your carts. You can now make each round last 1 year and not worry about your main characters dying of old age. Ways to eliminate your competitors have been also improved. Since your workers and allies fight for you when you attack someone you can use brute force with more ease. Even losing a fight can work for you if you want to get rif of your allies. If you like The Guild 2 you should get this game, if you've never played The Guild 2 I recommend you start here. The game is difficult and buggy, but it's worth playing.			"

The only problem i had was on starting the game it was slow to load and pertty unresponsive. I had to Ctrl Alt Delete to actually get past the opening cut scenes because nothing else worked. But i found a fix after an hour, go to your Steam/SteamApps/Common/The Guild 2 Renaissance. Edit the Config.ini and look for the following line// Show the splash screen at programm startup (0:no  1:on (default) )SplashScreen			= 1 (Turn this to 0 )this will skip the loading screens (Black screen) and bring you right to the games main menu.

												The game is sorta like The sims meets stronghold... i dunno.You start by controlling a member of your own dynasty, who can be patron, craftsman, rouge or scholar.You do your job, get married, have kids, maybe get a public position, buy a title and eventually be the biggest man in town.There are other dynasties around who try to ""win"" just like you do.the game has 3 gamemodes, which are Dynasties, Extinction and Missions, by far my favourite is dynasties, as its just a relaxing game where the ai doesnt want to murder you right away nor is there a clear end.Its a great game, im loving it.Graphics are decent enough.They sounds are alright tought there are some weirdness with looping sounds.Gameplay is fun, pathfinding is a bit problematic from time to time.The biggest problem with the game is the out of sync issues when playing multiplayer.This is cause The game doesnt use client-server network, instead it uses p2p networking where nobody can agree of anything. Just make sure all the players have decent connection, the right mods installed and a long list of saves to prevent corruption (also tunngle or game ranger as the game dont have its server thing up anymore (hamachi dont work as well as the others) )Get it while your hands are so fragile, so pure.Also, get the Patch 4.17b.

												The Guild II Renaissance is a fan made mod turned full game and it is by far the best version of The Guild II available but only by virtue of including everything that was in previous versions of The Guild II. By itself it might add a lot of new features but it was all stuff that was already available as mods.Renaissance adds new stuff in pretty much every category and with each new addition comes a new bug. Unfortunately this is a step down from the relatively polished nature of Pirates of the European Seas and a return to the bug ridden mess that was the original The Guild II.As with some many games that keep releasing new games while changing very little I come to a strange conclusion. If you asked me to recommend you one of The Guild II games to buy I'd say to get Renaissance, it's the latest incarnation, it has the most features and most of the mods available are made for it now. Taking each of the 3 games by their own merits however, as if they existed by themselves, Renaissance is by far the poorest.			"

												This is not a perfect game, and I doubt it ever will be. It is however one of a kind, there are very few games that feature sandbox mode business building in the 18th century. There is the element of starting up with your preferred business, finding a wife and starting a family - this is pretty much the gameplay of your first generation. As you build up more cash you can buy titles in order to buy more businesses, upgrade your house and also qualify for political offices. Some businesses are better suited to later generations - such as Carpenter, this business will be much more profitable if you also own a woodcutter hut which then can supply the wood needed and sell surplus to the markets (without this the need to buy wood from the expensive markets makes it quite not very profitable).All level 1 businesses can be levelled up to levelled up (1 - 2 - 3) which offers further production options and perks that can aid production, add workers and even fend off burglars. You can even decide to go a little crazy and start killing people, you will be taken to court and be sent to prison, fined or even executed for this. There is so much you can do with this game.I've seen some reviews saying that it has a clunky interface (it probably does if you aren't used to the game) but most of these people seem unwilling to learn how to play the game, if you want a simple game then stick to candy crush. I will repeat it is not perfect, you will probably find many bugs but there isn't anything that makes it unplayable and it can be very entertaining if you let it!			"

												Absolutely underrated and unrivaled is how I would best summarize this series. This is particularly true with ""Renaissance"" as the latest and most comprehensive addition.Ambitious at the outset, what The Guild II Renassiance successfully accomplishes (with minor flaws) is a faithful recreation of medieval life and its jarring transition to early capitalism. Everything falls under the purview of this simulation -- politics, economics, family, and what I view as its most compelling aspect -- murder, intrigue, and the subsequent games one might play with a court system as an extension of the earlier mentioned politics.It's a sociopath's kind of simulator. ""The Guild II"" has always, from my perspective, marketed itself on the player's ability to place the daughters of your character's enemies into prostitution, engineer methods of spreading plague to your rivals, and of course, its ability to rouse the jolly spirit of arson in everyone.Here is something that happened in one of my playthroughs. An AI owner of the town's hospital would not leave the building so that I could murder them and buy the deed to the place. My character had a high charisma and was able to fabricate a claim that the owner of the hospital had committed a serious crime and went to the court with said claim. From the AI's reluctance to leave the hospital, they failed to appear for the court summons and were deemed a persona non grata. The AI still did not leave the hospital at this point, so I firebombed the facility. As the building was engulfed in flames, the AI owner immediately stormed out of the place and was quickly lynched in the streets by the townsfolk. I got my hospital and without murder.			"

Get a gambling table to make money, bribe to get friends and go higher in politics, spread your rogue minions, make gear for minions, get a king, kill the king, be the king and have everyone in your family hold a seat to secure your rule. It's hours of good fun. When you get bored, you could go explore other professions and realise later on that it's a pain to micro-manage. It still has a few bugs, but you can just save a lot (can be a pain).Lots of maps to try if you get bored.			"

												One of the best games I've ever played. Mostly in multiplayer. I remember the old times with timeout issues. They are mostly gone, but there are till some bugs. I'm glad developers are still working on it. It even has a fairly big modding community. I've been playing it for a long time, got it in a computer magazine, and I've decided to support the developers once more, so I've bought it on steam. I realise that there were lot of different companies running The Guild since Europa 1400.This game has a great potential. It's one of the most complex games, but yet it is easy to play, but difficult to master. It's an economic simulator.At the beginning you create your character, there are not many options in design, but this is not The Sims. The more important things are the stats and class. You can even chose between 2 religions, protestant and catholic, the only difference in my opinion is that you can only build church of your religion. You can change it in a church.So to the classes: there are four of them: Patron, Craftsman, Rogue and Scholar.They are not balanced. The devs and modders are trying to fix it, but it's still not it. I hope guild 3 will be better balanced.My first try was Rogue (obviously). It was the easiest way to accumulate a lot of money, get rid of concurrence and hold the highest position in the council. In fact, in about 30 years, I've had a huge mansion on a hill and I stopped playing.That's the biggest problem of the game. In singleplayer, it gets repetitive.Scholar is second easier, maybe even easiest, because you don't break the law for your job. But you should. Where is the fun? :DYou just build a church and people pay you just to go in there. You can easily make friends and make everybody hate your enemies. I personally like the cemetery, because of all the satanists praying there. Even more than in church.Craftsman is my favorite, because it has a lot of challenge, mostly in big cities flooded with concurence. The job of a craftsman is to make something from something else. That's different from patron and scholar who just collects their materials, and rogue who steals it. I don't play for patron much, because I find it boring. So no review of that profession. Every profession is necesarry in a town, maybe except of the rogue. Without patron, craftsman cannot produce clothes and so on, and scholar cannot make medicine or other stuff. It is probably the most frequent reason of dying or bankrupting. No scholar means no hospital, what almost certainly means death. I hate that AI does'n really have a stock of more expensive medicine. Overall AI isn't so Intelligent, but in recent updates and modpacks it is more agressive and more complex. I hope that it will be better in The Guild 3.So I think that's enough for now, nobody is reading it anyway, I will maybe write another one regarding some other features, like marriage, children, burning down your neighbours house or kidnapping your mother in law. I'm really looking forward to The Guild 3, in fact, I would gladly do alpha/beta testing.			"

But around 30-60 seconds after the dawn of the second day, the game would crash and the save would fail. There's so many other bugs too, like not being able to build on some maps, and some maps just don't appear correctly, etc. I was willing to put up with all that stuff, because this game is that much fun, but automatic corruption of saved games as soon as the first day ends?

												Most of the bad reviews were written before the last patch (4.211), in which many of the bugs were fixed. The game still has some issues like random crashes, etc. but it's very fun and unique overall and I'd highly recommend it.Some tips:Avoid saving over old save files, this can RARELY cause corrupted saves; not common by any means but annoying enough to be worth avoiding.Be ready to manage your own businesses in the early game; I've seen a lot of people set them to AI controlled and then get confused when they can't get ahead money-wise. The AI controlled setting has an upkeep you pay every turn.Be sure to download the newest patch (4.211 as of 11/15/15) by enabling betas through Steam!Good luck, and enjoy the game :)			"

												An Addicted Game, but there is no tutorial to this which is disappointing. There are some problems with the video showing when the game starts and it may crash the game. The way to solve this is: goto the config file in the game's directory and edit the file, change the splashscreen parameter from 1 to 0. Pros.: Good Concepts and better than Guild II. Very Addictive.Cons: No tutorial. For tutorial, please play the Guild II: Pirate of the European Seas. There is a tutorial inside. I suggest they should have a tutorial for different professions. Game system problem: the video.Can only control 3 characters. Overall, I give it 60/100.			"

												This is possibly my favourite game in the entire RTSRPG genre, and I am confident in what I am saying.This game requires you to play for at least a few hours to learn the basics, as it takes time to progress and make profit of your business. (Unless you're a rogue)++ Edit: Patch 4.20 was released 22nd December! Definitly improved the gameplay, and I recommend it even more than before!Bottom-LineI would only and very much recommend this game to anyone who looks for an RTS that isn't trendy, there's quite few people I know which enjoyed this game. If your more into killing, return to C&C or SC. It lightly delivers an RPG feel, has a great economic system, and unique way of going about the game from a military point of view. Not only does it provide objective based rules, there is a sandbox to try out new things for single and multiplayer. However, you have to weigh bugs, your patience, and an absent multiplayer(online)  into playability of the game. The multiplayer does not work very well if you're playing with even 1 AI Dynasty, as it De-Syncs the other player most likely after 1 round (24 minutes normal speed). It's possible to counter with constant saving/loading, but for me It's not worth it. This is the first game I've tried of the series, so I can't compare/contrast of the others, but I have to say its a good play. I've played 250 hours alltogether with my second account. I paid sale price for this game and I definitely got my money's worth. Any game nearing 100 hours of enjoyable/challenging experience is no doubt in my opinion is something to definitely try out!

												*NOTE* - Steam does not download the latest patch for this game automatically. It has to be downloaded and installed manually.This game is not for everyone, clearly. It suffers from an undeniable and unforigvable ammount of bugs. With that said, though, there have been a couple great modders who have worked to save this game from itself. Go to http://forum.runeforge-games.net/index.php/topic,1438.0.html, read up on the changes and bugfixes, and I can guarenty it addresses nearly everything you may have had issues with.The game, at its core, is very entertaining. It is honestly one of the only games that fits this Political/Economic/Dynasty type bussiness management genre. I highly urge you to download the mod listed in the description (Or type ""Legacy Mod Pack +Vanilla Fixes Guild Wars 2"" in google if you are wary of following website links).I have always enjoyed this game, but as players have stated it is nearly unplayable in its vanilla state. So do yourself a favor and download the fixes that a few modders have been so kind as to work on and provide for us. Good luck!			"

												With the 4.20 patch I can finally give this game the rating it deserves! After more than a year of struggling to hold a multiplayer game for more than a couple hours, and never being able to load it without an out of sync error, the recent 4.20 patch has made drastic and noticable stability changes.Since the patch I hosted a game that ran 25 rounds straight. We successfully saved and loaded when there were sound glitches or things that needed to be reset. We're planning to get back to it when we have the proper time for it.The UI and mechanics are a bit odd and take a little trial and error to get used to, but it really pays off.The Guild 2: Renaissance has become one of my favorite games, and I look forward to the recently announced Guild 3.

												I had a bit of fun with the game. I enjoyed building up my dynasty. I enjoyed attempting to climb the political ladder while preparing for a revolution. I enjoyed the satisfaction of advancing my station in society. But the game just seems unfinished with broken or strange mechanics, nonsense dialogue, and game breaking glitches.Building a dynasty is cool. You get married, you have kids. Simple. But having a flourishing dynasty is useless because you're only allowed to control three characters at a time, and if you stop controlling one at any time, they're gone for good. If you have a member halway up the political ladder and you need to control another member of your family so they can start having kids of their own, you're out of luck. You have to make a choice. Do most of my kids end up unmarried and childless, or do I abandon my political career for them?Some of the broken mechanics involved the game permanently being stuck on pause and reloading a previous save does nothing. Others are the strange way you manage your dynasty, down to the weirdest dialogue. I understand it's a sim, but when my wife and mistress are both referred to as ""him"", or when people spout off random dialogue during a discussion, it breaks the immersion a bit. Another broken mechanic is the EXTREMELY limited space in which you can build. The maps are small and the slightest hill will prevent you from placing a building. This leaves you with massive wide open spaces in an already tight fit. The only way I found to slightly get around this was to place different buildings in the same spot before they could be built in order to form a grotesque super structure.But good luck playing the game if you decide to buy it anyway. There's no manual.Ultimately, I never got to complete the game. The game ended up breaking after I had basically taken over the whole town. Would I play it if it was more polished and didn't feature a stifling dynasty tree? Yeah. It's not a bad concept. They just didn't do a good job of it.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, but it is too bugged to enjoy. And I'm not even talking about the animation glitching and texture clipping, or people just standing around because they are unable to get to their destination kind of bugs, I can live with that, I'm talking about the game destroying bugs and there are a lot... Also tried it with the Fajeth's MegaModPack 0.8 and Legacy ModPack 2.02 (separately of course), and even though they do fix a lot of things, sooner or later you will have to restart the game because it will became unplayable. After awhile you get sick and tired of so many restarts, and after constant fear that something may bug the hell out, you have to admit to yourself that the game became repulsive.It's a shame that there are not more games like this, but seeing how many problems this one have, I guess it is understandable.

												(Taken from my Guild 2 Review)This game claims to be an RPG... it isn't. What it is is a management sim and it ain't a very deep one at that. For something that's supposed to be about you living the medieval life there's not an awful lot of you livin' a life and probably a bit too much of you micro-managing your businesses and your employees. It is possible to set the AI to manage the buisnesses you build but you're very unlikely to make a sustanible profit doing that. The political system seems interesting at first but once you've climbed to the top it doesn't feel very fulfilling, and it doesn't add anything to the game to make you want to continue playing longer. The family system could've been interesting if it wasn't for the fact that it requires almost no effort what-so-ever. The most complicated thing you'll do is court your mate, but all that consists of is using four or five actions in the right order to increase your prospective spouse's affection, but each of these actions have a linked cool down with the rest so you have to wait a good few hours of ingame time (you can speed up the clock thankfully) before you can perform the next compliment. Children you send to school with a push of a button and there's no need to keep either parent at home to look after them either.Combat does exist in this game as does criminal actions but it's all rather pointless, you'll be far more successful running a lawful business than you ever would a criminal one and using actions like threats or murder are far too risky and made pointless by the fact that you can just bribe anyone and everyone into liking you.I find it hard to decide whether or not to recommend this game. Yes i've been critical but as a management game it's not bad and i've certainly played worse. It does carry an interesting premise, if not a particularly well implimented one. What it comes down to with me is, tho, the fact that it claims to be an RPG and a medieval life simulator and it's just not.A word of advice if you still wish to pick this game up go for the Renaissance stand-alone expansion since it has everything that both the main game and the Pirates expansion offers.

												TL;DR version: this game is fantasic whether you are into being a criminal mastermind, Political powerhouse or a simple tradesman.Well to say this game is great is an understatement. I've played for several hours and i still think i have just barely gotten into it. Personally i like to play the rogue and its a rare game that instead of just having you have to be careful of the guards...this game allows you to apply for an office of political power and then use the guards to arrest your opponents. Guy not paying the protection money? send a thug around to spy on him, get some dirt on a crime he did and either take him to court or just arrest him outright, guy trying to collect hush money from your thieves and working girls? have them whip him up a refreshing poisoned drink!Now for the less criminally minded there are still so many (in fact probably more) Legal ways to earn money and rise to power. mining gems and aking them into some jewlery, making baked goods from a network of farms and mills and even running a bank. the game offers so much and concidering that i picked it up for around £4.49 for the complete package. I feel like i ripped steam off!			"

I fell in love in the first few minutes of game time, so much in love with this game that i didn't uninstalled it, after being so frustrated that it doesn't have a tutorial. It has many many bugs, but i just fell in love with it. At first i didn't know what i was doing, but eventually i learned and had to start over many times, trying each class. Right now after i finish writing this review i have to start over, because my game got bugged and my town is stuck in expansion, i can't apply to any office now because it says it's expanding, making my game unplayable.Anyways, i recommend this game to anyone that likes RTS games and simulation games and rpg games.

												If I somehow ended up on a desert island and could bring only one game with me, this with Fajeth's MegaMod installed would be it. It's rare that a game this ambitious comes anywhere close to achieving its potential, and when it does it's usually riddled with bugs. Well, the vanilla version of this game is pretty bug-riddled, but thankfully this game has such a loyal following that some modders took it upon themselves to keep fixing issues long after it was no longer profitable for the developing company to keep doing so, and the result is the most deeply immersive and complex life simulator that's ever been created. It's a little bit sims, and a little bit anno, and it's all good.			"

												The different things you can do to earn money are extremly unbalanced, only a few let you actually survive. Most automated functions are borked and on long term you end up manually micromanaging anything and getting annoyed and bored. Politics require a lot of time and money invested in. You can't even choose to avoid bothering with that completely, because with favor decay (over time people may start hating you) you will end up with enemy politicians that have powers like exiling, arresting, buildings destruction or even torture. So in general, ideas are good but how the game was made is very bad, especially the buildings AI for automated working gets very annoying after a while, when for example it starts selling your basic materials you have on storage, that workers need to actually craft advanced products, for no good reason. Not fun.			"

												The ideas behind this game what pulls you in. Unique game.Pros:-To be able to choose real life like professions.-Craft many items and create automated trade routes to supply your shop while you attend to your bussiness.-Check market details of each city and plan your next haul.-Become a rich, known family and try your luck in politics.-Starting as a commoner and becoming a noble family amongs other known people and more titles.-You may conquer an entire city using economy alone.-You can see the interiors of each building while you and your employees working. Kind of satisfying to watch as you ""Pay bonus"" to you employees or using ""Goad workers"" heheCons:-Graphics are outdated yet interior deisngs still looks good.-Game AI is not stable.-Game engine is troubling at times. You have the feeling of weird bugs stalking you.-Some professions designed good while others, like rogue, not working well. Bugs and mechanic problems.-If AI bugs sometimes economic balance between items goes crayz. Once, I happen to be the only person who is supplying the market with food and clothing even though there are 4 rich familys in this crowded city who owned shops. AI simply stops working sometimes.

												I am mixed about this game. Bought it to get a feel for when Guild 3 came out....I bought a farm for grain, then a windmill to turn grain into flour, then a Weaver for cloth from the wool from the farm, then a bakery to turn flour to biscuits, then a mine for iron, then a foundary to turn iron into tools and then spent my time getting stuff to where was needing and selling the surplus.  The chain grow.Married, had 2 kids, married the son. Started a rogue thingie... then realised.. was this it? Would I just be doing this same process slowly taking over each and every building?I started a scholar to try...  will this be same thing? Rogue? I Feel a LOT less flare for it now. Was great at first though.. now.. not so sure.I though the RPG element would add something that city builders lacked (I played Skylines and it was just this process non stop), but its not enough to keep me hooked, even though I love the initial idea behind it.

												I won't write much, because if I start, I wont stop. So for TL;DR sake :Dont buy unless you will play with friends (Need Tunngle for that), or just only tend to play games for a few hours at a time. (More under Cons).Pros :- Its fun, and unique- Lots of replayability ~100 hr- Mischievous business tactics. How fun would it be to own a hospital, and in order to assume market control, you just burned down all the other hospitals? Plus, you get more customers in more ways than one ; )^ Or just assasinate all the workers- So many ways to play it, from owning a simple bakery to a massive supply chain, or becomming the ruler of a village. If you have enough money, you can even my an estate and start wars between countries!- Multiplayer is awesome, expecially if you like messing with your friends. (Oops, you're wife was assasinated? Wonder who did that..)Cons :- Bugs. Like opening a Sarcophagus after a thousand years of fermenting human. You NEED the community created patches, however, said patches also add new features. Just make sure either way to get them!- AI absoulutely kicks the bucket if you play long enough. After maybe 3-4 hours, their entire family dies of old age and you just win. Even if you don't touch them. You really need people to play with for this reason.- Online portion is dead, and their servers are gone. To play with friends, you need the glorious Hamachi or Tunngle <-.Just pray to GOD Guild III is actually made. And thank the community this game is still alive, since the developers dont do sh*t.

Product received for free
												standalone expansion and adds many things from buildings to maps and 8 new classes. Lightly delivers an RPG feel, has a great economic system, and unique way of going about the game from a military point of view. Not only does it provide objective based rules, there is a sandbox to try out new things for single and multiplayer. However, you have to weigh bugs, your patience, and an absent multiplayer(online) into playability of the game. However, the community has a way around the multiplayer through the use of third party programs that allow players to join games through their Lan. This is the first game I've tried of the series, so I can't compare/contrast of the others, but I have to say its a good play.			"

												This Game is a perfect Example for a good Idea badly realised. You start with a single workshop and are bound to build an Empire. But You should be very carefull, which Craft You choose, because there are many worksops very dependend on the Market for raw materials - and this Market only has wares someone produces, that means You or Your KI-Opponent. But the KI is so bad, that some wares are never produced at all and so your workshop soon goes out of materials and becomes bankrupt. The KI for Automanagement is even worse (on Autoselling and -producing, the KI even sells the raw materials needed for crafting, so Your workers will be without work and You again will be bankrupt), so You have to do the mikromanagment on Your own - all the time. This may be nice at the beginning, when You have only one shop, but already in the midgame You will have about 5 to 7 shops, and neither of them will work, if You dont sell and buy and produce every Item by Yourself.But even if You are ready to play a Game like that, even You like the mikromanagment, I Wouldnt recommend the Game. Because You need to do the Mikromanagment of Your family, too. Find a mate, educate your children and so on - and of course become elected in court, visit the doctor, eat, drink, sleep, all of it at the same time. And a lot of the features arent even explained or seem to have an effect. So none of my characters has ever eaten, because there are no negative effects, at least none I could see.With all of this to do, im lacking the Game ""Guid"". A  Game where you had to raise money to fight Your opponent via intrigue, violence and trickery. The foundation for a good Game is there - the economic processes are quite nice and it is fun to bring your first shop to maximum level. But by then the KI of Your opponents and the catastrophic and suicidal automanaging-processes destroy every fun.If You wanna play ""The Guild"" wait for the Guild III or play ""The Guild I"" Not this. spare Your 10 bucks.plz notice that english is not my first language			"

												Very ambitious game, poorly executed.The start of the game is very fun, there's lots of exciting things to do and the game appears to have great potential and the game appears to be extremely deep... first impressions of this game are very good. However, after the early-game, the economy becomes unworkable, your businesses grow so complex that they become unmanagable, and the AI factions will be rising up the courts because of regular mouse glitches making you bribe the wrong people.The economy system is completely broken. The map will always run out of raw resources unless you (the AI will never do this) set up a business to harvest them yourself, but this costs huge amounts of money to set up - money which you do not have in the early game. As you supply raw ingredients to the market, other factions make use of this raw resource and generate huge profits from very little investment on their part. And even though you have a monopoly on a raw resource, you have no control over the price at which you sell that resource.The mouse controls regularly glitch, which can be extremely frustrating when you're in court and you have to click and bribe the correct NPCs in a very short time limit. Also, as your businesses begin to grow, you will need to start automating the management of your buildings - this automation is very primitive and is very glitchy and frustrating to set up. Also.. there's no pause... the game just runs very, very slowly...?The more time you invest into this game, the more you realise how broken it is. This game isn't worth your time.			"

												A flawed yet great game that blends the control of The Sims with an economy, politics, sabotage, assasination and fighting in general without wetting your pants every five seconds (For clarification your people don't eat, poop, and sleep. You control when they work, what they work on, who they marry ect), all set in the rennaisance era of Sweden, Denmark and Germany (Or the Hanse).Start a bandit camp and put tolls on the roads.Run a hospital and sell your medicine.Open a blacksmith's shop and make ""Only the finest weapons and armor"".Run for mayor and control what happens in your town.Weave cloth, make bricks, mix dyes, run an inn or pub, farm, mine or log.Smuggle, extort, bribe, murder and sabotage to remove your opposition and make yourself rich.Though it does have its flaws, the starting splash movie is glitchy and freezes the game before it can start, requireing you to alt tab to make it un-freeze, multiplayer is a tad broken with you having to download a third party client (Tunngle for instance) to be able to use it, and even then desync is very common. Plus multiple other small bugs.In all though, I give it a 7/10 and I recommend it to anyone. "

												This is perhaps my favorite game of all.. due mainly to my love of the time period and the gameplay as a whole. You basically are the patriarch of a family and spend your life making a dynasty to stand the test of time. With 4 classes to choose from the game has a near infinite amount of replay value and there is no particular goal in dynasty mode but to survive and outlast the other dynasties. From peasants to near Royalty you will influence your city and nation to greatness through noble businesses or underground criminal syndicates. Whether you choose to own farms and INNs or preach at churches or make potions at apothecaries you will find your place in this historical world.			"

												What an interesting game this is. It sort of spans across multiple genres - it's part RPG, it's part city-builder and it's part trade simulation. It's really a fantastic blend which offers an enormous potential for a perfect game, but sadly the game falls just short of that mark due to a cumbersome interface and some annoying bugs. But the new developer who took over the title (Runeforge) has made appreciable improvements and bug fixes which let's you really enjoy the game.If you're willing to put up with a bit of a tough learning curve and a rough interface then this title is something that can be extremely fun and exciting.

												Great concept, rotten implementation. :(Both The Guild and the Guild II seem to work up to a point and then they fall flat on their faces.1) When you pause the game, it does not actually pause. Theoretically you need to browse the enemy stats and you don't need the enemy to be continuing to grow while you try to absorb that information.2) The game straight jackets you into a forced pace / style of play which is extremely frustrating if you want to play it to your own style or with any sort of freedom of choice.3) The one mechanism which might compensate for the above two issues is the business route planner, which is limited, very cumbersome to set up and basically broken. The game applies an arbitray minimum sale value and will not deliver goods below that. This leaves you paying wages but earning nothing while you do so.Effectively the game balance just does not work.IF YOU BUY THIS GAME YOU WILL JUST GET ANNOYED AT HOW BEAUTIFUL IT COULD BE AND HOW BROKEN IT IS.B a s i c a l l y   i t   i s   s t i l l   i n   b e t a !

												So I decided to try out this game after it was on sale. Had a difficult time at start because there was no tutorial. Found some help online and turned out it was pretty easy after all. Anyway, I decided to start on a map with three different cities. All went fine, I made some money and eventually my family became pretty big. One of the kids got kidnapped and tortured as soon he was grown up. So I decided it might be better to let him move to one of the other towns, since no one knew him there and it could be a chance to make more profit. I made him walk from Bergen (Norway) to Londen (G.B.). He finally arrived there and I decided the poor soul needed a woman in his life. Before he found himself a wife, he got murdered. The rest of the family seems to be fine, even though they'll never know what happened to their son.Besides not having a tutorial, I enjoyed the game. EDIT: Turns out there was a patch for this game (underneath properties -> beta -> select the patch and let it download). You'll find a tutorial ported from the originial game in it.			"

Here is my review why.Firstly, I shall describe one of my experiences in this game. So, I was the leader of a bunch of brigands. Ruffians. Scoundrels. Vagabonds. Lepers.

A rival family in the Town decided to set up shop too close to my own front of a legitimate business. Of course, I could not allow this.

												While its a bit difficult to figure out the game is still majorly fun. The market has an economy, you can marry and have children who grow up, your character gets old and dies, you run businesses and can expand upon them to better businesses. Run for office in your selected city. Its fantastic. While the AI is very basic and it is hard to figure out how some things the game overall is very entertaining!			"

												Amazingly open-ended game. For example:You're a craftsman trying to run for a town council seat. Mayor hates you and votes against you. So you marry a rogue-class wife. Build/buy/takeover a Thieves' Den. Hire thieves to follow mayor. Send your thugs to beat him. Rob him. Kidnap him. Put him in the jail cell. Ransom. Then kill on the way back home. Then apply for a seat in the town council.			"

												This is by far a unique game when it comes to economic/political/simulation games. This manages to be a very entertaining game with lots of depth and strategy involved while also being light hearted and not too serious.It can be a bit daunting at times but reading up on the internet can help start you off, The campaign in Pirates of the European Seas also helps you get accustomed to how the game is played.An important thing to note is that there is no Dev support for the game anymore BUT it does have a very active and successful modding community, it's also highly recommended that you look for the latest legacy mod to fix the bugs and add some extra features.If you've got a close group of friends this game can be a blast with planning secret back room deals, political intrigues, sabotage and an in depth criminal system. On the top layers it is also pretty fun to run a proper business and try to improve the local towns prosperity.  Basically it's about as awesome as GoT but on a much smaller scale xD Sadly no massive armies or foreign lands to explore.If you Roleplay, this would probably be the best game to use as a setting, The depth of actions and choices you can make is staggering.

												I had the box version years ago in Germany but moved to the states and lost it. Once I saw that this game was bought out and a new patch was released + Guild 3 announced I just had to buy it again. This is truly one of my all time favorites.You can build an empire and crush your enemies (or friends if you feel like it).  You are not stuck with the same job but can switch once you progress within the game.The game experience is quiet unique and multiplayer is what makes this game really fun. The only downside is the out-if-sync issues. Once you have a few years in-game time the chances of getting a random disconnects from the game get greater. The newest patch has helped a lot but I feel that it will never be perfect. Maybe the Guild 3 will fix everything...			"

												This game is a lot like Oblivion, it's a buggy piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥but in the right frame of mind you can lost in itand lose entire nights of your life to it. You'll frequently find pathfinding not working as intended or town meetings being skipped yet results of that meeting still being attained.The tactics in this game are absolutely beautiful, from managing family relations, finding a mate to expand your linieage and sabotaging your competitor's shops.Having trouble with some guy? Why not fabricate some evidence against him and then convict him extra harshly because you just happen to be the town's judge?The possibilities for ♥♥♥♥ing other people up are endless, diverse, rich, satisfying and generally amazing. Too bad you'll need a relatively high bug tolerance to have those moments.Whilst the bugs make the game by no means unplayable, it certainly can make it a bit of a struggle every now and again.8/10, would recommend unless you have a short temper.

												The Guild II is hilarious in how it will make even the nicest player an evil, manipulative, and underhanded mastermind. At least to the npcs running around the gameworld.

												Honestly it's a really good game, few other series give you the ability to be a complete diabolical monster like The Guild can. Rogue is probably my favorite class and the combination of economy, politics and the occasional back alley shanking make this an awesome game to get into if you've got the patience for it.The good:1: Nice combination of life sim, political intrigue, economy management and crimelord style empire building2: Very replayable due to how unpredictable the game can get, with multiplayer being particularly vicious, keeps the player on their toes.3: Great story telling potential with your friends on discordThe iffy:1. Has a bit of a learning curve, you'll probably get battered around in the first couple games so you'll have to be patient.2. Sometimes unresponsive UI, occasionally your employees will do weird stuff or follow odd paths too.			"

												This game touched on a lot of great ideas. It combines an economic simulation with building up a dynasty by giving you control over the individuals and their abilities.  The problem is it feels like an alpha. Even if the latest beta patch did improve the game in terms of glitches and crashes, the barebone mechanics will drive you insane. For example, at the forefront of this game sits trading. The tools given to you for this purpose will just infuriate you. Sure, you can micromanage the trade routes in your chain of production, but this aspect is barely implemented. It's pointless to explain, but bottom line you'll find yourself tweaking the routes over and over again. The game doesn't handle properly overproduction mixed with multiple goods to transfer, partial mid route dropoffs are broken, starting the route only allows you to select the quantity of goods present in your buildings at that moment in time, and the list can go on. You'll end up transporting only one type of goods between point A and B. You can turn on the AI for this, but if you do, expect to get even more frustrated. The AI is making dumb decisions such as dropping off finished goods back to the building that produced the original raw resource (probably because it was in the way, who knows), buying goods from the market even though you have buildings that produce the goods in your production chain, filling up your buildings with raw materials leaving no room for the finished goods. Oh don't worry, this is not the only aspect lacking in the game, but it's by far the most important.This game is the perfect example of stretching the goals and having to deal with a scope creep that got out of control, leading to something that simply can't be called a finished product.

												The Guild is a wonderful concept, but this game suffers from a sleugh of bugs/stability issues/ and a horrible AI. The latest patch is not part of the steam download and must be downloaded from their website, and the ""best"" patch is the beta one, due to the developers not wanting to release a new one until they're sure it's finalized. Nothing in the game is streamlined. AI for your buildings made this worse for me which forces you to take the time to micromanage each business individually. Characters are seperated into professions which makes sense, however the seperation between building functions within the professions becomes extremely tedious, getting to the point were it sometimes doesn't even make sense. The rogue profession especially is limited by this. As far as money and the economy goes, it is fairly easy for the economy to crash. The longer you play through a game you will notice the economy starting to slowly worsen. Despite rival dyanasties reaching massive ammounts of money midway through the game their businesses weren't producing anything, and only base level items and resources were being put into the market. Despite this, it would usually become more profitable in the long run to also only have your businesses produce the 1st tier of items as well. Nobody would be buying the high tier ones, and as the supply went up the profit from selling them would go down for me until it would stay consistantly low for a few turns. This was an issue that stayed constant from almost every game I started, regardless of my profession. As I was playing a Rogue I would in turn be limited to this as well. It would take longer to upgrade my buildings, pay for employees, etc. since what was being stolen was only the low tier items the AI was producing. The flipside to this was that if I essentially wanted to exploit the game you could build a pub, play dice, and just keep reloading your save until you actually win a large sum of money and repeat when needed. To be fair, I was playing the game with the legacy mod installed with the right patch, and this fixed many glitches regarding the AI, but did  not fix some of the combat and job  issues with your characters taking prolonged periods of time before they would actually do what they were told to do.  To elaborate, the game isn't horrible. It's just that if you're expecting to the game to run smoothly you're going to be dissapointed, finding how long it takes to do even the simplest of tasks in RTSes taking much more time.. Likewise, if you're expecting the game to become as in depth as far as the economy for it goes, you will also be dissapointed. It's fun to mess around in if you just take it for what it is, but with issues going uncorrected and the use of an outdated game engine for this stand alone ""expansion,"" I can't get behind it. It's a wonderful idea and I really like the game's direction, so I feel very backhanded for saying I can't recommend this game to my friends. In the end however; I can't see myself paying even $10 for it if I had known about the issues I'd have with it before.			"

Be a Patron and grow wheat, or be a craftsman and make weapons based on the labour of the Patron, or be a scholar and try to create a service based empire or just be a rogue and rob everyone and make yourself rich through unethical means. The choice is yours, if only life nowadays are as simple as this.			"

												I actually love this game and used to play it non-steam so i probably have 100+ hours in total. Don't believe the guys saying the game is fine with beta update or community patches. It's not. It just makes the game a later alpha stage-like. It crashes every 2 hours instead of 30-45 minutes. If you can keep up with that for this gem go ahead and buy it but I can't advice this game it's a waste of money to most of people.			"

												Great game idea, terrible execution. Has a lot of crash issues (somehow even manages to crash windows to the point where hard reboot is needed for some folk), saves have a 50/50 chance of being corrupted, the pathing is wtf worthy if not downright frustrating; the controls become really annoying after a while (don't even get me started on combat). It has its cool moments, but honestly it plays like a steam early access game and it's from 2006 (granted Renaissance did come out in 2010, but it seems to me that the engine was practically unchanged in the two games). I might have a soft spot for this game because it's both a political and and economical simulator in one game, but honestly I would advise people to stay away from this particular game unless you're really into strategy/tycoon and the like. You're only going to go out being frustrated (and maybe a bit confused, as the game doesn't really have a good tutorial). Maybe wait for The Guild III as it's in development right now.			"

I can see the potential as a business and political sim.Unfortunately if you alt-tab out of it for any reason the game, at least for me, pauses and won't let me unpause it. Apparently there are all sorts of annoying bugs - just look at the discussion board.I'm on my way now to look at the other versions of The Guild because this really does look excellent if one of these games is bug-free. I just can't recommend this one based on all the bugs. I respect that this is a very good game, but it plays like EA even though it isn't listed as such. I'm not a beta tester.			"

												The Sims medieval done very right. Control your dynasty, become a mayor or a torturer, grow your family,  amass wealth, and much more!Become the scholar, and gain influence with faith or shady rouge who kidnaps the scholar to demand ransom. It's all based on your choice how you will progress. Definitly a game worth your money and your time! You prefer more calm experience? Buy an Inn and become the Patron of your town, spreding laughter and joy.Is your enemy much better? Did he gain money thorugh some juicy transatcion? Hire a mercenery and burn his building to the ground!CAUTION: This review is heably nostalgia driven :) Just being honest with you, I spent a lot of time playing this game, and yes it is flawed, read some more reviews as you might not like it as much as I do :)And video with some basic opinion and look at the game:

												Love the game.  I was able to live vicariously through my characters bringing my family from organized crime and into politics and banking to become the most powerful man in Danzig.  My first wife contracted leporasy, was an unforutnately a patron and had only gotten pregnant with one child.  So I divorced her and had her killed at my mercenary fortress outside the city where my men were killing bandits and collecting tolls.  I also used my mercenarys and thugs to track and inform on other criminals while my men at the thieves guild pickpocketed while the gypsies and wanderers I hired to tell fortunes and use crystal balls to shill people out of money.  I abused every political position I was in to get ahead, once while I was summoned to court as I was head on the dungeon I order my bailors to bring in the procecutor to be lashed giving the appearence he missed court.  All evidence against me was dismissed.  I rose in political office until I was Marshal and head of the guards whom I made sure were not around whilst my men broke the bones or killed my enemies.  I also brought my new wife up in the political chain until I had become sovereign and her the head Magistrate in Danzig.  We rule the city with an Iron fist.  We wiped out the rival crime family  through ambushes between cities, setting houses on fire and slaughtering inhabitants as they run out of flaming buildings and condemming buildings my thugs damage abusing my power as Sovereign while I banished anyone in the political office who would not vote my wife or children's way in application of office.  A rival family of doctors and churchmen still stand in my way and surprisingly tend to be more resilient.  We find their honesty unsettling.  I have allowed one of their family members into a low level political office.  To keep my enemies close.  I have since turned my eyes to the larger city of Hamburg where I now plan to send my son as he graduates from university to begin banking and with our blood money we use to purchase noble titles with an end goal.  For the head of my house to become King.  No one will stand in our way.			"

Problems ranged from corrupted files (crashes to the desktop when you load it meaning hours of gameplay lost unless you have auto-save enabled), lag on a map I didn't have previously playing the map on another file, inability to have my character enter a building he owns so he can work there, not being able to return my fishing boat to the fishing shack, mouse suddenly not able to click on buildings or characters, etc.  Idk if there is a patch for some of these problems, and if there is please someone tell me how to go about getting that, but otherwise this growing list of glitches has made an otherwise fun game unplayable.

												I am surprised that this game is getting a ""very positive"" rating; and the game is more than just quirky or glitchy; the game is so unrefined and plagued be so many bugs, that it's almost unplayable. Just moving the cart around can be difficult because of the poor implemented interface. I'm a very forgiving gamer, and I have to say that I wish I could get my money back for this title.I will admit that the concept is a good one, and if the interface wasn't so glitchy, this would be a fun game, but due to the bugs, this game is just too frustrating to look past it's faults.Asside from those issues, the graphics are lousy, the game chugs along and is very slow.

												This was truely a disappontment for me. I saw so much potential in this game, but between the unnecessary delays when making selections, the clunky UI, and bugs related to setting up trade routes, this game is extremely frustrating for anyone who is expecting an ease of use experience, common with most newer games today. With that said, this game is a bit older, which accounts for a lot of the delays. I can't recommend this game to anyone brand new to the series, as this is the only experience I have had with any of The Guild games. This game really is dependent on individual tastes.			"

												This game is cruel, I work so hard to climb up the politics level by pickpocketing. With enough cash and being labelled a Walking Nightmare, I finally reached the 2nd hierachy in the politics. However, I can't become the mayor or soveregn because the guy same rank as me was her husband. If I did something bad to one of them, the other person will hate me. I can't blackmail her because she is pure as a white paper. I can't bribe my subordinates because they are hell lot richer than me. Btw her daughter slapped me for giving her an expensive wine. Fu ck her. Now I'm determined to bring that whole family DOWN. :)			"

												Don't know how anyone could give this a good review. It is unplayable. Crashes almost every time I save. Worse, it seems to clobber save files as well... Whatever is causeing it, I am 64 Bit OS, and I have 16GB of RAM, so it isn't the ""usual"". I am just glad it was cheap, and on sale.			"

												It's clumsy. The controls are wonky and often times at odds. The UI often fights itself and it feels like 3 people wrote a lot of the interface without ever speaking or confering.It's buggy and imbalanced. Some buildings do little to nothing. Some are so amazing you'd be silly not to build them.But it tries. The Guild II Renaissance explores concepts most others don't, it finds new places to look and play in a well-traveled domain.But it's still buggy and clumsy and feels like it overreached its budget.

												So I picked up the base game in the sales it played ok though was really full of bugs most up to the point of making it unplayable but for the sale price it was really worth it so if you can pick that up go for it but stay away from the DLC!This DLC (Unsure about pirate one as I brought thme together) is so ridled with bugs it just does not make it playable at all, the first game I did it kept pausing itself and then after awhile just would not unpause had a memory leak and borked out so I had to task manager out of it, The second playthrough was met by placing a building and then well the building never built or anything... it was placed down and then was gone but I was still not allowed to rebuild it... Play 3 my character was completely invisible and I had no idea where he was... that is where I quit it! Don't even buy this in the sale it was rushed and in my professional opinion as a Games Developer ""UNFINISHED"" if this was sent to my QA department I'd fling it so far back into its design phrase you'd all have to wait another 4 years for it hahaa..If you really want to play it as I said DO NOT buy the DLC (Rennaisance or Pirates) just diver on over to the base game.. but I warn you that is full of bugs that at times take away vital features of the game (such as your courted girl refusing to enter the church or on my last playthrough the hospital just taking my money and ignoring me) In total I give the base game a 4/10 it has something but needs a lot of work it was rushed and in my eyes just a money earner, this DLC I give a 0/10 it is unplayable and marked by me as (UNFINISHED), Enjoy your night!

												I really really want to like this game, the premise is fantastic and the gameplay is engaging. It would be one of the best, most original and well executed games except for one glaring issue. Everything is buggy as hell. In my first playthrough I ran into a bug where I couldn't finalize the automated trade routes, consequently I had to do every single individual resource transfer manually. This made it borderline impossible to progress past owning a few basic facilities. This, among other glitches, ruined the game for me.Do not buy this game. By giving money to developers like this you set a bad precedent.			"

												Not too bad.  This is probably a $2.49 game for the following reasons:- I don't quite see the replayability being very highOnce you get the game premise there's not much to changing professions.- The UI is deplorableThere's no way to intuitively just pick up the game - you HAVE to read the manual, and delays in dialogs appearing on the order of 3 seconds add to frustration.- There are bugsFor example, a UI element will get ""stuck"" and rendering the game unplayable.  Close the game and restart it and things work again.+ The game concept is nice+ The context overlaps with other games like Patrician (1400s Europe)+ The game is funny.

												This game is amazing, I started out playing on the 1.17 version and the bugs were so bad I had to call an Exterminator. Once I reinstalled the game I got the 1.21 version and this game has become one of my all time favorites. Admittedly it does kinda lack in content but on the other hand I am more attuned to AAA games, that does not change the fact that I have dropped over 50hrs into it. This game has been icked up by a different developer who is creating a third Installment (due in 2016ish) so I cannot reccomend the game unless you got your bills caught up, snacks, bought your weekly drugs and still have a spare $10.FYI Drugs are bad.

												I have been a big gan of The Guild since i first touched the guild 1 years and years ago. I have all of them on cd still but decided to buy the steam version when it was on sale just to have a back up.Its somewhat of a niche game though. I highly doubt the vast majority of people would enjoy it. Its very slow and time consuming, especially if you go multiplayer. The game is incredibly buggy also. Most of the bugs are not game breaking but they can get very annoying. I reccomend heavily modding the game. Its fairly easy to do and mostly involves changing numerical values in text and if your able to understand basic html you shouldnt have a problem really working with the files to get what you need done. (i know the coding isnt in html but it isnt much more difficult than that to edit).Personally i love the game. Die Gilde i spent tons and tons of hours on. 2 I have quite a bit of time into as well just killing time at work and home. I personally like to make the game as difficult as possible for myself. I start with almost no money and a house and give the npcs a bunch of advantages. But for lighter game play id reccomend giving yourself a big advantage which is easily done by editing the config file and changing a few numbers.All in all id give it a 7.5/10 due mostly to bugs and difficulty setting up multiplayer matches (which require you to have all files exactly the same in a game that needs major editing to work at least somewhat properly). But i want to note this game is not going to be up everyones alley for certain and while i think people should at least try it i know many will be dissapointed.			"

												I was really looking forward to playing this game however the mouse doesn't show up and this renders the game unplayable, I am running windows 10 Home with an i7 6700k/R9-390x.  From reading about other people who have had the same problem it looks like this game only works if you are running an older computer with an OS from around the time this game was first made. I am no computer expert though and I am sure someone more competent with computer's  could get it to work, however If that isn't you and you don't like searching through old obscure forum posts for hours and trying to manually change things inside of set up directories etc to try and get it to work I would suggest not buying this game. I tried many of the fix's that were suggested and none worked, I wasted 3-4 hours doing this and gave up. It would be amazing if the game developers would release a patch so it would work on newer windows 10 machines. At this point I am out money and can't play the game.  Game still looks like a lot of fun just wish I could play it :(			"

												Damn, 90% off now. This game is great. Much better than The Sims medieval. More than just a business simulator - you gotta stay alive, make friends and start a family. Only downside is that you can only control 3 characters at a time. Seems a bit limiting. I'd have liked to be able to control all family characters. Just buy it already!			"

If you get the intro crash bug just check the forum. If you dont get why people dont like you ingame. Its because your rivals are using the central town message board to post negative stuff about you. Yeah, the game is not like others. Check it out!			"

												After so many years in existance the new developers (Nordic Games, that bought the license after Jowood took a nosedive into the abyss) finally patched it up so it is as fantastic and magnificent as intended from the beginning. From having game-breaking multiplayer issues and a great amount of bugs (and no effective bugspray) to be a, for once, fully functional version of itself making it reach for the stars, past Sir God and Mr. Jesus to infinity and beyond to be remembered always for being the sole heir to the throne of sandbox-/trade-/building-/medieval-/dynasty-/family-/murder-/backstabbing-/priest-/political-/bishop-/smith-/♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-/pirate-/robbery-/beer-/inn-/flu-/spouse-/babymaking-/dancing-/walking-/courtroom-/goad-/capitalistic-/bombing-/sabotage-/shipfaring-/buisness management-/woodcutter-/gravedigging-simulators with pretty deep RPG elements. Let's just say the game is pretty unique and as of now it's actually WORKING!metaphors aside this game is really good and now if you've ever wanted to try this game now is the best time to do it as the game is now fully playable. Also, as some reviewers pointed out before, The Guild 3 is on the way and Nordic Games are the right developers to get it done.			"

You can for example take the honest way of owning your own stores and factories and make money that way. Or become a preacher and build your own church en make money by giving sermons. Is this to clean cut for you?

												Update Jan.14.2017 Cold Hard Facts:  Game Launched July 2010 - Broken & Buggy beyond belief Latest Patch 4.211 released August 2015  (5 years worth of patches!!) - STILL tremendously Broken & Buggy. (Frankentstein himself functions better than this game) 6+ years after this game has released, Fanatical players see all negative reviews on steam as a personal attack on them & respond by trolling negative reviews with ad hominem arguments & smashing dislike buttons where applicable; effectively doing more to hurt the game they all love so much rather than help it. Original Review:TLDR: Broken beyond belief. Not worth your time even if it were free...Honestly, I tried really hard to have fun with this game. 11 to 12 hours of solid gameplay, 2 hours of learning form videos about this game on youtube, cause I was thinking: ""there must be something I'm missing here. Either I just don't know about all the mechanics, or I'm doing something wrong, or both..."". But no, none of that was the case. The problem with this game is that it is just plain broken. Out of all the mechanics in the game that are at the player's disposel, only 1 actually works (if only clumsilly).The impression I get from this game as far as what the dev's envisioned is bassically Crusader Kings turned Sims. Or even think of this game like this: turn House of Cards into a PC game, and set it in the medieval/renaissance era. Which, when hashed out on paper, sounds great and I think there's actually a need for a game like that in the PC market. Unfortunately, The execution on this game is just not there.The only mechanic that actually works 100% of the time in this game is the charchter's ability to make money, but making money in this game is not fun. it's a mindless 'Point & Click' chore. Every other mechanic is just down right broken.Want one of your character's to rob someone? Tough, cause it's broken. I actually took the time to find every single chacter on the map I was playing on (and I mean EVERYONE) and tried to rob them with both my main character and my ""henchmen"", and the game would not allow me to attempt to rob anyone. So then I thought: ""ok, maybe it's the buildings that I'm supposed to rob"". Tried to rob everysingle building on the map, and again, no dice. So why even have it in the game if it's broken?!?Want to bribe the Mayor to ellect you into office? Don't bother, because every other applicant will bribe him for the exact same amount you do, which essentially nullifies all the bribes given by everyone because he ends up equally favouring everyone. In one particualr ellection, I decided to show up to the council meeteing early so that I could bribe him right there in the council hall before the voting started. I then watched hillariously as every single npc in the council hall handed him a sack of money. I was like number 8 in line with my bribe. Needless to say, I wasted my money and so did the npc's.Want to Sabbotage a business owend by a competing faction? Tough nuts, because Sabbotaging a building doesn't have any effect on the business' abilty to function what so ever. Because you have to sabbotage it multiple times and there's a 7 hour cool down period on the sabbotage ability (in-game time of course), and by the time you've bombed the business enough for it to actually have an effect, someone's just going to lay charges against you and throw your bung-hole in jail. Sure, you can pull off 1 or 2 sabbotages with out having too much incriminating evidence floating around, but it takes more than that, so you will get caught. So therefore, pointless.I'm not even scratching the surface here. There are sooooooo many broken mechanics that I do not have the time or the patients to list them all here. Conclusion:I bought this game on sale for under 3 bucks, and I feel very lucky that I didn't spend any more then that. And please, don't buy into the youtube videos that supposedly show you how this game works and then claim its a ""good game""....In fact, now that I think back, every video I watched never contained a single second of mid-game or even late-game play time. And that makes alot of sense, because this game is 'deceptivley' broken:In the first 2 hours of the first playthrough, you might feel proud that you've started a thriving business, gotten married and had kids to carry on your ""Dynasty"", and bought your familly a higher ""Title"", and that will give you the illusion that this game is ""Fun"". But then when you try to make use of all the game mechanics provided for you in order to progress further than that (i.e. get ellected in to office, hostel take-over of competing dynasty's buildings, bribery and blackmail, etc...), you'll slowly find that those game mechanics just do not work at all. And its sad. because the idea behind this game is so great. Motives for this game were great; method's in making this game were crack♥♥♥♥♥ There are early access games that are more pollished than this game, and bare in mind, this game is on it's 4th itteration already...So no, I can not, in good clean conciense, recommend this game, even if it were free, let allone 80% off. Sorry dev's, but you bought a really bad, sour apple here. Rumor has it there will be a ""Guilds 3"", and I really hope they're just that: Rumours.... "

												This game has a lot of potetial. However, the amount of bugs that are still presenting in game is unacceptable. Even with the last bug fixes mod, the game is still bring more frustration than joy. Not mention that the balance of the economic in game is next to broken. The only ways to access to better equipment is to producing it. The market hardly ever has anything better than the lowest gear. Futhermore, the amount of micromanagement is extremly annoying. For example: In order to upgrade equipment of the employee, it is required to individually sellect them, lead them to wherever place which those items are stored or can be bought, then drag one item at a time to the right slot, which is more then six of them. If the employee die or be killed, every items will disappear.If all or at least the major issues were addressed and fixed , this game would enjoin a much better successful.			"

My character regularly walked about in circles trying to get into a building right next to him.The game is buggy and very unintuitive, tooltips are far and few for many things.I recommend saving your money. The game has a ton of potential, but the execution is bad. Unless you already know how to play or plan on looking up guides, you will have a stressful time getting into this.			"

												Do not buy this game. It looks promising, the premise is neat, and it is currently on sale but you will waste hours of your time searching for the nugget of gold within this game only to realize it is just a lump of charcoal.There is no tutorial, it is incredibly unclear what you can and cannot do so there will be lots of trial and error and googling of silly things like ""how do you talk to people"" and ""can you rotate buildings."" It also runs like a one legged jack-rabbit and once you finally figure everything out it ends up being incredibly boring.Sadly it's oddly intrigueing and addictive nature is preventing me from abandoning this all together - I actually benched ""The Witcher III"" for this! Save yourself and don't buy this game!5/10 Would not buy again.			"

Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette.

												The Guild 2 Renaissance is what I would call a diamond in the rough.  It's really fun and enjoyable in a way that I find unique.  The rough part of this game are some of the glaring bugs that appear when you manually control production buildings like carts not appearing at the market or back at the building (Have to save, go to main menu, then reload to fix), fishing boats won't move across water unless under AI control, etc.Although whether this was a bug or just an indiscretion in the coding, I had the head of a rival family put in the city dungeon for assaulting a chicken.Gameplay 10/10Bugs  5/10Put rival in jail for assaulting a chicken 10/10Would recommend.

												All right, so I'm giving this game a positive review, but it comes with caveats. I'm going to be frank, I love this game. If you and a few friends get together to play, or even on your own, it's ridiculously entertaining and will engage your interest for hours. BUT the caveat is that it has some bugs and breaks which are pains in the♥♥♥♥♥ Almost all of these bugs I've encountered revolve around the UI and it's either malfunctioning or non-existance in one case. Caravans travelling long distance can also get trapped and stuck on each other which is awfully annoying, but if they're your own then it can be rectified easily by assuming direct control. The political system is a bit broken in that once a family gets a monopoly on the higher offices, there's no way in except some thuggish skullduggery, and that dynasties will often completely ignore mutual assistance pacts and relationship when it comes to voting. Many times in the city council, the UI will tell me that I'm about to get a unanimous vote for some position, but often despite all their votes being ""for me"" they all wind up voting for my competitor instead, completely ignoring what was visibly a victory. I've dropped over 100,000 gold into the political process and absolutely could not get elected due to these issues with the election system, so if you're looking to simulate politics then you should probably look to Crusader Kings II instead. I've ragged on about these issues with the game, but really everything else is wonderful. The jobs all work out fine and building a business empire is both gratifying and cathartic. Whether you run a criminal empire of breaking into buisnesses for cash and roughing up travellers for pocket change, or a patron farmer taking their crops to market and running a local brewery, this game has countless hours of fun to offer, particularly to people who are interested in roleplaying with their friends. Especially for it's price of 99 cents at the time of this sale, I've gotten nearly 30 hours of enjoyment out of 1 USD. Buggy though it may be, I accept them considering the price of the game, and also considering they're almost never game breaking since it autosaves at the beginning of every day.			"

												To start, the game has a lot of bugs such as NPC's disapearing, walking in circles, karts getting permanently stuck just to name a few. While most of these are minor annoyances, they synergize with the really clunkly and awkward menus and interface. It took me a while to get anything working as a result of the difficult interface and sporadic bugs. I had to go in loops trying to figure out why I couldn't do the most simple tasks only to learn that the buttons had ceased working and my game needed to be restarted. The idea of the game seems really cool to me, but it could really use a much cleaner or clearer interface. Now IF you are able to get through the bad mechanics and like management econemy based games you will probably like this.			"

												Carts are broken (they just stop at the market and never unload and come back) and everything relies on carts. Makes it unfortunately unplayable but it takes a while into the game to have enough buildings that you need the carts really, so it isn't possible to refund anymore by that time. Otherwise I would absolutely recommend that game. I think it is unbelievable that they keep selling it with this bug.			"

												I don't know where to start with this inestimable treasure to the simulation gaming world. I don't know what I like more, the frequent visual bugs, the constant presence of the black plague in maps without hospitals, or the fact that sometimes the language randomly switches to german. Designing a character is about as stimuating as Perelli's miracle elixir but unfortunately you don't get to keep that character for long because he will either die of the plague or be turned invisible by a rogue memory leak. The day to day gameplay, aside from when your guarded carts are being pillaged by old ladies and your house next to the guard's post is being robbed, is pretty standard. You build a farm and you watch your character farm. This goes on for the entire game, although occasionally you get to randomly hug people and marry them so they can bear you children who will continue to work on your farm and continue the whole ugly cycle. Despite all of this, it's the best terrible game i've ever played.			"

												An extremely fun and time consuming game, albeit quite buggy. It's quite the sandbox, and you start out as a lowly plebian and build your way up through legitimate business or other endeavours of your choosing, which could include being a pirate, an a*shole, or a thief.The game's best mod pack can be found here: http://forum.runeforge-games.net/index.php/topic,5794.msg14581.html#msg14581 and is highly recommended if you want the best possible gameplay experience.Although I only have 10 hours on record, I put many, many hours into this game before I had it on Steam.

												I'm fairly sure the developers never played their game as a game, rather than a feature set. If they had, they would have noticed the tedious busy-work.

												Well, I can't say much about this game.  From all the comments I figured it was some kind of city building meets ""The Sims"", but in reality I found it to be an extremely confusing and frustrating game.  From the very start I had no idea what I was doing.  My house would be robbed without me knowing how to stop it.  I spent the limited money trying to figure out how to make it back, and not succeeding.  The game is rather impossible to play without watching a lengthy tutorial, but you have to find that yourself on YouTube since I saw no sign of one in the game.  I'm glad I got this game as part of a bundle, because if I would have purchased it on it's own I would really be regretting the purchase right now.			"

Not even opening task manager and ending process worked and that is the first time I've heard of that.I plan to give this game another go butonly when I'm sure it wont crash again.For those curious, I am on Windows 10 with a GTX780.Update: After tampering with config files I managed to fix the issue and after 10 minutes of playing Ireally cant get over how bug-ridden this game is. My character is sometimes simply unselectable and immovable and the UI is really poorly laid out. I'm gonna go ahead and guess that this game is excellent judging from the gameplay I've seen from other people but if you're new to the game I'm not sure it will be worth it to learn how to play.

												If you compare this to ""the Guild""one, it`s practically a rip off. It has more similarities with those browser based clickbait games than with a full computer game. The love for detail found in the first game is completely missing. Don`t buy.			"

												What a piece of shitake mushrooms. The learning curve is not just steep, its a sheer cliff. You have no idea what to do unless you sit through a 2 hour tutorial, where everything is unskippable video and you are unable to key in on the task you are interested in. There is no glossary and nothing is immediately obvious or intuitive. You make a person, and then...? what? buy something? It takes a while to even figure out how to move. Once you divine that you are intended to build buildings in order to create a production line, you are at a loss as to how to get people to work. I choose patron, and attempt to build a farm, only there appears to be nowhere in the city where I am allowed to build. Fine, I'll build a bakery on the one scrap of open real estate and buy the raw materials then, even at a loss at least its something. Twiddling my thumbs while it opens, I then send a cart to market to obtain flour and honey, which makes biscuits I assume from the ""production"" menu of my new bakery. I deliver these ingredients to the bakery, and then...what?? there is no icon anywhere to make the biscuits, all i can do is move the ingredients back and forth from the cart. None of the equipment visible in the bakery are clickable, and my new employee simply stands there like a dumb f****** cow. The production menu offers no insights, there is no button that is intuitive on how to make any items. I see ""biscuits"" and their ingredients listed on the left....and what? Make them, ♥♥♥♥♥! What am i supposed to do? Where is the help icons or something to identify what I need to do immediately. Even if i wanted to go back to the tutorial I would have to sit through it from the very f***** beginning! F*** this, i have better things to do with my life. Uninstall.			"

												Fun game of building families, businesses and climbing the social ladder over the years.Good fun multiplayer but you can't marry into the same family. You can only join the same ""team"" which doesn't really do much.Incredibly unbalanced (rogues are unbeatable) and glitchy. But there isn't another game like it.Don't buy the pack, just buy renaissance, it includes all the other games anyway!Doesn't include the tutorials from the original Guild 2, check youtube for user contributed ones.

												This game is still an interesting and fun game. It has a lot of great ideas that could potentially be used by other games later on. I find it quiet enjoyable to play as a rogue family and make toll booths with my mercenaries so that all the carts must go through me to get the goods were they need to be. No one likes me at the end of the game though *shrug*. I enjoy owning a mine, making huge bank, and then spending that bank to actually build a bank for my Doctorate son. I enjoy running an inn, and watching all the serfs spend all their hard-earned money getting drunk after a long days work. Though this game does have some bugs, but none of which are game breaking. For instance, the AI is too pacisft, never really bothering to interrupt my family other then maybe plundering my new tiny shop, or beating up my sons second wife. I only got murdered twice in the hours I have spent. The learning curve has gotten harder, for originally in PotES, buildings were going on sale left and right, but now buildings are rarely sold, adding a bit of competition to the game. Another issue I have with the game is that titles are WAY too expensive compared to PotES and the original. I do like how becoming a nobleman to become a king is a lot harder now, but 100000 gold? I could get a baron title with that in the other games! They do add other titles to fill in the gaps with the game, but they just dont feel right to have. These things are minor things however, and can be overlooked. Most people have modded the game to fix these problems, and you can find a lot of them at Runeforge's forums.			"

												Ignore the negative reviews, this game is fantastic, there are the odd few bugs but they aren't game breaking, and it is old now so the tech certainly isn't impressive but it still holds hours apon hours of potential gameplay. I won't say modding is essential but it certainly makes the game more interesting, and if you're not a fan of micromanagement it will make the game much easier, so head over to the runeforge forums and sign up. But otherwise it is a great game, the politics is fun, the dialogue is cheesy, but in a good way, and the art syle and model design really grows on you.			"

												Don't get me wrong, it's a buggy game, lipsync and dialogue is terrible, there's no learning curve, the black death is painful (I got rid of it through tweaking a game file), and pathmapping is at times hilarious. For all that though it is a really fun and adicting game. Cross RPG with city building and you have The Guild 2 Renaissance. I would highly recommend playing the Guild 2 first and playing the tutorial on it in order to get the basics but once you have that down there is so much to do and so much variety that this is a game to keep you entertained for many many hours.

I had to meny times restart game the beginning, due to the freezing of the main NPC (ver 4.15).It little stings, that after the first child partner immediately catch a died of plague and repeated it twice...If bugs were fixed, planning distribution of cart was a little easier and fighting took place in one location and NPC confused scampered across the map to attack other targets, this would be a much entertainment.

												If your into roleplaying games, with rpg elements and a hint of strategy and money management.This is a game for you.You create a charecter and you choose a profession, along with a religion and stats.You customize a little bit, choose a town and family emblem.When the game starts its up to you what path you want to follow and what kind of role to play. You can get into politics and become mayor of a town, or maybe the go to guy if you need supplies and resources.You can be the dastardly rouge and commit crimes, steal, and cause grief for the town. Or be the man of honor and become the town watchmen, find and defeat the thieves and villians.Become a doctor, opening a clinic and healing the sick and broken.You could try being a clergymen and spread the good will of god, and educate the ill-informed.A simple farmer, to a noblemen of high status.It's up to you who you want to be, and find the role you want to play.You pathe your own destiny.

												Harder than the Add-On The Guild 2: Pirates of the European Seas, but still, very addictive.  It is still very unclear as to what to do at times like:1.  I Still Don't Know How to Create Most Objects.2.  Food?3.  This Needs A Refresh Tutorial.4.  It is Unclear as to Who's Sheild Belongs to Who.Other than that...Great Game.  The Politics Portion is a bit Harder.  You have to Bribe, Compliment, and Begile everyone that's Probably Voting before the Election.  Love how The Assembly Hall has a an Entrance Hall to it.  It's a little harder, as well in the Election Department because you have to move-up in Class in Order to become Mayor.  So, if you're in for some Hard(er)-Core Fun, then this is the Game for You!  :)			"

												Very challanging, lots of bug , no longer being developed very closely. Great game if you dont mind a challange and some modding to fix some bugs. The developers do not focus on the game anymore as it seems. There was talk about a new version but that died out. Overall if you can get past all the bugs then you should have a great time! i know i love it even with the bugs.			"

												As far as I'm concerned, this is the best looking historical microeconomics simulation game on the market. Admittedly a small niche, but in a world where macroeconomic grandstrategy is what gets attention, this is a nice change of pace. It can be tedious, but in the most cathartic way possible; I don't feel particularly excited when my dynasty purchases a new title - it's more of a zen sensation. The combat and wooing systems are comical, and you can pretty much amass a fortune by over saturating the market with a single, easy-to-produce item (like sugar beets). That said, I can't recommend it enough. I always seem to forget its inadequacies when I remember that it allows me to arm my monks with daggers and longswords and sic them on the town like a hyperreligious biker gang.			"

												Don't get me wrong, it's a buggy game, lipsync and dialogue is terrible, there's no learning curve, the black death is painful (I got rid of it through tweaking a game file), and pathmapping is at times hilarious. For all that though it is a really fun and adicting game. Cross RPG with city building and you have The Guild 2 Renaissance. I would highly recommend playing the Guild 2 first and playing the tutorial on it in order to get the basics but once you have that down there is so much to do and so much variety that this is a game to keep you entertained for many many hours.

												This is a mixture between character building and city management.  You can focus on building your family to take over the economy, or you can run for office where you can climb your way to the top and do whatever you please without anyone questioning you because you have immunity! Or you can do both.  Plus there is the part where you show other families that you love them or just beat the dog crap out of them through politics or violence.The only down side to this game is the fact that it is buggy out the wahzoo.

												So glad that the newest update came out. The game is still a little buggy but no where near as bad as it was previously. If you are a fan of micromanaging and RTS games - especially for the medieval era, you should try this bad boy out. Own and operate multiple businesses (up to 999 at the highest nobility rank), use hired thugs to beat down your opponents, marry and have kids, send them to school then turn them in to assassins and either kill your enemy in the streets of the city or call him out for a duel! Or raise your children the proper way and use them to operate your various establishments, including but not limited to brothels, farms and blacksmiths.Sometimes I play for hours just to build up my businesses, make alliances with everyone and never beat the game. Just continue building and expanding. Once in awhile, i'll murder someone to keep the plebs in line though. ;-)As usual, my steam hours arent near accurate. Played this game offline, A LOT! Says i have 80 hours now, but its probably closer to 150-160.Anyways, 9/10 (would be a perfect score but due to bugs and glitches, 9 is still very good)			"

												This is by far one of the most unique games I've played. In broad terms it's a game about business management and politics. It's filled with bugs and game ending crashes. It's got a slow pace and tons of micro management.  But it's fun and challenging. There's a lot of different ways to succeed, and you can play it good or bad or just mind your business. The game has lot's of issues when it comes to multiplayer. Out of sync errors are something you get used to. The auto-savings helps with that. what I love the most about it though is the silly quirks it has, weird humour and not really taking itself too seriously. Where the sims is about amassing stuff and crap; This game is about being a Citizen, political or otherwise and amassing wealth for your dynasty.""You are a knave!"" yes... yes... I know.9/10			"

After you get a feel for that part of the game there is still politics to involve you, the scheming to find your other office mates and meet them on a dark road and end them for there place or to bribe or talk yourway into position.Also rather fun is that each town has its own economy so things that are not needed in one you will find a buyer in a far away area, it you may find that a far away area has goods that you can buy there and bring back for either personal use or selling yourself.I find that I still even after playing for quite a long time and maybe taking breaks now and then still come back to this game every once and awhile and still find enjoyment in it.

												Ok so I used to play this game back when I had the disk copy (a LOOOOOOONG time ago) and it's still fun for a plane ride or killing time when needed. The graphics are definitely outdated and it is SUPER BUGGED!!! You can even play one game, start a new one without changing any settings, and suddenly people can run for mayor without holding any office, you can buy any building regardless of type and other immersion breaking (though easily exploitable) situations.Those things aside though; BUY THIS GAME! It's just a lot of fun! Dueling an enemy who keeps running against you in office, having your goons follow people around gathering evidence against them for court, poisoning the well of the other town where your rival dynasty lives and then burning down the hospital so if, IF they survive the long trek to your hospital (which happens to be the only one left - oops), they have to pay way above the normal prices... these things are awesome! Don't like politics and running for office? Be a scholar, create the mage's guild, build a firebomb and then destroy a city! Don't feel like all that? Be a bandit - kidnap and murder people for fun! Need the life of a farmer, just making bread from the wheat you grow? .... ok. You can do that too, if you're really wanting to for some reason.It's an excellent game with a bit older graphics but tons of fun still left in it. I fully recommend it!			"

												If you've never played this particular franchise before then The Guild 2: Renaissance is for you.You manage a dynasty which starts with one family member and you can invest, bribe, steal or war you way to making your dynasty the monarchy.  You can increase your family insize through courtship and marriage or if you aren't into that there is always on of those ladies of the night that tends to work for Rogue operators.You can own a multitude of businesses that start from the basic type and are upgraded for a price.  Your characters profession shapes the path you can follow with which businesses you can own, however you can have 3 active dynasty members with different profession types (there are four professions to choose from)The most recent patch removes some (if not most) of the bugs in the single player game, I've not tried the multiplayer however be prepared to setup an LANoIP setup (and be ready to deal with some of the bugs that currently occur from not using a dedicated games host.)All in all, there isn't really and single game that is like The Guild and it's franchise.  It's worth checking out.			"

Play a family, but start as one man or women who owns a shop of some type and a house, all upgradable12 other families who try to kill you, and each other off Very much like EA's sims, where you don't have any real direct control, in terms of button mashing ect, over the outcomes of actionsThere are a few ways you can play, but the most effective is a heavy handed approach, dealing in robbery and murderYou can kidnap and torture rivalsDueling (largely automatic)Run for offices, set up your family in elected positions as wellGaphics are not great and there is a memory leak of some type that can slow down the gameYou win or lose the game very quickly, within the first 2 -10 years, depending on your style, you can either ride out, wipe out or be wiped out by all threat families, though you keep playing for long after any major challange			"

												The Guild II is a fine single-player strategy game, but where it really shines is in multiplayer (LAN/Hamachi compulsory), as you conspire with a buddy to fill up all elected positions in each town or city-state, with various members of your dynasty. Once this is accomplished, the game feels as though it has run its course, but the stories generated by the hours-long journey there are fit to rival any Hollywood plot. The sheer number of options given to criminals in The Guild II is dizzying. Kidnapping, murder, bombing, arson, mugging; and these are just some of the options given to civilians, never mind the awful things you can do to rival factions, or even the Royal Family, if you are elected to a post that gives command over the city guards. That these things can be done to a rival family controlled by a human player; that you can have agents stalk other players, to witness their various crimes and report them to the authorities, or bomb their gold mine, crippling their entire production chain, makes this game an absolute joy to play. It really is something special. If you'd like to read a more in-depth review, have a look at my new site! Shameless plug, etc! http://www.firesidefrag.com/the-guild-2-jerk-politician-simulator/But seriously, look at how many hours I've clocked in. None of that was idle time. It's good.			"

												Like many other who have written reviews of this game i too have mixed feelings. It has the ye olde buisness tycoon style of other games such as the Port Royale and Patrician series (both of which i am mixed on to whether liking or hating) but with a sort of a sim style to the approach. Its a weird but interesting little mix of the buisness aspect but also controlling your own characters and how they can effect the game. Voice acting is...tolerable. I wish the developers could have just stuck with sim giberish and text boxes. The graphics are okay nothing special and yes there are a ton of bugs.    However I find that there is a lot of replay ability if you install the fanmade patch for the game as it fixes most of the games issues. There are mulitple different classes to choose, different buisnesses to operate and a political system to get involved in. However once again the AI is smart just not smart enough if you want a  major challenge. You can imprison, commit arson, kidnap, or even murder your competition and take over there buisness. Intermarrying classes works to your advantage so yo can opertate outside of your own characters limits and the generational effect is a nice touch. So i would reccomend this game because for $9.99 you get a little more than you paid for in replayability and because the concept of buisness tycoon with medieval politics and simulation is a great concept...it just wasn't done well here. I say give it a try and see what you think if you like it great if not well steam has a refund policy now.			"

												Ich habe bis jetzt 12 Runden gespielt bis Sommer 1412, 1 Runde= 1Jahr und es ärgert mich schon wieder maßlos, denn obwohl die Bugs ""Drehende Karren"" und ""Absturz von Savegames"" behoben wurden, sind sie bei mir vorhanden - und ich habe das letzte Update installiert! 4.20 Final  - manchmal lassen sich die angeblich kaputten Savesgames sogar laden und dann mal wieder nicht. Ich hatte auch einen Bug, dass die Umworbene (Brautschau) plötlich eine andere Person war, als die um die man geworben hat - anderer Name, Alter, Erfahrung, Dynastie, Beruf. Ich bin grad an einen Punkt angekommen an dem sich das Spielen nicht mehr lohnt, da wo es dann eigentlich richtig Spaß macht, man macht Kohle steigt in der Politik auf und hat 4-5 Betriebe am laufen, nur stürzen ständig die Savegames ab oder die Karren drehen sich, weil irgendeine Person (letzten ein AI Dieb) an einer Stelle war und den Bug somit ausgelöst hat, geht auch nicht weg wenn man die Person umnieten läßt, die Stelle zieht alles wie ein schwarzes Loch an und die Karren drehn sich. Mich ärgert es sehr wenn man jedesmal Zeit verliert um wieder beim letzten Save das funktioniert anzufangen nur um dann wieder dort anzufangen weil irgend etwas nicht funktioniert... ich hör jetzt auf zu spielen da es sich nicht lohnt und man nur seine Zeit verliert, lieber ne Runde Patrizier 4, das funktioniert besser!

												This is a very good game, Set in the middle ages in which you start with only one person from your family. You eventually get married, have children, build your own business that you'll have to mantain through time, scale up within society until you become someone powerful. One of the best sim games I've ever played.			"

												I love the game Anno and The Settler 1-3 and 5. So this game had all the attributes to take me. Unfortunately, the overall balance i bad. Therefore, 90% of lets play is as a rogue.  Game contain a lot of errors, jams, incomplete AI. I had to meny times restart game the beginning, due to the freezing of the main NPC (ver 4.15).It little stings, that after the first child partner immediately catch a died of plague and repeated it twice...If bugs were fixed, planning distribution of cart was a little easier and fighting took place in one location and NPC confused scampered across the map to attack other targets, this would be a much entertainment. Now reigns frustration ... "

												As far as I'm concerned, this is the best looking historical microeconomics simulation game on the market. Admittedly a small niche, but in a world where macroeconomic grandstrategy is what gets attention, this is a nice change of pace. It can be tedious, but in the most cathartic way possible; I don't feel particularly excited when my dynasty purchases a new title - it's more of a zen sensation. The combat and wooing systems are comical, and you can pretty much amass a fortune by over saturating the market with a single, easy-to-produce item (like sugar beets). That said, I can't recommend it enough. I always seem to forget its inadequacies when I remember that it allows me to arm my monks with daggers and longswords and sic them on the town like a hyperreligious biker gang.			"

												Don't get me wrong, it's a buggy game, lipsync and dialogue is terrible, there's no learning curve, the black death is painful (I got rid of it through tweaking a game file), and pathmapping is at times hilarious. For all that though it is a really fun and adicting game. Cross RPG with city building and you have The Guild 2 Renaissance. I would highly recommend playing the Guild 2 first and playing the tutorial on it in order to get the basics but once you have that down there is so much to do and so much variety that this is a game to keep you entertained for many many hours.

												Pretty intersting Sim-type game.  There are definitely issues with compatability and gameplay but its playable for the most part and in windowed-mode to boot.  I don't see a point in getting the original Guild II as this seems to include everything in the original and the pirates version, except for the tiny ""campaign"", plus a few new building/professons.  The AI is ok but seems deadset on killing you, especially members of the other dynasties when they can.  It is also quite annoying that your family members do absolutely nothing but sit in the house and die unless you control them as one of the three controlable character slots.  Seems to me they missed on one of the biggest strategies of the medeval period, that of inter-marriage of noble families to consolidate power and settle disputes.  You only have the option of courting random jobless serfs with reputations that change every time you check their profile.  Overall, especially for the minimal cost Humble Bundle had for the game, its probablly worth at least a few hours of enjoyment before becoming overly repetitive.			"

												Way more Simulation than RTS, this game would appeal to anyone who wants to immerse themselves in the life of a poor to wealthy person in Europe during the Renaissance.  Different options to your character include courting a perspective spouse, running for local office, and of course expanding your mercantile empire.  If running a tavern or farm isn't your cup of tea you can always make a bandit camp and set up ""road-tolls"".Also, this game is low-price which makes it an excellent cheap purchase.			"

												yeah well.. I love these kind of games and couldn´t care less if graphics and sound and such are not state of the art. it´s the possibilities and flexibility that sets this game apart from other trade / politics / medieval industry simulations.but... and there´s always a but.. this game does lack on certain aspects. pros: -a lot of options(trader, rogue, crafstmen... it can all be done and so much more. very unique blend of RPG and trade sim..)-decent graphics for a game that oldcons: -too much micromanagementin order to have a functioning economy going, you need to almost always manage it by yourself. theres no safe way (or I just haven´t found it) to really automate the business and structures and personnel to really do what you want them towhich directly leads to the second con-politics is a pain in the buttocksin order to gain influence and climb the political ladder, you need to gain influence. but about the only thing that really worked for me (and I tried everything) was to bribe people. which is useless if everyone else does the same.I dedicated a whole new career save just to gain influence and climb the political ladder, but to no avail. when you concenrate on gaining influence, you simply run out of money. when you concentrate on making money, you will never gain enough influence. once your enemies gain enough political influence (seems they don´t have the problem micromanaging everything like I do) they can use their political powers to just jail you, accuse you, kill you, whatever. I haven´t been able to find any decent late game tutorials and descriptions and I have to agree to some other review I read: the late game purely annoys. instead of being able to concentrate on late game activities like politics, intrigue and such, you will have nothing else to do than micromanaging your economy. sure, money won´t be a problem. but it won´t help you at all. it was fun the first hours, but got old, tedious and boring pretty fast. for the price I paid it´s quiet alright. but if you expect deeper gameplay.... well. maybe you are into micromanaging. then play your heart out, this game´s for you			"

												The Guild 2 with the new Renaissance upgrade is a solid game. Not perfect mind you but solid. If you are a fan of simulation games like The Sims, or are fan of business games then this game can be enjoyable for you.Pro-There are quite a few different maps available for play. So finding a change of scenery in the game is possible, but there is no way to create your own maps which is too bad. -There are a lot of different store types in the game to experiment with-There is more than just business. Family management and politics are present as well-The timeline of the game takes place in what I say is a fairly unique setting. Few games of this type take place in that area of historyCon-Although there are a lot of maps for play the replay value on this game is weak. Much of the gameplay is the same no matter which map you play on.-There is quite a clear lack of balance between the jobs in the game. Some earn fantastic amounts of money while others make close to zero even with all of there upgrades. As well a new player has no way to know this until they play more of the game.-The AI is quite weak. They are unable to build or politcally compete with the player in any meaningful way. This means that once the player has gained any bit of power they will have nothing more than limp rivals to contend.-There are many bugs in this game. I frequently found my family in the game out thousands of dollars because one of the characters could not 'find a path' to a feature. This was just one of the many that were present.All in all if you like economic games and simulators this game does have its fun. However the fun is limited and its replay becomes shortlived with the lack of functional AI. ** out of ***** for the average gamer I would say.			"

												To summarize, this is basically a House of Cards simulator and Frank Underwood would definitely love it (now if you liked that teaser, please keep reading haha).Despite the glitches that you can find on the game, it's extremely fun to play it. The idea is pretty much unique, as you start controlling the life of someone who has an entrepreneur spirit, meaning that you have a considerable amount of freedom to pursue a specific craft (hiring employees and everything), or maybe engaging in politics. Besides that, the person that you create can also get married with other people and have children, which is something that increases the number of members on the family (it's a shame that you can only control 3 of them at the same time). In order to survive and to win the game, you literally need to find a way to eradicate all the means of competition (rival families). The fun part is that you can use your creativity to find ways to do that. For example, depending of your political position in the government, you can literally be untouchable, in other words, you may hire assassins to remove certain people out of the way and also destroy your rivals' buildings without having to worry about further consequences. You can be promoted to further rankings in politics simply by flattering with influential people and that goes for the 3 people that you control at the same time. Just a friendly advice: Don't forget to apply the latest patch! Have fun *evil laugh*.			"

												Quick run over the game and its mechanics..You start selecting your character, skills and essentially decide how you want to be the surviving dynasty. There isnt really any backstory as such. Imagine this game to be an arena styled game.. However, to win you use politics, business, sabotage, alchemy and more to defeat your opposition.You can be the scum of the earth, killing the opposition by using henchman to burn down their businesses or house.You become a king and sentence your opposition to prison and in some instances death.Or you can build a business, wait for disease to strike and use money to keep your self and family healthy and clean.In all honesty, anything goes.This game is fantastic, random, and the AI are actually quite smart.for i.e you want to get into politics, however, the entire monarch is based around a singular family and as such only vote for their own family members therefore making it very difficult to progress.The only way you can get to the top is through brides, charisma and assasinations..This being said, there are alot of bugs with the game.Inactivity bugs, save bugs, global market bugs, building placement bugs and more..but..It isnt easy to pick up either, there really isn't much of tutorial, took me about 5 hours to pick it up tbh.the game is WAAYYY to fun and unpredictable to stop playing.9/10 ♥♥♥♥ing great game			"

												I've had a lot of fun with this title, but it does start to fall apart after long-running games. I experienced massive slow-downs after more than seven or eight generations and various save and load errors. Regardless, the game is great and a great example of the real-time strategy format. I've simply modified my game type selections so I don't end up playing that long during a single session. Considering that it starts to feel like a bit of a grind around that point anyway, I don't mind the sacrifice.There are a few aspects of this game that make it stand out in its genre. The continuation of your lineage's goals over several generations, for instance, is a unique approach and adds an entire realm of activities outside of your standard economy-driven real-time strategies. Imagine adding the Sims to your favorite RTS. If that doesn't sound like fun to you, no worries, you can play out your life as a lonely hermit who doesn't get involved with the town's social affairs. There are enough game type choices that make this just as entertaining an option.If you like real-time strategies, and the medeival format entices you, I'd highly recommend giving this game a try; that is, if you can get past the dated graphics. I certainly can. If the latest graphics are a hard requirement for you, skip this one; you won't enjoy it.			"

												Great and very original game. It mixes RPG, strategy, economic strategy, turn based stategy, and realtime strategy, life simulation, politic simulation, and at the end of gameplay very rich politician-merchant with powerfull army of thugs and big family. Its rewarding, and looks beatiful event if we take into account that this is a game from 2010.Its complex, I have never played game like this before - very very unique and well crafted gem.What a pity, that it was so badly advertised when it was released. I played a lot of it, but not on steam. So dont take into account my small in-steam gameplay time.			"

												Built an army of mercenaries and thieves. killed or kidnapped everyone in the town who was running for office. Became mayor. 10/10 best political simulator.In all seriousness i would definitely recommend this game, their are so many options to do the difficult part is sticking to one save game. Multiplayer is very difficult to do, I've ben using hamachi which seems to work when it wants to but more than enough gameplay to be worth the price tag.			"

												A very serendipitous find for me, I had never heard of this game before, it popped up on my Steam feed for £2, liking the sound of it (I love games with depth) I decided to give it a go. My first 4-5 hours were spent scratching my head and wondering what the hell do I do? I finally got the hang of it and learnt that there was a patch released recently even though the game is quite old, the patch also unlocked a tutorial, which I didn't bother with as I thought I was well on my way to establishing my dynasty, it also fixed and streamlined a few things like pathfinding. It is still a little buggy but there is a fantastic deep game here that is still getting support from somewhere, more patches to come and maybe even a third game in the works, hope so.  Top game and nothing quite like it.			"

												If you've never played this particular franchise before then The Guild 2: Renaissance is for you.You manage a dynasty which starts with one family member and you can invest, bribe, steal or war you way to making your dynasty the monarchy.  You can increase your family insize through courtship and marriage or if you aren't into that there is always on of those ladies of the night that tends to work for Rogue operators.You can own a multitude of businesses that start from the basic type and are upgraded for a price.  Your characters profession shapes the path you can follow with which businesses you can own, however you can have 3 active dynasty members with different profession types (there are four professions to choose from)The most recent patch removes some (if not most) of the bugs in the single player game, I've not tried the multiplayer however be prepared to setup an LANoIP setup (and be ready to deal with some of the bugs that currently occur from not using a dedicated games host.)All in all, there isn't really and single game that is like The Guild and it's franchise.  It's worth checking out.			"

												The concept of this game is good but the execution is rather poor.  I enjoy the idea of this game and I am entertained enough to stick around awhile and try to play it despite its flaws, but there's no question that it deserves the low metacritic score it has.  The game has some major shortcomings that should have been resolved at release and I cannot recommend it due to those shortcomings.  I'll list a few of them:If you slow down the gameplay it also slows down your user interface for instance.  There's no excuse for that.  Telling your wagons where to go should be responsive whether you are paused or playing in fast forward, but because of the way the wagon command ui is tied to the world movement ticks entering commands for them at low speeds is slow and annoying.The pause feature is fairly buggy.  It stops time but some of the people are still moving around in slow motion the whole time you are ""paused"".   This is probably because the wagons and such would be completely unresponsive if they were actually completely paused due to their response to commands being tied to their movement.Sometimes my character becomes unresponsive and it wont respond to any commands anymore.  I end up having to save and reload the game just to get it to work again.  I'm sure this is also related to the buggy pause feature.Pathfinding is sometimes buggy and people will get stuck at one spot on the map and just turn in a circle repeatedly.  This is fairly rare but has happened to both my characters and the AI characters in my game.  One time I saw 20 AI stuck at one spot with my wagon and I had to save and reload the game to get everybody moving again.I still can't figure out if you are actually supposed to eat in the game.  The only time I fed two of my characters a biscuit both of them contracted tooth rot which I couldn't even treat because there was no hospital in my game.  When I run a shop I place items for sale in it that other people can buy, but when I go into the npcs shops they never seem to have anything for sale so I have to buy everything at the market.  This works, but it breaks the immersion of the game.  The tutorial has no coverage at of food or equipment or artifacts at all.  Note that there's only a tutorial currently if you download the 4.20 beta.  The base version of the game has no tutorial at all.The user interface for analyzing the profitability of your business ventures is poor.  You can't tell how much each individual business is earning or losing.  You just get some totals that encompass all your business and house expense into an end of month total.  You have no easy way to tell how much you are earning or losing on individual products in a business.I tried to participate in politics.  The political board listed the requirement as Citizen for almost all of the positions and it did not specify a level requirement, but when I bought my way up to Citizen and tried to apply for one it told me I wasn't high enough.  Either there's a hidden level requirement too or the requirement page for politics doesn't list the actual rank requirements. Anyway, you've been warned.  If you have too much time on your hands like me and you want to play a mediocre game that only costs a few bucks on sale, then go for it, but you should not pay more than a few dollars for this game.  You can get some entertainment out of it if you are willing to deal with its faults. "

												A lot of work has been done to get rid of the (many) rough edges on this title.  The AI is much better.  Pathfinding bugs are mostly gone.  And the economic system functions almost perfectly, which is to say it's a challenge.When you do get a supply chain settled, things can work quite smoothly.  I'd advise you to use the AI management after you get one or two businesses.  It costs a bit of money in game, but the micro saved is well worth it for how much you can focus on other things.There's about 20 different approaches you can take to become successful in the cities of each map.  But the highlight for me is developing your family and seeing them grow and interact with others, although I've never really gotten anywhere politically.PS. I have one copy of this game in my inventory.  If you're interested in receiving it, leave some comment to this review telling me what you think of it, as well as why you're not able to buy it yourself.  OR tell me about a friend of yours who can't really afford this, but you'd like to play it with them.			"

												Great game that will have quite a bit of reply value as you want to try the different profesions.  After you get a feel for that part of the game there is still politics to involve you, the scheming to find your other office mates and meet them on a dark road and end them for there place or to bribe or talk yourway into position.Also rather fun is that each town has its own economy so things that are not needed in one you will find a buyer in a far away area, it you may find that a far away area has goods that you can buy there and bring back for either personal use or selling yourself.I find that I still even after playing for quite a long time and maybe taking breaks now and then still come back to this game every once and awhile and still find enjoyment in it.

												The Guild 2 Renaissance is, well, quite the different game and it's hard to pin down. Imagine if you will a cocktail, three parts The Sims, two parts Crusader Kings and a dash of any German made simulator game. Shake well and you've got yourself The Guild 2.Now I think it's best to point out that I have not played most of the game modes available. I have played the dynasty mode which is kind of just the games free roam mode where there’s no quests or objectives apart from keeping your family/dynasty alive much like Crusader Kings.So the first thing you do is pick a map, this entails what villages, towns and cities you'll have in your world and the environment. I pick the ""Sheriff of Nottingham"" map since it was smaller, had a village and a town to work on and well...you know...Robin hood n'♥♥♥♥♥♥Then I picked my family shield, which also dictates the colour of your dynasties’ clothing, so naturally I went for bright orange to show my power or some such and then went on to make the founder of my dynasty, one Benn Grey. Good old Benn, was a rogue one of the four classes in the game and the more...violent and backhanded of the classes making his money and way in the world collecting a toll from passing traders dotting the road since personally I found earning money the more legal way was pretty dam tough and will take a lot of learning on the players part. As for most jobs you'll have to buy/make ingredients then make whatever your business makes, from bread to bracelets made out of bones stolen from a graveyard and sell these items in different markets and counting houses or otherwise risk lowering the buying price of your goods till you can barely make any profit anymore. Whereas being a rogue all I had to do was kidnap, murder or force people to pay a toll. Hey it's a dirty job....but I'd rather do it.So with that in mind, I set forth to make old Benn Grey the most feared gangster of the 1400's. I built my own personal merc castle and started forcing people to pay a toll just for walking through the market place, which everyone hated me for so when looking for a wife to pop out a baby and keep my family line strong, nobody wanted to marry me. So I did the smart thing and brought my own wife, good old Linette who totally didn't mind me buying her off her family. She was a Craftswoman so with my extra money I bought her a little forge to make weapons for my mercs so I would be unstoppable! She also did pop out a brat so all was looking up for Benn.So the next stop would of course be for Benn to get political power. Which in my humble view is the best part of the game. Bribing people, flirting and killing your way to the top feels so dam good and it's tough but not too tough so you feel like you have to plan and slither your way to be mayor. With Benn being a rogue I wanted him to be the village mayor because it granted him the ability to embezzle public funds and not be arrested for any crime he committed, and so sure I was that I would get the office I murdered the captain of the guard in the market in front of everyone and shot the mayor in a duel after kissing her in a pub and then calling her a ♥♥♥♥♥ after she slapped me. After this I thought I was unstoppable, until I lost my campaign to be mayor when the victor, a woman from a rival dynasty won by having her name pulled out of a hat since everyone who could vote had been killed by me. Then poor Benn was put on trial for killing the mayor and captain of the guard in public and since he didn't have the immunity he craved, was sentenced to death. After screaming ""OH YOU'RE NEXT!"" at the judge he was taken out side and had his head lopped off right where he killed the captain. A somewhat fitting end when you think about it.Finally poor Linette tried to avenge her husband by getting the Mayor’s office and killing the judge but failed over and over losing all her money in bribes selling the castle and her forge and then getting a cold and dying since she never had the coin for medicine.Overall if you enjoy roleplaying and have a stronger imagination this game is great. Oh the stories you can spin about your dynasty. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll kill your way to the top before dying from a sprained ankle and leave a two year old boy an orphan. Although you'll just as easily get muddled in the economics of the game and crash the market for grain.Personally speaking the role-play value is a 7/10, but is more like a 8/10 if you put the effort to understand the economics.I hope to see you all soon buying wives and killing mayors in this gem of a game.

												Although i like the concept of the game and enjoyed it immensly the first few days, i quickly grew weary due to the many bugs. They are not game-breaking but often force me to return to previous save-games and once forced me to completely demolish a building and build a new one in a different location because the carts could no longer enter it since it was upgraded. It is an old game and very buggy at that; but it's also cheap. So if you like the builder-simulation genre and you are a patient person you might enjoy this. For everybody else, i wouldn't recommend.  "

												One of my favourtite Games of all times...As it came to steam I bought it here too, cause its easier to install and I can support the work of the developers.No matter how much similar Games I played in the last years, The Guild is always a favourite. Even that it was so bugged all the time. With the new patch its working fine for me and I didn't discover any major bugs so far.I played Guild since Part 1 and its always a Game worth a reinstall and replay. Ok, in my case 85% of the time playing Guild over the years was with some freinds in Multiplayer. I never focused on Singleplayer too much. Even with this stupid ""Connection out of sync"" problems it was worth some rounds to play.Since most bugs were killed in the last years, we managed to play very long rounds in LAN-Sessions by sending the Hosts Savegame, when Sync Problem occured. Since this time even the MP worked for some good rounds, where we ended up with Maps full of selfowned Buildings and no other Dynasties left. And its still funny to send your character for some Beer to your freinds Tavern, after a hard working-day praying in your katholic church. Or send your ""Fungirls"" to the Marketplace to make lots of money  :PI really hope The Guild 3 will keep up with the good work and hopefully no Bugs. ;)But most of all keep up the intense involving to your Dynasty, and City  when playing.  Also Multiplayer on Online-Server or with LAN should really get a focus on developing and should work at launch. ;)			"

												This game has a core game play that is really fun and unique. Build a dynasty through trade, shadowy power and political intrigue.At first with only one or two business, things go well. You start earning money and feel a sense of accomplishment as your fledging trade empire grows. You notice a few problems and bugs such as a pause system that work by slowing down the game to a crawl and also, slow down your user interations to a crawl, pathing issues where npcs get stuck, your char keep running and stopping behind an npc, trying to interact with him/her never succeeding, but still tolerable.Then you got robbed. Which is fine, wealth is nothing without the force to defend it. You hire guards to patrol your buildings and defend you. And you got rob again. You stare in disbelieve as your char and guards do nothing as you order them to attack (possible pathing bug?), only after the thief is running away then your guards start chasing futilely. Ok, lesson learned. You build watch towers right in front of your structures, build a mercenary fortress and plant mercenaries right in front of your shop in toll collecting mode, security and money making, both at sametime, seems to work.As time goes on, your trade empire grows and you start getting annoyed with all the micomanagement required to make sure supply flows smoothly or else the whole chain will grind to a halt. You tweak your trade routes such that they move just the ""right"" amount of goods without flooding the recipent (a shop with no space storage cannot produce stuff) and constantly move crafted good from storage to sale slot because there is no way to automate that. When you think that maybe, just maybe you can get this under control, you accidentally end the day with a negative balance after your employees are paid and your whole house of cards came crashing down. All trade routes cancels when your balance become negative, carts halt right in front of the stall they are suppose to sell to.Ok fine, maybe you know, this game isn't suppose to be micromanaged? You turn over the shops to the AI and build structures from the rouge tree (which doesn't need resources and require min micromanagement). Things start to get managable again. You start getting a good feeling, maybe soon you will be able to finish upgrading all your buildings and start running for office.Then the game crash. Well, tough luck, good thing you as a veteran gamer have the good habit of saving regularly. You load the last save... and the game crash immediately again. You load the save before the last, and the game crash again.- End of review			"

												Although i like the concept of the game and enjoyed it immensly the first few days, i quickly grew weary due to the many bugs. They are not game-breaking but often force me to return to previous save-games and once forced me to completely demolish a building and build a new one in a different location because the carts could no longer enter it since it was upgraded. It is an old game and very buggy at that; but it's also cheap. So if you like the builder-simulation genre and you are a patient person you might enjoy this. For everybody else, i wouldn't recommend.  "

												G2 is a decent game, but the micro-management of the shops is a royal pain in the♥♥♥♥♥  If you set up buildings to support a supply chain, you have to keep transferring the goods manually to make that happen.  AI manager doesn't understand supply chains and doesn't try to maximize profit (Read:  At all).  While this isn't too much of a bother when you only have a couple shops, once you get a couple supply chains up and running, it's just way too much micro-management to have time to do anything else in the game.  If I could specify I wanted to keep 40 oak, 40 pine, 40 gems, 40 pins, and 40 gold in my Joinery, using my own raw materials buildings as a preferred source; and to sell crafted products to the market when there were 20 in stock...  The game would be so damn much more enjoyable.As it is, it's just micro-management hell and tedium.			"

												This game is actually despite what i will say in the review really enjoyable i am not sure if i can call it good cause it has a lot of faults. But it's also very unique in what it is and if you are a fan of management games and trade games you will love it for certain.It has a lot bugs and it looks pretty bad up close graphics wise, but the gameplay is interesting and engaging enough to make up for it and the mechanics are pretty good. Overall despite all its faults its still worth playing and i recommend it.This is only for people who own the Guild 2 Renaissance on Steam: Go to Properties then go to the Betas section and select latest_patch then wait for it to download to have a playable version of the game.

												A very serendipitous find for me, I had never heard of this game before, it popped up on my Steam feed for £2, liking the sound of it (I love games with depth) I decided to give it a go. My first 4-5 hours were spent scratching my head and wondering what the hell do I do? I finally got the hang of it and learnt that there was a patch released recently even though the game is quite old, the patch also unlocked a tutorial, which I didn't bother with as I thought I was well on my way to establishing my dynasty, it also fixed and streamlined a few things like pathfinding. It is still a little buggy but there is a fantastic deep game here that is still getting support from somewhere, more patches to come and maybe even a third game in the works, hope so.  Top game and nothing quite like it.			"

												This game has some amazing potential. I have never seen a game like it. I'd describe it as a cross between The Sims (lifestyle simulation) with Age Of Empires (Mideval time period, RTS-like qualities) with a broth of Economic strategy.The idea for the game is great, but it needs a new engine. It suffers from many bugs and glitches that never quite got patched. There is almost always a bug durring each gameplay. There are some major tweaks that could make the game better (and worth a higher price), but I would still recomend giving it a try, given that it is a cheap game.It seems, to me, like the precursor to a new genre and may possibly lead to some better games in the future. Hope to see some new games, of better quality, influenced by this one.			"

												The concept of this game is good but the execution is rather poor.  I enjoy the idea of this game and I am entertained enough to stick around awhile and try to play it despite its flaws, but there's no question that it deserves the low metacritic score it has.  The game has some major shortcomings that should have been resolved at release and I cannot recommend it due to those shortcomings.  I'll list a few of them:If you slow down the gameplay it also slows down your user interface for instance.  There's no excuse for that.  Telling your wagons where to go should be responsive whether you are paused or playing in fast forward, but because of the way the wagon command ui is tied to the world movement ticks entering commands for them at low speeds is slow and annoying.The pause feature is fairly buggy.  It stops time but some of the people are still moving around in slow motion the whole time you are ""paused"".   This is probably because the wagons and such would be completely unresponsive if they were actually completely paused due to their response to commands being tied to their movement.Sometimes my character becomes unresponsive and it wont respond to any commands anymore.  I end up having to save and reload the game just to get it to work again.  I'm sure this is also related to the buggy pause feature.Pathfinding is sometimes buggy and people will get stuck at one spot on the map and just turn in a circle repeatedly.  This is fairly rare but has happened to both my characters and the AI characters in my game.  One time I saw 20 AI stuck at one spot with my wagon and I had to save and reload the game to get everybody moving again.I still can't figure out if you are actually supposed to eat in the game.  The only time I fed two of my characters a biscuit both of them contracted tooth rot which I couldn't even treat because there was no hospital in my game.  When I run a shop I place items for sale in it that other people can buy, but when I go into the npcs shops they never seem to have anything for sale so I have to buy everything at the market.  This works, but it breaks the immersion of the game.  The tutorial has no coverage at of food or equipment or artifacts at all.  Note that there's only a tutorial currently if you download the 4.20 beta.  The base version of the game has no tutorial at all.The user interface for analyzing the profitability of your business ventures is poor.  You can't tell how much each individual business is earning or losing.  You just get some totals that encompass all your business and house expense into an end of month total.  You have no easy way to tell how much you are earning or losing on individual products in a business.I tried to participate in politics.  The political board listed the requirement as Citizen for almost all of the positions and it did not specify a level requirement, but when I bought my way up to Citizen and tried to apply for one it told me I wasn't high enough.  Either there's a hidden level requirement too or the requirement page for politics doesn't list the actual rank requirements. Anyway, you've been warned.  If you have too much time on your hands like me and you want to play a mediocre game that only costs a few bucks on sale, then go for it, but you should not pay more than a few dollars for this game.  You can get some entertainment out of it if you are willing to deal with its faults. "

												On my CD copy I have put in 100's of hours in to this game. It's my favorite game of all time because of the amount of freedom the game allows the player to have. I love playing as a rouge building a criminal empire and taking control of the city. The game takes 3 very different generes and puts them together to make a fantastic sandbox style game. You take control of a character who is the start of a long family line. You get married have kids to continue your families legacy and start a (Hopefully) lucrative Business to make money and compete in the local econmic market. Your family can get involved in city polictics and compete for higher seats of office. There are so many ways to play this game. I only wish that multiplayer was a little more stable because if it was this would be an awesome multiplayer experience. To end this review all I can say is I can't wait for the Guild 3 and I hope you give this game a try!			"

												- Pick a profession out of many possibilities. Sounds interesting!- Construct your business building which allows you to produce several specific goods- Produce the goods from resources that you either collect, buy or produce yourself- Sell goods either at the business or at one of the markets on the map- Update the building and hire more workers as money permits- Repeat with as many businesses as you like- Grow boredResources that you can collect never run out. You can send a bunch of workers to pick that same small spot of lavender flowers for decades.Resources that you grow never fluctuate. I never had a bad harvest.Production rates are steady, too. I've never had a problem with my workers or any noticable difference in their output.Seasons don't provide variation either. While the game has nice visuals for the seasons and even tells you that transports move slower in winter, you can harvest just as many flowers, fruits or grain in the deepest snow.There are only 3 levels of each building and very similar minor updates. I maxed out 6 businesses within a generation of my dynasty and now they are just sitting there.Goods are often weirdly specific or illogical. A lvl 2 inn can only offer a salmon and mushroom dish for food, so you better get salmon and mushrooms, no alternative. A lvl 1 bank produces copper coins from iron (by magic?).Goods never spoil. Harvest a ton of fruit and sell them 20 years later, who cares?Even places that should be about providing services are not. As a healer you earn most by selling soap you make out of lavender.As soon as you own a chain of supply, there's nothing left to do. Buy a farm, a mill and bakery, and spend the rest of your life moving icons of grain and wheat around, yay!tl;dr: Maybe you could have a little fun with a criminal or political career, but the economy and building mechanics lack any dynamic or complexity that might make them interesting or challenging.

												The main reason I'll recommend this game is because you get a ton of value for the price if you get it on discount. It's more or less a medieval version of sims♥♥♥♥♥business tycoon♥♥♥♥♥political simulator.+Many types of businesses you can choose to run in the game, each filling a certain market demand, and your town grows as you hire more employees.+Interesting political aspect to the game, including elections, where you climb your way up the political ladder for more privileges like immunity from the law.+Many options to dealing with your enemies, including dueling, defamation, taking them to court, kidnapping, or just plain murder.And now with the cons:-AI is terrible at managing certain high level businesses. It’s frankly quite broken and doesn’t do what it’s supposed to do.-Market demand is non existent for certain products. They will remain on the market  pretty much forever and depress the price. The AI doesn’t know how to utilize some of the higher level items and will never buy or make use of them against you.-Indicator during politics or court sessions not always reliable at predicting the result.-AI is more or less passive and relatively peaceful, making it pretty much impossible to be killed by one and thus lose the game. Even if you fast forward the game 40 years, the AI even at their meanest doesn’t go around killing people for the most part and while fighting amongst themselves not one of them will eliminate another. If any one of them is going to die it will be because of the player.My overall impression is that the game had a pretty good and unique concept, but it was executed somewhat poorly. After all the patching it is pretty playable, but still somewhat buggy. Again, the main reason I’ll recommend it is because if you get it on discount, the value you get blows many other games you can get at a similar price point out of the water. Another thing to add is that the Guild 3 is supposedly coming out this year, so you can treat this game a bit like a preview as to what you may expect from the upcoming sequel.			"

												After 10 hours of play time I can confidently recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of sim, rpg, time or economy  management games.Having said that there are a few caveats.1. You must patch the game to the latest 4.211 (there are many posts about how to do this as it's not straight forward)2. Even after patching it you will see some bugs (e.g. pathing problems, UI glitches). You'll have to make peace with the fact they will never be fixed.3. Watch a tutorial video or be prepared for frustration the first couple of hours. The in game tutorial is ♥♥♥♥e.I myself did not watch or read up on how to play and it made the first couple of hours very annoying but during that time there was still enough intersting game play that it made me want to keep going. I'm glad I did because the very entertaining scenarios that arise during the game are endlessly entertaining to me. It also helps if you like to use your imagination. If you have ever played the sims maybe you have done like I have and made up back stories for sims and especially for explaining the decisions they make. I'm having  a blast doing the same in the Guild 2 Renaissance.If you're on the fence put this one on your wish list and wait for it to go on sale. it's definitely worth a buy then.			"

												This is a great game. Excellent economic and political sim that makes you really feel involved in your character and their family. A few bugs here and there but any game has them. The game runs a bit clanky at times, but if you have the patience to wait through the bugs and problems, and you SAVE OFTEN, it's endless hours of fun. As for mods, I havent even touched Fajeths mod pack yet, and I am still enjoying the game.I only have one warning; Make sure you buy ONLY this game, and not The Guild Gold Edition or any of the other The Guild II versions. They are all standalones, not expansions, and Renaissance is the most updated with the final update coming in 2015. Dont waste your money on the bundle either, because this is most likely the only game you will play in the bundle. However, praise to the devs for working on a game so long after it's release.All in all, give it a shot. The game really isnt that expensive and as far as simulators go, it is one of the best I have played in years.			"

												A lot of work has been done to get rid of the (many) rough edges on this title.  The AI is much better.  Pathfinding bugs are mostly gone.  And the economic system functions almost perfectly, which is to say it's a challenge.When you do get a supply chain settled, things can work quite smoothly.  I'd advise you to use the AI management after you get one or two businesses.  It costs a bit of money in game, but the micro saved is well worth it for how much you can focus on other things.There's about 20 different approaches you can take to become successful in the cities of each map.  But the highlight for me is developing your family and seeing them grow and interact with others, although I've never really gotten anywhere politically.PS. I have one copy of this game in my inventory.  If you're interested in receiving it, leave some comment to this review telling me what you think of it, as well as why you're not able to buy it yourself.

												After few years of building my small patron empire, I had THE oppurtunity to take over my rival's only business, fully upgrade windmill. By throwing fire bombs at it until it, I guess, burned into submission. Lost a lot of good hired men, but I had crippled the enemy dynasty, which was nearly dead by now because of the plague that ravaged the city. But, as people tend to do, she told the city council and I was to be punished for my crimes. So I hid my kid away and while doing that my male character caught the Black Death. And by the time the hearing started he was on his death bed.So my female character (whom I forgot to level up) went in and faced the charges. I was charged with: vandalism, robbery, theft, attacking a guard and tripple murder (her thugs did nit agree with me taking over her property, so I convicnced them with my sharp tong- I mean blade. And there was no way she would not win that trial. But seconds before the court asked me to tell my version of the story, I remembered -- I could raise my Charisma and Rhetoric. With Ch and R at 10/10 (IGN approves), I blew the judge away with my grabbing speech. Also, I found out that one of the guards was infected with plague and that both me and the executioner were freshly sick.After my epic speech the court single-handedly said NOT GUILTY, and I was to choose proper punishment for my rival. I adviced 40 years in prison, which for a single childless woman meant the end of her dynasty. And jst for the fun of it I asked for 5k of gold. Got her in jail and got the gold, with my social status being better than ever before.As the guards and the executioner took her out of the court room, my female character suddenly collapsed, died right there, because plague + age + stress = bad blood. And just like that, after my glorious triumph and mere seconds before my child reached the age he was considered adult (after each day the time fast forwards one or four years into the future), I lost it all -- because kids can't run The Guild, right?Recommended: But of course! I still have to make it as the National Executioner, and so should you!(About my playtime: I got this game from my local store and got the Steam version to save myself the trouble of looking for the DVD I somehow managed to lose; estimated playtime: 100+ hours)			"

The MIDI music is a little unsettling seen from a musician's point of view but still makes a nice ambience and feel for the game in general.There are some pros and cons, but in the end it doesn't even matter (LP reference right there).The game is fun to play and I totally recommend it to anyone who's into rpg, trading sims, intrigue and the like			"

Just look at the forum, almsot every thread is full of questions on how to play the game.You will probably find yourself stumbling over menus, having the click things multiple times ( I hate carts), botching playthroughs and generally not understanding why the heck you can't do something. With that said, it's pretty neat trying to make a dynasty.It's a fun game but it comes with too much baggage in my opinion, bugs, the difficulty curve. Also, way too much micro-management for me.  There is probably a way to make it easier, but I don't get it, even after 8 hours. You're better off playing some other game but I'll recommend this one if you don't mind lots of work to get to the fun.			"

												Wow. I loved playing this game when it first released, though it was very very very unrefined back then. Frequent crashes, bugs, features that didn't work. No longer.Somehow this magical concept is still being updated and after playing the most recent BETA, feels fully polished.Extremely flushed out political simulations.Very detailed business operations - the AI for running your business is kind of sluggish, but it is APPROPRIATELY time consuming to micromanage each workshop in your empire.The combat is pretty straight forward.I do feel like the highway robbers do have too easy of a time early in the game.However, this game is now thoroughly completed and bug free. I've played it about 20 hours this week alone (I ended up launching it outside of Steam so that I could play offline.) and believe I'll be playing it another 40 hours.AN ABSOLUTE STEAL AT $2.50.			"

												The Guild II is a unqiue strategy/life simulation game set in the medieval era. It brings many great mechanics from strategy games and life simulation games (such as the sims). It will take some time to learn, but once you have the game down it is very in depth. Worth a try if this is your style of game! Watch the video below of the tutorial to get an understanding of the game style and dynamics.Note: Get Renaissance, it includes everything from the previous two releases.

												G2 is a decent game, but the micro-management of the shops is a royal pain in the♥♥♥♥♥  If you set up buildings to support a supply chain, you have to keep transferring the goods manually to make that happen.  AI manager doesn't understand supply chains and doesn't try to maximize profit (Read:  At all).  While this isn't too much of a bother when you only have a couple shops, once you get a couple supply chains up and running, it's just way too much micro-management to have time to do anything else in the game.  If I could specify I wanted to keep 40 oak, 40 pine, 40 gems, 40 pins, and 40 gold in my Joinery, using my own raw materials buildings as a preferred source; and to sell crafted products to the market when there were 20 in stock...  The game would be so damn much more enjoyable.As it is, it's just micro-management hell and tedium.			"

												I had played this game previously a few years back prior to repurchasing it on Steam and loved it, even though it was extremely buggy. Unfortunately, even with these new patches to the game, it is still buggy as all hell. My first game in, after having bred the first child, my character was unable to sucessfully take any action thereafter. Reloading to a previous save had no effect to remedy this bug. Unfortunate that game breaking bugs still exist, and are even worse when the save game is corrupted well into a playthrough and can not be reversed. Great game concept, but I would recommend avoiding this if possible and wait for the 3rd edition which will hopefully not suffer from so many bugs as this still does.			"

												The Guild 2 with the new Renaissance upgrade is a solid game. Not perfect mind you but solid. If you are a fan of simulation games like The Sims, or are fan of business games then this game can be enjoyable for you.Pro-There are quite a few different maps available for play. So finding a change of scenery in the game is possible, but there is no way to create your own maps which is too bad. -There are a lot of different store types in the game to experiment with-There is more than just business. Family management and politics are present as well-The timeline of the game takes place in what I say is a fairly unique setting. Few games of this type take place in that area of historyCon-Although there are a lot of maps for play the replay value on this game is weak. Much of the gameplay is the same no matter which map you play on.-There is quite a clear lack of balance between the jobs in the game. Some earn fantastic amounts of money while others make close to zero even with all of there upgrades. As well a new player has no way to know this until they play more of the game.-The AI is quite weak. They are unable to build or politcally compete with the player in any meaningful way. This means that once the player has gained any bit of power they will have nothing more than limp rivals to contend.-There are many bugs in this game. I frequently found my family in the game out thousands of dollars because one of the characters could not 'find a path' to a feature. This was just one of the many that were present.All in all if you like economic games and simulators this game does have its fun. However the fun is limited and its replay becomes shortlived with the lack of functional AI. ** out of ***** for the average gamer I would say.			"

												So, i bought this game as i broke my ankle and couldnt walk to the shop and get ciggarettes, 13 hours later still hadnt gotten and smokes, but i had a kick♥♥♥♥♥orchard and farm.This game is fun single player, but really stands out in local multiplayer, the banter, the laughs, the despair on your friends face when they start to go broke. Its ideal.10/10 would be a patron again.			"

												10/10 would start a riot for justice just to be punched to death by a commoner In all serious though, this was a long time favourite of mine and i have thousands of hours outside of steam but recently just got back into it, There are easy ways to play but once you learn the game after awhile you really get the full enjoyment of the guild 2.

												I bought the Guild II Renaissance approx. 7 years after it was released. Usually you expect games like that to not be up to the time and to feel weird an rusty. Most of the time (at least for me) they are not a lot of fun. The Guild II, especially Renaissance however is an amazingly fun game that aged better than any Elder Scrolls or Battlefield. This game still has hundreds of hours of fun in store despite its age. There have admittedly been some problems in the past especially with the online aspect of the game. I personally think playing this with your friends is one of the most fun an durable online game experiences on  the market. If you like RPG elements and/or simple economic principals in games you will have a blast with the Guild II. I had a bug that caused my rogue character to kill cart drivers to not be able to take their stuff, wich made it essentially useless for me to do it. However the spirit of the game makes it up and the bug turned into part of the lore of this character that grew and grew until I even made a small audiobook for my friends about htis character. Get this game and be surprised. It has more to offer than you might think. My recommendation: Wait for this to be on sale and BUY it! You don´t need the original, just buy Renaissance, as it is more refinded and has more to offer. Steam routinely puts this down to 2,50€ and that is just a great deal. DEAR THQ NORDIC AND RUNE FORGE,I am very much looking forward to playing the third part of your wonderful game series, as this is one of my all time favorites! So if you read this, wich is highly unlikely, but anyway, THANK YOU! Thank you for so many hours of fun and joy with your games!I would also take a free version of The Guild III if you insist!Much love from Germany,Your Birdy			"

												---New Review---Many people have said, through various locations on the internet, that this is a game that should be forgotten, and the series died at the first game but I can't help but disagree!Theres something about this game I just love! I think its the difficulty curve. If you play on Easy you'll struggle to actually find a foothold in your chosen field the first few (tens of) times you play, or at least; you will if you're like me, but once you find the profession that  suits your play style and you find the strategy that works you'll find it becomes pretty simple to carve out the lineage that you know you deserve.For the most part thats what I love about The Guild 2: Renaissance; the fact that its still amazingly fun even when you know what you're doing and  (In my opinion) even fun without challenge.When you get bored of that you'll be tempted to turn up the diffculty; call me an unskilled gamer if you like but I dont do that anymore... I simply find the  difficulty too hard and its not what I play the game for! Okay, so this review has been a little rambly but the point I'm trying to make is that this game is truly great, its great with massive amounts of challenge (Although thats not how I like to play it) and its great with basically no challenge. Its a very adaptable game, you can play it seriously and in ""I AM BEST GAMER IN WORLD! HEAR ME ROAR!!"" mode or you can play it in ""My names Doris, I'm a mother of 4 and like a nice simple game to pass the time"" mode.Buy it you fool!---Original Review---Despite what you may read/hear else where on the internet; this game genuinly is brilliant.Its a game that truly stands apart from others in its rather specific group. Its about being a nobody with dreams of being MORE than somebody.You create a character, build a business, buy some stuff, then die.Then you try again; Create, Build, Buy, Sell, Get murdered.And again: Create, Build, Buy, Plague.And again: Create, Build, Dysentary.Again: Create, Build, Buy, Sell, Marry, Children, Die, Children take over, Build more, Buy More, Get arrested, Die in prison.Give up.Wait six months and repeat.If that sounds like something you'd enjoy then get this game! (This one is also the best of the series so dont bother buying the others.)			"

												On my CD copy I have put in 100's of hours in to this game. It's my favorite game of all time because of the amount of freedom the game allows the player to have. I love playing as a rouge building a criminal empire and taking control of the city. The game takes 3 very different generes and puts them together to make a fantastic sandbox style game. You take control of a character who is the start of a long family line. You get married have kids to continue your families legacy and start a (Hopefully) lucrative Business to make money and compete in the local econmic market. Your family can get involved in city polictics and compete for higher seats of office. There are so many ways to play this game. I only wish that multiplayer was a little more stable because if it was this would be an awesome multiplayer experience. To end this review all I can say is I can't wait for the Guild 3 and I hope you give this game a try!			"

												GREAT game....minor bugs, but infrequent and irrelevant enough to still enjoy the game immensely. I have played hundreds of hours, and still have never 'beaten' the dynasty mode...but I bet I would be able to if I really wanted to. My goal is to eventually be the only dynasty left and own every building, but that goal might take thousands of gameplay hours to complete...which is fine by me, since I have never gotten bored. Learn how to create and work trade routes, and figure out what you need to do to become well known among the government and the people, and enjoy the gravy that comes along with the monotonous task that comes with maintaining your businesses and political standing. Well worth the price...and Guild 3 is coming out soon :)			"

												I'm going to preface this review by saying that if lack of bugs is an important quality in a game for you, then you will probably hate this game.I have played every iteration of The Guild 2(as well as the first game). Since it was first released, I have played much of this game in various forms long before purchasing it on Steam. Renaissance is, by far, the best form of The Guild 2 that there is. If you had played the earlier forms of the game, you would understand why I love Renaissance so much. Is this game bug free? Absolutely not. It has had a rocky development and maintenance history. It has been more or less abandoned on more than one occassion. Yet, it's still here, and people are actively developing mods for this game. That's because the gameplay concepts presented are an absolute home run. While it's basically meant to be business sim and rpg, it succeeds by offering diverse ways of playing the game. Sure, you can buy materials, make them into a finished product, and sell your finished goods at a profit. Absolutely. You can also use those finished goods to arm mercenaries who will extort money from passersby. Or you can use other finished goods to improve your chances of gaining political office. You could also rob a plump, plentiful shop for your income. And wouldn't it be nice if you could use your politlcal influence to gain control of the city guard and prevent guards from patrolling near that shop you want to rob? Yes, you can do that, and that is what makes this game great. It's worth noting that that is just the possibilities offered by one class, the Rogue.Honestly, what makes this game great, for me, boils down to the fact that you have a lot of different things that you can do. In most business sims, materials and goods are just icon swaps for each other with different numbers representing their utility. In The Guild 2: Renaissance, the utility of goods extends beyond simple, numerical values. Have a rival Dynasty in the same business as you in your city, constantly beating you to the punch by selling in your city's market and lowering the economic value of your goods? Sure, you COOOOULD just sell your goods at a different city's market. IF YOU'RE A COMMUNIST. Instead, show them whatfor by setting off a stink bomb in their firm. They can't very well sell goods they haven't made, can they?Now, here is where reality bites. This game is buggy. Buggy to the point where I simply won't run the game without installing a modpack. Lucky for you, there are many great mods available. To make things even better, you have two great options for mod packs. Fajeth's Mega Modpack and McCoy's Legacy Modpack. Both of these are great. While they both include a lot of similar mods Mega Modpack is geared towards adding more item options, and Legacy Modpack is geared more towards improving the multiplayer experience. On the latter note, if you're looking for a good multiplayer experience, this game is a mixed bag. On the one hand, multiplayer is awesome. On the other hand, multiplayer was poorly implemented in this game. Legacy Modpack has made a lot of improvements, but even with that and following all advice offered by the community on avoiding them, you still may end up with OOS errors. And the advice goes pretty far. Last I checked they even mentioned playing with the same exact video settings (turning most graphics features off). If you can get a good group going, the multiplayer can be extremely fun and rewarding. Mario Party has nothing on this game in terms of ruining friendships.I recommend this game if you're a patient person who is okay with having to deal with bugs. You have a lot of fun ways to play the game, and its particular blend of gameplay concepts is unique. The game offers a lot in terms of actual roleplaying, and it charmingly begs you to immerse yourself in its quirky world.EDIT: I can't wait for The Guild 3!			"

												This game is deceptively awesome even with the plethora of bugs in the game that were never fixed.  I will buy The Guild 3 upon release.  Hopefully in the new version, they will add options to family size and or provide an easier interface to track all of the activities occuring in game.  There were a couple of times where I would look for a worker or Mercenary and they were dead or just simply vanished...  But overall, I haven't had this much fun in a game since Medieval Total War II; Total War being more about the Combat and The Guild being more about the operations of a Pre-Nobility family.			"
