												For three or four days now, I have played nothing but ""This War of Mine"". I am a veteran of Iraq and I remember all too well the hardships it brought upon the civilians, especially in the beginning of the war. I remember being heartbroken at the sight of children crying and begging for food on the side of the road.This ""game"" puts you square in the middle of the experiences of those civilians. It is a brutal, kill or be killed world - where an act of unimaginable violence may let you live another day, but it can also break your heart and soul. Some days, you are offered a chance at compassion - and if you take that chance, risking your own safety and resources for others, you may find you feel a bit better about yourself.Then there are the times where you are stuck between a rock and a hard place. You are unarmed, scavenging for anything to save your friends, and you peep through a keyhole and see a soldier brutally beating - and possible worse - a woman. He has an AK-47, you have a lockpick and a rumbling stomach. So you sit there and watch - afraid that any noise may turn his violent attention upon you. When it is all done, you hide until he leaves and then, shamefully, pick over the bloodied body of the woman for anything she may have scavenged before the soldier got to her.This is ""This War of Mine"" - a dark, beautiful, haunting, exhilerating, and horrible tale.What's that tagline, ""The first casualty of war is innocence""? It applies here - in a way you would have never imagined coming from a computer game.			"

												Entered a building with other people.The building's description  had said ""Danger"" which ment hostiles. Bandits.I grabbed my knife and was ready for those bandits.I saw one bandit and after breaking in through a window, she ran calling for backup.One guy showed up with a shotgun and chased me off but I waited.He searched, and couldn't find me and then I got the drop on him.We fought, he couldn't shoot, and three stabs later he fell.I grabbed the shotgun and went inside. My friends needed food, and these bandits were killers. They deserved what they got.I grabbed food, supplies, and another bandit showed up!I fired at them with the shotgun, and they dropped with a gurgling scream.One bandit ran after me! Surely they had a knife!No... she ran past me to the man's corpse.She was crying. She called me a murderer.I fired again and she dropped.There was silence then, and I had to hurry up and grab the rest of the supplies before more bandits showed up.I opened a closet, and snagged the food.But, the inventory of the closet said ""Private""Someone owned this wardrobe? I looked outside toward the other building, and between the two.. a garden someone built?One guy had mentioned they were running low on meds.This.... no.. it couldn't be. It just couldn't be!This wasn't... this wasn't an abandoned building being picked clean.This was another group's safehouse.These people are.... were.... survivors!...and ""I"" was the bandit.			"

												This is an INCREDIBLE game. It was recommended to me by a close friend because, me being a former war refugee from the Balkans, he thought I might find the content ""a bit familiar."" It went a bit further than that, in fact it kind turned out to be some uncanny early-childhood simulator for me. I still remember the visceral terror of being a child in that war; I will never forget howling and begging my mother not to go outside to buy bread, out of fear that she would be shot dead by a sniper. Asking why my grandmother couldn't go instead.This game captures moments like that with a masterful hand. It is never heavy or hamfisted. I can't explain how well the developers have encapsulated the hoplessness and the mundane brutality of the Balkan civil war, and it leads me to think that at least one key person involved in the development of this game had to have lived through it, too. The tone is just perfect, striking that difficult balance between terror and absurdity, and reminds me of all the films I love that came out of Former Yugoslavia after the war. This is not Angelina Jolie painting Balkan politics with a broad brush dipped in ignorance and a skewed western perspective insensitive of nuance--this is an authentic work of art that is sensitive to the complexities of its subject matter and the individual stories of the thousands of people whose lives were shaped and altered forever by this horrible, unnecessary war. It's an emotional playthrough, even for people who haven't had any experience with the historical event. It is a ""war game"" like no other and I can't recommend it enough. Take it from someone who was there.			"

												I'm 5 hours in, and that's a straight 5 hours. Most survival games I've played are either pretty forgiving, or shallow in character.This one is neither. In the beginning of my hours I was hopeful and treated others I met with the same kidness I normally would, as the going was good. I shared my supplies, and took in others that needed shelter. Food was used daily and luxuries were built.36 days later (and still going) the survivors that are left are battered men; hungry, sick and tired. We've had to kill to survive, even innocent people, because the only other option was our own death. We have stolen and traded our way through the cold-snap, and the outlook is grim.All that matters now is lasting the few days until outside aid arrives. But in the end, will that really matter? We're not the same people we started as, and the atrocities we've commited are ones we have to live with forever.I highly reccomend this game, but be warned: Your decisions WILL have severe consequences, you WILL hate yourself for the evils you have done, necissary as they may feel. You will learn to know the survivors, what things they find acceptable, who can talk to whom best. Most of all you will think ""Maybe next run, I can do things differently.."". I know I am at this point, as it looks like my first run will end in failure and misery.10/10, am now broken, tired and hungry IRL. Soundtrack matches the atmosphere, graphics are a little jarring at first but become normal after a little bit. Gameplay is solid and needs very little introduction, and you will want to think your decisions through a few times... It all matters in the end.			"

												This game shows a bad side of war, the dark one. It shows war from the citizen perspective. We start surviving with 3 or 4 chosen characters (first we have only one group and we unlock next people by surviving next days). Players group lives in destroyed house. They have to seek any food or medicaments in their house, but this resource runs out very fast. So what to do?       We have to steal everything we need to survive. Sure, there are abandon houses, but almost nothing is there. We start hiding in shadows, and preying for noone to spot us. And now comes a very hard choice: what about killing. I played two times (now i was playing the second one). First time, i got into pensioners house. They saw me and ran up to me. My friends were starving. I had no choice. I attacked the man with fists. He died after two hits in the head. Woman ran to the toillet and locked in there. I took away their food and left the house. I remember this particular moment all the time. In ""This War of Mine"" there is lot of choices. Is killing in order to get some dood better then starving? It' s a good game, I enjoy it, but it' s hard and... very sad. Sure, I still play CoDs and CS, but it changed my observance of war. Good luck, and hope you will survive.If you enjoy this text, please, leave a like, it's a motivation for me.			"

												Day 21: It's been three weeks since we moved into this bombed-out house we've come to call home. Three weeks since I last saw any members of my family; two since my last hot meal; one since Katia was gunned down scavenging for food and medicine. Bruno hasn't fared well. The illness is no longer confined to his body – now his soul is sick, broken. The snows have come, and we're feeding the heater every day now... I wept when we burned our only two books. Bruno scoffed. “They're children's books,” he muttered from his sick bed. “It's not as if we read them.” He didn't bother asking whose books they had been.Day 25: I scavenged last night. We're both starving. I remembered a house, untouched by the violence. I had come weeks earlier in the hopes of getting supplies only to find it occupied by an old couple... living as they had before war came. They reminded me of my grandparents, and I left. Katia and Bruno had not been happy, and we did not eat that night. I returned this evening in the hopes that they had fled... or worse, shamefully. But they had not. The old man struggled, wouldn't let me steal his wife's medicine. I tried to tell the proud ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I only needed a little, for my friend. I struck him and he hit the floor hard, unmoving. His wife screamed. “Why have you done this?” I am not sure if this was directed at me or God. What little food was left in my stomach came up, and I fled with what little I could carry. We'll eat tonight, and Bruno will have medicine.Day 27: Bruno passed sometime during the night. He looks at peace. It is better this way, I suppose. I shall join him. Hana, Emira, Lejla – I shall see you all soon.This War of Mine is an indie title set in an unspecified city that's been besieged. You and a random set of survivors brought together by chance stumble upon a bombed-out building. You control these characters by clicking on them or their photographs (which also provides a daily bio) and clicking on an interactive prompt. It is at this point that every game of This War of Mine will diverge. As you walk around your new home, shifting rubble and unlocking armoires, you'll find supplies: lumber, food, medicine, and all important components. Components (and lumber) are your primary building tools in the beginning, with which you can craft beds and chairs. These may seem luxurious in a time of war, but creature comforts help keep morale up. Advanced items, such as machine parts and electronics, will allow you to construct a metalwork, stove, heater, radio, and oven. But you'll never have enough for several of these items – not in a single day.It's up to you to decide what should come first. Do you build beds, so everyone can have a good night's sleep? Sure, you can sleep on the floor – but it's not as good as a warm bed. Do you eat cans and raw food, which are not very filling or comforting, or do you build a stove to make hot meals? Do you construct a weapon with which to defend yourself, or do you choose to build a herbal crafting station or moonshine still, which are great for future bartering?You'll busy yourself during the days with these tasks, and how to divvy them up. Some characters might be sick or slightly wounded, and keeping them in bed all day can help with recovery. But someone is going to have to craft and dig through rubble. When day turns to night (8 PM), you'll have further decisions to make. In the bombed-out city there are sites – villas, apartments, houses, hospitals – with potential supplies, some more promising than others. Each carries with them the risk of human habitation. Some people are willing to barter uneasily, while others are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥deserters from the army. Pillaging an empty building has no repercussions, but robbing people is generally frowned upon, and justice is swift and cruel. Worse still, there are looters who may just shoot on sight.So, who will go? Sending your fastest runner means they'll have a better shot at outrunning would-be murderers. Send your best scavenger and you'll have more room to carry supplies. Send your best trader/negotiator and they may be able to strike a deal. But if any of these characters are sick, wounded, tired, or feeling blue, they'll have a tougher go of it. Worse still, you're not exactly living in a fortress. There's a risk each night of looters coming to take what little you have. Some players will choose to use precious lumber to board up holes, others will craft knives and shovels, putting one or more characters on guard duty during the night. Others still will be forced to let everyone sleep, if exhaustion and illness are setting in, and you can't have your wounded staying up all night, guarding; they'll never heal. These raids can range from desperate scavengers that will flee from a single guard, to well-armed bandits that will wound or kill anyone in their way.You'll have to survive for a long time, upwards of forty days. And it's no easy task. Each playthrough will give you different survivors, different weather patterns, and different challenges when scavenging. It's fun and highly replayable, but the subject matter is heavy enough that you won't likely spend more than a dozen hours with this title.This War of Mine is a macabre juggling game, and just when you think you've found your rhythm, the weather or a sniper hits you like a greased up chainsaw. You will never find yourself thriving, just scraping by. And when supplies are low and days turn to weeks, you'll have to make some tough choices. The opening scenario I described is one that can happen in your game. You may decide to help neighbors initially; sending a survivor off to board up a woman's home while her husband is away, feeding an isolated artist, or helping the victim of a sniper attack. But your heart will turn to stone in time as living becomes a prolonged struggle. That old couple? They're no longer off limits. The hospital? They're wounded, dying – my people need this more than they do. And that is what This War of Mine does most effectively. It shows you the cost of war – body, mind, and soul. I've read plenty of great anti-war novels, seen plenty of great anti-war films. This War of Mine joins Spec Ops: The Line in a growing, prestigious genre of anti-war games. It speaks for the most silent, unrepresented victims of war unflinchingly, sincerely. It reveals the cost of war; not with the over-the-top set pieces and faceless macho protagonists, but with quiet moments.Near the end of my first playthrough, day 25, I had two survivors left from our original four. One had fled in the night; the other succumbed to a lethal injury. One survivor was utterly broken, rocking upstairs, muttering to himself. I sent my other depressed, ill survivor to comfort him, to rouse him from his depressed state. She sat and comforted him for an hour, and it gave him a little hope. But I knew it was all for naught. They were going to die, inevitably. We had no food. We had no medicine. So why? Why bother comforting him? Why not reset the game? I couldn't. I couldn't leave their story unfinished, untold. They both slept in beds that night, and both passed in the morning. The night had been calm, perhaps the calmest night since day one.			"

												This War Of Mine is an emotional, intense, and challengeing experience as you observe and control the actions of various surviving civilians in the center of a war torn city. I've played a few hours of this game, but decided that I would share my most recent experience, in which I ended up dying trying to save a young girl from getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥..: It was the third day of this living hell. I was staying with an old highschool friend who I just happened to run into after the city went to♥♥♥♥♥♥ After scavanging an old abandoned house the first two days and gathering gathering us enough food for the next few nights, I decided to head to the supermarket under the cover of dark. I creeped in through the entrance and heard the faint sound of shifting rubble behind a closed door. I slowly approached the door, being very careful not to make much noice. As I got down on one knee and peeked through the keyhole, my heart jumped. Not two feet ahead was a large, military-clad man weilding an ak-47 assault rifle. In front of him a young girl was sifting through some rubble, and mumbling about food. ""What is that you're looking for, sweetheart?"" the man asked. ""Please... food. I need food"" ""Hey, I've got food. All the food you need. Maybe I can trade you some for a favor?""""I... I... don't think so""""We can dine together, then have some fun""""I... better be going home now""As she begins to walk away, he runs up behind her yelling ""get back here ♥♥♥♥♥!"" and smacks her across the face with the butt of his rifle, knocking her to the ground.""Get up now! Or I will shoot you!""Wimpering, she crawls to her feet and he escorts her out the back of the supermarket with the rifle in her back. After making sure the coast was clear, I carefully opened the door, and proceeded to loot the main store isle for any food and supplies I could find. After filling my backpack to its full capacity, I began my walk back towards the entrance when I heard loud crying coming from the back of the store. Being a curious fellow, I decided to investigate. Outside the back of the store, there is a small shed with a large sheet metal door. I press my ears up to the large door, and I can hear lots of shuffling and crying. My heart sinks as I realize what's happening. This poor girl is about to get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I had to make a decision at this point. Do I leave with my supplies and live another day, or do I attempt to liberate this young woman? Without skipping a beat, I drew my crowbar and began prying open the sheet metal door. Finally, after what felt like forever, the door gave way and I finally saw what was unfolding. Making eye contact with me, the girl screams ""Please! Help me!""To which the man immediatly turns and sprays my chest full of lead.As I lie dying, gasping my final breaths, I see the girl climb up onto some broken carts and jump over the fence. She had escaped. As I fade into darkness, I smile: knowing that that girl will go on to live another day.A Screenshot Of My Final MomentsEmotional, Exciting, Realistic, Horrific. 10/10			"

			Cosmic reviews This War Of Mine a indie survival game developed and published by 11 bit studios. On steam here - http://bit.ly/1xzhtzq Twitter - http://twitter.com/Cosmicengine99 Facebook -...		

As the game starts you find yourself in control of three civilians in a shelled house. Each of your civilians has different backgrounds, inventory space and a main skill for example good cook or skilled scavenger. Your first objective is to scavenge through the house and find materials so you can build basic equipment like a cooker for food, beds, heater and other essentials.The aim of the game is to get your group of civilians to survive through the war or if they all die the game will end. Each time you play the game you are assigned a random group of characters. Not only is this random but the length of the play-through is random, sometimes the war can last 30 days other times it can last months like in real life the length of a war is never certain. Both the location on the map and the things you find there are randomly generated too, which ensures replay-ability so each play-through you have will differ in some way.Graphically the game is fantastic, the way the art direction has been done is very well thought out. The game is a grim one and its reflecting in its dark color palate. The game looks like it has been done with a charcoal scheme and then they've added a pencil shaded overlay which blurs the lines between computer generated graphics and hand drawn art. Sound effects are top notch everything from bombs going off in the background to the opening of doors. The soundtrack to the game is wondrous providing great atmosphere and emotion in the background as you play.The controls are fairly simplistic and nearly everything simply requires a mouse click. Once a character is selected you can use the left mouse button move them or interact with an object. Clicking with the right mouse button has the same effect but makes the character run instead of walk so keep your fingers nimble as you never know when you might need to get away quickly.The game works from off a day and night cycle. Its too dangerous to venture out in the war torn city during the day. The day is used for keeping your civilians needs met like feeding them, making sure those who were up all night guarding or scavenging get some sleep and of course treating the sick and wounded. The day is the only time you can make equipment and build items. In terms of crafting you automatically start off with a basic workshop in your base from which you can build basic things you need to survive such as a heater, beds, water collectors etc. You can also build other more specialized workshops such as the metal workshop which you can use and upgrade to craft weapons, ammo and armor. All these workshops can be upgraded so you can gain access to more items to craft such as upgrading the herbal station will eventually allow you to craft your own medicine and bandages.Everything costs something in the game after all its all about survival. Crafting items will cost you parts and materials which you will have to gather or trade for. But before you even consider crafting more complex items or even basic ones you first need to see to the needs of your group. Each member will need food and this can be done in various ways. First should you come across raw uncooked food and vegetables you can cook these at a cooker to create meals you'll also need water and fuel. You can also eat vegetables and such without cooking them but it does not satisfy hunger like a proper meal. You also have canned food which is usually pretty rare to find and very valuable, just one canned food counts as a complete meal and can be a life saver if your low on other food supplies.Once night comes along its time to decide what you want to do with your people. The night, like the day is dangerous but its safe enough to try and scavenge for food and resources. When the night comes you'll enter the city map screen. This is where you can assign who does what for the night be it guarding the shelter from looters, sleeping and of course assigning someone to go out scavenging.Truthfully scavenging is where the game comes alive. The locations you can scavenge vary and more are added as your progress. You can visit everything from houses, schools and hospitals to supermarkets, military outposts and more. Moving your cursor over a location will tell you what you can expect in that location, not only does it give you an idea of what supplies can be found there but it will also tell you if there have been reports of people inside and if there's possible danger.Once your selected character is at a scavenging location they will automatically be in scavenging mode which includes the sneak stance. It's often best to try and get what you need quickly and quietly as drawing unwanted attention can have lethal consequences. So you scour the location you will come across various obstacles like mounds of rubble, locked doors or even grates and bars. With the right tools which you can craft at your home base you can overcome these problems however tools are either one use like lock-picks or have limited durability like the shovel.You will be able to scavenge the same location more than once after all you won't be able to fit an entire locations resources into your little backpack. This is helpful as it means you know the lay of the land when returning to a previous location but don't get complacent, just because the location was void of life the first time doesn't mean other scavengers or worse won't be there upon your return.While out in the city you will come across all manners of people who are just like you and trying to get through. Inevitably you may come across individuals who will want to do you harm, this may be some looters, raiders or soldiers. Dealing with hostiles very much depends on the situation, factors include how well armed you are, how armed they are and how many enemies your facing. Often sneaking past or making a run for it will ensure survival but you may find yourself having to fight. Sounds from rooms you have no line of sight in can be heard and seen with a red circle appearing. If you hear footsteps, it could be an armed soldier or just a scurrying rat, you never know until you look.I certainly feel that the games vision has been achieved. As a video game it hits all the right marks, solid mechanics, great art and sound but what tops it for me is the events and it's sandbox nature. Not only are you creating your own story as you go through but it's a deeply meaningful one. The game has both feel good experiences and experiences that make you sick to your stomach. Through the characters, events and game play a powerful message is sent to you as the player. I grew attached to every character I had in my party and the people I met. The whole game was a gripping experience that left me as a gamer wanting more but as a human being truly distraught at the realities of civilian life in a war torn city. For all these reasons and more This War Of Mine has easily become one of my favorite games of the year and is probably my indie game of the year by leaps and bounds. There is a lot of mature content in the game so it's certainly not for younger audiences but for everyone else I certainly would say to pick it up and experience it for yourself.			"

TL:DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:'This War of Mine' is a side-scrolling survival game developed and self-published by 11 bit studios back in 2014. The game's overall theme is based on a war-torn city with player activity focused on civilian survival through scavenging, trading, crafting and resource management rather than direct military action.PLOT (No Spoilers):The game places you in control of three starting survivors in one of the default scenarios with more  joining as the story progresses. The game starts by scavenging and fortifying a derelict house which will act as the player's base of operations. During the day the player can construct basic survival necessities such as beds, food production facilities and water collecting devices and at night, the player can elect to send a member of the team to scavenge for supplies or trade with known traders in the area. Survive the harsh conditions, defend against bandit attacks, scavenge supplies and keep your survivors sane and healthy until the peacekeepers arrive to resolve the conflict and put an end to the war.PROS:+ Great art style that blends well with the theme+ Challenging survival game mechanics but...(see CON #1)+ Refreshing new theme for a survival game (by that I mean, no zombies, monsters or ghosts)+ Adequate base upgrade and item crafting mechanic (although I wish there were more items to craft)+ Good resource management mechanic+ Random events that add replayability but...(see CON #2)+ Good survivor skill variety but... (see NEUTRAL #1)+ Morality and state of mind system+ Good scavenging and combat mechanic that works well with the side-scrolling system+ Atmospheric with good sound effects and lightingCONS:- The challenge wears out after you get past the learning curve (which is not that steep)- The game becomes repetitive after a few playthroughs...dare I say, tedious at some points- No speed up time (only an option to end the day and start the night game)- Limited construction space in each room of your base- Some of the game mechanics are highly exploitableNEUTRAL:+/- Limited survivor customization+/- Autosave is too far in betweenCONCLUSION:GREAT SURVIVAL GAME. This War of Mine is essentially for people looking for an authentic but not too realistic survival experience since it has the basic elements of a survival game while at the same time having the resource management mechanics of simulation title. IS IT WORTH IT?:I can easily RECOMMEND this game even at full price so if you see it on a sale, then it's a no-brainer. It's a good game to experience and provides a good amount of enjoyable game time for its price.The game's system requirement is not that heavy and can be played even on lower-end desktops or non-gaming laptops but to be safe, make sure to check it out.The game key was given by the developer for review purposes.--------------------------------------------------------- Like our Reviews?

												**SPOILERS** I went into an apartment complex to loot some stuff, not knowing yet what that meant. It was my first playthrough, and I thought ""stealing"" stuff was maybe like it was in Fallout or Skyrim. If someone sees me do it, they get hostile, and I kill them. Shouldn't be a big deal.I was skulking around when I was spotted by a guy who yelled at me to get out. He had a gun, so I thought he was a bad guy. I blew him away with my shotgun. I started to loot his corpse when when voices started shouting upstairs. I quickly hid and waited for the ambush, but what came around the corner weren't more armed guards. No, it was much worse. It was his parents.They were wailing about their lost son and how they couldn't survive without him. I couldn't speak to them. I wanted so badly to tell them that they could come back to our place, that I had killed him accidentally, something, anything. I walked out without taking what little they had left, in fact leaving my shotgun and rounds in their refrigerator to help them, hoping that maybe I didn't doom them entirely, but what was the point of survival for them anymore? Why would they want to survive in a world without their son who laid his life on the line for their safety?I never went back there. I was probably as affected as Marko was. He was depressed. I had to atone. I ran to the City Hospital to donate as much of our medical supplies as we could spare. I risked my life to free prisoners held by armed thugs. Night after night, in my attempt to atone, I tried to do as much good as I possibly could manage, if only to mitigate the incredible horror I had performed. We all survived, and I never went back to their apartment. I couldn't face them again. I don't know if they made it or not.Man, I'm a terrible person.			"

Karma-Hammer!  -  9/10Introduction:First off - no, 'This War of Mine' is not like Deadlight or your typical war game and it's not your typical survival game. It shows everything in a different angle... it deals with the normal citizen and how war can affect und brutally change their life. You have to question yourself...how far would you go to survive? My group was starving in my first game, one was ill and another one wounded. I decided to raid some obviously empty houses at night due to my misery, but the house wasn't empty. There lived a old couple. The old man told me that his wife was ill and I should leave. He didn't want to help me or at least trade with me, but I couldn't leave, because otherwise it would have been the death of me and my party. I started to explore the house while the old man was begging me to not hurt anyone. I found a huge amount of food and medical equipment, more than the couple would need in a long time. I took some food to survive two more days and only the really needed medical stuff to get well soon. Everything else remained untouched, so they could easily live on too and I moved on with a bad feeling. In the same night I got raided myself. Karma. During the next day I had some visitors, friendly neighbors. They gifted me some vegetables and didn't want anything in return. Karma, I regretted my nightly activity even more. This was just one tricky and remarkable situation out of many. A day in 'The War of Mine' is split into two parts, the day and night time. During day time you're in your house and you have time to work on new and helpful stuff for your party, manage the needs of your people and from time to time you will get some visitors. Before the night starts you'll have to choose, if you want to go on raid or completely stay at home, which person is allowed to sleep and which one(s) should guard the house. After you've made your decision you'll either start your raid (with time limit) or directly switch to the next day. This system works pretty well. How many days you have to play to finish the game can vary. (45 days in my first game)Thanks to some randomization it's worth it to start another round. I'm currently in my second playthrough and it's still interesting and the game came up with different and new situations, which I haven't experienced in my first game. Great!Pro:very good, interesting and unique game topic/settinggreat atmospheregreat survival feelinggood art styledark, sad, melancholic and overall fitting OSTinteresting and very different characters with own storiessome characters have addictions (take care of it ... or not)tough moral decisions which are completely up to youyou're often pushed to limits how to handle things (especially if you're starving, sick or wounded)your actions can affect various situations and people will react to it keep building offers various different ways to handle and specialize your 'production'random generated world/loot and different starting partiesenvironment and item prices will change from time to timegood replay value (my first playthrough was about 10-11 hours)no bugs, crashes or glitches in my play timeContra:your keep always looks the same and only the starting loot and some furniture are randomizedthe 'end' can come kinda suddenly, if you have no radio (you finish the last day and boom...end)combat can be a bit awkward and random sometimesunexplained character skills (some are self-explanatory, some not)you can only raid with one person at nightConclusion:Pure quality! The devs have successfully turned a very interesting, but difficult topic into a great survival game with loads of moral aspects. It made me question my actions and behavior several times and even as a good and helpful person there were decisions I'm not very proud of, but sometimes things need to be done to survive in a cruel world. Hands down, 'This War of Mine' is one of the best gaming experiences I had in this year. Absolutely recommendable!9/10----------------------~ Do you want to add something to the review or do you want to share your opinion? Feel free to make a comment. "

												In the beginning there were 3. Pavle, the ex-footballer. Katia, the journalist. And Bruno, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ professional chef. They came together during the siege purely by chance, and used their collective skills to improve their survival chances. Over the next 2 weeks they struggled to stay fed. Always low on supplies, and usually having one or more go hungry each day. Then Marko arrived, seeking shelter. The survivors knew they would struggle to support a 4th person, but welcomed him anyways. Marko then proved his worth after bringing home more food and medicine in one night than Pavle had managed in a week. Then he managed to bring home enough supplies to build some more furniture, and a radio. He helped the group not only survive, but flourish. He even at one point rescued a girl under the assault of a drunken soldier, earning him the status of ""hero"" amongst the people of Pogoren. Then one night he went scavenging in a dangerous area, known to be inhabited by brutal bandits. He had done this many times before, and felt safe enough to travel indoors. While searching through a cabinet, he was spotted. While he managed to kill 2 of the bandits, the remaineder proved to be too much for him. The group was devastated by his death. They never really recovered. A little over 2 weeks later, the siege had been lifted. The group had survived, and all went back to try to pick up where they left off before the war.Except for one. Whose body silently lies in a shallow, unmarked grave.RIP Marko. You will be missed.dis game 11/10 i cri evry tiem			"

												This War of Mine has an interesting take on survival games by putting the player not against zombies, or the wilderniss, but against human nature. You begin with three survivors in a city under siege during a civil war, supplies are running low and they just arrived at an abandonned building. This will be their holdout for the war.You will then manage their daily lives, making workbenches, chairs, beds, and everything else they need to get through the war. Of course, with supplies low, you need to prioritise. Do you really need a second bed? Maybe that material can best be spend on something else..At night, you go out to scavenge supplies. You bring one (Only one per night) of your survivors to a location that you hope has supplies you can use. Once there, you can encounter many things. It could be an abandonned building with nothing there. There could be a friendly (But well armed) trader, there could be civilians like you just trying to survive, or you could be shot on sight by the locals. Or there can be any other event... Or nothing. There is plenty of variation to be had.Personally, I went to a church, unarmed, as I had nothing yet. The priest told me about how the place was robbed, and asked me not to disturb the refugees under the church. So I went on to the ruined building behind the church. Scavenging up supplies, when I notice there's sound outside the door. It's just standing there, so I creep to the door and look through the keyhole. Just then, a man with a pistol turned around and made for the door. I looked for a place to run and hide and set off, just as he opened the door.""Oh, Hello there. Don't worry, I'm just looking around""He seemed pretty friendly. So I just went on my way to pick out some more nails and wood for my own business. It went alright this time. But plenty of people are less friendly than this guy.Combat, which you will at some point get into, is not explained in any way. So you will likely have to take a bit to learn about it, and stock up on bandages as you do so. At the same time, the stealth system is not explained, but easy enough to understand.With all this, you are tasked with making your group survive the war. Or at least as long as you can. It can be easy, challenging, or at times nearly impossible. But that's war, and neither the government nor the rebel forces will help you there - You're not their problem.And once you've gone through the game, you can ask yourself if you really did win. Did you end up stealing from old people to let them starve? Did you rob a priest for fuel? Shanked a doctor for a bandage? You can ask yourself what winning really means in war. And if just surviving is all you should try to do.			"

												This game is brutal. War is hell.    I stole medical supplies from the last hospital in the city so that I could survive.I stole all the food from a neighbors house so that I could eat.I let one of my people die so that I wouldn't have to feed them.I burned books for warmth.I turned away children in need.I killed an elderly couple for no good reason. Than committed suicide because I murdered the elderly couple. 10/10 I would suffer again.			"

												There's a lot of reviews out there already, so I'll just say it's the only game about war everybody SHOULD play, at least once. This is what war is about, not pretty headshots and great ideas and running around like a tool shooting at everything that moves while feeling invincible. War is about actual real people dying, whether they're soldiers or not, and this game makes a good job of portraying it.It could be longer, it could be deeper, but as it is it's a good game and well worth the price, if only to show that gamers are ready for the medium to grow a little more mature. It's sorely needed.			"

												Down to my last survivor (who was depressed, starving and severely ill), I had no choice but to raid people. I was caught,  so I had to kill two people. I got everything I needed and more. Went back to my shelter, but he couldn't handle killing anyone. He was racked with guilt, and was broken and alone. He couldn't even eat the things he stole. Boris hung himself that night.The most harrowing, emotional, and nerve wracking game I've ever played. It's brutal, it's beautiful.Amazing game. 10/10			"

												My HQ and my team were falling apart.  We were sick, hungry and weak.  Night came and it was time to head out and scavenge.  I picked ""Quiet Home"" due to its lack of danger and apparent surplus of supplies.  Up until now, no notification of danger meant only rats and hungry (but kind) strangers were present.  After arriving, I picked up a few things in the front yard and then after entering I see an elderly couple talking.  The woman is distracted and annoyed, the husband is supportive and strong.  Her mind has been corrupted by Alzheimer's and he has made it his final aim to provide safety and shelter for her.  I walked around the house while he nervously asked if i was a bandit.  I didn't answer him.  He got more worried after each item I would pick up or opening his refrigerator.  While I didn't threaten him directly, he soon became paranoid for the safety of his wife and yelled out ""HIDE! HIDE!"".  She ran upstairs while he went downstairs to the basement. I found him huddled and sobbing.  I brought my shovel down on him, he cried out for help and ran to a locked door.  I finished him there.  The mentally disadvantaged wife eventually shuffled through the same room and upon finding his body she kneeled next his corpse and began crying softly.  Her mind was gone but not to the point where she couldn't make perfect sense of the situation.  I stood behind her, aware that I had forced her to live the rest of her confused life alone.  I did the unthinkable and brought the head of my shovel down on her neck and she died violently, curled up next to the corpse of her husband. LOOTED HER BODY AND FOUND TWO DIAMONDS.  TEAM CAN SURVIVE FOR AT LEAST A COUPLE MORE DAYS.  WORTH IT. 9.8/10.			"

												This game is so heart-wrenchingly surreal that it gets my physical heart to beat at key moments. Here's a little taste:Day 17. I'm desperately low on food and the survivors are starving. I decide to raid a nearby house in the hopes of stockpiling food. Uponarriving, I find the jouse inhabited by two brothers and their elder parents. I sneak in through the back unnoticed. One of the brothers is about to walk through the door so I ascend to the second. Through the keyhole, I see an old woman come down from the attic and approach the door. I ready my knife and pray that she doesn't come any closer to the door. I don't want to kill her. She stops, idles for a moment in self pity, and then turns back around and enters a different room. I enter and scavenge for supplies when the same brother enters, causing me to hide. He finds the place suspicious and approaches my hiding place. I panic and lunge at him from hiding. He dies noisily, and his brother hears. He runs to apprehend me, but he is unarmed. I dispatch him quickly. The old mother hears and comes down. She sees one of her dead sons and weeps above him. I pause before her as I realize what I've done to them. She cries as she says their names. In one final act of pity, I kill her where she kneels. I loot the rest of the house and escape to my shelter, food in tow. The father, out of earshot to it all and asleep, I've left to awaken to the massacre.This game touches me so deeply that these actions of mine caused me to ask myself, ""what if this was a choice that I couldn't just hit the resatrt button to?"" Then I realized: that question is the game.			"

												Being someone who lived through war (Syria & Palestine) I can tell you this game is amazing and serves its purpose.It's really emotional and can get depressing at timesIt forces you to make moral, ethical, vital decisions (which is not easy at all)I think the beauty of it is that it spreads awareness in a different unusual wayCause I do believe that most games these days are glorifying war more and more every dayDon't get it twisted, I play tons of shooters myself (First & Third person) but nevertheless.although it brings me back some bad memories, I love it.As far as gameplay is considered, it's pretty simple and neat, nothing too complicatedyou'll get the hang of it after playing for five minutes.And yes, there is some parts here and there which are not that realistic when it comes to warAfter all, it's a game,But still, I have to give credit to the games team,I can really see that they have put a lot of work and heart and time in this.the only thing I can say that I thought was missing from the game..Is voice acting. I think it would have made the experience even more beautiful and authentic than it is.Conclusion: If you want a well-made war simulator from an innocent civilian perspectiveGET THIS GAME !plus it's on sale nowNote: I wanted to play a bit more before actually reviewing the game but I just genuinely loved it.

												Pavle was a man.Pavle was a father.Pavle was a killer.Pavle was a hero.On day 5, Pavle robbed an elderly couple. They just stood there and watched as he searched through their house, looking for supplies to feed his friends.On day 8, Children came to our house begging us to take their mother to the hospital. Pavle volunteered, saving her life.On day 13, Pavle killed two hobos with his bare hands. He stole their box, they came after him with knives. He had no choice.Pavle was never the same. He returned with supplies. His friends would live. But he couldn't live with himself. He killed two people the other night. And for what? Carrots and bandages? He sat there, depressed.A former football star.Breaking down.Crying. He couldn't live with himself. He hated what he had done.""No more blood on my hands""He swore as his friend Katia went over to console him.He took a well-earned drink of moonshine and went to bed.Pavle. A man. A human. Acting the way a human should act when they kill another human.Pavle went out a few nights later, robbing various places. He robbed thugs, he robbed soldiers, he robbed defenseless civilians. He did whatever he could to keep his friends Katia, Anton, and Bruno alive.But he wouldn't kill. Ever again.Day 17: Pavle couldn't sleep.Day 18: No one could sleep.

												Well.. for a very long time.. I didn't want to start playing this game.Not because this is a good game...It is a wonderfully made 2D suvival simulater set in a besiged city.You are not soliders in the war but you are a team of one to four civilian survivor to do everything possible to survive..Will you steal? Will you murder? Will you rob the elderly and doom them to death?Wonderfully pencil draw graphics .. awesome music/songs (some are sad...Will there be a dlc for original sound track in the future?). Simple survial element of crafting and building type of game play. Very basic combat situations that don't happen very offen.There are practically everything done perfectly for this game... except it sets in a very sad background. Civilian in war is hard... Simulate in game is already hard enough for me to make a lot moral decision in order to survive. I cannot not even imaging what true war will bring if it happens to me in real life.Game play is quite simple but very unforgiving since there are no save option except a daily ironman type autosave.Survive for those 45 days if you can! Once you finish this game and put it down.. make sure you make peace not war in RL.9.5/10 A masterpiece suvival game that survival fan must play!			"

tl;dr -> This War of Mine has been specifically designed to make you feel like the most hopeless, utter piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ tugging at your emotions at every opportunity. It will try to take you to the breaking point where you finally begin to consider robbing/killing your helpful neighbor for a few cans of food. This is good, because it makes the game a fantastic war simulator.Despite my massive backlog, I had decided to pick up This War of Mine because the premise really, really intrigued me - I absolutely love survival games. To emphasize this, I had purchased The Long Dark, then Eternal Winter, then This War of Mine. Although the first two games were a lot of fun, they were still fairly barebones due to early-access status.I played This War of Mine for 7 hours straight when I first tried it - 3 playthroughs. I love this game so much that I will be adding immersion-stories to the comments of this review, as well as in my steam group. As an avid reviewer, I play A LOT of games in a short amount of time, and this is easily one of my favorite ones.If you like grim survival gameplay in a war-torn country, deep immersion potential, testing the limits of your emotions, dark atmospheric themes, and elements from the rogue-like genres, then you will thoroughly enjoy this wonderful, macabre game. I was extremely impressed that an indie game was able to capture the essence of the brutalities and ugliness of war on such an artistic scale.The aesthetics are fantastic! If you've played the atmospheric platformer Deadlight, you will notice some similarities in the side-scrolling environments. The level of detail in the areas and character models are great, however, I wish there was an option of changing your characters' clothing and appearance (not a big deal). A pencil-shading effect (similar to grain-filter effect seen in games like Mass Effect) adds a very nice touch to the dark and sombre atmosphere - you can adjust this to be soft or more obvious. The music and sounds are great and suit the theme of the game very well. You can also build a radio and leave one of two stations on - one classical and the other more of a general music genre. There is no voice-acting, which I found to flow well with the playstyle.The game is point-and-click based, so the controls are fairly easy to familiarize yourself with. The learning curve is moderate to difficult, your experience with survival games and how to plan your actions will really affect how successful you may be - keep in mind that the game strongly encourages a pacifist (excluding self-defence) approach. When you start the game, there is no tutorial - you are immediately thrown right into your safehouse. You start off with (usually) 3 survivors randomly chosen from the grand survivor pool - each with a specific skill and weakness (or vice). For example, Arica has a much higher stealth rating and likes to smoke to calm down. You also start in a random season (usually NOT winter). The loot is randomized in each area, however, the layout of each location you can visit remains static. The game operates on a day/night cycle (you can fast forward to night) - during the day, you will be in your safehouse and do things like build structures, eat, sleep, etc. During the night, you will give your group members different orders: have some sleep, guard, or scavenge (only one may visit an area per night). The areas you can visit are randomized each playthrough, and will sometimes be inaccessible if the civil war leaks over into certain areas. Something I just found out today was that, after  the militia pushes the government's army out of the city, some areas may show signs of war. For example, the church will be devastated and have construction ladders around the outside of it, with armed looters present. This impressed me immensely. (I read up on this, and apparently some areas have more than 1 possible layout, randomized each time you play through)  As you progress through the game, traders and recruit-able survivors will periodically visit your safehouse (limited to one event per day). Various neighbours will also come and ask for your help -  assisting them usually yields immediate or future rewards; and also boosts morale. Each character needs to eat and sleep - being deprived of either for too long may result in their death or desertion. When you kill, or if a group member is injured/killed, remaining group members will usually experience a blow to morale. Morale falls from ""sad"" -> ""depressed"" -> ""broken."" When a character is broken (and sometimes depressed), they will be unresponsive to your commands - you will have to have other characters deliver food and medication to them. They will also be unusable as scavengers. To combat this, you can have any of your group members talk to the broken character - you can also try having two characters drink together to alleviate some stress. Building and crafting is a major element of this game, and you will really have to plan out your build and scavenge routes to maximize your time. Trying to simply rush to the highest craft tier will most likely result in your quick death. On the city map, each visit-able location will have a list of items available to scavenge. Items do not respawn or restock in the different areas, and it is generally a bad idea to rely on randomness if you are in dire need of a specific item, like medicine for example. There are many areas where you can trade/steal from others, however, be advised that (at least early) violent/aggressive playstyles make the game exceedingly difficult if you are unprepared. Killing even one person damages group morale significantly, and it is very easy to find yourself with a group of mostly depressed/broken individuals.The game adds amazing immersion in the character cards - the different members will record their opinions on what's happening. For example: if the group is starving, but Pavle has eaten, then he will have a comment saying something like: I must find my friends food since I am not hungry. The reactions when someone has committed murder or died are very interesting to see as well.Overall, This War of Mine paints what I would expect an accurate, emotion-driven picture of what life would be like for unfortunate individuals caught in a war, and the tribulations they have to face to simply survive. If you are interested in war simulation and/or survival elements at all, then I implore you to try this game. You will not come out feeling good after playing it (more of an anti-catharsis), but you will not be disappointed.ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND! Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												I will always remember the first kill I did in the game.It was during my first hours of play, I went inside the shelled school (full of homeless) searching for some supplies. I never met a stranger in the game, so I was really affraid of meeting one.So I was looting discreetly, trying to avoid every persons, thinking they were a danger, especially since I hearded about all these muggers and soldiers. But I made a mistake, and went in a room without checking it before, and just found myself standing up, a man in front of me.This person was showing his back, hearded me, and started turning around. I panicked, jumped on him, and hit him with my showel. He falled back but didn't died, so I hit him again, killing it this time.Finally meeting and killing a person after all this hours of play, all this hours of tension and pressure, just paralyzed me. I didn't move for some seconds, just watching the corpse, my showel full of blood in the hand, until some other persons breaked into the room.I saw them like another danger and was about to react, when they started screaming things like ""You killed him !!"" - ""Oh my god why did you do that ?!"" - ""Please don't kill us !!!"" .It was a mess in my brain, it kind of disfonctionned for a seconde. In this kind a situation, in a video game, it's the regular and right thing to do isn't it ? (I Am Alive players know what I'm talking about).After this sec, I just felt extremely bad, like if I did a terrible mystake in real life, the kind of you can barely repair.I immediately ran away and left the building, letting behind me people crying on their friend's body. Not because I was afraid of them - they seems more scared than me and non-agressive - but because I just could not faced them and the consequences of my act.So yeah, all of this happens in 10 sec, but it was a great moment. This game his great, because it combines good gameplay with deep emotions, in an unusual way.10/10			"

												For some reason, it has taken me a bit of time to try out This War of Mine. After finally jumping in, I have to say — delaying this is was a huge mistake. Great atmosphere, excellent attention to detail, and a ton of variety to gameplay elements make it easily one of the best games I've played this year. While it lacks the lustre and grandeur of AAA titles, This War of Mine still spares nothing in its devious crafting of a dangerous, war-torn world and a phenomenal survival experience not like anything I’ve played.This War of Mine opens with the ruined skyline of an unnamed city, and a single button that reads not “Play”, but “Survive”. As soon as you press it, the scene pans right to a trio of ragged-looking survivors, who’ll be your protagonists. From the onset you’re given a trial-by-fire tutorial that begins the game with one member of your randomized crew injured, and another sick. Offering the supplies you’ll need to tend to these is all the help the game offers, leaving it to your abilities to learn how to use them and which ones you need to stock up on.This War of Mine uses a simple day/night cycle to break up gameplay modes. During the day, everything happens at the home base. Crafting supplies, furniture, and other necessities dominates this time. Resting and patching up wounded or sick group members happens here, as well. At night, you’re offered a chance to send one of your group on a scavenging run into the city. Each party member can opt to sleep, guard the base, or head out to search for much-needed supplies and materials. Danger fills the embattled landscape, but the rewards can often outweigh the risk.Surviving in This War of Mine is no simple task. With sickness and injury as the most obvious threats, hunger, tiredness, and other factors have a lot to do with progress. One of my early scavenging runs left the returning Pavle wracked with guilt, represented by a ‘Sad’ status condition that lowered his productivity after walking into an elderly couple’s home and leaving with a full load of food. This moral angle keeps things interesting; you’ll also encounter other survivors wanting trade, asking for help, or outright hostile and trying to take your possessions.I’m being entirely honest - This War of Mine is one of the best all-around games I’ve played all year. A crisp, consistent atmosphere, intuitive gameplay, and surprising depth create a fantastic experience. While the pretty steep difficulty may cause some to shy away, I enjoyed myself even as my group was falling apart — it all began when Marko was killed on a scavenging run. Filled with difficult moral and survivalist choices, it keeps you on your toes and thinking the entire time. While the 18,99€ price tag on Steam may be higher than many indie titles, it’s easy for me to say it’s entirely worth it. If you’re on the fence, wait for a sale — but jump on it as soon as one pops up.			"

												Marko had spent last night scoping the place out. He clutched his pistol tightly with a pair of sweaty plams. This was it. Slowly, he edged towards the door and out of the rain, opening it with a gentle sigh from the hinges. It was dingy inside; the gloom was heavy. Taking slow steps forwards he made his way to the next door. Knelling down and looking through the grimy keyhole, he saw no one. Good, he thought to himself. Nudging the door open with his pistol, the hooded survivor krept down the hall. Footsteps! Quickly hiding in the gloom of an alcove, he held his breath tightly as a young woman walked past. Some part of him was screaming in anguish over the moral dilema. It's not right, the voice spoke to him. His conscience needed to be suffed, and he ignored it as the door closed. The woman was inside the kitchen. He just needed to wait, and-""Emil!"" she screamed suddenly. Marko bit his lip as she locked eyes with him, only to run upstairs. Grasping the weapon as his breathing became hard, the young man ran through the open kitchen door, slid down the ladder, and burst into the basement. Turning and looking for a place to hide, he wanted to cry. There was nowhere. ""Not here,"" came a strong masculine voice from above. Markos slowly turned to face the door, his eyes shaking in their sockets. Some bloke in a blue shirt ran into the room, holding a knife high. ""Bandit!"" Marko was up against the wall. He couldn't hold the pistol properly because his hands were shaking so hard. Two shots burst through the gloom. One hit the man square in the chest, the other in his knee. Although wounded he charged, stabbing Marko twice as they grappled for freedom. Life and death. Markos raised his pistol to fire and......He missed. He died before he could realize the folly, falling limp with a soft plod as the knife sunk into his neck. Marko had been a hero, always willing to brave danger to feed his fellow survivors, always volunteering to scavange, and never letting anyone go hungry. He'd been a hero. Pavle realized his best friend was dead the moment he didn't come back. He was distraught. Waiting by the door all day, sitting on the floor and listening for hours. The young sports star had only eaten once, and his face was grim. ""I'm sure he's just la-"" began Bruce. Pavle sucked his breath in sharply, cutting Bruce off. ""No,"" he said slowly. ""Marko is never late. Ever since this started he was always back on time."" Taking a knife from the floor besides him, Pavle looked Bruce in the eye. They knew it had to be done. It was raining again. The journey to the house had been uneventful, and Pavle knew roughly what was up, thanks to Marko's work two nights before. Slowly but surely he crept into the dark building, illuminated only by the blinking lights and fire. Creeping into the kitchen the football player could see food. He was glad. Sliding down the ladder and turning around, however, his mood plumeted. There lay Marko; his corpse pale in the darkness. Blood was all across the floor and up the back wall, with the body slumped slightly against it. His face was frozen in time, eyes wide in fear. Pavle was... calm. He knew what he need to do now. Going back up the ladder and shunting the kitchen door open, with no regard for stealth, he charged up the stairs. Up and up he went, his breathing becoming savage as he reached the very top floor. Pavle heard groaning and the moving of objects, but he didn't care, bursting through the door he stared a bandaged and bloody man in the eyes. ""No... you can't!"" cried a female voice behind him. Running forwards with his knife in hand, Pavle screamed as tears streamed down his angry face. The blade sunk deep into the wounded man, killing him instantly. Turning to face the woman, and watching her run out of the room, Pavle ran after her. She was too slow, and his blade was very sharp. Her body fell limp about as fast as he used to score a goal. Checking both their bodies with no respect, the sports star cursed. They had nothing on them. When he got back to the safehouse, Pavle was covered in blood. Alica asked him what happened, but Bruce merely handed him a drink. Placing the knife off to one side, Pavle just sat down, and wept. They had killed his best friend... and he had killed them. -------EDIT: Complaints and whatnot, decided to do a little proper review down here.This War of Mine is powerful because of how it handles itself. There's an overtone of helplessness and regret, characters lamenting over their uselessness. Often when someone dies, they'll hope the next one isn't them. Marko is dead.Those three words gave off more emotion than every other war game I've played. I didn't need to twoniner my foxtrot, I wasn't ""getting my♥♥♥♥♥quot; down to 'bravo point', there wasn't some black hawk down, and my 'LZ' wasn't 'too hot'. I didn't even have to press [F] to pay respects. Marko is dead. I just saw these three words as my screen faded to black. Then I was back at camp, and the others knew something was up. I can't really express how profound that was. Perhaps because of how subtle the game was, the moment it outright told me someone was dead, then moved on... maybe that's why it was so powerful. This War of Mine allows you to build characters up. It's literally an open book and it'll allow you to draw as many conclusions as you want. Because of that, I feel, it was made much more personal. Let me explain: I'm a writer, see? I write characters, get attatched to them, and sometimes watch them die. I'm constantly close to my own creations. I feel like this game lets everyone else do that, too. If you want to make your own characters with it, that's totally fine, and it will let you. If not? That's still fine, because the game tells you enough on its own to invest you regardless. I'm kind of rambling here, so I'll end this edit thus: This was not the game I wanted, this was the game I needed.Also the DLC is garbage sadly. Hopefully their new game is better.			"

A gritty, unforgiving adventure into the war-stricken land of...Russia?You survived the radioactive wasteland of Fallout. You crafted a rough-shod bunker out of dirt and leaves in 7-days to die. You managed to log off of Rust for 5 minutes without losing everything you worked so hard for, for 9 straight hours. None of that has prepared you to survive just 5 days in This War Of Mine.You start the game with just a small group of survivors in the war-torn country of possibly Russia. I'm only going by what the names of the characters resemble. I didn't actually read anything. Your starting point is a bombed-out ""home"" (In quotes because it's a damned big home) in which you have multiple rooms to clear for the purpose of scavaging and having space to build things such as rain-water filters, beds and cook stoves. Building these items requires parts such as wood, scrap and gears(?). Some of which you will find in your shelter on day one, the rest you have to scavange from other locations.MechanicsThe mechnanics of the game is simply point-and-click. The game is divided into two parts; Day and night. The daytime is when you build up your shelter (protect it with patched up holes, upgrade your cook-stove or work bench, build furniture to make people happier), cook food, apply medicine or various other things to keep your group happy/healthy. Nighttime is dedicated mostly to scavaging, but also allows to to allocate who gets rest, and who guards your shelter. The day is divied into ten-minute increments and you are allowed 12 hours per day/night. Everything happens in ""real-time"" but that is a bit of a misnomer as it takes ten minutes to take 5 steps or to climb a ladder. Double-clicking allows you to run to your destination, which speeds you up my a factor of two, and I have yet to see any downside to doing this (i.e. fatigue). Clicking on piles of rubbles, doors, bars, etc. allows you to perform a contextual based action such as sift through rubble, open/close doors, pick locks or pry open doors with a crowbar, saw through metal bars, etc. GameplayYour goal, from what I have seen so far, is to simply survive. Something we have all done in countless games before. Only his time, it is brutal, gritty, real, and unforgiving. You are constantly battling hunger, exhaustion, sickness, depression, wounds and more. Balancing the act of taking care of your group, as well as sending people out to scavange (so that you CAN take care of your group) becomes an excercise of patience, frustration, and futility. You will lose people, you will get frustrated, you will die, and you will hate the game as you click ""try again"".ControlsAgain, just point and click. It's simple enough without taking anything away from the game. GraphicsGritty, pencil-drawn-esque style artwork really works here.The game is a bit of a 2-D sidescroller, s don't expect a whole lot.SoundThis is one area where I was a bit let down. The sound design leaves a lot to be desired, when using the radio. The sound is alright until then.What sets it apart?So what is it that makes this game unique? It's the fact that the game actually makes you FEEL the consequences of your actions. Remember that old couple who's home you raided and who's food you stole? Your group will. And they will talk about how aweful it was. Return to thier home? Now they are dead because YOU took thier food and medicine. You will not feel good about it. Niether will your group, as actions like this will affect them in a negative way. It's up to you to decide how you survive, and what kind of person you will be. Just remember: you will not survive by being the nice guy.OverallAreaScoreGraphics7/10Sound7/10Gameplay8/10Fun9/10Replay Value10/10 "

												After 24 hours of total game time (and many attempts), I finally survived This War Of Mine﻿. I was *elated*. The narrative was totally gripping, and I got a little teary-eyed reading the epilogue stories about my survivors. I figured once I finished the game I would be done, but I still want to play again. Easily one of my favorite games of 2014.Update, 4/23/15: This game remains one of my favorites, and respect to 11 bit studios for their DLC pack, the proceeds from which go to the War Child charity to help children in war-torn countries. I picked that up, and you should, too!Replayability: It's been asked if the game has any replayability. I didn't expect it to, but for me at least, it does. I find myself drawn back to this one, even after having survived the war twice.PS - You CAN bring someone back from terminally ill! It's difficult, but I have done it. :)			"

├Professors Review┤Game Pros • Looting/Crafting • Hunger System • Happiness System (Happy, Sad, Depressed,..etc) • Weapons (Melee/Ranged) • Gives you moral choices to make, effecting chances of your survival Game Cons • Strictly Click to move (Would have been nice if they added a WASD option)Relateable Games • N/A ConclusionThis War Of Mine is an amzing platform game. No zombies, no crazy aliens, just people, dealing with other people in need, or looking for trouble. The game doesnt make it easy to survive. Do you use the little wood you got on that loot run for a bed? Or do you use it to burn on the stove to cook your food so you dont get sick? Every little choice leads up to your survival or death. Truly an amazing game.(If you found this review helpful, consider giving it a thumbs up!) "

Overview:This War of Mine is a strategic, tactical, point & click 2D-sidescroller with traits of life-sim, but it practices a different theme compared to other war games. The title is developed and published by polish devs 11 bit studios. It's a game that doesn’t look at either military side of a war, it looks at what's in the middle – innocent victims caught amidst somebody else’s conflict. It’s available on Steam, the App Store and Google Play Store.Story:The story in This War of Mine changes every time you begin a new campaign. The player begins with a group of people who have shelter, some food and some tools; after that the game plays out day by day, and it’s the player's task to manage resources and make the characters survive as long as they possibly can. They’re in the middle of a city used as a battleground for a war in an eastern-European country.A campaign that I went through:Day 1: I begin with Marin, Katia, and Arica in an abandoned building. Arica sneaks, Katia bargains, and Marin builds. Each of them have personal backstories. The first day everyone searches through the building. Arica leaves to scavenge a gas station. Marin and Katia stay and guard. Arica gets food, components, fuel, and herbs.Day 2: All three are tired and hungry; Arica and Katia eat, Marin makes two beds. Arica and Katia sleep, Marin builds a Workshop, a heater, then eats. Arica goes out, Marin sleeps, Katia guards. Arica goesto the gas station.Day 3: The shelter was raided, Marin is slightly wounded, but they stole nothing. Arica and Katia sleep, Marin builds an Herbal Workshop, Metal Workshop, makes a knife. Arica wakes up, eats. Marin and Katia eat and guard. Arica goes to the gas station. She finds a soldier harassing a girl. Arica uses her knife to fight the soldier and kills him, he severely wounded Arica. The girl is saved. Arica keeps the man's gun.Day 4: Arica is severely wounded. Marin is sick. Katia bargains with someone. Despite lack of food, fuel, and Arica's wounds, all three are content. Arica stays and sleeps, Marin guards, Katia goes out to a supermarket. She sees someone but gets by unnoticed. On her way out she bumps into and kills him out of fear.Day 5: Arica is severely injured, Marin is sicker, Katia is now sad. Food is low, fuel is high. Marin and Katia sleep. Katia goes out with a gun in hand. She goes to the military outpost. When trading doesn’t work, she shoots and kills one, severely wounds another, and gets killed.Day 6: Katia is dead, Marin is sick, and Arica is severely wounded. No food, little fuel, gun was lost. Arica goes out, Marin stays to sleep. She moves slowly at a nearby church already robbed. As a last ditch effort to bring back medicine for Marin she kills three men, robs them. On her way back and another thief appears claiming to be friendly. He shoots Arica and she dies.Day 7: Everything has gone to♥♥♥♥♥♥ Marin was raided and is now severely ill and wounded. He has no food, no fuel, and is depressed. He can’t even go out to scavenge.Day 8: Marin is terminally ill. He sleeps all day in bed.Day 9: Marin is dead.I didn’t make it.Gameplay:Find supplies: food/consumables, crafting materials, electronics, weapons, valuables, etc. To do that you must leave the shelter and look for it in houses, schools, hospitals, and churches, among other city structures. There is a Day & Night system at play: During the day your characters are forced to stay inside because of snipers which prey on people out in the open; inside they can eat, build, rest, smoke, talk to each other, etc... Traders, beggars, and people looking for shelter will knock on the door often, it’s something that might kill you or help you live another day, you could ignore it; it’s also how one can acquire more characters, or just another mouth to feed. During the night your characters can sleep, guard the shelter, or go out scavenging. Since you have more than one character, each can do something different. However, bandits can and will raid your shelter during the night while you’re scavenging, and you won’t know this happened until the beginning of the next day. Characters can get different conditions of varying levels: Hunger (still hungry, hungry, very hungry, starving, extremely starving), Fatigue (tired, very tired, and exhausted), Emotion (content, normal, sad, depressed, and broken), and Health (slightly sick, sick, severely ill, terminally ill, slightly wounded, wounded, severely wounded, lethally wounded). And some other states that I’m likely forgetting about.The thrilling gameplay takes place mainly while one or more of the characters is out scavenging for supplies. Technically anything goes, but there are always consequences. Anything out of the line of sight will be blurry or foggy (like past a door, or on a higher floor). Entering an owned property will require sneaking; walking is silent, but running causes noise. There are some hiding places to hide from other survivors. If they hear any noise you made or spot you in their line of sight they will check it out, but they might give up thinking it’s a rat, as they make some noise when scurrying around too. You can hear steps and they are visible on-screen, it might be a person or a rat. If it’s a person and you are revealed to them it will trigger different events, either a fight or a discussion on whether to trade, or maybe extortion. This is where trust is tested.If a character has gone through different experiences, like helping out a neighbor pull his family out of rubble, the morale of the group will change, they might become content; if a character kills someone during a night of scavenging, the opposite will happen, when a character reaches the state of ‘broken’, they will not have the will to eat, sleep, or even move – they’ll have given up on life - and might escape the shelter (disappear) or commit suicide.Visual:2.5D is was you would call this game, since it’s built in 3D but is viewed from the side. You can zoom-in just enough to see the detail in the environments and the characters. The HUD is clear and though sometimes there might be a lot of icons on the screen, it never feels too in-your-face. Animations are for sure the biggest plus that this game has in graphics, the animations are amazing; from simple knocks on the door to grabbing someone from behind, throwing them on the ground, and stabbing them to death. The art style doesn’t chase realism very much, but it isn’t stylized by any means; it’s the perfect blend of semi-realism and atmospheric feel.Sound:This game has got the environmental sounds among silence completely nailed. Sounds like making food, opening and closing doors, all the way to the way stabs sound, it is simply superb.Final Thoughts:It never lets you win. You either finish a campaign completely dissatisfied or you finish a campaign with the vaguest feeling on dissatisfactory satisfaction. For those who crave a challenging resource management mechanic, this game should scratch that itch mighty well.You might do things in this game that will surely surprise you, things you wouldn’t expect yourself to even think about doing, but you can do it because it’s simply a game; how nice it is to sit in your cozy chair in your cozy house and experience this awful world, without ramifications; makes you think about things, doesn’t it?The game is an unforgiving and emotionally wrenching experience that shows how psychopathic human nature can be once humanity is pushed back to primal environments. It's made to reflect the realities of living in a war-torn city.Liked this review? Join my group and follow my curator page. "

The war game we desperately needed.You will have to make severe decisions which will not only impact your own life but also those around you.Developer: 11 Bit StudiosPublisher: 11 Bit StudiosFormat: PCReleased: November 14th, 2014""I never thought I'd end up running and hiding from my buddies. But that's how things turned out. We were like brothers, and now I'm a dead man to them. My crew had ruled the hood since we were teens until just before the war. Then some of us got drafted, like my best friend Leon, others like me volunteered for the militia, it was going to be the ultimate showdown and every single one of us wanted a piece of the action"" - Roman (Playable character)This is a game I've been waiting for so long.Usually when you hear someone mention war and games you automatically think about games like Call of Duty, Battlefield or Medal of Honor since those are the games we are used to.""Why isn't there any game out there where you don't run around guns blazing but actually have to survive war as a civilian?""That's what I was always thinking when I heared another Call of Duty or Battlefield hits the market.Then some time later I found This war of mine.Ever since that day I was really excited for it because that was exactly what I wanted.A game where you aren't the chosen one. Where you don't become a hero and save a nation or the whole world.You're also not a survival specialist. You're just a normal person caught in the shadow of war trying your very best every day and every night to survive. Where you actually have to think of every consequence. Do I go out tonight to gather some stuff? Who get's to eat and sleep? Should I give this shady looking guy shelter?You start the game with nothing of value. All you have are three civilians you have to take care off.After you got to know the character by reading their Biography you'll notice that some of the characters have some traits like Good Cook or Runner for example. That means that some characters are better suited for specific tasks and situations then others and it's up to you to find out how to exactly put the characters and their traits to good use.What really got me was the situation on Day 3.I had to decide whether or not I rob the house of an elderly couple.  The moment I entered the house the husband was following me around,asking me what I'm doing, what I'm looking for and begged me to not hurt his ill wife. Needlessly to say I never thought that would bother me since we're used to such situation where we would actually rob this couple laughing... but it did. I felt terrible. I needed medicine since one of my characters got wounded at night when he was out scavenging and I didn't want to let him suffer and slowly dieThe old man basically asked me not to take to much since he needs it for his wife. Now I could decide. Whose life do I value more? The guy who went scavenging last night to get some resources and who really tries to help his group or the life of the old Lady I basically know nothing off. So I took the medicine. After I left the house and came back the bio of my character was updated and he actually felt sad that he had to do this in order to survive. Even the other two were torn whether or not he made the right decision and the woman in my group actually felt sad as well while the other guy supported his decision to take the medicine.There are several other instances that got to me like when I found an abandoned hospital and there were actual Doctors and Nurses which tried their best to help the people in need ... And I had to rob them in order for my group to survive.You encounter a lot of characters which are just in the need of help since they're also stuck in hell on earth that is war but you simply can't trust them at times.Also another positive aspect of the game is that you have to keep your characters warm and in good condition at all times if possible. Since it gets colder as the game progresses and the difficulty really increases once you reach winter.After I survived my first run I was a bit torn. I don't know how many people I screwed over in order for just one of my group to survive. We were four at some pointWar is hell. This game truly shows what war does to people. "

												This War Of Mine is a harsh, unforgiving and absolutely delightful game. You begin with a small group of ordinary people, each having their own skills and weaknesses and try to survive through a civil war that has left you with barely no resources. At it's core, the concept of the game is quite simple (yet innovative for all I know): during the day, you must make the best of what you have to organize your shelter in order to tend to the needs of your group while at night, you go scavenging for the resources you are in dire need of. Where all this really takes off, is how the game mechanics have been fine tuned so that each and every day, the stakes are to the max. As it is the case for any realistic survival situation, every bits of food and material is vital and must be carefully managed, every step you make while scavenging can be deadly and have irreversible consequences - this is a rogue-like game: you cannot save and everything you do generally have irreversible consequences. For instance: you must have water to cook food (per the game's mechanics, raw food is less nourishing) and given a group of four people, you hence might need a certain amount of water to feed them well. Let's say one day you forget to tend to your water collector, the raw food you have might then not be sufficient to nourish everyone in your group. Being malnourished, someone might get sick so that, on your scavenging night, instead of simply having to find a little amount of food, you now must find water, lots of food and some meds. Meds are usually rare and chances are you'll have to sneak your way in some dangerous place to find some (and perhaps even kill someone if you get caught stealing), all this because you forgot to tend to your water collector! Add to this mix a bunch of unexpected, random events such as kids begging for meds at your shelter, a friendly neighbor offering you a batch of vegetables, your well crafted survival plans can easily go south in the blinking of an eye. This is, in my opinion, what makes this game so addictive, intense, frustrating and yet deeply enjoyable. On the technical side, there are very few bugs. The graphics are a perfect fit to the game's spirit; the environments are diverse and not repetitive and while the music themes can be a bit repetitive they do create a very good atmosphere. In all, if you like survival games for the sense of vulnerability and intensity they provide, if you appreciate rogue-like games such as FTL, you will definitively love This War Of Mine.			"

												I almost cried after I had my character kill an elderly couple with a hatchet for a bottle of pills and some scraps of meat.Its a different perspective than every other war game, rather than being a soldier like in CoD, or being that one guy that murders everyone laughing maniacally like in Fallout, you actually feel the feels of a person struggling to survive in a sieged city. If you have a phobia of killing innocent people, its not the game for you. Like I said before, I almost cried at least 5 times in the course of one playthrough.I r8 8/8 m8, gr8 game.			"

												Initially, I wanted to play the game peacefully; scavenging but never stealing, growing foods when I could, trading for whatever else I needed by growing tobacco and crafting cigarettes. After repeatedly failing to keep my characters alive, as they met fates such as freezing to death, starvation, sucumbing to sickness, or being murdered by armed thugs, my morals began to fade.I started a new game, and I was done being the victim. I crafted a knife for Pavle, my chosen assassin, each night going out in search of trouble. Like a trained hunter, I’d stalk bad guys as they made their rounds in a building. I'd jump out of the shadows, the armed thug caught totally off guard as he smoked a cigarette, quickly stabbing them to death. I was ruthless, meticulous, and my characters were living great. That is, until I slipped up and one of them shot Pavle in the back as he tried to escape. Things went downhill after that. Pavle survived, but nursing him back to health slowly depleted my limited resources.Another night, as Pavle climbed through the window of a fortified home, he came face to face with an armed female guard. Pavle quickly dispatched of the girl, but what came next chilled me to the bone. As the girl’s lifeless body lay on the floor of the home, I heard footsteps coming from the floor above. Pavle hid in the shadows, waiting for the next victim to show their face. This time though, instead of a heavily armed thug, all Pavle saw was a grieving mother. She ran to her daughter’s body, falling to the floor in tears as she held her murdered child. As Pavle emerged from his hiding place, she screamed at him, just wanting to know why he was doing this. The unfortunate reality of the situation was that Pavle still needed the shotgun that poor girl was carrying, and nobody was going to stop him from getting it.The profound weight of his actions had begun to take a toll on Pavle. Severe depression and sickness had started to creep in. Still, when Pavle was physically able, I sent him back out into the night. More dangerous encounters led to Pavle suffering another gunshot, this time worse than the first. As he returned home, empty handed and bleeding profusely, I knew what would come next for my once glorious killer.With Pavle returning with an empty backpack, I only had enough food to feed 2 people. Someone would need to go without. As I looked over my 3 survivors, all hungry, Pavle stuck out as being a particular problem. He was very hungry, bleeding at an unprecedented level, and severely depressed. With the extremely limited resources on hand, I knew there was little that I could do to get poor Pavle back to 100%. So I stopped feeding him, and I stopped bandaging his wounds. I told myself it would be much easier with him gone, scavenging for 2 should be much easier than for 3. He died 2 days later from his injuries, a hero to some, monster to countless others.These horrible actions weren't Pavels though, they were mine. I was the monster responsible for murdering a mother and child. I was the executioner of countless men and women that were likely doing the same as I was, whatever was needed to survive another day. In my quest to keep my companions alive during the war, I lost something just as important. My humanity.Read the rest of my review at http://gamecrastinate.com/review/war-mine-review/ "

												I am not sure that I can easily sum up this game.What I will say is that I liked it,I encouraged a friend of mine to play.He was hppy at first, he was making th right first steps...Then things started to go bad, his survivors got sick, hurt, and hungry.I watched him stress out... we both watched his few favorites slowly waste away, unable to complete the basic tasks of survival.I told him that he didn't have to play this game, that he could turn it off.He never did.It was so powerful, so personal.He did his very best made every correct decision to make it thru to get somebody to the finish line.They all died, nobody made it thru.I don't think he ever regretted his play thru, he got angry at the game, angry at the war...an anger that didn't save his people.♥♥♥♥ the War!Buy this Game!

												If I had to sum up This War of Mine in one word, it would be ""powerful"". It is a touching reflection on the suffering caused by war, but through the eyes of civilians rather than soldiers. I actually showed it to a professor of mine who survived the Yugoslav Wars, including spending over three years inside besieged Sarajevo. He was caught there when the Siege started in April 1992 as he tried to help a friend flee the city and ended up being stuck there until 1996, and he has a number of... troubling... stories to tell about the Siege. He actually bought and played This War of Mine for a while and it made him so emotional that he started crying (and he is a very tough, ""old school"" sort of fellow). I think that pretty much sums up what this game is like, in my opinion.As you have likely guessed, this game is not really ""fun"" by any standard, but you should play it anyway, I think.			"

Emotionally crushing & successfully self-reflecting // Recommended for those seeking a personal experience+ Sound effects are nearly flawless in quality and implementation; ambient noises add to a paplable atmosphere+ Pencil effect is mesmerizing, and lends the game a style of its own+ Line of sight is extremely well-represented, and adds to the suspense of not knowing what's in the next room until you're close enough to be at risk+ Scavenging creates at atmosphere pregnant with tension+ The soundtrack pulls the player into the game and engulfs them in emotions appropriate to the theme+ The player-controlled characters are presented and developed so well through one's actions, that one will find a deep emotional investment forming; the player will really care about what happens to these people+ Different surivors have various skill sets, making each one somehow valuable to the others+ Scavenging locations remain static, but their contents and risks are all randomly generated+ Graphics are crisp and meticulously detailed; animations, too, are seamlessly rendered with little clipping issues+ Crafting is slightly basic, but the costs and desperation for materials makes prioretization the crucial factor; crafting is less about hoarding items and advancing, and more about making difficult selections+ Frankly put, the game makes the player choose between devastatingly hard choices; this is further expanded, in that the characters are designed to react emotionally to the consequences of such decisions+ Myriad factors exist to affect one's characters, including sickness, depression, hunger, and temperature; such needs must all be balanced via crafting, trading, and scavenging for materials+ Custom play options increase replay value+ Taking life in the game is intimate and often emotionally involving; this is exacerbated by the reactions of both the victims and the player characters, who often slide into debilitating depression as a result+ Random events can affect the safehouse if one isn't prepared, such as raiding and murders- Bartering feels slightly unbalanced; the player always leaves a trade feeling screwed over, and many common items seem inordinately expensiveLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

												This is the kind of game that will make you wonder about what kind of person you are. Is it worth killing helpless innocents for a couple days' worth of food? Will you help the weak out of kindness? Or will you rob everyone blind in the sheer desire to survive? Sure, you can say ""it's just a game"", but it's impossible to avoid the feeling that your actions here might well mirror your true inclinations. So what's more important, survival or your humanity? Or can you preserve both? There are moments of both incredible kindness and cruelty to be found within, and they stir something in the human soul that I've rarely seen in games. From running a gauntlet of sniper fire to help a wounded father reunite with his infant son to murdering an elderly couple for their meager goods, it's impossible to play this game without thinking, ""Could that be me? Would I do that? Could I rise that high, sink that low?"" And that is the brilliance, the poetry, of this game. "

												This War of MineYou start with three (3) people in your hideout in a middle of a war and you have to survive!You usually have a runner, a cook and a scavenger (sometime you could start with a female character instead of the scavenger, but she is good in trading). During the day, you build equipments, tools and others. During the night you go scavenging to collect items like foods, wood, weapons or other materials. Visually, it is well done and you get the atmosphere of being in a war zone. To be honest, at first it remind me of Deadlight (how it looks) but without the Zombies.You really need to look after you people in this one to be able to go to the next day. Making the wrong choice or not getting food can get you characters depressed or even broken. I only played 3 hours and will definitely play it again.Positive:•	Good concept (War zone) / No zombies•	Visually polished and run smoothly•	Plenty things to doNegative:•	A bit repetitiveOverall, I enjoyed it.MORE THE_CPT_FROGGY REVIEWS HEREFOLLOW THE CPT FROGGY CURATOR PAGE HERE "

												Where to begin really, I was impressed enough by the trailer and the interesting idea to buy the game without looking much into it, so really I didn't know what to expect other than the fact it would have survival elements and was based around a group of civilians in a war zone.My first impression would have to have been the amazing artwork - the level of detail that has gone into every single part of the game's visuals is stunning, with many rooms having stories of their own to tell (for example, at one point you might walk into a shelled out room with some children's drawings on the wall). This factored heavily into my enjoyment of the game itself, as, along with excellent audios it drew me further into the game and made me connect far more with the characters.This connection with the characters is what really made this game shine. From intially not knowing the various people you control very well, you get fed tidbits about their past, and some of their personalities are apparent from how they react to things you might make one of the characters, or indeed, themselves, do. The immersion was so great that when two characters died (actually my third and fourth to die, my first two had died pretty early on and thus I hadn't grown attached to them yet), which prompted a third to leave and never come back, I actually cheered as I wouldn't have to watch him suffer the slow deaths that his friend had. Of course, this enthusiasm was short lived as it suddenly dawned on me, he had left me with only one character, who was also dying of her wounds. The first playthrough ended therefore after five hours of me bumbling about blindly, failing miserably, and being utterly captivated as events unfolded; fighting desperately against the odds to save the lives of my characters.Another plus was the fact that not every single NPC is a raving lunatic planning to murder and/or eat you as is so commonly done in other games set in survival based settings. There are some people with... issues, sure; there are a refreshing number of people who don't just shoot you or stab you in the back.Altogether, I found the game to be one of the best of its kind that I have ever played; I even enjoyed the more mundane moments such as chosing where to place my new furniture (Yeah, trading all my medical supplies to buy materials to make a few armchairs didn't back fire on me at all, honest!). The scavenging is intuitive - the NPCs don't mind too much if you just pick up a few bits of rubble which is strewn about the place, but start picking up stuff they've put in their cuboards? They might object just a little to that one.As for the combat... Well, I sucked at it so can't really go into much detail. Turns out trying to punch someone in the face when they have a shotgun and a buddy armed with an AK standing next to them is a bad idea. I did manage to escape from several combat situations, though in one case 'escaping' meant a slow, lingering death as the wound gradually worsened over the course of several days as I had no bandages to treat him with. So yeah, combat exists, but with the risks of infections and so on, it can be risky to attempt.Altogether - I found the game excellent in virtually every way and far surpassing what I had even begun to expect. I look forward to spending the next few weeks playing it, as it has massively increased replayability by having randomness added not only to the daily events which can occur, but also to the various key events, even including the length of the wars (Sadly enough, I failed miserably despite having an apparently relatively short war to survive through, so I dread to think how badly I will fail at long ones).

												It was 8 PM, time for another scavenging. Tonight it was the quiet house. I peeked through the key hole and I saw an old couple who were reminiscing about old times, unaware of the intruder on their doorstep. I didn't see anyone else. After searching and looting all there were on a pile of rubbles nearby I decided to pay the old couple a visit. The door handle was broken so I just pushed it open. The door creaked like an old man's bones after a long rest. Both of the house's inhabitants were startled and jumped from their seats. ""What do you want? We have nothing here."" I ignored the old man and proceeded to search their cabinet. The old lady screamed in terror and scrambled hastily out of there, guided by her husband. ""Quick! Upstairs!"" I found several materials and food inside, but no bandages. I followed the old couple upstairs. They were hiding in a small room by the end of the corridor. They were sitting in a corner and the old man was facing his wife. He stopped whatever he was doing and turned around, blocking his wife from my sight. ""Please, you can take anything. Just don't kill my wife."" The old man followed me while I paced around the room looking for any sign of bandages. Nothing in the desk drawer. Nothing in the cupboard. Also nothing even in the medicine cabinet in the bathroom. I returned to the room. And I saw it. The old lady had it all along. She grabbed onto the bandage tightly and it was at that moment that I saw a wide gash on her skirt. They were wet with blood. She must have gotten the wound just now since it was not there earlier. So, the old man was treating his wife when I barged in. I reached out my hand. ""Hand me the bandages."" The old man was taken aback, ""No, please. Anything but that. I need to treat her wound."" He continued to beg me. I was at a loss. Damn! Katia was severely wounded by last night's raid and I had to patch her up quick or she won't last until tomorrow. It was either us or them. It was better us than them, right? Right?? With harsher tone, ""Just hand me the bandages and I will leave you guys alone."" The old man suddenly rushed towards me to attack. I was surprised but not for long. He was fast but I was faster. I reflexively reached to the knife I hid behind and it was all over in a matter of minutes. As I stared at the pool of blood at my feet and the bandages in my hand I wonder what kind of monster that I have become. This was definitely not my most cheerful moment. In this life. Or in this war of mine.			"

												I'm not that hardcore of a gamer, but This War of Mine (TWoM) managed to make me glued to my seat in front of my laptop for hours. Everytime I played this I discover something new (how to clean out Military Outpost, how to safely pass Sniper Junction, how to kill the bandits in St. Mary's Church, etc.). And on top of that, this is the only game that managed to give me something to think about: war is hell and I should be grateful for all of my comforts in life. After playing this game I even felt guilty having leftover food on my plate. Consider that as message delivered.Bottomline, this game is BRILLIANT and I would recommend it to everyone I know. Really really worth the money. 5 stars!P.S. to the developers: I hope more content is added to this game in the future. Maybe more safehouses? More places to scavenge? New characters with new strengths and weakneses? New items? Marathon mode?			"

												A popular franchise once stated ""War. War never changes"". Maybe so, but for the people caught in the midst of the conflict, everything changes. This War of Mine explores the horrors of war from a perspective not explored in the medium till now and delivers one of the most tense, gripping, and bleak experiences I've played this year.Games like Call of Duty and the like tend to use war for the spectacle, creating big action set pieces from the chaos. You'll never see the war ravaging the country where This War of Mine is set, but its effects are ever present. A gutted war-torn city, all pencil-sketched shadows and ruined structures, reeking of desperation and hopelessness, as explosions thunder and flash ceaselessly outside.This War of Mine is not fun. It's grueling. Unrelenting. Oppressive. You start each playthrough with three survivors. Sometimes one or more might already be sick or wounded. Sometimes it might be winter at the start, meaning fuel and heat will be utmost priorities. The game is divided into two phases: Day, where you're confined to your base because of snipers outside, and Night, where you can venture out and scavenge for supplies, The daytime hours are when you can maintain your survivors and home, crafting new tools and workshops, building defenses against looters, or simply keeping your group alive by making sure they rest, recover, eat. You're always on the back foot, always just barely eking out a miserable day-by-day existence; even when your group finally is healthy and has a good amount of food stored, there's always the sense that it can't last long.Once night falls, you're free to travel to other locations with one survivor, while instructing the others to rest or guard against raiders. These places range from homes and apartment buildings to schools and hospitals, and each scavenging run is a slow intense affair. Similar to 2012's Mark of the Ninja, environments are cloaked in shadows, only areas in your line of sight being visible. New unexplored areas are foreboding, never knowing who resides within or if they're friendly or not.Even when you're equipped with a knife or gun, combat and violence in general feels like a last resort. Not simply because guns and ammo are a rarity or because you're untrained, but because you don't want to kill people or steal from them. A lot of games have moral choices or meters telling you if you're good or bad, but honestly, they've always felt artificial to me. In This War of Mine, there are only murky grey choices. Your actions matter, not just at that moment when you're desperate enough to kill and steal from people who are just trying to survive, people trying to keep their group alive just like you are, but also in the long term, as doing morally questionable things weighs on your characters. Building a radio or finding books and cigarettes can only distract and keep them occupied for so long. Survivors grow depressed, listless, broken, perhaps even suicidal.If anything, that's War of Mine's greatest achievement: the way it makes you feel bad for crossing that moral line or makes intruding onto another group's home feel weird and wrong. You don't want to turn away children asking for help, or steal medicine from that elderly couple, or kill those people for their food. But your group is sick, and starving, and you desperately need fuel to stave off the winter cold, so you must.The days go by. Winter comes and goes. As the war worsens, places that were once safe havens might be overtaken by bandits. Barter, scavenge, do what you must to endure. This War of Mine is the kind of game you might only be able to play in short sessions, due to the overwhelming bleakness and depressing nature. It can be slow and tedious and monotonous, but that only works in the game's favor, establishing a grim ""We just need to last another day"" tone. This War of Mine is not a fun game, but it is one hell of an engrossing, compelling, and atmospheric experience.			"

												WARNING TO ALLNever drop your guard, never lose cautionI was on Day 19, I had enough food to last me another 30 days, I was well armed and armored, I had 4 members in my group, Roman, Marko, Arica and Bruno, my base was well made, I had everything I could build practically, times were good, resources plentiful, and then I went in the church.On a typical scavenging run Markos partway through stumbled upon an armed man sleeping, he quickly slashed his throat, but as he slashed another foe came down from the floor above, a barrier between Markos and any possible escape, Markos ran at the man with knife in hand only to find the foes fists were faster, he tried not once, not twice but thrice to fell the man before him, but he could not land a hit, and in a matter of moments, he was dead.The next day at the base the survivors mourned the death of their comrade, I was filled with grief for my fallen friend, Bruno had been gone the night before assisting some men with repairing their home, Roman and Arica had guarded the base all night, all three were tired, until the afternoon all they could do was rest, Roman then gathered some meat from a trap, they were hungry, but they werent supposed to eat until the next day, having naught else to do, the day was ended.Trusting Bruno and Arica to guard the base while he was away Roman entered the church where Marko had fallen, I was filled with grief and rage, vengeance would be mine! Armed with a shotgun, a knife and a bulletproof vest he ventured deeper into the depths of the church, ""I can take them"" I thought as Roman climbed the ladder which Marko's killer had descended from, upon reaching the next I witnessed a man descending the stairs to my right, Roman pulled out his knife and advanced, the foe fled, giving pursuit Roman witnessed another man pursuing him with pistol drawn, once he fired, missKnowing he dare not turn back Roman continued his pursuit of the cowardly man, through several rooms he pursued him up until the man made it outside and jumped on the roof, the man with the pistol was almost to Roman, Roman closed the door and shotgun in hand waited for his foe to catch up, the door opened, I tried to attack him but the man fired first, frantically I continued to attempt to fire a shot, but alas I could not, second later I was almost dead, I panicked and tried to run! But I couldnt move, as with Marko I had to watch Roman die knowing I could do nothing and he would be gone for good.The next day Bruno and Arica mourned yet another friends passing, actually not Arica, she didnt care, but still my grief and frustration at losing half of my group in 2 days was overwhelming, I quit out of the game, and began writing this review.The morale of this story is that no matter how good your run is going, no matter how well supplied and armed you are, it can all go to♥♥♥♥♥♥pretty easily, believe me when I tell you that with only one or two survivors, you will die in a matter of days, if not by starvation or lack of sleep, by raids, you will lose your supplies, your people will be injured or killed, and then finally, it will end.....On a side note great game! 10/10			"

												♥♥♥♥ the warDay 1:3 People met together: Bruno, Katia, Marko. Searched our basement, found pretty things, made beds for everyone. Everyone was healthy.Day 2: Nobody tried to rob us.  We built some cooker, traded tobacco for food, everyone had dinner. Everyone was happy.Night 2: Time for scavenging. Marko found homeless guy in garage. He was asking for some food, but Marko came without anything. Just with knife for protection. Left with plenty of wood and other stuff for building. Left that guy starving.Day 3:We were raided, but  we were lucky, robbers didn´t steal anything. We had medical stuff like bandages, food for everyone, we were happy. Survivors aren't always the strongest; sometimes they're the smartest, but more often simply the luckiestNight 6:Marko visited some small quiet house. There were 2 pensionist, man and woman, begging to not steal their supplies. But we were low on food and medicines, so Marko had to take it. To keep his friends alive, no matter the price is. But brave old man, protecting his wife, attacked Marko. Marko had to kill him. Stopped nearby woman who was crying over her dead  husband. Marko couldn´t leave her just like that alone in this world full of misery. Stabbed her from behind.Night 9: Marko visited apartment building.He brought a knife with him. There were two guys with assault rifle and one woman. He knew, he has to kill them, because he would left empty handed or wouldn´t left at all. Took one guy on the stairs. Woman went to bed. She was sleeping. Marko came inside a room, closed the door and stabbed her, while she was sleeping. At least, she didn´t even know. The best, she could get. Then Marko shot last guy with rifle of the guy, he killed on the stairs. Took their supplies.No one can tell what goes on in between the person you were and the person you become. No one can chart that blue and lonely section of hell. There are no maps of the change. You just come out the other side.Day 13:Katia couldn´t stand Markos killing spree, even that was best for her and bruno. She left during a night. Bruno is depressed and begging for cigarettes. Marko was sure, killing for supplies was right thing to keep them alive.Night 19:Marko decided to loot a church. Armed with assault rifle, powered by hunger, he went for food  through corpses. Shot 2 armored guys and a priest. While he was searching private cabinet, other guy with shotgun showed up. Marko was ready, confident to shot the guy. Pointed at him with rifle, puled the triger....... click. Marko was lying on the floor with holes in his body. Hunger made him blind. That mother ♥♥♥♥er forgot to check, if there are any bullets left in his rifle. Now you can rest in peace.Day 20:We have been raided. Bruno was lethaly wounded. They took our water, the last bandage we had, almost everything. Bruno was crying, Begging for help... he was bleeding to death. He was affraid to die alone.knock.. knock...""Someone´s knocking ?  Or were those just bullet shots ? Have to check it""""Hi, I´m Pavle.""Bruno saw a little bit of hope in pavle. Let him stay inside.They talked to each other, wanted to get them out of deppresion.Night 20:Pavle run to a hospital, to find some medical supplies, but he didn´t have anything to trade, so he had to steal. Saw a nurse. He was sure, he hear her talking about checking medical supplies. He followed her, into the room. She was there, checking some cabinet. He closed the door, pulled a knife out of his pocket and stabbed her from behind. Searched the cabinet and....... there were no ♥♥♥♥ing bandages... just some pills ! and herbs.... "" I had to kill a nurse for... some. .... ♥♥♥♥ing .... grass !!!! I killed someone who could save many lives ! "" Someone was coming, Pavle got out of the room, nobody noticed him. Left hospital.Day 21:Pavle came back with bad news. Bruno was depressed much more. Pavle was hungry and tired, so went to sleep. Meanwhile there was someone knocking on the door. It were 2 guys, one was armed with rifle. Bruno opened. They were asking for a guy that robbed the hospital and got info, that robber was from our neighbour. They wanted to give a reward for info about that robber: 3 cans of food, 10 cigarettes. Bruno was heavy smoker.. but he didn´t want to betray Pavle. He said know.""Are you sure ? "" armored guy asked.Bruno was thinking... no.. he wasn´t thinking. He was dying from bleeding. He wanted his last cigarette before dead."" Just give me a second... ""...Can they help me ? Will I die as a betrayer ?.. cigarettes.... I´m hungry...""No, I haven´t seen him.""Day 22:Bruno was sleeping and Pavle was guarding. He got depressed last night, Because he killed. He killed a young nurse. They said, they are like angels. He killed angel. Bruno woke up. They talked to each other.Got along. PAvle was sure, he has to find those bandages for bruno. They had almost nothing left after last night. Raided again. Only few herbs and picklock. We forgot. There is one cabinet locked in the basement. PAvle picked up the lock. There was a rifle... with ammo. He was thinking..... he has to help bruno.. he has to find bandages. It must .. must be somewhere in the hospital. He was ready to comeback to find it. He was ready to kill for it.Night 22:Pavle returned to hospital. They didn´t recognize him as robber, who stole their supplies night ago. So he was looking in the hospital. Found private cabinet. Is someone around ? No. he tried to search it, but he was caught. By another nurse. He was afraid to be revealed, so he quickly pulled out the gun and shot the nurse. ""What I´ve done ? I became a monster."" Bu it´s too late.. there´s a guard with shotgun running towards you. It´s your choice - kill or be killed. SHOT HIM ! There´s guard.. lying on the ground with bullet in his head. Afraid patients running around... Afraid Pavle ... Do they have gun ? Do they want to kill you ?... kill them ! kill them all !! Search the place  ! Quickly ! ... There it is. 3 Bandages in Pavles pocket. dead guard, 2 dead nurses, 4 dead patients. There´s no time for sorrow, the dawn comes. Pavle has tu run home.Day 23:Pavle returned. He was running towards Brunos bed. He found him.. found him dead in a puddle of blood. Pavle couldn´t stand his life anymore, couldn´t stand the misery of war. He hanged himself.-this game shows other face of war, There aren´t just soldiers fighting for their lives, there are ordinary people too, fighting for their own life, this game will show you your true inside, show you, that you are not as nice as you thought, This is not playing nice, this is ... Survival of the fittest			"

												I got mixed feelings about this game. First of all, this is no classic side-scroller as you might think at first, which was my reason for starting it much later.  The actual movement is side-scroller like, but nothing like a jump and run platformer. It performs more like a rouge like game, at least for me.So where is this mixed feeling coming from...This definitely is one of the best games I have played in years. The last game that had such a great atmosphere, graphics that worked so well with the soundtrack and had such an impact on me was back in 1997.  I do like fancy graphics, but this one proves again, it is not all about FPS, ultra settings or 4k. This War of Mine feels like a piece of living art, where you are in the middle of a living hell. Just played it for a few hours so far, but I definitely need breaks between the sessions. I can't really explain what it is, that makes this game so beautiful and terrifying at the same moment. The most significant part about this game is the mood it creates. There is no jump-scare, no pointless zombie-slaying or raiding some random areas to simply pimp up your base. What is so scary about this game is the psychological atmosphere it creates. It is dark, it seems hopeless all the time and what ever you do, in some way you may feel guilty for it. In terms of immersion and realism it is just an awesome game, maybe the best I ever played. Devs, thank you for this great game. I'd love to see this in schools, to experience history in a different way.Worth the price? Playing 1 hour, can't stop thinking about the situations the entire day, so yes it is totally worth it - maybe even more, since personal experiences are hard to value.WARNING:If there are veterans out there playing games, you might wanna skip this one. It is great, but you don't wanna live through your memories again.			"

												It's a devastating survival game. Sometimes when you're at the end of the road you're forced to make certain decisions to survive - and so do other people as well with you.The grim looks of the game, careful management, 'ethics' perhaps since when you make a choice to kill, it will impact all those around you... And may have longer term consequences as well of which you have not imagined. In my two playthroughs, the last one almost got me to apparent freedom - until the last man standing died.More about resource management: You start in a hideout with only a workshop, some barricaded doors, rubble, locked doors, locked closets and piles of materials. It's best if you clean it up as soon as possible so that you know with what kind of resources you start with.Generally, you have enough to create the basics of basics: A bed. A metal workshop. Perhaps depending on what you have and like, another bed, maybe some more items, a shovel to clear up rubble. Or perhaps a knife for self-defense at your home, or safety out scavenging? Typically the three 'main' resources are:Building materials.These can be components, lumber, parts, electric parts, everything to upgrade your benches, create more useful items such as weapons, single-use filters. I wonder why you can't create a re-usable filter. Because you REALLY need a LARGE amount of these for Luxery goods production, but also to filter out clean water for cooking use. Furthermore to board up your home. You'll really need a lot of these.Luxery goods. These are rather wanted and can be consumed by yourself as well.A few examples are cigarettes which has multiple 'tiers' or in easier terms, 'quality'. The better quality has better effects as well as more value for trade. Coffee beans and alcohol which also has different qualities. To consume either coffee or cigarettes you need to have an armchair (not sure if regular chairs have effect) and ofcourse a person who is either a coffee drinker or smoker. It will improve their morale drastically. Also jewelry. An important thing to notice is that you cannot eat jewelry (don't make that weird face at me please). Although you can trade it for a lot of goods early on if the trader appears it is perhaps wise to stock it up if you survive long enough to visit a marketplace perhaps or another trader in which you see something very useful - but don't have anything valuable or useful to the other person to trade with.Food for Hunger, Medicine/Bandages for the Sick, Alcohol (from Luxery Goods!)Food. It's rather important. You'll be always short on these - even moreso if your group grows beyond the starting three. You'll find some raw meat, vegetables, canned food. All of these can be eaten, however not cooking raw meat is unwise, the same goes for vegetables. However, you can eat the canned food! (Be blessed you do NOT need a can opener! Inbefore this featured item is added to the game.) The canned food stills hunger greatly, does not require time to cook, is an useful trading item as well!Now over to Medicines, there are two of them: Herbal meds and the real Medicine bottles. The first one may have half/half chance to cure slightly sick to sick people. However, the latter can really cure very sick people. Although prevention, or curing before they reach that status is highly advised as you need daily doses of the bottles to ensure survival of said sick person.Bandages are needed for wounds. You really don't want to fight too much with a wounded person as that'll affect your survival chances drastically. They're a valuable commodity as well for trading, however crafting these is rather hard and they are a rare find as well.Revisiting the alcohol part, if someone is depressed a chug of these can help as well. The better quality you have, the better it is. If you have two depressed people you can even chug down one bottle for both of them! Requires an action when you mouse over them if possible though, the one next to the speech bubble. *NOTICE: When they are Drunk they are highly slow during the Day, and may become totally useless during the Night! Has a high chance on curing 'poor morale' statusses! (Warning, there is a minor chance that it may not cure it fully)Now the few 'negative' parts of the game.Replayability value: After several times even when locations, people within, events and your starting party it may become dull. There is no speed up option during boring parts of the game, such as everyone working or when nothing special happens when you dig with your hands in rubble when you forgot your shovel. Or have no resources for a shovel.Items. There is this very annoying 'single use filter' in which I'd like to see a more permanent object, perhaps a 'Sink Filter' decoration for your home or a 'Multi-Use Filter' that requires an advanced workbench to create would be a nice thing to add. I must stress the point you need this filter to filter water, to create alcohol. They are both used heavily ingame. There's also a limited amount of items you can craft ingame - it is already hard enough as it is, but more diversity might be welcome. Also why can't I equip clothes for example, or a bigger bag, or maybe one use shopping bags or leather bags to get more loot back from scavenging places? (You can equip weapons though, or the rare body armour if you find/craft any during a scavenging trip...)Combat. Essentially I've tested out the melee portion and it does not have much logic into who hits who first exception that you may get stun-melee locked. The only way to nearly surefire kill someone who is not armored is to have a Knife or Hatchet and kill them from behind undetected (icon will become orange for this). Shooting is better. Also - the round circle may be either partially or fully white. This may indicate success chances into meleeing your opponent first before they do so to you. More testing is required, but above all a more detailed explanation may be required from the developers.RNG. But hey, if you're looking at this game you may like roguelike games right? Sometimes luck is in your favour, sometimes not, sometimes totally in your favour only to screw it up at the end =3There's probably tons of gameplay video's and streams out there including mines if you want to see more of it =P Guide here:

 Visually appealing, a fresh breathtaking experience will leave you frightened at the consequences of the war and its true horrid nature.   If you are craving for more survival type of games, but sick of washed out zombie themes, this game is for you! It offers quite unique experience vastly different from any kind of nowdays popular games of this genre.Postive sides: Gameplay - Although combat overall might seem fairly clunky while trying to pinpoint your mouse click on a little bubble above enemy's head, the amount of stuff you can craft, way you can survive, and assets you can use to improve your life in a little house you call shelter is astonishing. Not only that there's a way to craft all the essential stuff necessary for survival, but you can craft guns,traps,filters, make your own chair,bed,heater and many more. Scavenging was never more dangerous and fun at the same time. Your decisions WILL have an impact on the behaviour of an individual, leaving him either sad, depressed or completely broken. It really shows what kind of effect war leaves on man who's struggling to survive in this cold and long period where fighting is imminent. Trading is also part of the options you can do in order to maintain your resources balanced. You will often find yourself in a situation where all the materials you managed to collect won't be even close to the value of the bandage/food. Story -  Although lackluster and not really detailed since your main goal is to survive through a certain period of time, you will encounter all the different variety of quests where you have to decide whether you want to either help someone, or accept them into your group. Depending on your pick, ""story"" will unfold itself and you'll have different man source at your disposal. It's not the strongest attribute of this game, but definitely not the weakest link out there. Soundtrack - Apsolutely amazing soundtrack that follows you throughly whether you are in a tense situation where you are fighting for your life and trying to escape from bandits, or it's just a chilling atmosphere in your house, music will leave you impressed nonetheless. Negative sides: It's really hard for me to ""highlight"" the bad sides of this game, mostly because there aren't the bad sides if you overlook the clunky combat. Most of the people will draw special attention to replayability of the game itself, but considering the variety of places you can visit, and different people you can encounter and accept into your group, this game will give you a solid 15-20 hours of gameplay, which frankly, is a lot given that ""This War of Mine"" accomplishes something that many games nowdays are unable to.I would rate this game as a solid 9.5, definitely Game of The Year contender, and I'm happy that I played this gem and not overlooked it.

												If This War of Mine doesn't make your soul ache, you may not have one.What can I say? This isn't a game so much as an exploration into the very depths of your conscience, integrity, and pragmatism. It may be the only glimpse you will ever have of who you really are under the most desperate of circumstances.There are those of us who, during their first playthrough, will go to every possible length to maintain a pureness of intention and action and will suffer because of it. Case in point: One of my survivors was shot to death when trying to save a girl from being♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by a soldier. He died and she apparently still got♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. . . Was it worth it?I'm still trying to figure out what it says about me that after doing so and having been met with disaster I have started another session and am a colder, harder, less forgiving, less generous, and more callous person in my interactions. I have killed, stolen, and left others to die - but I have survived.I dread the choices I will be forced to make in the days to come, but I cannot stop playing. My survivors are somehow still warm, healthy, well fed, and - unbeliveably - in good spirits after 18 days. How many more days will pass before it all goes to♥♥♥♥♥♥and I'm left wondering whether or not having let the ends justify the means really made any difference at all.This War of Mine is the most evocative game I have ever played.

												我本来觉得那些在战争中杀害无辜的人太可恶，可没想到自己也成了那个可恶的人。看到老人瘫倒在儿子尸体前泣不成声，他哭喊着对着儿子说的那些话更是让人心碎。所以现在，我在努力通过完全不杀不偷来赢得游戏。I uesed to think those who killed innocent civilians are monsters, but how could I realize, that one day I became one of them.Watching the old father collapsed in front of his dead son, the words he was crying really made me regret deeply.So now, I am working on winning the game without any killing or stealing.

												This war of mine, (starvation simulator 2014) is a war game where you don't play as an elite soldier who can't sprint for more than 10 seconds, you play as a group of survivors trying to live in a war torn city. This war of mine is loosely based off ""The Siege of Sarajevo"" During the Bosnian war. The gameplay is a point and click, resource management, meaning you have to click your characters and get them to do tasks such as make tools, cook food, sleep, and bandage any injuries. The game is divided into day and night cycles, during the day you manage your characters, )feeding them and making them sleep) build necessities, and manage resources. Nighttime consists of scavenging for supplies, with a singular character in a variety of locations. These could be bombed out homes, abandoned schools, or other survivors shelters. Sometimes the player might come across other survivors, sometimes friendly, sometimes violent. During night time the player must collect as many resources as possible in order to maintain their shelter and their characters needs. Occasionally your shelter may be raided during the night. This can be prevented by patching holes in the walls, and having weapons accessible for whoever is still in your shelter. The shelter the player starts with is locked to that play-through. Although, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. There are only 2 home bases available (acquired randomly) both approximately the same size with the same starting materials. The player will start building things. This includes metalworking benches, herb/vegetable gardens, animal traps, and makeshifts stoves. These all make surviving significantly easier.Depending on the scenario you were playing, different locations available on the map (to loot and explore) unlock at different times, usually after a few days. Each location is different, with randomly generated supplies to be found. Sometimes location can have different scenarios, such as one play through the grocery store might have the military in it, and in another play through there might just be some scavengers. This adds immense replayability.The sound in the game is over all well done. It adds a feeling of stress or concern. The art direction in the game, although basic, is a perfect match for the 2D side Scroller. The charcoal effects ingame add a feeling of darkness and dread, with almost 0 colour to be seen. Overall the art direction and sound are extremely well done, and fifth the game well.Depending on the scenario you playing, you'll be given certain starting characters. Each with their own abilities, backpack size, and potentially addictions. These characters need to be fed, rested, and kept in a good mood. They also need to be in good health. Your characters may get injured from raiders or scavengers, or sick from lack of heat in the shelter. They can also fall into a depression if the player controls them and a negative fashion. An example of this would be having your character steal from other survivors, or kill other survivors. This can be counterbalanced by doing maintaining them/entertaining them  or helping other survivors. The counter side to this, is in the event that someone asks for your help, and you refuse, your characters feel sad, potentially falling into a deep depression, preventing them from doing basic tasks, like eating, or defending the shelter. The same can happen if you let your characters get to hurt, too sick, or not take care of them properly. This adds more difficult to the game, becoming less about keeping them healthy but also about keeping them happy. The ingame combat system is minimal. Most situations you will engage in melee combat with a melee weapon. Guns and ammunition are extremely hard to come by. In most situations, The player will save weapons for defending their shelter at night. The game overall doesn't want you to fight other survivors, it's not good for the characters sanity, or health. However if you decide to go down a path of stealing at The game overall doesn't want you to fight other survivors, it's not good for the characters sanity, or health. However if you decide to go down a path of stealing of and murdering,  be prepared to deal with depressed characters.This war of mine does many things right: The games graphic design and Soundesign are fantastic for the genre The game is challenging in a good wayIt tugs at the heart strings ImmersiveThe controls are goodSteam workshop compatibleExtremely satisfying when your characters survive the end of the warCan create your own scenariosOne of the deepest games in 2014Has DLC were you donate too children in real life affected by real warLots of replayabilityThis war of mine also does a few things wrongThey game can screw you over very easily, causing you to restartMay be extremely frustrating to some playersSome achievements are extremely hard to get, if you're into that kind of thingSometimes to randomly generated world is more harsh than you can handle (Like real life)Hits the feelsOverall this war of mine is a fantastic game. For the price of 21,99CAD, some people might not think it's worth it, but others would say it's a bargain. Overall I think a lot of people should try this game, if you have any interest in the genre. Pick it up on sale if you can.			"

 This game is amazing. 	Once you get in the story and characters, you'll start to get emotional. In a good way of course. You have tought decisions to make, you go through different locations, you meet different people and you get to know other people stories. With DLC The Little Ones, you have more options, but see for yourself. Also knowing this game donates to a charity that helps people to go through things like this is even more satisfying than the gameplay itself. This game is one of my favorite ones. I keep coming back to just sit and play the stories, because in that moment - nothing else matters.   Different locations  Different scenarios  Different stories  Street art  Amazing soundtrack  Heartbreaking  Deep story  Amazing atmosphere  Simple  DLC The Little Ones  Ability to make your own story This game is worth every cent. Just play it for yourself.	 "

												This game has my vote for Indie game of the year. The choices you make need to be thought out as some actions have either positive or negitive effects on your suriviors. You start with 2 ~ 4 random people in a shelled out home in the middle of what seems to be a civil war. The games art design is fitting to set the emotion & the somber music helps with this a lot. The game cycles between day ~ night. Day you fix your home ~ build items ~ get rest for the night. Night hits and the fun begins. Pick one of the 3 members to go looting, one to stand guard at home and best to have the 3rd rest for day time activities. Pick what tools you want to bring with you as you go out looting (saw blade~lock pick~crowbar~etc.)  You pick where you want to head off too, sometimes you don't see anyone and looting goes smooth, but what fun is that. Some of the survivors you come across are harmless and are just out looking for surplies like you, others maybe living where you go and you need to decided to loot them or leave and of course there is the chance they are bandits. We all know they just want to sell you the best long distance plan. There is plenty of random events and every time you start over your 3 survivors could all be different, the weather might of changed and I can promise you while the locations on the map might be the same going there will not be. Giving this game plenty of re-play ability.  Average game time is between 30 -50 days, thats right a survival game where there is a goal! Finally you have an objective, outlast the war & win, Don't be fooled this is not an easy game and has the ability to make you care about your survivors wanting to see them live to the end & sometimes having to choose who eats and who don't.  Final verdict 9  ~ 10 The only thing I wish and would make this game better is more of the same type of music, not the same thing on a loop.			"

												This is a hard-hitting game. It doesn't hold back and it covers very mature subjects. The developers have kept a lid on some of what is involved, but there is murder, violence, theft of the most vulnerable and sexual assault.It is an extremely dark tale, and your characters can do quite horrible acts to survive or protect others. This all meshes quite well with the mechanics, and everything has a cost, or a risk.Robbing the poorly defended hospital is a very good idea - medicines, actually functioning medicines (not the could-work herbal nonsense) can be traded for some of the most useful items around, or a lot of building items like wood and tools. However, the rest of your party will be disgusted with the thief for robbing those most in need, and the whole shelter will take a morale hit. You will take many of these, so get used to them.With many similarities to the sims, you have to keep your survivors fed, rested, treated (if injured or sick) and non-suicidal. Managing sleep is very important, and there are a variety of debilitating status effects that take your survivors down from 100%.I recommend this game, and it is better than it looks - although the artistic direction is quite gorgeous and perfectly tailored to the desired experience. While some say it is depressing, there are moment of humour and just surviving a day or escaping pursuers with a full backpack of loot is tremendously rewarding. The bigger the risk, the bigger the win!In closing I want to add one little extra fact. There are no saves per se. If you quit your game saves, but there are no saves to manipulate and no backsies. So if you lose someone, they are gone for good. This is an excellent design decision, and it will surprise pc players when they want to just reload a save, and find they can not do this. Pavle is gone, that is the end of his story. Now try to push on with the survivors you have, depressed by Pavle being shot like a dog.There isn't a game quite like it.			"

												This game.It will force you to make choices that show you the sort of person you are.The game lets you play with characters of your own creation. Excited by this, I made myself, my wife, and my friend.It started off well enough. But then winter came.  The cold made us sick.  And then my wife went on a mission one night because my friend and I were too tired to leave.  She was badly wounded.  She got horribly sick during the next couple of days.  But she had to keep limping to the hospital night after night because my friend and I were too sick.  Then my friend's character got better and my wife came close to death. I we needed more medicine. More than the hospital could trade to us.  And my wife was almost out of time.I knew, however, of a place that had lots of medicine.  Another band of survivors.  I had traded with them before.  But I was low on all my supplies now save for water and some firewood.  I took these to trade when I sent my friend on a  mission.  But I also had him take a shotgun and ammo.I went to trade. They wouldn't give me any medicine for the food and water.  And they only would give me one bottle of pill for the shotgun.  Not even close to enough. I knew my character would die. But worse, my wife would die.  I wouldn't let her die.  My friend's character took the gun and killed the survivors. All of them. He grabbed all the medicine and food he could and came back.  Because of the medicine, my wife recovered.  My character recovered.  But my friend's character...he never did.A week later, he just left. No words. Nothing.  He had been fighting depression ever since the killing.  We tried to reassure him. But it stayed with him.  And we never saw him again.Two days later the war ended.  My wife's character and mine escaped back to their lives.  And part of me likes to think my friend's character did too. None of this happened, truly. It was nothing but pixels on a screen in a video game.  But that play through hit me harder than any other game I have ever played.  Every choice you maker, from helping a sick mother down the street to killing for supplies stays with you. And part of the reason I haven’t played the game since is because I don't want to ride that emotional roller coaster again.So if you play, and I VERY much think you should play, do yourself a favor and don't put your loved ones or friends in  it. It's amazing how it becomes deeply personal when you do. "

												Day 1: During the wartime, I was forced to abandon my original home which was in the shelling zone, why? I don't knowDay 1.5: I stumbled across a war torn home, it looked okay to live in, but not in full conditionDay 2: I slept the night on the cold hard floor, hearing the gun shots,AA,mortars,etc, it was very hard for me to sleep last night, so I set up stuff in my home, set up a bed on a pallet, repaired my stove,  and stuffDay 3: I met this woman named Katia, she appeared on my door asking to get in, so I let her live in my newly found home, she said she was a reporter before, she traveled the globe, first to deliver the news. Sad news is, she couldn't find her family.Day 3.5: I heard knocking on the door, so I said to Katia to open it and ask what the person is doing while I was building a new bed and a crafting bench. So after I was working with my stuff, I went up to check, we met this person named ""Franko"" and said he was a trader. So we exchanged supplies and told stories together, but he knew he still had business to do, so we wished him to have a safe travel.Day 5: We saw a person running towards our safe house as we were blocking bandit entrances and other holes as they can get in. He came straightly knocking when he reached our door, so we let him in and let him stay there.He was relieved when we let him stay in, he was thanking us so much tho.Day 5.5: The guy we met earlier, his name is Pavle, he was a football player for the Pogoren football team.So we found our runner in the team. When he saw a guitar, he picked it up and started to play music in it. Turns out he was not only a football player but a good guitaristDay 6: Remember Franko?, he visited us again, oh how we cheered that he was still alive. Pavle didn't knew who he was so we introduced them together. again we just exchanged supplies and told more storiesDay 10: The home looks much more better now!, we even have our own moonshine maker to trade other refugee/survivors with.Day 25: Surprised that we are still alive from looting stuff outside and coming back here. I got us 2 Assault rifles and 1 pistol for protection or attacking. guess what, the abandoned building had so much supplies! I'm not sure why people haven't raided or ransacked the place yet.Day 30: We saw a shady looking person out in the rain dressed in a milita/rebel-ish clothes. We knew he was a soldier and thought we could use him to combat our unaware armed hostile civilians. Turns out he was actually finding a place to hide in! His name was Roman, he was a soldier for the other team.  He was drafted by the rebels, but he didn't want to kill his other brethren, so he deserted it and if ever he's found, he's gonna die.Day 35: I hope there's a ceasefire coming up soon, I heard from the radio that winter is going to come in 3 days.Day 38: Its getting cold in here, luckily we had enough wood to use on our furnace, good thing is, we already have enough supplies to survive 2 months. Day 41: I was getting a bit adventurous and explore a bit of the city in winter, not sure if its a good idea but hey!, I found a nearby city squad in which its a safe zone for people to trade,chat,gift,etc. Its a strictly no-fire zone but soldiers always come there to drag people out.Day 42: So I was...exploring a bit into a warehouse, where I saw a squad of soldiers whom I don't know what they were doing, but I knew that if ever I make noise, they will shoot at me. They looked foreign tho, speaking English and stuff, luckily I knew what they were saying but not about what they were talking about.Day 42.4.5: I waited an opportunity to knock them out individually, so I knocked 2 out, but when I tried knocking another 1 out, another soldier saw me and opened fire. so I tried to run as both soldiers were firing at me. I got shot at the leg twice.Day 42.4.10: I was limping to get back home, but I'm still far away, A sniper saw me and continued to fire as I limped from cover to cover, building to building. I was sure it wasn't just 1 sniper due to them covering all angles. As I limped away after they seemingly fired a shot and I thought they were reloading. One of them shot me near my shoulder while another at my lower chest.Day 45: I got back home due to some nice person at night, healed me good. So, I sat on a chair and turned on the radio while we were talking about what happened. I said to everyone to stop talking first because I heard an important broadcast. It was about the cease fire. it would take effect in 5 days. We cheered but it wasn't over yet.Day 47: A harsh blizzard took effect, I could still feel my wounds hurt, so we stayed near our furnace for warmth. We talked about each other's past. It was nice to learn about new people's stories of whom we just met nearly a month ago.Day 49: Things were setting side, soldiers not firing shots,shells,AA,etcDay 50: thank god a cease fire ended,(SPOILERS)(for other people) Katia met her family in a camp abroad and soon published her diary and it became a best seller after 40 days of the cease fire.Pavle found his wife and son in France when he made contact with them.He lived there with them and never came back to PogorenRoman found his buddies during the war but they surprised him that they weren't mad or anything but they admired his courage. Soon he became a leader of the local communityDay 51: Here I am writing my war survival story, and I am gonna press the ""Add to Cart"" button for a video game "

												When This War of Mine starts, the game delivers unto you three lost souls who've banded together to try and survive the Eastern European civil war that surrounds them. They're civilians—not survival-trained, battle-hardened soldiers—and ill-equipped to suddenly live without running water, heat or readily available food. During the daytime, you manage their actions inside a cracked, multilevel structure. It's barely livable at the onset, with holes in the walls and piles of rubble obstructing part of the building. Command them to dig through rubble and you'll open up more space and start finding organic and scrap materials that will help them scrape by day to day.Your initial trio of survivors start off hungry, tired or wounded and, no matter how much scavenging, bartering or crafting as you do, those states of being are never too far away. Just to make your shelter moderately livable, you'll have to have them patch walls, build beds, grow vegetables, filter rainwater, bait and catch small animals for food.The game is hard and sometimes disturbing because it makes you feel the grief of war. Make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival.Key Features:- Inspired by real-life events- Control your survivors and manage your shelter- Craft weapons, alcohol, beds or stoves – anything that helps you survive- Make decisions - an often unforgiving and emotionally difficult experience- Randomized world and characters every time you start a new game- Charcoal-stylized aesthetics to complement the game's themeTHE GOOD- Distinct, dismal pencil art style- Powerful examination of civilian life in wartime- Complicated & challenging moralityTHE BAD- Becomes monotonous after a time- Autosaves only- Some systems are a bit too easily exploitedDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE			"

												Two nights of scavenging. Nothing but planks, herbs and weapon parts. Three of my friends are hungry. I don't dare to enter an abandoned building again, I need to make sure I come home with food. The radio says these are violent times, so I grab my knife as I leave. My target tonight is just across the street. They say some people live there, but they aren't kind to strangers. I hope I can remain undetected.I sneak in. Patience. I hear footsteps. Doors opening. Someone enters the room I'm hiding in. Is he armed? I can't tell, but I can't risk it. I wrestle him down and I stab him. His friend sees his body and comes running. I panic and now they're both dead. I search the bodies. Neither were armed.I find alot of food and medicine. Exactly what I needed. My friends will eat well, though the taste will be bitter. I go collapse in my bed, sobbing.A couple of days later, someone knocks on my door. My neighbour greets me and hands me homegrown vegetables. She asks for nothing in return, says we need to look out for each other in times like there.10/10 would cry again			"

												I replayed this game recently with The Little Ones DLC. It's a tough game to play, especially with the addition of kids, but one I think is worthwhile. It's like the darkest possible version of The Sims; your characters huddle in a bombed out ruin in a war-torn city by day and go out scavenging for materials and food by night. As the shelter is upgraded, they can construct new utilities and items such as weapons for defence. Your survivors get hungry, sick, and depressed; your scavenging becomes sparser during periods of intense fighting and cold weather. Add to the mix some troubling moral quandaries and you're left with a compelling but potentially deeply troubling game. Just like the beautifully understated graphic palette, all This War Of Mine can offer is shades of grey.			"

												This game is an excellent blend of stealth, resource management, base building and decision making. You play as a group of civilians trapped in a city beseiged by an ongoing war. Scavenge, trade, craft and even lie and kill your way to survival. The question is, how far would you go to survive? This War of Mine asks this question constantly, and it means it.One highlight is how good the game is in connecting you with your survivors. I have felt despair, anguish, sadness and hope in my playthroughs. It's remarkable how the game accomplishes this although each playthough can be very differerent. The game sets you up with a different set of survivors each time you play, and many events and locations are randomly generated to a certain extent. You may see the same location in a subsequent playthrough but the events and circumstances might be different, prompting you to use a different strategy whist visiting. A market square bustled with survivors eagerly engaging in black market trade might become a dangerous, deserted spot preyed upon by hostile snipers in your next game.I thoroughly enjoyed my time with This War of Mine. Everything feels fresh and new, and I feel I'm a kid again eagerly discovering everything for the first time. This is the sleeper hit of the year.			"

												Wow, just wow. This is an absolutely beautiful game. No game has ever impacted me as much as this one has, despite how minimalistic it may seem at first. But it is this minimalism that makes it so much more powerful and therefore have a greater impact. Most war games nowadays just show the ""glory"" of war - whether it be shooters or strategy games where you must crush all opposition. The games in which the civilian toll of war is explored are few and far between. Even strategy games where you besiege a city or planet to force the population to surrender gloss over the civilian toll. Probably the most notable instance of civilians being involved in a conflict game would be *that* level in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. But even then, This War of Mine is completely unique in that you are controlling the civilians. While you may encounter combatants from either side, you don't participate in the conflict at all, you just try your best to survive on the peripheries of the unmentioned Civil War tearing the city and its population apart.This is a very meaningful game in ways unlike most others. War is Hell, and no game demonstrates this as well as this one does. There are many conflicts in the world right now, and civilian casualties are a very real, and very sad part of this reality. Having a keen interest in military history, and knowing just how destructive city sieges are/were, let alone the bombing raids on cities, this game really does strike home just how terrible war is. The hard choices that civilians must make in order to survive in such situations is a really important part of this game, and truly one of the standouts. Just like in the real world, there is no black and white, just a whole lot of greys. You are unlikely to make it out of this game feeling like a champion; there are terrible decisions to make one after the other. The decisions you must make, and the consequences of these decisions, are incredible, and I needed to take a break after some of these decisions. No spoilers here, but you may feel like a disgusting monster, or a hero, and well... will either decision even affect the survival of your own group?The playable characters, though with Eastern European names due to the geographical setting, all have excellent back stories and personalities which actually influence how they may react. Some characters may be more or less willing to do certain things, and certain actions will either positively or negatively your group's morale. Being caught on combatants aren't the only hazards, however, starvation, dehydration, and depression can be, and are real killers in This War of Mine. Depression is particularly well handled in this game, given the tough choices you must make, and the effect that these choices will have on your group. Special mention owing to the difficult nature of depression and other mental illnesses.The graphics and sound may not be complex, but they convey the themes of the game excellently. For the game's theme, the simple 2d side view of the game works better than something which would be provided by either a first-person or third-person perspective. The 2d nature of the game allows you to better encapsulate what it is all about, from building your shelter to scavenging for supplies. The audio is also brilliant, with a haunting soundtrack punctuated by the sounds of combat in the distance.Meaningful and excellent in a way that few games are, I cannot recommend this game enough.

												I try to put in enough game time before doing a review. Kind of like a relationship. You don't judge the person right away (even though first impressions leave a big impact!), so you stick around, treat them nice, hope they treat you well in return. Basically, this game has been a wonderful date. We even had discussions of marriage, briefly. The only problem is, she called me overly emotional and attached. Though I liked to work through all our problems together well, she has continuously made me cry and feel depressed. So we are on a break. In reality, this game is a slice of that. It hits home hard where the heart is. If you play this game without exhibiting any empathy/sympathy for these characters in the game you grow attached to, then you are either a sociopath or you have a painful past that requires therapy and not this game.You try so hard to be a hero, the leader. Making decisions. Who goes, who stays. Who can eat today. Who needs the medicine more. Do we need a bed or grow tobacco for trading goods? Every decision matters. Every death matters. Every consequence is dire and prolongs the torment of being dragged away from the light at the end of the tunnel--only to find out the light at the end of that tunnel is inevitably more pain and death. If this game was in 1st person (full immersion), I would probably kill myself from the pain. I love these developers, I love the animation, I love the gameplay and style and the somber music. I have trouble with the controls sometimes when ya want them to do an action or go somewhere especially in a moment of danger and necessity, but it is forgivable because you die anyway. Get now.			"

												This game is dramatic, emotional, and pleasingly artistic. I loved every minute of it and had a difficult time stopping. So I ddin't. I played the game through... over four hours. The first three died and then the final survivor gave up. Very sad ending.  The game launches straight in the action and story line, with zero splash screens or tutorials, etc. The positive of this is that there is no time wasted and you get a realistic feel for the lost and hopelessness of the situation for civilians in a homeland war. The only drawback is that I was uncertain on the first night what I was packing. After fumbling with the controls that first night, and getting it wrong, you probably have a great idea of what you should have done. Sadly, experience is not the best teacher for survivors. I was hooked instantly, however, so I will be going back for a second try tomorrow, and hopefully this time I will make better choices. I also want to dig nto some of the info about the artists, because this is one game you will remember primarily for the art work, as much as for the storyline and drama. Disclamer: This is my first game review on Steam, and I welcome friends, since I am new here. So add me.			"

												I've experienced a game-breaking bug, where I got stuck on Day 42 on my very first playthrough. No matter what i did (uninstall, re-install, turned off cloud-syncing etc), I cannot progress past Day42. I've asked the developers for help, but all they said is that it will be fixed in an upcoming patch. However, I've since discovered that this is a bug that the Steam version of the game suffered from since 2014, and the developers have obviously not found a solution yet. I'm sorry but the game is just too tedious and repetitive to plod through another partial playthrough. I therefore cannot recommend it until they fixed this bug.			"

												I made a few choices that caused my people to start to lose faith.  They were depressed and sadly things got even worse for me within days.  My people were sick, they were wounded and they were hungry.  I had to do something drastic so I sent my healthiest person to sniper junction.  Things were going well for me as I was able to make it from cover to cover and even looted a few items i desperately needed.  I was heading back to my shelter when one little misstep cost me everything.  The sniper fired and Pavle went down. The effect it had on my last two party members almost shut me down.  They didn’t want to do anything but I was at least able to rest them and they ate what canned food I had left.  That night Bruno went out to try and find anything I could get my hands on.  All that was to be had were some parts and some smokes.Back at the house I see that the game is over, there is no way to go on.  Bruno won't get off the floor.  He won't move at all.  He has lost all hope and given up because he is found Katia has commit suicide.  He is alone in the world in the middle of a dying city in the middle of a warzone.All was lost.			"

			War doesn't end when the last shot has been fired. It stays in people's minds long after that. Some wounds don't heal. Pre-order This War of Mine http://bit.ly/1obz0aN (Steam key included on release...		

This war of mine has a very unique way of capturing you and this game really pull's you in and makes you want to fight to help the people survive the war, sometimes it gets tough out there amongst the gun fire and hostility of locals and to survive you are forced into decisions sometimes a decision that you wouldn't normally make and this could ruin the path you travel down and affect the entire group.Sometimes it is emotionally frustrating watching your characters struggle after fighting so hard to survive, such as watching one character slowly die from terminal illness and your survives rally to try and find supplies to help keep him alive in the hope the war will end, or the server depression that washes through the group leading to heart-felt suicides leaving you stunned and confused saying could I have done something different.But sometimes there are happy moments meeting new people ,helping a woman protect her daughter from the pigs of war, to sharing your medication with strangers to taking in people off the street and giving them some rest from the war-torn surroundings, sitting there listening to peaceful guitar play which helps drown out the horrors your survivors face outside to sharing a drink and stumbling around drunk.With this game you experience heart pounding moments to hot and cold flushes this game makes you feel like your part of the group you try so hard but sometimes all is lost war is not a happy place to be and this certainly makes you feel that.Anyone who is thinking about purchasing of this game go ahead and buy it I come from long line of racing games and I love this game This war of mine is great game.

Product received for free
												Note: A friend purchased TWOM for me.This War of Mine (TWOM) is a survival platformer game developed and published by 11 Bit Studios. It was released in November 2014. TWOM is based on the city of Pogoren, inspired by various civil wars in Eastern Europe. You play as a group of civilians from various backgrounds that need to survive until the end of the war. This review will cover the campaign, the gameplay, the soundtrack, and the negatives.  Campaign, Gameplay  TWOM features one mode, the campaign. It is incredibly dark and gloomy. It is harsh, emotional, and unforgiving. All of your characters actions have consequences, whether it may be good or bad, the bad mostly outweighs the good throughout the campaign. The primary aim is to reach the ceasefire point, which is around 45 days. TWOM is a very well-structured game because consequences vary. For instance, one character may be more susceptible to innocent killings whereas one may not be, and this affects their mental health. The game's structure revolves around day and night counterparts and survival and crafting are main features of TWOM. Day time allows your characters to craft things, interact with others, cook, and so forth. Night time allows one of your characters to scavenge different places in Pugoren, while the rest either sleep or guard the base. Day and night are solid contrasts because one focuses on survival through defending and the other focuses on survival through attacking.The other main features are scavenging and crafting. At night time, you can choose one character to scavenge. This character will have between 10-17 inventory slots depending on their background, which is how much they can scavenge. Characters can take any item from their base, so weapons, goods for trade, and so forth, which is beneficial because most places you will encounter enemies and some places you can trade your items for others. During day time, crafting is a core component of surviving. The resources you scavenge or trade allow you to build various equipment, weapons, and structures to help improve your home capabilities. For instance, you can build an animal trap and to operate the trap you will need bait through either 1 canned food, which is rare and not encouraged, 1 fertiliser, or 1 chicken. You can then gain two chicken when you catch a rat in which you can cook with a constructed stove. For note, TWOM does not have varying difficulties so in general the game is difficult. I played three walk throughs and on the third attempt I managed to create a sustainable home food economy, but at the trade-off of a lack of weapons, meaning I could not scavenge because I had a knife compared to others guns. Therefore, these mechanics create interesting situations in which you have to deal with scarce resources and adapt to the changing needs of the environment.I will provide a quick snapshot of certain events in my game that capture the emotional intensity of TWOM. On one occasion, I travelled to the church and sneaked into the house behind. A guard attacked me and I killed him. I return to the church the following day and the priest attacks me, I had to unfortunately do the same. I did the same to the last guard down in the basement and before I finish him, he says ''don't do this man'', but I seal his fate. I do this in front of three children of theirs who are crying and loudly yelling ''Patrik, please wake up'' and ''Why did you have to do this''. I want to share this with because this captures the entire experience of This War of Mine. You are civilians trying to survive and not harm one another, rather help each other, but over the duration of the game you become desperate to survive and turn into someone you don't want to be, a thug or a bandit. Your characters experience the emotional trauma of wanting to end the war, but you need to survive and make these uneasy decisions. Later in the game, I experienced another haunting event - raiding an elderly house and attacking them both because I needed resources or my characters would not survive another week. The grandma begs me ''Please don't hurt me, please take whatever you need'', which haunted my characters for the next week. But the question raises of ''was it worth it?'', but you will confront these situations in the game, which is why I describe it as a dark and gloomy game because it really captures the anguish of someone in that type of situation and the consequences of actions.  Soundtrack  TWOM features a great soundtrack that complements the atmosphere and setting. It features beautiful instrumentals that fit each situation. For instance, a darker song when you are scavenging or a lighter guitar song when your day begins.  Negatives  I will list my negatives here because I emphasis certain points in my other paragraphs. First, there was no tutorial. I didn't like this because it is a tough game and there are a variety of components to understand so I would have liked even a simple tutorial. Second, I did not like the combat system. It felt unbalanced, particularly the enemy mostly outmatching your abilities, resulting in you mostly losing close-combat fights. Lastly, the game crashed on me twice when minimising, but this did not hurt my experience of TWOM.  Conclusion  TWOM is an intense and brutal game. It features an excellent atmosphere that complements the war-torn city of Pugoren. It incorporates a crafting system that allows you to build equipment, weapons, and structures for your base. It's primary selling point is the relationship between characters and their decisions and their overall wellbeing through these decisions and their consequences. TWOM creates situations that showcase the need to survive and the need for your characters to make uneasy decisions for the best of your group. Note, I did not try the DLC yet. At USD$19.99, I highly recommend this game.   Rating  9/10  Pros  	- Characters decisions and their consequences and how it affected the game.	- Environment.	- Crafting and scavenging system.	- Day and night system.  Cons  	- Combat system.	- Lack of tutorials.If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up. If you would also like to follow my reviews more easily, be sure to join my group Antwog's Analysis (Reviews).EDIT 1: I wanted to clarify combat. I understand a military soldier or armed thug could beat me in a close-quarters fight due to experience and likely strength, but I didn't like how the majority of normal citizens could beat me in close-quarters combat, particularly if my character was strong (ie. Boris) or experienced in combat (Roman).			"

												Depressing. Fascinating. Sad. This War of Mine is something special in survival games. The horror of the war displayed not through weapon sights, but through a party of ordinary civilians looking for safety and willing to survive. This game definitely is worth the money. One of my candidates for game of the year. A must buy.			"

												I'm a bit torn on this game. While I don't really enjoy playing it, I am in awe of its power. I have played a lot of games in my 30+ years of life. I've played fun, casual, silly games that make me laugh, I've played highly technical games requiring skill and accuracy that make me rage, I've played puzzle games that really make you think and slap your forehead once you figure something out that's taking you too long, I've even played horror games meant to scare me, and I some have really made me scream. The point is that all games touch some emotional side of us, some hit their intended nerves deeper than others, but regardless of how much a game has affected me in this past, I've been able to get past my emotions and continue playing.This War Of Mine is the exception. After I killed an elderly couple to survive, I had to stop playing. I can't even pinpoint what certain mechanic in the game managed to ring this bell in me, but I have never had such a deep emotional reaction to a game. I felt digusted with myself, completely lost and buried under a mountain of despair. As I clicked the buttons to bash their heads in with a shovel, I felt my soul turning black. I try to think of all those koopas I used to eject from their shell as Mario and wonder why I didn't empathize on the same level because, at the root, the two actions are the same: preying on the weak to succeed. So, why does it feel so much worse when I do it in This War Of Mine?For this reason alone I am recommending the game, because no other game has ever been able to strike this sort of reaction in me, but I will never play it again.

												This War of Mine is a survival game made by 11 bit studios, who used to be known mainly thanks to the Anomaly series (""tower offence"" games). This time they went with something completely different, as you'll have to get into lives of people who try to survive in partially destroyed house, in the middle of a war zone.To survive all the terror outside your house, you have to keep people in healthy state (to the extent possible) - you have to fight their hunger, thirst and depressions, but also keep them prepared for raids - being armed is helpful. From morning to evening, you'll be taking care of all basic needs of your characters by reasonable use of your collected resources like herbs, meat, wood and metal. It may seem complex but the whole crafting system is pretty simple and there isn't a huge amount of items you can have; you'll get known of most items in first hours. But where you'll get all those important resources? At the beginning, you'll find them in the ruined house you try to live in, but sooner or later you have to send out your characters to scavenge the other houses during the night. That's the phase where the game swaps from resource management to 2D stealth game, where the whole outcome is only up to you. You can try to rob army deserters, or you can be afraid of them and rather pick the house where ill and old people live. But what will you do if somebody finds you and protects their property? There comes the important part of This War of Mine - all your scavenging brings even more depression to all characters that you control. Even though they have pretty limited amount of dialogues among themselves, you'll still feel the emotional press coming from your actions. Let's say that you won't mind killing other people for food - congratulations, character who kills will get truly depressed and other will be disgusted of him. And what if you don't kill? Congratulations, character will feel depressed because of stealing other people's things, and other will also get disgusted. Or you can just let them die, if you feel that's the better option.Graphic style of the game is a great one, it doesn't require a strong hardware to play it since it's a combination of 3D models and drawn textures and effects with a really specific style (you can see it in screenshots). Low HW requirement is also the positive fact for players not just on Steam, as This War of Mine is also ported for mobile platforms (Android, iOS) - that seems obvious from the controls, as they are really touch-friendly, maybe too much for PC standards. All movement is done just by clicking to a specific place, and all actions are done by clicking on small icons over every object that you can interact with.Conclusion:This War of Mine isn't overall much complex and isn't even long (few hours for a single scenario is enough), but the game's quality tops at the atmosphere and story based on despair. You may think that you can survive without hurting others (somehow) but you'll be forced to compromise pretty soon. There's no good way, there's only ""wrong"" and ""somehow lesser wrong"" way, but at least you can manage to survive the war.			"

												A war game where players take control of a group of people surviving the war. The situation and story is grim and just making it past the next days requires the player to search, scrounge, and even steal for food and supplies just so that the group can make it past  the next day from creating homemade cigerattes and moonshine to crafting guns and bullets to kill others that will try to raid them,  or being the raider yourself. This game is an absolute piece of art and for survival fans a great game to own. Pros  + Growing attached to certain characters after using them for hours ( Pavle is a bro)+ Positive and negative choices during gameplay to steal or not steal that will question your entire conscience.+ Fantastic sketchy themed art and music that fits the game perfectly.+ Survival game randomizes your base and situations during the war. Use radio for news.+ Game uses Rng (random number generator) that will push you into good or bad luck. Making the smallest positive situations rewarding.+ Mostly point and click game easy to play without the use of a keyboard if you didn't want to+ Grim dark story telling and immersive+ Addictive style gameplay with stealth, guns, and picking up items to survive. Kill who you want or trade with them.+ A single playthrough will last up to 8 hours per.+ Replay value of different survivors and randomization+ Grow rolling tobacco, Catch and eat rats, and Make moonshine Hell yes Cons (Not really)  - You can easily survive anything once you raid a major outpost.- I've figured out ways to break the game into easy mode no matter the situation- Not much content besides just trying to survive no other gameplay modes.REPLY TO CHALLENGE BOTTOM

												Nominated for The “I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye” Award straight away.Survive. Survive at all costs I thought choosing a place to scavenge.I need food and some meds for my group.Entered a house. Looks quite. Despite danger in location info.Searched first floor. Materials and some food. Good. Someone on the second floor. Two of them.Got to the basement. Locked door. Nobody is around. Picked the lock and loot all the stuff. Very good day for my group I thought.Suddenly, I heard steps nearby. I prepared my knife and rushed to a cover. Just one more second..A guy opened the door moments later. Aiming his gun somewhere near me. This is it I thought. He walked past me. I rushed out of the cover and instantly stabbed him. Twice. He was trying to aim a gun and... Slash. He is dead.I picked up his gun. Rushed to the second floor and crashed all the firepower I've got onto these nasty mercs. Some more loot. Nobody will be robbed by you anymore I thought.Rushed through the house. Running around I realized that they were not mercs - they were survivors like me. Suddenly, I am the bandit. Survive. Survive at all costs...I thought....We have made it through...not without losses and tough choices though...As many have asked, I will add short review as well.In this game your target is to survive throughtout the war. With stylish graphics and soundtrack combination you will actually feel yourself in the war times. A lot of choices you will have to make during a single run will add up the atmosphere just as much as other things do. You will hate yourself for the choices you have made. You will search for an explanation for your violent crimes trying not to associate yourself with bandits. You will see how moral can be twisted and how people can change while fighting for survival. Game is extremely punishing for wrong choices. You can loose everything in just couple of days. Even if you have food, goods for trade, weapons, workshops etc. With several sets of starting characters, decent-sized world and several random events the game has a certain replayability. With all the drawbacks and flaws the game has it is still a truly unique experience in the Steam store and it is far deeper than many zombie/post-apocalypse or whatever survival games currently on the market. The overall great and deep atmosphere covers up all the flaws so you can easily name it an outstanding game. I do.Outstanding game.8,7/10. There are still some things that can be improved.			"

												On the surface, This War of Mine is a survival strategy/simulation game. You rebuild and improve an abandoned house in the daytime, and at night you scavenge for supplies. The mechanics are simple – certain supplies are required for certain improvements. You need wood to build a bed, weapon parts to build a saw, water and meat to cook, and bait to set traps. At night, you sneak around different areas in varying states of destruction – a field hospital set up in the ruins of an old one, a flophouse for the lowest vagrants, the home of an old husband and wife just trying to hold on – sneaking around, avoiding conflict, and grabbing as many supplies as you can carry. The controls are simple. It’s quite literally point and click.The gameplay, however, is almost unimportant, except that it forces you to make choices, hard, brutal choices. Food is always scarce, and when I played through the game, my characters were always starving. I saw them complaining every day about their empty stomachs. I could either let my characters starve, or rob an old couple blind. I took everything from them as they watched, helpless, begging for me to leave them something. It put a knot in the pit of my stomach. When I picked the game up again, my characters were horrified at what they had done.The most chilling moment was when I had a character kill a man. It was the first time I encountered another person, and I didn’t know how they would react. I didn’t want to lose, didn’t want my character to die. So before the vagrant I ran into could do anything, I beat him to death with a shovel. In the next room, there were even more vagrants who all simply ignored me. When I returned home, the character who killed the vagrant was depressed. She was wracked with guilt.This is the success of This War of Mine. It puts you into the mind of the starving, the dispossessed and the desperate. It shows you that survival is not easy, that the truest victims of war are not fallen soldiers but the innocents left behind. This War of Mine isn’t just a reaction to the endless stream of war-glorifying shooters, it is a response to all war and anti-war art that focuses on combatants as the sole recipients of horror. Wilfred Owen, Kurt Vonnegut, Tim O’Brien, all hallowed names in the annals of war literature and criticism. Yet they all focused on the burdens borne by the soldiers and overlooked, as many do, the civilians stuck in the boot-churned mud. This War of Mine challenges literature’s view on war and in doing so become literature itself. It is so rare that games become art, but the sickening feeling in my stomach every time I see one virtual character mourn another tells me that this one is, in fact, a work of art.			"

												With the proliferation of technologies such as computers, smartphones and the internet, it is easier to see and more apparent than ever that the world around us is constantly changing. And not always for the better. With militants ravaging the Middle East, rebels vying for control of Eastern Ukraine, and the conflict between Israel and Palestine still raging on, its difficult not to feel like things are sliding towards a tipping point, a new global conflict even. Games depict wars, real and fantasy, all the time, and, if the likes of Call of Duty and Battlefield are anything to go by, those kinds of experiences are very popular. But we don’t often find ourselves connecting or giving a second thought for the civilians caught in the crossfire, trying desperately to survive. This War of Mine turns things on its head, you aren’t a soldier, kitted out in the latest combat gear, you are average citizens trapped amongst the fighting, doing whatever is necessary to survive. It’s brutal, thought-provoking, and yet another sign that games have matured as an art medium.This War of Mine doesn’t simply tell the tale of a lone survivor, caught in a war zone, instead you’ll have dominion over three randomly selected characters (initially) and guide them through each day, trying your best to keep them fed, healthy and as happy as they possibly can be. Luckily, they’ll have the relative safety of a small dilapidated house to take shelter in.  It’s not much but it’s a good starting point. By scavenging inside, or at other locations, you can collect materials to fix up the house to make life more comfortable for the inhabitants, and you can build beds, stoves, radios and workshops. These little extras help to keep morale up and depression at bay. Materials don’t come cheap in the middle of a war zone, though, and somebody is going to have to pay a price for them – be it in coin, or in blood.Running low on food and medicine is not an option if everyone is going to make it to the other side of the war intact. The brutal lengths that you may have to go to are uncensored and unglorified, and while murdering an elderly couple for their food and jewellery may initially shock, it becomes second nature after a while. And that’s the grizzly reality of war: sometimes, you must be absolutely ruthless to survive.These realisations can deeply affect your survivors, and they may become deeply troubled by the events going on around them. Each has their own mood indicators highlighting whether they are hungry, tired or depressed, and their effects are almost immediately apparent. Characters who have fallen into depression will drag their almost lifeless bodies around the squat ruminating over the events that have happened, asking themselves ‘why?’. Other characters may take note of this and try to help by talking with them. Each character also keeps a diary with details of the events from days gone by; depending on the situation you may see your characters attitudes change before your eyes. Characters whom have murdered others may initially regret their decision, only to accept it later as an inevitability, required in order to stay alive. This War of Mine may sound emotionally draining to play, and it is; 11 Bit Studios have struck a delicate balance and created a title that is as entertaining to play as it is emotionally compellingEach day is split into two sections which see your survivors fixing up the house to make it more comfortable during the day, and going out scavenging at night. Some aspects of the game have a “The Sims” feel to them, with you having to tend to everyone’s needs such as feeding them, keeping them comfortable and dispensing medication if they are sick. Scavenging at night can be very dangerous, especially if you intend to come home with anything useful, so it is wise to stay armed. A nifty crafting interface allows you to create all manner of different items such as lockpicks, axes, shovels and hack saws, which can be used to reach particularly valuable loot. Each scavenging location requires careful consideration before you set off though, and you’ll pay the price if you go out without the proper equipment. It is very easy to lose characters to militants or, other, better-armed survivors.Sometimes, while out scavenging, you’ll encounter other violent and non-violent NPCs, and whether you engage them or no is up to you. Combat isn’t particularly in-depth but it doesn’t need to be. You can switch from scavenging mode to armed at the click of the mouse, but your adversary may become aware and attack you. Simply clicking on an enemy is enough to send you stabbing/punching/shooting in their direction. The impact doesn’t come from the combat itself, rather the effect it can have on your character – and you. As aforementioned, whilst out scavenging at an old cottage we found a friendly old couple, relaxing in their armchairs. Sadly, their number was up before we even caught sight of them; our fridge was empty, we had no valuables or medicine. Luring the old man down to the basement, we began beating him mercilessly with a shovel. “Don’t leave me!” cried his wife, as we set about her. We couldn’t help but pause for thought – would we do the same in a similar situation?This War of Mine isn’t a delight to look at, but its aesthetic is expertly crafted. The city is awash in dark blacks and greys which inspire a feeling of desolation and despair. unfortunately we were subject to a number of graphical glitches and stuttering issues, which should be patched out post-launch.As a game, This War of Mine is sensational, as a story it is gripping, but it is as a statement that it makes its biggest impact. Whilst most of us (hopefully) will never know what it is like to live in a war zone, it’s important to know that there are people, like us, out there surviving in horrific situations. It is an unforgettable survival horror game, but not as you know it. 11 Bit’s presentation of war is candid, undiluted and bound to leave a lasting impression.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Received a review copy from the developers for review purposes.

												What a change from regular ""war"" games.Famine, depression and helplessness. The idea is to get your survivors to live until the end of the war (a randomly generated number of days) in a random environment.(The Sims + stealth + crafting) x The RoadIt's bleak and depressing... and relentlessly engaging. A masterpiece of the point and click.8/10			"

												Absolutely amazing game.I purchased this game on a whim, and I don't regret it at all. Very fair price for a game which is very unique. If you are a fan of post apocalypse games then this is one for you. It will take a few play fews to get the hang of it as you are thrown in the deep end with no guide on how to play the game though.This game brings you into a city caught in the middle of civil war, you get to witness events from the soldiers and rebels - some bad, some good and some you have to watch and can't do anything about. Every time you send one of your characters out to savange you are constantly worrying about what to pick up and what you need the most, every scavange matters! I normally don't enjoy games which tend to avoid combat, however ""This War of Mine"" has pulled it off in such an amazing way. The world really does pull you in, I love the encounters with the rebels or soldiers.Some key points:- Each play through is different, maps do change!- A decent amount of events.- Real sense of a post-apoc world.- Loads of crafting! (Weapons, ammo, armour, household objects, medical supplies, food)- Can't let your people die via starvation, health... they can even commit suicide if they become depressed (gain by killing innocent people, your people have decent morals).Real fun game, still playing it now. Thought id take the time to write a decent review for it as I haven't been pulled into a game this much for a long time. "

												Day 10: My group was hungry.  We were out of food and desperate.  We put our hopes in that there would be food in the apartment complex that was basically blown in half during the shelling.  One half was empty but we knew the other half had a group in it.  We often heard gunfire coming from the building meaning they might be hostile.  It was risky but we were desperate.  It was simple.  We would take from the empty half of the building and let the other half keep their stuff.  Marko went that night.  The only way he could approach was from the inhabited side.  I climbed the ruble to the second story and used a crowbar to break in.  I then headed to the next door inside and peaked through.  There were two women on the other side.  One told of a scavenger on the other half searching for items.  The other responded by saying that, ""John"" would kill them.  Kill them.  But it's just a scavenger.  He wasn't a bandit breaking into this side. One of the women went upstairs and the other started walking towards my door.  I quickly got up and hid in the closet.  The women entered the room and checked her items, then left from the same door she came in.  I could hear her go upstairs.  Now was my chance.  I left the closet and opened the door.  Only stairs upwards and another door.  I went through the next door.  I opened it to see a man with a sniper rifle aimed at the next building.  This was John.  standing at the end of the building.  He screamed for the other scavenger to show themselves.  I considered going around but John would see me crossing to the other side.  And he would most likely kill me.  Was this what the gunshots were?  Not self defense but killing scavengers on the other half?I pulled out the crowbar.  If I don't get these supplies, we'll die.  If I cross to get them, John will kill me.  And he is already threatening to kill another.  This is justified right? I slowly approached him from behind, and swung.  I wounded him but didn't kill him.  He then yelled at me saying, ""it would be the last thing I ever did"" and brought his powerful rifle around to aim at me.  No.  I can't get shot.  We don't have any food let alone medical supplies.  With new found fear I swung again.  And again.  I saw that one last hit could do it.  And begun to swing.  He then yelled, ""please don't kill me!"" and began to let go of the rifle.  But it was too late.  I was already swinging at his head.  I hit him and he fell off the second story of the building and down to the ground. Dead.He was giving up.  I could have taken the weapon and let him live.  If only I hadn't attacked to kill.  I might not have swung so eagerly.  But I was scared.  It was his fault.  He was going to shoot me.I then heard the women coming from downstairs.  I got ready for another fight.  But they ran right by me.  One got on her knees at the edge of the building and began crying.  The other stood between us.  Fear in her eyes with no weapon.  I paniced.  I did this.  He's dead because of me.  I ran.  Without any of the stuff I needed.  I headed back.  Marko entered the safehouse and the following message appeared.The night was calm.			"

 LONG REVIEW AHEAD For TL;DR, check the  BOLD  or  UNDERLINED stuff!I'd like to make clear that this is a good game.  It is a unique idea  for survival which is far away from Zombies and bravely detaches itself from the rest of the swarm - that is all the recent survival video games based on a Zombie apocalypse... However,  I can't recommend the game;  read on and you will realize why, and also  see at the end  the section called:  - IMPORTANT EDIT In  'This War of Mine'  you take on the role of three survivors. Although I haven't played alot(~7hrs), I understand that they are 9 overall characters and each time you play, you get to control three different ones, each with his own, unique abilities, such as ""Good Cook,"" ""Good Scavenger,"" and so on, which give minor advantages to certain skills (The Good Scavenger has 5 more backpack slots, for example).All this happens in the same building (same in every run) which serves as your outpost. During the day, you supposingly add/create stuff for your 2D outpost such as beds and chairs. During the night, you are supposed to go outside and scavenge from other 2D buildings that usually are occupied by other, friendly-or-not survivors IN ORDER TO BUILD during the day. However, your backpack space is so limited that there is no way you can scavenge the whole place in one run, you will have to wait another full day to get back to it, even if you scavenged for 1 hour and there are 6 more hours remaining until daylight (enough to return the supplies and go back for more).  SO, YOU BUILD STUFF  (there are not that many options to build)  DURING THE DAY (or you simply do nothing cause you have no supplies 90% of the time) AND YOU SCAVENGE DURING THE NIGHT IN ORDER TO BUILD THE NEXT DAY (and eat).  And repeat. And, this is pretty much it.   It is fun for the first 4-5 in-game days but then it gets  pretty repetitive;  if you add on that  the game's extremely slow-pace  then there you have it.  You will find yourself almost MOST of the day doing nothing but watching your survivors sit idly around, tapping your foot on the floor while begging for a ""Speed-up Time"" button since materials to build stuff in your outpost and therefore DO SOMETHING (pass the time) are scarce, or you simply CAN'T take enough during the night because of the greatly limited inventory you have. So,  you will either  have to click ""SKIP DAY"" and miss the WHOLE day in order to go straight to night  (which you can go out and scavenge),  but at the same time, by skipping the day you are missing opportunities such as other survivors coming at your home to Trade, or seek help, etc.  OR  you will have to sit idly and watch the screen, waiting for the time to pass.In addition, in all my attempted playthroughs, it is as if your outpost is cursed. Your survivors, 99% of the time will be both sick and wounded, always limbing and unable to do pretty much anything. I understand that it is a time of war, but lets be realistic, they are not soldiers to be hurt (you spend 90% of the time inside your outpost, like you would in your own home in your everyday life) AND there is  NOT  a plague to have you be sick all the freakin' time.  In order to test it, I had 1 out of the 3 survivors rest for days while a message said: 'recovering,' to find out that he never became well - as if bugged, so I am going to edit this part of my review if it turns out to be a bug, and not the actual gameplay. Moreover, another annoying element is that other survivors will raid your place while you are outside at night, stealing your stuff and 'wounding' your survivors. Even if you can't control it, can't you at least command your survivors not to fight back, so that they won't end-up hurt or miraculously sick after the raid all the time?On that, the raids are  awkward.  You may have 5 items of food in your fridge (food is very rare and you will always be hungry - which is ok since there is a war going on) and instead of raiding your stuff and taking everything, as they would IRL, they grab x1 Chicken Breast and then leave... which is weird... so you call that a 'raid'?! ------>  Finally,  for replayability reasons  (as most people state) the war may randomly end at any time.  However, I don't see how that adds to replayability. You will do the SAME stuff for either 15 in-game days, or you will do the same stuff for 30 in-game days. It's the same thing.  EVERYTHING else remains the same. Buildings, locations, people -  everything.  With this amount of content then, and its lack of replayability, the game does not, by any chance, excuse the 20 euro it costs. So, if I had to recommend it for a certain price, that would be 7 to 8 euros maximum! I am not gonna give a score to the game and I will restate that I believe it is a good one. However, to me, I simply can't find enjoyment by doing the same things over and over again, in  such a slow-paced  game while 40% of the time just watching the screen for the day to pass.  IMPORTANT EDIT: As is the case with most  Overwhelmingly Positive  titles, feel free to start spamming the Down-Vote button as if you own the game and I suddenly 'hurt it' or 'insulted it' - I don't mind at all. One of my characteristics (or perhaps weaknesses) is my  honesty,  and I am not going to praise a title that I did not - myself - enjoy, just because they donated a small amount to charity  (DO NOT HATE, READ ON!)  I heard from people that, the money of their latest DLC (0.99) goes to charity,  and to me this TRULLY is awesome,  but this is not reason enough to give it a false and unrealistic review.   So, please, hear me out on this! It is indeed an awesome move what they did , but here, I am reviewing the  GAME.  Even if the 20 euro for it all went to charity, I'd still down-vote it, because I am reviewing  the GAME itself,  and not the action behind it. If I wanted to spend money on charity (which I do once a year) I would do so immediately and not through a game.The above is what I found in-game and represents my own and only opinion on the game:  I do NOT recommend it. I hope I've been helpful to you.			"

												As usual, a tl;dr for the lazy:+ Emotionally driven mechanics, very well executed+ Nice art style though nothing incredibly noteworthy+ Interesting concept in a popular gaming trope- Adolescent and frankly infantile writing- Characters are, honestly, very unlikeable- The ""randomization"" is severely limited- There is mundanity in the mechanics that does not exhibit an emotional response the same as 'Papers, Please' does.Read More:First off, I really don't think the game is particularly amazing. It is noteworthy in its mechanics and it does portray emotion relatively well but to write it off as something incredible is a frankly exaggerated overstatement made by typical reviewers in the indie sub-industry that supplements the credulous nature of its audience. The writing, my biggest complaint:I think games such as these require a strong connection between players and the characters- in this particular game I have found perhaps two I could stand. Most if not all of them are beyond unlikeable (♥♥♥♥ bruno, seriously. And ♥♥♥♥ that edge-master militia guy too). Consequently, this ends up as a limit on the amount of empathy a player can muster to the ""story"" of the game. Those who don't have a larger necessity to character-build and personally develop a mental image of characters will be able to get away from this problem relatively well so take what I say with a grain of salt, it's personally subjective after all. An Example: http://gyazo.com/4f9f347cb58c865e13924896493364bcAs for the comments many players hold about ""a survival game without zombies, finally!"" except you can imagine a zombie survival game, subtract all the zombies and this would be the exact same. Humans are potential threats, you struggle to survive and scavenge for essentials. That's it. There is little relatively relevant to a war in a mechanical sense so the context becomes frankly wasted, largely underutilised and superflous. Perhaps I missed something in my playthroughs but this appears to be the case. Furthermore, the game is by no means a piece that will represent the struggles and complexities of war because the writing, as I stated before, is incredibly infantile, limited and practically reads like an edgy story a teenager wrote in his late teens when one has just started learning the nature about the true atrocities of the world and history. This is exactly that, since all the game's storytelling, writing and efforts to set up a plot boil down to ""♥♥♥♥ the war"", ""war is x"", ""look what the war is doing to us"", hell the trope ""war never changes"" applies here perfectly and not in a good sense. I appreciate the attempts to try and provide a civilian perspective to war and to a certain extent it's achieved but only in a miniscule scope of the subject and in a very adolescent display. Why not expand on the war itself? You have victims of this arbitrary entity that's seemingly wiped the nation and wrecked its civilian livelihood but such little context is given other than ""both sides are bad guys because they ♥♥♥♥ us over"", why are they bad? What do they do? What fighting was there? We don't know anything other than a basic evil that's displayed over us as a contextual cue. Please tell me if I'm wrong, I'll happily accept evidence of such but I got little more than some basic lines about ""war is this"" and ""war is that"" and ""the militia is fighting them"" and ""we dont trust the militia"" well, christ, why? Mechanics:What the game does very well is the initial emotional shock you get playing, killing and scavenging. These are all superb by design and implementation, however, they are also very difficult to replicate thereafter. I would compare this to playing a game from the souls series for the first time, getting through the ropes and understanding the system is very satisfactory, whilst in this particular title it's very impactful emotionally. You are hit when you realise the actions you took had consequences far beyond what you could imagine. You are hit when you realise the game's mechanics will force you to almost keep everyone hungry or very hungry as you struggle to ration food out. I'll stop there to avoid spoiling the experience for you, but as I state, it's portrayed beautifully. But there are also limitations here and they are certainly not to be ignored. There was no mechanic to display group mechanics on the move for example, only back at base. How groups tackle situations would have been far more interesting than one person who does not interact with the environment other than with what the player does. This means that the game wanted you to create your own story- a fallacious objective when all you can do is limited to scavenging, possibly murdering, bartering and perhaps sometimes helping someone in an odd encounter. The whole time I was playing I was wary of assisting people, I was sometimes rejecting assistance itself and not attempting to help others when they needed it, not because my group needed supplies or anything but because I was afraid of what they could potentially do. I would credit this to the nature of the game and to some degree the game is responsible but this is largely from my own experience, I don't know if the game has such encounters of betrayal but I certainly never saw such. For the record, I come from Myanmar, a country that suffered war for a long time and I myself have lost loved ones under it. Playing through this game, I felt like the author simply wanted to display the absolute horror of it as opposed to the daily mundanity people have to live through, listening to the radio is worthless because it only updates in between every few days, days are so limited your characters are going through processes to ensure you finish building everything, they've eaten etc. within the time limit. You decide what to do on occasions with people who come to the door, and these are quite nice encounters that are well scripted for the most part, much more so than the characters and their backstories which I felt were the weakest point in the game. Graphics:The game looks good, that's all I can say. Characters are gritty, they blink (which is creepy and quite cool that they implemented that), the war torn environment is done nicely I suppose and the graphics quality is quite well made. The game runs smoothly but that's unsurprising considering the indie nature of the art direction but it is still commendable. I have had one crash through my gameplay and for me that's relatively acceptable in an increasingly error heavy industry. Final Thoughts:All in all a good game, but by no means an amazing piece of work nor game of the year material as many have stated, I would say it's better to buy it on a sale than at full retail. But that's me personally, if you were to ask me about the title without a price tag, I would tell you that it's worth a buy nonetheless. However, approaching this title with great expectations will leave many disappointed and I personally believe many of the steam reviews here are unsanitary in the nature they portray this game's emotional impact- there is so much more to a game than that, and sadly this particular title seems to have either forgotten or failed to drive attention to them. Between this title, Wasteland 2, The Last of Us, Fallout and The Walking Dead, there are very few titles of noteworthy mention in a very congested genre/trope that's become little more than a pile of drivel, consisting of poorly made titles that boast emotional prowess when in reality the capacity of such is usually little more than an initial impact of ""well, humans are terrible"".

												Superb game!""This War of Mine"", a survival game based on what can be a moderm war in a city siege for civilians, like the Yugoslavian Wars[en.wikipedia.org] as an example.You start on an abandoned house which was shelled a bit. You have initially three survivors that have the common quest to survive, everyone with their own perks, positive/negative needs, most important one being food. There is a number of ""premade"" survivors, and everytime you start a new game, you get 3 random ones as said. During the day you can build improvements for your house from water collectors, oven, tool workbench(to build tools and weapons), furnitures(from beds to armchairs), fix holes from explotions to avoid looters and to keep the place more warm, vegetable gardens and animals traps, and more!You will ask me how can dudes/dudettes build all this? By scavenging during the night for food, parts and all sorts of other junk laying around.During the night you order which survivals go to sleep, which stay on guard agaisnt looters, and which one goes scavenging.You have all sorts of locations that unlock from time to time for you to scavenge, some are fairly safe while others are full of bandits waiting for your blood.Your survivers can get tired, sick, wounded, sad, depressed(if you turn him into Hitler for stealing the last spinach soup from the old people living nearby), so you must organize well what to do and when.Also not to forget, events: From the greedy trader who comes to your house everynow and then, neighboors may come to ask your help(in return for some possible reward), a radio including various channels that can also tell you how the war is going, as well as Eddard Stark telling you that Winter is coming.Now that I finished my blabber, buy the game and check it for yourself!P.S.: Oh, forgot to note that this game has a stealth system, bit overpowered in my opinion, unless my survivor was a member of the Dark Brotherhood.~P.P.S: Oh! Forgot to mention that this game has lots of lore into every character, every decision you make has an impact in your gameplay and story. It's a very well detailed game, quite an achievement compared to what developers release nowadays.			"

												I would highly recommend this game to anyone as a poignant and thought-provoking experience. It really lends a new perspective to experience war as a normal person just trying to survive rather than a godlike human war machine wreaking havoc.That said, I would not describe it as an enjoyable game in the slightest. It is a depressing view of something utterly awful that should never have existed, and if you get anything of value out of the game it will leave you miserable. But it will also leave you a better person than you were before.			"

												So good I bought it twice...I've only played for ~5 hours and I've already bought a copy to keep in my gift inventory for the next friend I need to find a present for.So far, it's so gritty and realistic that it's impressed me no end.Who knows if I'll ever manage to survive the war but I'm going to try pretty damned hard.Full marks to the developers for such a novel, challenging game. Personally, I love moral dilemmas and bleak situations in my games. It makes me question what's really important and I think that's missing from many modern games, especially AAA titles.Bravo~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Edit: I'm now 200 hours in and I still find the game just as enjoyable as I did at the start			"

												I was desperate. When I walked into the house I knew I was going into someone elses house. It wasn't abandoned, but I was just going in to get a few things sneakily and then I was going to leave. I needed some construction materials, maybe some food.When I walked upstairs I heard a noise. It was the guy I had heard talking to himself earlier, speaking of how he was taking care of his family, how his elderly grandmother didn't have anyone else who could take care of her at this point.I stood in the doorframe, out of sight, but he walked in, looking suspicious. He must have heard me. Within an instant he walked right up to the doorframe I was hiding in and I grabbed my knife. I had a second to choose between stabbing him while I still had the element of surprise, and letting this guy go. Maybe he'd just shoo me off if he found me. Maybe he'd shoot me dead in an instant.Terrified I lunged at him, stabbing him in the chest, killing him instantly. I found a gun on him and took it too, satisfied that I did the right thing, that this guy probably would have killed me.It wasn't until I was running for the exit that in the last second I saw his mother walk in, and collapse next to his body. I didn't stay any longer to see if she said anything, I couldn't bear it.But that night I came home with a full pack.			"

												This war of mine.. this game will make you feel horrible.Day 30. It was freezing, one of us died recently from the cold. I had no meds. I had little fuel to keep us warm, i had to do terrible and disgusting things to keep everyone alive. So i took Roman to the hospital with a knife and scoped rifle. I stabbed everyone there and shot them, doctors, guards and even dying patients just to loot them hoping for meds. Though my actions were the worst luckily it saved us.Day 36. The meds helped, but people were still a bit sick and depressed. There was only 1 more location i've not searched.. The Church. So again i took Roman on a mission, i stole everything valuable they had. Sugar to make Alcohol, a bit of food and 3 bandages. I also had to stab the priest to make him stop punching me. They were all crying. But i ran off with my supplies. Now we're all okay, not sad. Not hungry and not sick or hurt.This War Of Mine. 10/10 "

												9.5/10Food became a product of high value, moreso than it already was. I was so pre-occupied with crafting, building, designing a safe haven, that I forgot to feed my people. I got desperate.A lazy cottage was not far, and it looked undisturbed. On my 3rd outing it was my choice as word was, there was a lot of food there. For some reason, I didn't send my regular guy, but instead someone more ""fresh-faced"". No idea why, perhaps she needed to get out more, spend less time sleeping or crafting.The house is as quiet as expected... after looting through the rubbish outside, I suddenly spot a fire place... alight...? Surely that means that I won't be alone in the house... I take a peak through keyhole, lo and behold an elderly couple sit quietly, peaceful either side of the cosy flames, exchanging small talk.Husband - ""I know, honey, I know""Wife - ""Maybe we'll have a nice dinner tomorrow?""F*ck... well, they might be peaceful after all, perhaps I could barter with them. Make an agreement. I make my own way into the house.Husband - ""Oh... how did you enter...?""He approaches me at the door, God, I hope this guy can help me out. All 3 of us need food... his wife calls after him,Wife - ""Is something wrong, my dear?""He's at the door.Husband - ""I'm afraid we can't do anything for you...""No option to barter... no option to talk. I need this food, I need to eat, my guys back at the shelter are starving I don't know what to... the shovel is equipped....Husband - ""What are you doing...? Put it down.""*PAUSE*Husband - ""Put it down, please""Oh, Jesus, don't plead with me. I'm the desperate one here, I'm the one who should be pleading with you. But I can't. I'm so sorry...Husband - ""Jelena, run!""Wife - ""BANDITS! HELP!""The man bolts downstairs to the basement, but Jelena unwittingly heads straight for me.Jelena - ""I'm calling for help!""It is a 'double-tap' affair. The lady hits the floor, after 1 more hit than I had predicted.Husband - ""What was that...? No, it's can't be! Please, speak to me!""The man runs back up from the basement to discover his own personal hell in front of him. Standing there, over his dead wife. He cries for help moments before the second blow, but I assume there is no help coming...--------This place is a gold mine. There's enough food to take home, including some more to come back for. I rinse the refrigerator, and the closet, but my bag is full before I even reach the other 2 floors. On return, my scavenger is not in the high spirits of someone who has found enough food to last a few days. She wishes she had never left the shelter. It would appear her actions have taken over her, and she continues to regret her decisions. I knew there was a reason I should have build that ♥♥♥♥ing radio.--------On return to the house, the new scavenger raids the leftovers and finds a letter.""A letter from Grandpa Bernard to Alen""""We're happy to learn that you've come to like living with auntie. The war is not that bad, it's just not for children. In fact, they say it will be over soon, so don't worry about us. Grandma is feeling better. She asked me not to tell you, but she's saving some flour to make you those cookies you like! And as for me... well, I promise you to repair the swing when you are back"". "

												I barely made to day 10 on my first 3 hours of gameplay. Scavanged old couple house (and hit the old man with a shovel of course), ignored to help a man who was going to save his baby (he was shot down by a sniper anyway and the baby couldn't make it), and one of my men got killed when he was trying to save a homeless guy. Those stuff, are the 3 examples of the situations you're going to see in this game. You need to choose a very tough decission. You may use your instinct to do that, but you'll regret it later. If you killed a guy, it will give your survivor(s) a morale hit. If the situations are worsen, they might commit suicide and the game ends. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. There aren´t just soldiers fighting for their lives, there are groups of civilians too, fighting for their own life. Struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. You can't change the way the world works, but the world will push you to change the way you live. This game will show who you truly are. In the end of the day, as long as you live on this planet, you will realise, you are not as nice as you thought.TL;DR : Whatever decission i chose in the game, it gives my men and I a morale hit and makes me think what i have done to my life. This game makes me to change my mindset about how the world works and I think, i've become a better person (not sure though)			"

												War is raging outside...First few days for us weren't that bad considering the circumstances. Pavle found heaps of materials, spare parts, wood. Pretty soon we were able to fortify our home. We grew accustomed to it. In the beginning we got raided on what felt like a regular basis. And they always went for the food and water. It got tougher. Everyday we listened to the radio. Gotta know what's going on out there, right? Radio has been telling us about an increasing rate of crimes and robberies. No♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sherlock...We got hungry. Then we got very hungry. Night came and again our home was chosen for a raid. But not this time. We closed every hole in our walls and we were armed - well we had a shovel - but it worked. We managed to fend of our first raid. Things were looking up. Then it drew on us. What good is all our wood, fortification and our shovel, if we can't eat. We've scavenged quite a few locations by now. Always came back with our backpacks filled to the brim, but lacking food and water. We grew sad. One of us grew ill. We gave him some medication and let him sleep it off. The rest of us sat down on our two armchairs around our radio, listening to classical music. It felt strange to sit on those comfy armchairs, fancy music echoing from the walls, while we were lacking the bare essentials. My stomach rumbled, then somebody knocked on the door.It was a woman, self proclaimed singer. A cheery girl in a good physical condition. She asked if she could stay with us. We weren't even able to feed three people but hell, I liked her. We let her stay with us. She might be able to lift our spirits. A good girl she was.Night came once more. With all of us quite shaken up from the dire situation, we sent the new girl out to scavenge. The other three of us were close to starvation. What happened then, is what the new girl told us the next morning. While we fended off yet another raid, she did...well, what had to be done. You know, there was this lonely elderly couple living just a few blocks from us. Our new girl visited them. They asked her to leave, to spare their food. They begged her. When she began ransacking through their stuff, they fled to the attic. Waiting for everything to be over. We took their food, took their water. Even took some jewelry for bartering later down the road. We did not take their medical supplies...they would need them pretty soon...thanks to what we took from them. Next day the new girl told us about that night while we ate our first cooked meal in days. We were still hungry. What have we done? Depression took the better part of us and we spent the day together around the radio - comforting each other. That night, everybody stayed at home. Everybody slept.Couple of days later, things are not as bad. We're still kinda sad and food is an ongoing issue, but we managed to build a device to collect and filter rainwater and we caught our first small animals to fight the hunger. Supply around town is running low though and we need to take bigger risks. We built knives. Everyone of us has one now. Our home stands. Each night one of us is going out there to provide for the group. Until now, they've always returned. And until now, only once, we had to do the bad thing. Until now...			"

You face hard decisions tough situations and very tricky moments along the way, this game has amazing visuals very good atmosphere and sounds Smart gameplay and is done brilliantly. And it has a nice integration with the steam workshop for extended gameplay. Very good game.			"

												TWOM is a great yet soul-crushing experience wherein you have to come to terms with what it means to survive in a state of war. It's not easy and most decisions are definitely not black and white.You are tasked with controlling a group of survivors (I've heard you can unlock a solo variation) who are simply trying to make it in hopeless situation. Along with the variety of moral dilemmas that you face is a bit of mildly challenging resource management. When crafting, not only do you have to consider the materials needed but also the time it will take to accomplish goal x/y/z. The game also features a rich amount of dialogue from not only your characters (check out their cool biographies) but the places you visit at night during your looting runs. It adds a lot of character to the game and makes some decisions even harder to make. There's a lot more to this game but it's honestly better to just take a look and see for yourself. If you want a meaningful survival game then I strongly suggest you pick this game up.			"

												I wish more games were like this.This is a game that semi realisticly shows you what would happen if you had to survive in an area engulfed in war. The mechanics are fun to play with, and the resources that you have to gather to make said mechanics work are never in abundance.But more importantly, it teaches you something, and it does it very subtly and very well. It shows you that when it comes to 'your group' or 'yourself', you will do whatever is necessary to survive. I believe this to be something very hard to capture in a game, but this war of mine does it perfectly. It manages to make you feel, think and act like a survivor.The game has some bugs and crashes, and I did not enjoy the combat mechanics of the game that much, but combat is not the focus of the game. It is a fantastic experience.			"

												I was rather dubious with buying this game from looking at it, didnt really see the appeal and it looked slow and boring....how wrong i was. One of the best purchases i got during the summer, became very addictive very quickly. The idea of showing what normal civilians have to do just to survive during war time was genius, dealing with depression, food rationing, black market trading, sleep, pillaging and raids all come into affect just trying to stay alive and healthy. You have a nice range of people to choose from, each with there own unique ability, many areas to explore, great achievements, challenging gameplay, no bugs and buying the War Child DLC helps real children around the world who suffer from issues in this game, a real masterpiece.

												It's 10pm, have to stand up tomorrow at 6am, let's not start something big, just test this new game I got for 50% last sale. 10:20Ok, it's the first day, my characters are Pavle, Marko and Bruno. I like the graphics, the controls are easy.11pmAfter a few days and nights I learn, how differnet characters are professionals at different activities. Marko is a great scavenger, he has a big inventory. Bruno uses less materials when cooking.12pmOk, I should go to bed now. But wait, I need more food for tomorrov, let Marko get some. I can end when I'm in a good situation.1amMarko was wounded by a sniper, I can't stop now. Pavle has to get some bandages for him. Oh thank god the trader, let's give him some cigarettes for the medicine.1:10Bruno gets sad because he can't smoke, come on Bruno better quit it.2amWe have a new member, Emilia. Is it a good idea to let a woman join this group of three men? People are getting sad, Bruno depressed because Marko had to steal supplies. I did not want to steal from these old people either..3amI really need sleep myself now, but think about my group, they are tired too. And I have to get them through this conflict. Last night Emilia attacked Bruno because she is not feeling well. What a b**ch. We're also getting robbed by raiders every second night. Just found out that I am able to build a door with alarm system, that should help.4amSleep is for the weak. My group is getting a relative normal life in this city. Found out that people can get each other out of depressin by talking to each other or listening to music. It's a hard game at the start, but now I now how to handle it.4:20Marko shot by a sniper. F**k4:30Raiders steal most valuable items.4:40Pavle is killed while steeling supplies.4:50Bruno and Emilia are broken and won't even move or do something productive.5amF**k it I'm quiting this motherf**king game.Same afternoon I started a new game, chose characters, created my own, got a completely different house, different events, differnet loot. Atmospheric game, touches the heart.10/10 would play again (and again, because at second try everyone dies too)			"

												A great story of survival in which making choices of what to take home, the moral choices you need to take, and just the day by day survival just grows bleaker. If you're into a sleek stealth, survival management game than I would say give this title a try. The choices only get harder as time moves forward, and sometimes the lines between right and wrong become blurred when it comes to surviving. Are you a good? Are you bad? It really comes down to if you're going to see another day.The first time of deciding should I bring home some scraps to build an upgraded stove, or the extra herbs to make some medicine for a member of my group who was wounded in a raid alone was a hard choice to make in the longevity of my groups survival. Be prepared for some darker days as it doesn't get any better going forward. Great game to pick up for the asking price.			"

If we can bring more than 1 person to scavange each night, or maybe send them at different places and play them 1 by 1. It will be goodOther than that, this game is EPIC!!			"

												This game is beautifully depressing. You start out as a small group of people with a few materials to work with at your disposal, but all that changes at night, where you can have one of them go out looting. This can be dangerous, or even heart-breaking: in some places, there may be threat, while in others you could steal a dying man's medicine for a hurt member in your group. No matter what you decide, your group as a whole and as individuals will be affected physically and emotionally. This game is hard to play at times, because it can get so. sad.

												This War of Mine is like nothing I have ever played before. I thought going into it that it was a platformer of sorts, but it’s actually closer to being a real time strategy game. The whole game revolves around keeping a group of survivors alive for the duration of the war, which includes keeping them fed, rested, warm, treated for any sickness (meds) or wounds (bandages) and also keeping tabs on their mental wellbeing, which I learned early on is very important as I lost a character to suicide.The gameplay basically revolves around activities in your safe house during the day, which include things like building beds, stoves, work benches, etc and then building and managing supplies like food, fuel for the heater, filters for clean water,  and ammo etc.  As night falls, you have to choose which characters will sleep, which will guard and which will go scavenging for supplies. You have to balance sleeping with guarding, as you can’t let your people get too tired, but you also run the risk of getting raided each night by bandits, which leaves you with supplies stolen and possibly wounded characters.Scavenging at night, now this is where the real fun of it came in for me. You can’t go in guns blazing as you usually scored yourself a pretty quick death. In the end I found the most effective form of combat was to hide in the shadows, and bait each enemy close to me so I could finish them with my knife. But, you have to balance who you kill as killing can have huge consequences on your team’s mental health. In the end it was easier to only kill when needed, as I didn’t have to worry about anyone getting sad or depressed.All in all I had a heap of fun learning the game, and after having just completed my first play through, I look forward to playing through again with all the tricks that I learnt.  I highly recommend this game for all fans of strategy or even just someone looking for something a little different. Even at full price, I think there is a lot of fun to be had.			"

I'm really thankful to my ancestors that us the new generation (most of us) have not been through such tough times. To be honest when I'm playing this game I make every move with such care and the fear of losing the character is so real as if I'm facing a real war scenario, I hope such fierce conditions which are torturing and mind breaking are not faced by anyone and this game has made me realised that. PEACE!!			"

												this is a amazing game. It let people feel like in a war personally and you have to make a lot of hard choices. You can both feel the darkness and warmness in this war. It can help people rethink about the victoms in a war and always remind the our human beings the harms of  wars. Long live PEACE. (from Chinese player)			"

There's nothing I do not like about the game. If in doubt you should just go ahead and buy it. Swietna Gra!			"

												What can I say about This War of Mine that other reviewers haven't already?Nothing.So I'll just list why I think this game is so important. TWoM is a survival game with tough moral choices that actually /mean/ something.I have played this game four times now, and only one time did I manage to make it to the end so far. The other three times I either managed to get all my people killed, or lost because I made it otherwise impossible for them to survive. And yet even the losses were a ""win"" in a way.As you play, you get choices like risking one of your people's life's in order to safe an innocent from an enemy, or to rob another surviver since your own people are starving... and these choices have consequences.Sure, deciding to plunder the home of defenseless people of valuables and food means you get to eat for another few days, but this can cause emotional stress with one or more of your people, meaning they will be unable to work during the day or go out scavenging during the night.And taking the risk to gather resources inside enemy territory means your surviver can get wounded, leading to a dangerous and slow recovery -- if any -- or even death. And this will have consequences on the emotional wellbeing of the others.I am fortunate enough to never have been in a war zone, but after playing this I feel can empathize with the people who are living in a country torn apart by war. For that reason alone, I'd recommend you play it.			"

It will make you smile with delight. It will make you cry. It will make you frustrated.

												I would like to start this review by stating the fact that this was the first game that I FULLY played through. Before I had good games, bad games, but I always restarted them after learning a new tip, or if somebody died, etc. So this was the first playthrough I went with all the way. Now we can begin.I had just unlocked a new story, with a set of some of my favorite characters, so of course I reset my current game to try out this new set of characters that I was rather excited to play as!But, as the camera started to pan into the house, I noticed it was snowing.I got a winter start. I didn't know what to do, I had never survived to winter before! So I went about as usual, not noticing that I already had a furnace down in the bedroom. Night hit and I just did what I normally do, scavenge for materials then come back and build. But when I came back both of the people I had left at the base were ill, so I let them rest and rinse and repeat a few days.At about Day 6, Marin became terminally ill, he was going to die. I scrounged up my tobbaco, made some cigs, and traded for some meds at the Military Outpost. But, apperantly I stayed to long, and after trading a soldier opened fire on me, hoping to get their supplies back. I ran back with the meds, albiet with Katia wounded, and was going to give them to Marin, but the other survivor, Arica, had also fallen terminally ill, and was dieing. I had to choose between Arica and Marin, and I chose Arica. She still had a chance, she could survive!They both survived longer than expected, but Marin was constantly ill, and never did anything other than eat.At around day 8-9, I went on a scavenging run with the now slightly better Arica, to an apartment building inhabited by a small family. I ran into the middle of the house, opened the fridge, stole everything in there, and ran out before the eldest son could shoot me. When I got back, everybody was absolutley torn at what I did, and they all sat on the floor and just stayed there, wasting a day, and a night, as they did nothing.That night, Marin left the group, leaving a Broken Arica and a depressed Katia in his once home. I didnt have anything to do for the next 2 days-nights, so I waited.On day 13, Arica died due to diesease, and then there was one, a heartbroken Katia. She sat on the floor all day, and did nothing. And that night, she commited suicide by cutting her wrists, and laying on her bed.There was nobody left, the base was empty, other than the faint smell of blood.At the end of the game, you get a runthrough of all the important events that happened, and what happened to the characters after the war, no matter if you win or lose.As I sat and watched what happened during the game, I realized how much I would be torn if I had to do these things, and then I felt bad. I felt pity for pixels on my computer screen. They felt like real people, they had stories, and it tore at my heart. And as I read what happened to each of the people after the war, I nearly broke out in tears.Marin took a action figure toy talked about in his bio, and left. He was never found.In Arica's section it talked about what she might have become if she lived.And in Katia's section, it said she couldn't take the war anymore, slit her wrists, and layed down in bed clutching her war diary, her parents also never found out what happened to her.This War of Mine deserves all the praise it gets, as it tears at your hearts with its amazing storytelling and great gameplay. I recommend this game to the end of space and beyond.			"

												This game brought out more feelings in a few minutes than most games do through an entire playthrough. I have never wanted a virtual human to live or die more in any other game.You are not soldiers. You are civilians caught in possibly the worst of circumstances. Will you kill and steal from innocents to survive? Will you give to those in need if it means you have to suffer? Will you help people in distress even if it means you may get injured or die? Your morality will be tested like no other.The soundtrack is brilliant and adds so much more to the already grim atmosphere. There are not enough words to describe the rush you feel listening to this music while saving a life.My only complaint is that I didn't pick up this game sooner. The rollercoaster of emotions evoked from this masterpiece make this game one not to miss.			"

												Not many games make me cry, The Walking Dead and This War Of Mine are examples.This War Of Mine isnt really a game, more like an ""interactive movie""  sort of thing.This game shows you the prespective of you, most war games are bad guys vs good guys. But in reality. Is pretty much Bad guys vs Innocent people.The atmosphere couldnt be more perfect, decisions really matter in this game, and is REAL HARSH, from having to say ""No"" to some children that need medicine for their mother, having to rob and old couple, then days later find them dead in bed, stealing a hospital in service for you're bleeding friend. And having to see a young girl get beaten by a soldier.This game really shows the worst of you. SPOILER :  after the ceasefire, it shows all the important actions (for example, killing a person, helping some children) and the aftermath of your (alive) characters, some end up having a normal life again, some just end up homeless from depression and die. It's sad. The war is a massacre of people that dont know each other for the profit of people that do know each other but dont massacre themselves.Remember, war is hell. This game supports war child.			"

												This War of Mine is a story of civilian survival in a war torn city.The core mechanics of the game essentially come down to resource management. The basic resource categories you need to manage come down to these broad groups:1. Food (ex. raw meat)2. Building Materials (ex. wood)3. Weapons/Utilities (ex. lock picks)4. Happiness (ex. cigarettes)5. Healing (ex. medication)6. Bartering (ex. diamonds)The game uses a cycle of two times: night and day.During the day you will do things like:1. Cook food2. Distill alcohol3. Sleep4. Set mouse traps5. Grow vegetables etc.During the NIGHT you will go out and SCAVENGE.The night is the more interactive part of the game. During the night you will look at your map and determine where you would like to scavenge in the city. Some locations (such as the Garage) will be relatively safe and have people for you to barter with. Other locations (such as the Construction Site) may not be safe. You may need to bring a weapon or be prepared to not be seen. The entire goal of scavenging is to bring back food, materials, medications, etc. for your party back at base camp. Criticisms:Overall, I feel like the game becomes very grindy. The fact that you can only carry a limited amount of resources with you while scavenging is realistic yet tedious. You will have to spend multiple nights scavenging the same location in order to loot all of it. While this feels realistic and reasonable, in practice it just becomes monotonous and repetitive. Day time phase is a bit of a hassle and simply becomes a routine. You will make water every day. You will put tired people in beds every day. You will cook every day/every few days. Basically day time is just a monotonous time sync as you go through the motions of keeping everyone healthy. And that's honestly what day time is - going through the motions. It's not fun, it's not interactive, and you do the same thing nearly every time. It's disappointing. What I enjoy about the game:I absolutely love the concept - it's clever and I have to give the studio props on originality. It's fresh and something I have never seen before. I like the resource management concept of the game - unfortunately I just didn't care for the way it was executed (too monotonous/going through the motions).Final Word:There is A LOT more depth to this game than I have presented here, but I have presented the basic gist of the title. While the game is unique and original, it lacks engagement. There isn't much of a story and the gameplay is simply too repetitive.  I'm very torn on this title, as I want to recommend it but the game just isn't fun. The gamplay isn't strong enough and it becomes repetitive very fast.5.0/10			"

War is hell, even for the noncombatants entangled in the conflict.Summary:By flipping the script and focusing on civilians trapped in a war torn city, 11 bit studios has created a more humanized and poignant type of war game. The game will run you through a range of emotions from starvation induced desperation, to the guilt and rationalization of a thief, to the heartwarming joy of a rare display of camaraderie among neighbors. Much like the citizens trapped in this war, you won't receive any guidance on how best to survive. Controls are very simple and intuitive, allowing the challenge to come from how you manage resources and respond to events. My chief complaint toward this phenomenal game is that it can be too slow at times, making me wish there were a fast forward button.A couple tips: Don't spoil the experience by looking up guides until completing at least one playthrough on your own; overcoming adversity is part of the fun. Alt+Tab consistently crashed the game for me, test it on your system after the start of a new day (when saves occur).Full review:Like a microcosm of the split, warring factions of the city, the civilians have also fractured into small, wary, tribe-like groups. Some are willing to trade with you while others will shoot you on sight. The small group that you watch over consists of one to four people depending on which scenario you play. These are drawn from a modest collection of realistic characters. Each has a backstory and reason for being in the city when the fighting began. Don't mistake this for a heavily text driven narrative kind of game. It uses just enough text to set the stage and then lets you experience and create your own stories.There is a realistic but sometimes burdensome level of variation in how useful each character is. They all have one unique talent that they excel at as well as some hidden general competency statistics. The imbalance among them can make some playthroughs significantly tougher than others. Overall, the game will test you mightily as you learn the ropes but actually became too easy once I had discovered enough ways to boost my efficiency.Playing as nonviolently as I could limited my combat experience but when I did fight, I found it to be awkward. It is largely dependent on your equipment and whether you get the drop on your opponent, rather than any player skill.One cool tool that the developers use to feed you information without breaking immersion is the radio. It can give you updates on the war's status, tips on what goods are able to be bartered at a higher price due to scarcity, weather forecasts and more. Winter is the most brutal period to make it through and you will want to know when it is coming.This game's muted color palate and heavy use of black is what I would call subtly beautiful. It effectively communicates the grimness of the setting. A sketchy, pencil-like visual effect lends a hand drawn quality to its 3D animation. I'd also like to highlight the differences in how each character moves and holds themselves. Their personalities are imbued into their movements in a way that I don't recall seeing very often in video games.Adding to the atmosphere is a mostly downbeat soundtrack reminiscent of The Last of Us. It has character without becoming too busy for the mood it is trying to set. I like the music, but there are few enough tracks that repetition eventually began to wear on me. The soundtrack is included as a free DLC.I would like to encourage anyone who buys and likes the game to pick up the War Child Charity DLC. It only adds a little artwork to the game but 100% of the proceeds go to charity. You can choose to pay 1$, 10$ or 20$ for it. I skipped The Little Ones DLC but its recent price drop makes it more enticing.A final note on game length: My first playthrough took 13.5 hours, the second lasted 11.5 hours, and my final two took a combined 10.8 hours. The final one was a custom scenario designed to be shortened by the optional Anniversary Edition ending attached to the ""Epilogue: Exodus"" achievement (an annoyingly difficult to accomplish task during regular play, but still fun to experience once).

												We can play this game in two ways. 1. treated it as just a game. 2. ""feel"" the game.Getting more food is easy, just steal/rob from other poor/helpless survivors.I tried to ""feel"" the game. I am a poor survive, I saw people kill/rob/steal from other people inorder to survive. How do I react ? Thieves and robbers, oftenly they came to our place trying to steal/rob from us.My three people have no food to eat for two days, is it a good excuse to steal from other poor people like us?For me, I played the game under two rules. 1. I don't steal from other poor people. 2. I don't kill and tried to avoid killing other poor people. Unless being attack. Even being attack, if they stop I stop.But I will kill the armed thugs and bad soldiers if needed.It's more challenging and more meaningfull playing in this way.Anyone agree?			"

												This War Of Mine is an artistic and entertaining experience that most will never forget. The decisions made can have a large effect on the way you view yourself sometimes. I looked at myself in the mirrior and said ""did I really have to do that"". The perspective is a much more entertaining experience than todays military shooters. You are a survivor in a besieged city in a war torn country. You improve your house by day and scavenge by night. The artistic graphics give the game the right mood for a great experience.  I would recommend this game to all gamers who love the survival and story genres.Edit: Still a good game			"

I got rekt the first playthroughs so bad. But I kept trying and now I completed all the premade campaigns of the game. Really relaxing and fun. Every detail and choice you take can be death or survival for the characters. Even some unaccurate raid in an hostile place can be fatal. You have to save food and sometimes you are forced to leave someone die for let someone else live. I still need to buy the children dlc, but I will. It's a must play, imo.9\10			"

												Gameplay & Review here:


YouTube™ Video: This War Of Mine: Scavenge & Survive 

			Views: 122		

			Today I check out This War Of Mine by 11 Bit Studios. In this war game you play as a group of survivors trying to scavenge for food and medical supplies during war.		

I love this game so far. It's a grim survival game where you have 3 survivors during a war. You need to scavenge for anything even remotely useful. Food, clean water, medicial supplies & building materials. You need to begin to craft yourself a shelter your group can actaully live in. Build beds, stoves and even cigarettes to help keep your group as comfortable as possible. All this is done during the day when you cannot go outside. At night you tone changes again you must split your group one will scavenge for resources away from your shetler, another may be assigned to guard your home from other scavengers/raiders and another may just simply sleep. With limited amount you can carry on scaevnging runs you have to pick and choose carefully what you bring back. Do you have enough food? Is anyone injured? Can you build enough to help survive? Is anyone sick? Can you defend yourself if attacked? So far a great game and a beautiful one as well.			"

												A short explination is it's a survival game like State of Decay, but instead of zombies it is about the grim reality of the civilian experience during war. The game really hits you in the feels with any decision you make. It was difficult to send away people asking for aid, which is normally a very mechanical and mathematical response from me. The characters internalize the bad, and the struggles are difficult to watch and interact. I don't want to spoil it for anyone. Great game. I was deeply invested and the end felt very rewarding. 8-10h for full playthrough with lots of replay value.			"

												This game is a 10/10 for me. Its really good graphics i like the dark and very sad style. They really caught the perfect mood and i find myself being sad and felling bad for the actions i had to do for surviving. As a little group civilians that is caught in the middel of a war, you need to find food and basic ressources to survive in a pretty sad hidding place, you need to improve your hidding to try and get a better mood and to try to forget the terrible war raging outside your door. When night comes you will have to scavenge, find places that are empty for people or go in and rob or even kill to get the stuff you need. But remember to have people to watch your own house, because every one is in need for stuff.This game really caught so many forms of sadnes and regret, it makes me live in to the world and its really interesting made. I want to see more of this type of games and hope that they have some great ideas to future updates. Clearly worth the price no question about that. One last thing guys...... Enjoy the game.			"

												This game took over my life for a few months to such an extent that I had to stop playing it. It would occupy every thought I had and I would wake up in the middle of the night worrying about the characters and how to stop them starving or becoming suicidal. The emotive content of the game was so accurate and so human that there has never been a game like it. I eventually worked out how to keep most of my characters fed and surviving but that didn't stop the 'enjoyment' (if I can call it that) of playing the game. I ended up downloading it to four different platforms (PC, Android, Apple and PS4) so if that doesn't say something about its addictiveness then I don't know what does.Such a simple game but the combination of its graphics, music, and playability make it the best game I have ever come across in nearly 40 years of playing games. 10/10.

												=| Heads Up |=This review, is an older review of mine and needed some cleaning. Therefore I wanted to post this fresh review up here with the new ones as I can word my reviews a bit better than back then. This is, surprisingly my point of view. My opinion so to speak. If you should disagree, you know what to do.=| Review |=First, I want to get two things out of the way. Do not expect the game to be easy and hold your hand. And even though that is a fact it still is a masterpiece for what it does.This game plays in a fictional war in our modern world. You play as a group of survivors living in their shelter in the times of war. That means, that the fear of being killed is not only quite big but also ever present. They want to survive and see the ones they loved or simply try and get out of the city and leave it all behind. And that means that its up to you to help them to reach that goal. On your first day in the Shelter you are able to loot most if not all of the items in said shelter. It will take a while but once you have done it, you wont have to worry about it again. From here it is all building and upgrading your shelter.From one simple station you craft various other stations or even upgrades for your own shelter, as well as items you need to upgrade other stations or the one you are working with right now. But those are not the most important things. In fact, nothing is extremely important as everything is important. You need every little thing you can get. And that means you have to manage with the things you gathered in your house. But now you used it all up, so what now? Well, its about to get real as the night falls. Now you choose who gets to guard the shelter, who gets to sleep (either on the floor or in a nice comfy bed) and who goes out to scavenge. And this has effects on your group. Over the night, everyone gets hungry. If you let them eat that can be dealt with but if they dont eat in 2 days they get very hungry and you have to deal with theit hunger. Everyone as well gets tired if they wont sleep. This means that they have to sleep over the day, if a bed is available, or have to rest on the night. If they wont do it for one night or day, they will get very tired and this has to be dealt with as well. And why put up a guard that needs to sleep over the day? Well, it isnt all that safe over the night. You send out your own scanvenger after all and most likely into buildings that are not abandoned. And the same will happen to your own shelter. People will try to break in and steal your ressources which you have to guard to keep them. And this can lead to not only hand on hand combat but also guns being used later on. Injuries from the event have to be dealt with over day and night. Let the person rest most of the time and of course bandage them if you can. But it wont be the only thing affecting your survivors. The worse they feel, the more depressed they get which can basically leads to them running away if you wont deal with their needs. This can be delayed if you let your characters talk to each other when such an event occurs.But now back to scavenging. You need some more ressources after all to build up your shelter and weapons to defend yourself with. But sadly you cant take everything you want with you. You only have limited amount of space and sometimes are needed to take tools with you, like the shovel, bonesaw or lockpicks. Sometimes you even have to take a weapon with you to take out the dangerous bandits in your way. And sometimes the people you think, are bandits are not even bandits but survivors just like you.On my first time playing the game, not knowing anything, I wanted to try my best not to kill people if I didnt have to. I would kill bandits as I didnt see them as other survivors. They simply stole for their own good and didnt care about the lifes of others, after all. And then I got into the church where the description told me that the people living their wouldnt be all too friendly, but I didnt know that this was focused on what lied behind the church and not below. So I went downstairs and killed the first man in cold blood. Another comes in, as he heard the noise and I dispatch of him just as quick. Two more people come running in and instead of running towards me, they run away and all I can read is that they try to get away from the murderer and that they are looking for help from others. I realised at that moment that it wasnt them who were the bad people. It was me who turned into a bandit simply because I didnt even considered that these people might be more friendly than it told me. I stopped playing the game for about 2 weeks after that, having to think about it constantly. The game made me feel extremely bad about that decision and after I began to play again, I tried my best to check before I go for the kill. As that was my initial intention after all.The longer the game gets, the further it progresses in the story of the war. Winter comes and so does the time of crime. Two events to keep you on your toes. In the time of crime you are being raided almost every night and the people who do it are not your normal survivors who steal things. They own guns and armor and try their best to get to your stuff. And the winter is probably when it comes to that, the lesser of two evils. The winter is simply another condition added ontop of the challenges you have to deal with already. Now you have to keep your shelter warm and you can activly collected snow to create water which you also need for various things. Cooking doesnt work without water and you cannot create Alcohol without it either which then leads to the creation of bandages.But of course let us mention the one thing that is outstanding in this game. The trader, who seemingly doesnt show up when you need him the most but when he does, he has exactly what you need. You can haggle with him and keep up with how much what is worth over the radio. And this changes drastically over the game. So do you need ammo in the time of crime? Or is it parts to upgrade your defenses and build weapons to defend yourself? Maybe you need tools. Well get some scrap metal for that matter and maybe some technical parts as well. But one thing is for sure. You need wood. A lot of it. So buy as much as you can.Because Winter, is most certainly, coming.			"

												Gritty. Grueling. Unforgiving. Depressing. Dark.  ...Beautiful. Those are all the words that come to my mind when I think of this game. Not joking when I say that I legitamately cried when I killed a couple just for their food with a knife... in their own home. Even worse? I was doing what I would do in a situation like this IRL on that playthrough. I panicked IRL. Legit.Unlike games which claim to be about survival such as DayZ or H1Z1, this game is legitamately about survival. Your survivors get hungry. They get tired. They have emotions. Hell, they can even get addicted to drugs and alcohol. And they can even commit suicide if they get sad enough. Trust me when I say this is a true survival game. A ROLE MODEL for all survival games in the making, and already released. Not to mention, the replayability in this game is tremendous. I've played on different playthroughs about 5 or 6 times now. (thanks my friend Hoplite for reminding me of this)Though there are some bugs and not very much to do at your shelter during the day after you build everything you need and do everything you need to do in a day for your survivors, there is lots to do in this game. Remember to get several boxes of tissues though. Like, 10 boxes. Maybe 15.9.5/10 from me. If anything mentioned above is what interests you, get this game right now. There's a very good reason for why the reviews for this game on Steam are ""Overwhelmingly Positive"".			"

												While many games try to portray war as something fun, This War of Mine tells it in a more realistic way. War is a dark, harsh, and depressing subject. In the game you're tasked with managing the survival of a group of civilians in a war-ravaged city. You'll face many tough decisions along the way. Do you steal from innocent people to feed yours? Do you let in that person seeking help, knowing that it's just one more mouth to feed? Going out each night to scavage what little supplies you can while trying to prevent your group from succumbing to starvation, illness, injury, or falling into the pits of despair.All of this may sound very bleak but just remember, every cloud has a silver lining. War does eventually end. Let's just hope it happens sooner rather than later.			"

												You do everything to stay alive in the world with a war and the danger all around.Whatever you are, a good person or not, this game will change the way you think and will make you do everything in order for you and people in your group to survive. Steal, kill are the only way for you to get something back to your group.Old couple who had many food and medic, the old lady sick as same as your group, she got 4 medicine and about 6 cans of food. I don't have any option left, must steal from her or let my people die. The old lady saw me in, she freak out and slowly run away, the old guy run to me and told me ""please, take whatever you want just don't hurt us"" I cried and quiet the game, feel guilty a lot even it just a game.This game will let you feel how bad the wars situation are, and make you do everything, every possible ways to lived on, whenever you need to do it or not.

												This is the kind of game that will make you wonder about what kind of person you are. Is it worth killing helpless innocents for a couple days' worth of food? Will you help the weak out of kindness? Or will you rob everyone blind in the sheer desire to survive? Sure, you can say ""it's just a game"", but it's impossible to avoid the feeling that your actions here might well mirror your true inclinations. So what's more important, survival or your humanity? Or can you preserve both? There are moments of both incredible kindness and cruelty to be found within, and they stir something in the human soul that I've rarely seen in games. From running a gauntlet of sniper fire to help a wounded father reunite with his infant son to murdering an elderly couple for their meager goods, it's impossible to play this game without thinking, ""Could that be me? Would I do that? Could I rise that high, sink that low?"" And that is the brilliance, the poetry, of this game.			"

												A very grim game that puts you into the feet of survivors which end up in the middle of a civil war. Moral decisions from stealing from bandits to killing innocent elders to get their food for your group well being. This game makes you witness all the horrors of the war that are not seen by the naked eye. Makes you think about your actions and shows you how each and every action will have some sort of reciprocation. You have to play it to witness it yourself.Absolutely amazing art style and soundtrack (even if it can get slightly repetitive). Definitely a contender if not an early victor for the Indie game of the year! Absolutely astonishing.9/10 in my books!			"

												10/10 would replay again.I don't usually enjoy games where all you do is click, so starting this game I didn't think I'd spend more then twenty minutes max playing it. However, I took a break after 2 hours of continuous gameplay and had yet to get tired of the plot and goal. The goal itself is simple- survive. Many games use this as a goal, however This War of Mine brilliantly and impressively conveys the realism whilst having very simple gameplay. Other games tend to sugar coat the effects and attempt to make up for it through complexity and empty substance. This War of Mine hits the mark amazingly, and definitely is worth the buy. No ""ragrets"".			"

												This is a game I always find myself coming back to every once and a while, despite how the game mechanics start becoming more and more predictible. Originally, the selling point of the game is the tension of not knowing whether you survive, the struggle to keep everyone fed and happy and well-rested while also mitigating the threat of raids, but even now that the uncertainty of survival has worn off and I know every location by heart, I still enjoy the game. Even though the tension might be gone, the game is enjoyable in a different sense. I play it when I don't feel like playing something intense and challenging, but rather to play a game just difficult enough to challenge me and yet not too difficult to require concentration or worry. I enjoy its slower pace and it's a very pleasant break from shooters and strategy games that require the constant juggling of variables and threats that change moment to moment.			"

Posted: November 18, 2014
												This War of Mine offers a refreshing concept that is beautifully realized, both in detail and in broad strokes. What does it take to survive when you can't just shoot your way out of every situation? The game puts you in a tight spot: as a civilian trapped in a war zone, you are not the almighty hero this time. You are just another dude who don't have any influence on the outcome of the conflict. You're not fighting for glory or honor, nor king or country. You're fighting for your life, in an unforgiving world where your enemies aren't just soldiers and criminals, but also hunger, sickness, cold and even depression. It's too dangerous outside during the day, so you will spend the time building up your shelter and improving it with fancy amenities such as pallet beds, tin stoves and water filters. During the night, you'll step outside and scavenge the ruined city for food, ammo and resources to keep yourself and your group alive. But it's a war zone after all and everything seems to be in short supply. And winter is right around the corner. Throughout the city, you will meet other people who are in the same situation - deranged loners, vulnerable families, fiercely territorial traders, gun-toting bands of criminals, the military.As the pickings get slimmer by the day, you will have to make some hard choices. Sometimes those choices won't be clear. Sometimes you will have to take split-second decisions without fully understanding the situation and you will only know what really happened after the deed is done. Would you act against your principles and steal thy neighbour's food, dooming them to a slow, agonizing death? Would you share your scarce supplies to visit relief upon complete strangers?You are free to pursue any path you choose, at any time. You can barter and cooperate with friendly neighbours. You can isolate yourself and avoid contact with people outside of your group. You can hunt down criminals for awesome loot. And you can be ruled by your rumbling stomach, killing everyone you meet and stealing whatever you need. The game won't try to steer you in either direction. Every good deed and every line crossed, it's all on you. It's a matter of survival, after all. It's a bleak, unforgiving world out there, and it can really bring out the best - and the worst - in people. When the war is over, how will YOU be remembered? ...Besides the great concept, the game is very stable and offers good replay value, as you can have a different starting party, different characters may join your group and different locations will appear in the map in each playthrough. The interface is clear and intuitive, but it will require some reading and trial/error for you to master all the mechanics, since the game doesn't offer a tutorial. Frankly, I don't think it needs one - you will learn fast from your mistakes. Stealth is important, because death is usually sudden - and it's permanent. That is specially true for combat, as you will control only one character when you're out of your shelter. While it is possible to have full-blown shootouts, it's a very risky proposition against large groups (3+). A tactical, silent approach is preferred. Limited inventory space means you will have to make a few trips to the same location in order to pick them clean, so be ready to spend a good amount of time exploring and scavenging. Overall, This War of Mine offers an awesome (albeit a little short) experience for gamers who enjoy stealthy survival games with base management and a healthy dose of tactical combat. If that's your thing, I highly recommend this game.			"

												War. But it's not the war you're used to see. You don't see the soldier glorified. You don't get to shoot the enemies. It's the civilian aspect of the war. The game reminded me a bit of Don't Starve, it's technically 2D survival but with a hint of 3D. You get to select your characters, build your own base, try to defend your place from raiders aswell as loot, scavenge and upgrade your stuff. You beging with essentially nothing, and you need to scavenge in order to find loot. But it isn't that easy as you thought - you have a limited amount of space in your backpack, and have to choose if you're going to take materials or food. But you have to choose carefully, you'll always need something! This War of Mine is visually appealing, with a dark vibe and sad but calm music. It helps muild an atmospthere of tradegy and pain, what the civilians feel and how they are during war time. The houses are cut in half in a 2D-like doll house style, but moving the camera around reveals it has an aspect of 3D in it, not much, but enough to make it unique in my eyes. The soldiers are portrayed as horrible who the people do not trust when they don't know who they fight for anymore. How well the game runs; as far as I know, only problem I had was when I installed a workshop mod, but otherwise it runs smooth, constant 60fps or more, doesn't feel like it takes up much juice at all and I can easily multitask or play some other game at the same time. Computer includes 8GB ram, nvidia GTX 980 and an intel i5-4430 so it should be powerful enough to run whatever game too. Overall the game is hard, but it's definitely worth the praise. Would recommend.			"

This War of Mine is a point and click survival game. Let's start off with the gameplay.Gameplay is quite basic. It plays like your everyday point 'n click adventure game. You point and click where you want to go or what you want your selected character to do. You can control up to four characters and you switch between them by clicking on their portrait pictures. The entire game is played using only your mouse. You literally point 'n click till the end. So the core gameplay is pretty basic. The difficult part is making choices. It's basically a base building survival game. A bit of strategy is involved. You have to choose what to build, when to build. What to upgrade first if upgrade at all. At times people might ask you for favors. You can either choose to help them or not. You can even betray them. You can trade with other NPCs, rob them or even kill them. All this also affects your characters. They might get depressed, sad, cold...or get killed by other NPCs. Yes, your characters can get cold and die from frostbite. They can die from hunger, just leave the shelter or get gunned down.This might sound all too complicated but it really isn't. You will lose 1-2 party members in your first playthrough but after that you should understand how the game works and your 2nd playthrough should be alright...If not perfect. The game ain't actually hard.Now i said ""playthrough"" back there. There is no story. Don't let the game and people fool you. It's basically a glorified survival mode. There is no replay value here. It's true that i've played ""through"" it 4 times but just because i wanted to do a perfect run with the hardest settings (harsh winter, 80 days of survival).Every time you start a game it's pretty much the same thing. It's a survival mode. Nothing more. It's not a bad game. It's very fun, addicting and will keep you playing for at least 2 ""playthroughs"" or till you get a perfect run or get bored. I'd say it is worth the full price if you don't mind point 'click games but don't expect a deep story. There's none. You're just a civilian during a wartime who is trying to survive by looting junk and stealing from elderly people.Definitely a unique take on war but far from being a masterpiece people claim it to be. In it's core it's still just a simple survival mode.The game also uses cheap techniques to get you killed. People seem unarmed before they start shooting at you and that's very unfair. One of my characters died from frostbite when she was sleeping next to the furnace and it was +18 in the house. How the hell did she die from frostbite?! This is the reason I had to do 4 runs. I HAD to get a perfect run but the game used cheap tricks to get me killed. I never died 'cus the game was hard. The resource management is rather simple and straightforward.			"

												This War of Mine tells the story of a group of survivors in a 2.5D sidescroller at the last month of fictional war in a fictional country which feels so real that you might feel genuinly sad at moments. As a player you are presented with many options on how to survive through the conflict. One might take things by force from others, kill them or rob them and deal with moral consequences afterwards. Another might wish to stick to scavenging and avoiding conflicts, using the gained resources in trading with other survivors to get the much needed items. There is no right way as survival is paramount and war is presented with all its anarchy and cruelty. The choice is based on current situation and willingness of player to follow up on it. Managing your safehouse, resources and characters, deciding every night who should heal/rest, who should guard the house and who would be the one to go out to scavenge or trade provides constant dynamic environment of choice.Mechanics are thought through and hint deep realism of desperate situations - management of water, food, resource expenditure for most pressing issues is vital. As serious all of this might sound the game is fantastically fun as it presents every challenge with a solution and does not make player feel like doing chores, even thought that is what you are doing. The satisfaction of dealing with all the issues is immense and every little bit feels enjoyable - starting from a house full of rubble and thinking how to trap rats, cook food and stoke your boiler with firewood to eventually organizing a fortified safehouse with weapons and autonomous supply of resources and income of trade goods via scavenging.Game presents player with many random situations. Locations rotate from game to game (Diablo 1 quest style or most modern roguelike games) and have different events happening in them. As hospital being shelled in conflict between rebels and military (which you can hear about on crafted radio) giving player an opportunity to help refugees and either donate/trade or take for yourself medications found in the rubble. Almost every action has a moral consequence and characers react based on their background - rebel doesn't mind killing military personnel, former mathematician or lawyer rationalize every misdoing without losing morale, honest people go into depression after tragic events, etc. Visual aspect of the game is pleasant to say the least - pseudo-pencil drawning style with great animations and lighting effects, with slight issues appearing in specific locations due to line of sight. Mechanics are solid and entertaining, with many random factors affecting every playthrough, making gameplay extremely catchy and gravitating. And most importantly the choice and approach is fully in player's hands. Game presents player with difficult situation, how one chooses to go through it is completely up to him/her. 9/10			"

												Really unique theme and feel to this game.   You start off with three people hiding out in a ruined building with a war raging around them, and you have them craft during the day and go scavenging at night.  To me it feels like you're the cast of The Walking Dead except instead of zombies it's a war that's got you scrambling to survive.  Very fun and compelling, it's definitely got that ""one more turn"" feel that great games have and couples it with some choices you won't make in other games like ""these cigarettes I just rolled... do I let my group smoke them all or do I take them over to the bombed out hotel to trade them for rat meat?""    I can see how parts of it might get repetitive after a while, but most games do.  I'm finding it highly entertaining if a little bit depressing.  I definitely recommend it.Edit/Addition 16 hours in:  I've been asked if it's fun. It's ""fun"" like Schindler's List was fun. Ok... not exactly like that but it's dark, it's depressing, and sometimes your game ends by having your last surviving character reach a point where she just can't take it any more and slits her wrists. Is that ""fun?"" I don't know. But it's making me think like few games ever have, and for me that's an amazing experience.			"

												Marko died today. He was trying to scavenge on an old house where some people were trying to live. He was just looking for stuff that they didn't need like garbage. Nothing that was actually property. But somebody there got scared and fired a shotgun at him. This happened in the game and five hours later I am still thinking about it.  I have contemplated anger, anxiety (he was my scavenger how are the other guys going to survive?) and it even got into some serious questions. Marko had a life and a backstory, but in my gameplay he was just surviving, being no-one and nobody will remember him, just like all those people starving and homeless, just dying like dogs for no good reason. I want this game to be both successful and influential. I crave depth like today in games. This is such a powerful step in the right direction. Play this game and let the atmosphere get to you. Warning: it is very hard to process. I  need to take only small doses because of how hard it is to accept that stuff like this is reality for some people. But this game is making me go through ideas that no modern warfare game ever has.			"

												I figured I'd play this game a few times over, before I decided to post a review. After many rounds, I have to say I can fully recommend this game. The gameplay is really well done, hardly any bugs, and I love games that make me dream about what I should have, could have done. A few things about the game, the screenshots don't do the beauty of this game justice. The character animations are quite well done, I was often wondering why there wasn't an option to zoom in to see how much depth was put into the character's animations. When the game first came into my radar I figured that this game would be a neat concept, but a quickly put together point and click; this is far from the case.The replay ability is quite high, each run will have you wanting to try something new/different. The mood and music are perfect for this type of game.  Also I cannot say that the game has ever cheated me. I have had moments of the game where I got upset that events played out the way they did but I was at fault for the results.I'd also like to point out that there are constant interactions with characters during the game, which is really cool. It'll take a while to find out what I mean there but I won't spoil anything, but when I saw it I was like oh cool.A few things that I'll bicker about. The game is too easily exploited. I found out during a crash, yes it does crash from time to time ( though I think it's due to a skype issue), that each day can be cheated. I'd say this is a total con point, but some people will like it. . . others won't but hey you're only cheating yourself, in a game like this. I'd totally say that if you are on the fence to get This War of Mine. I had three other games I picked up before the came out and this is the only one I've been thinking about getting back to play, after work.			"

												On balance this really isn't a great game.  It DOES hook you in and you find that you have devoted some hours to what is really just boring monotony and after you've invsted tons of hours you are liable to suddenly find your characters quickly all die with little you can do about it.The graphics are basic, essentially you generally control 3+ cartoon like sprites and there is nothing else moving on screen, yet the game hogs CPU resources like you were playing Halo !  Just crazy.The major thing I didn't like about the game is that it appears to deliberately make life difficult for you.  Doesn't matter what decisions you make, the game will find a way to level you out.  It's like games like Oblivion where, when you finnaly get a God like sword and look forward to carving through swathes of monsters, you find the game has levelled up all the monsters so it's no different.  Very unrewarding.So here, if you have lots of timber and components and need cogs to make something, when you go out and scavenge you'll find tons more timber and components and sweet FA cogs.If your party has bandages but no meds, sure enough the characters will become sick leaving you stranded.  If you have meds but no bandages then sure enough, the house will be raided overnight and characters will be wounded and without bandages quickly deteriorate.The moral aspects of the game are a horrible element imo.  Just stupid.   If the scavenger does anything remotely ""bad"" the whole party gets depressed.  I mean you're surviving a war so stealing for example is highly likely to happen, but if you do it, expect the game to brutally punish you by dropping moral of the party.  Characters go from Sad, to Depressed to Broken pretty quickly and trying to recover that position once the juggernaut has started rolling is very difficult.  If you don't have books or armchairs or coffee, smokes etc then it's a quick decline.  The most stupid aspect is Broken status.  Your character won't do anything at all.  Will just stand or sit there and is useless from that point on, may as well be dead.In the final analysis it feels like you are just following the pre-programmed route for the game, you don't really have choices, though it creates the illusion that you do.  You have to play the way the game wants you to or it stuffs you.There are the basics of a good idea here, but as implemented it's just a time waster that deliberately skews the numbers against you to prolongue the play time.  You win if the game wants you to win.When you do finally win after all the hours and effort expended in monotnous repetitive actions, what do you get?  A black screen with 2 words in white . . .  ""You Survived"".Too much of the mechanics (resource management) doesn't make sense.  You have the ability to build rat traps (with the appropriate resources) but once you've built 2, the GAME doesn't let you build more !  No reason why the characters couldn't or shouldn't, they have the resources, but no, the game just says no, 2 is it, I'm removing the option after that point.  So, as I said, the game doesn't let you get ahead.  You don't really have choices.  You DO have to build a stove, a heater, a water distiller, beds etc.  No choice, you build them or die.  You can't inventively do anything, you can't out-think the game, you can't therefore experiment how you might survive in such a war.   You are merely playing numbers.  X timbers + Y components = item.  Item + something else = another item.  etc etc.   Always on the back foot, always fighting a game that won't let you get ahead.  It presents options for stealing and killing people, but if you do, the game punishes you.  Ultimately just silly.It is in the end a glorified time waster that doesn't reward at any stage.			"

												A great game but it's quite dark and depressing, you need to be in the right mood to play. Very well designed and challenging. Once you're on a good run it's very satisfying, then it all starts to go wrong... Someone gets sick, someone breaks in to your shelter while you're out scavenging for supplies so you return to a home with injured friends and missing items, you risk scavenging in a derelict building but a gang who take shelter there turn their guns on you, you run, hide, stab one in the back and shoot two more before escaping with some medical supplies and food. Now your character suffers from depression from killing those guys, so he needs consoling. There's often a lot to do to keep your team and home in good condition. It is tough, but a good game.			"

Recommended: The gameplay mechanics aren't anything to write home about, but the way the game uses tried-and-tested tools to tell your own gripping survival story is quite unique to This War of Mine.  It takes those well-proven and simplistic tools and elevates them with what it accomplishes with them.  It's probably not going to be your jive if you're more mechanics-focussed in your gaming preferences, but if you can enjoy a compelling survival story, This War of Mine delivers.  In spades.Read the full review here: https://www.highlandarrow.com/reviews/179-review-this-war-of-mine.html "

												Imagine FTL but instead of a ship you're given a shack. Your crewmembers are replaced with civilians who constantly get sad, hungry, and sick. They will also have crippling addictions to substances(coffee and cigarettes.) Instead of blowing up enemy ships and saving a Federation you're digging through trash piles and robbing other people's homes to find food, medicine, and scrap.  Also like FTL, any instance of person-to-person combat is awkward but gives you more stuff. It will also depress the hell out of your characters which is lovely, since morality of the things you do matter more.If you haven't played FTL, This War of Mine is about running around grabbing stuff and dealing with other sad, hungry humans  at night while trying to optimally manage the limited resources you're able to acquire during the day.Good little game to spend a few hours on and its perspective on war as depressed starving civilians is a nice different take  instead of the usual ""playing as a supersoldier"" archetype of most shooters. I recommend having some snacks handy while you play because of all the little prompts screaming ""HUNGRY"" on every character of every day will only increase your appetite as you progress.			"

TL;DRI highly recommend this game. The Style, Gameplay, and Decisions are superb.Style This game's visuel style is stunning. The mute colours and the slightly fuzed out parts of the screen indicating areas out of the characters line of sight overall lend themselfs to the atmosphere. GameplayThe game has a day and night cycle. Day time your inside your house were you can fortify it for protection, be involved with random events, produce items, and take care of your characters. Night time you can choose one of your characters to go out and hunt for items. You can choose which location they go to but there different risks and benefits along with threats.DecisionsThis game is brutal and pulls no punches. Let's say all four of your characters are exhausted from too many nights awake. They are becoming sad and unproductive. In desperation you let them all sleep through the night. Big mistake, your people get raided that night and the character with the most Backpack space (who you normally send out at night to collect supplies) gets injured. That would be fine but you gave the last of your pain meds to some kids who came to the door that day and you were planning on collecting bandages in a few days. You let the character rest during the day hoping for the best. When night falls you put one of your characters on watch afraid that you will be raided again. You send the another to a high risk location because you have already raided the low risk locations for meds. You let the last one and injured one sleep through the night. You don't find what you need and have to do this a couple of nights in a row. You alternate between the three uninjured characters but you pick the one character with the second highest Backpack space the most to go out at night. That character becomes so exhausted that their movement speed slows. They caught by a enemy and die. You now have three people; one who is very badly hurt at this point from lack of proper aids. You have no food and limited supplies. Do you risk someone else to get medical supplies or do you prioritize food? Your characters are sad and tired. If someone else dies your other characters will slip completely into depressed and become unresponsive.  Possibly killing themselfs. Overall:This game is beautiful in its design, Heart wrenching in its decisions, and savage in its gameplay. All of this stems from the games realistic portrayal of a Conflict zone from a civilian point of view.			"

												This game is not bad.  But it does get boring very fast once you get through for once.The game play lack randomness in the most significant parts.  You will soon remember who exactly will be at each location, and how they will response to your actions, what they have for sale if any.  You will know how many days you will need to survive and can start sitting on your stockage 10 days before that.  The snowing always lasts these many days and preceeded & tailed with fixed number of rather cold days.  You will even remember when it will turn cold in different presets.  Also, you will surely notice new crew comes exactly every X days.As you can see, you will soon know exactly what will happen and how you could handle it.  The lack of randomness make this game more of a planning game rather than a survival game.  As you can easily be sure of all your crews' survival from day 0.Edit 1/5/2015:People talk about my 35h game time and claim I should not vote down on a game I am willing to spent so much time on.  Here are my explainations on this:1. When I bought the game, it had already got famous in my circle of gamers and had overwhelmingly good ratings.  So when I felt the game was not as fun as I expected, I did not give up immediately.   Instead, I explored the game as much as possible to understand how everything is designed to be, so  I could be reasonable enough to my fellows on why I do not really like the game.For the same reason, I do not write review on game that I have not fully explored and understood.2. Hours does not mean everything.  The game is slow paced and takes more time than necessary by nature.  It lack a good mechanism of speeding things up.  You either give up all your left day time or keep waiting things out.  If there were a 2x or 4x accelerate button with event driven pauses, you would surely see a dramatically smaller number on my game record.  This also means I am bored from time to time during the game play so I could get the feel of archivement in the end.  I really do not think hours spent like this could be proof that I enjoyed the game.			"

												Truly original and inspiring game. If you want a kind of DayZ survival shooter game - it ISN'T for you. This is a game that is supposed you show you that you can't build a fortress and be self-sufficient in the middle of war. You'll be hungry, sick and depressed all the time. People will die, inlcuding you. Still, this game is very well executed and it makes a great experience. Made by true altruists for people who care about this stuff.			"

												This War of Mine sells itself mainly as a game about making emotional choices and following characters through a story, and it definitely is that. However, as a survival fan, I've found an incredible amount of replayability in this game that I would not have expected.If you are interested in the experience of war and the disturbing choices that you have to make to survive, you'll enjoy playing through this game multiple times with different ""parties"" of characters, each with their own personality.[cloud-4.steamusercontent.com] There's a nice sense of accomplishment in exploring all the locations on the map and making it through the 30-45 days that it takes to survive the war. (It varies by character group, meaning that each group of characters has a slightly different difficulty.)I figured that after I figured out how to survive in this game I would finish it and put it away. Not at all. I've been coming back to it quite frequently as a casual survival game. It's very well-balanced, and even once you figure out the mechanics of the game, it's still difficult to keep all of your characters healthy physically and mentally. If you don't, they don't get the happiest possible endings,[cloud-4.steamusercontent.com] and will also start to argue with each other or have trouble sleeping. I have tons of fun trying different crafting, scavenging, trading, and combat strategies, and still never kill innocent people in all my hours of playing. I'm slowly working on surviving with each combination of characters just for the satisfaction of getting a nice little ""survived"" badge on each one in the opening screen.With all of the different combinations of characters to start with, and randomization of the areas you explore, there's a nice balance of consistency and surprise. For example, in one game a hotel might be occupied by a well-armed gang who tortures people; in another, an eccentric guy lives there and will trade with you, and the rest of the building is abandoned. One of my pet peeves about the game is that you can only save at the beginning of each day (making it harder to save scum). However, this also makes it a good game to play in short bursts. You only need to use one hand for the mouse, which is nice. I've found it the ideal thing to play while watching Netflix shows I've already seen on my other monitor, etc. etc. So whether you want to get really emotionally involved in a first playthrough, or want a balanced survival game that will keep you interested for quite a while-♥♥♥♥♥♥ I have 89 hours somehow--definitely check this game out. You can also support an indie studio, and if you want, buy an extra DLC that adds cool graffiti to the game and supports a charity for children affected by war.tl;dr: do you want to scavenge for parts to make moonshine? shoot a deserting soldier and steal the food in his fridge? slowly die of depression and gunshot wounds after protecting your herb garden from midnight raiders? this is your game			"

												Having a great night getting more and more resources, come back to our small humble grotto, excited to distribute food and repair everything, realize I left everyone sleeping. All our stocked food is gone, supplies needed for upgrades are gone. Hopes for future survival dashed. It's great 10/10 would tear up again			"

												My house had just been destroyed by artillery shells. I ran into Pavle and Katia, and we decided to set up camp together in an abandoned house nearby. We had heard reports of other groups of scavengers stealing, looting, even killing. We swore we would be different.We were just trying to survive until the seige ended. Our goals were simple: find food, build a few things to make us more comfortable (beds, a stove), keep our hideout safe. We fixed up the house during the day, and at night one of us went out scavenging while the others tried to get some sleep. We traded for what we didn't have with the local priest, the owner of a garage nearby, a traveling peddler who showed up every few days. Mostly, we traded for food, and it wasn't cheap.We got raided by local bandits several times that first week. Sometimes, we fought them off. Other times, we weren't so lucky. I got a nasty gash in my leg from one of their blades, and was bedridden for several days. Pavle was furious. ""We need to fight back! It's not enough just to stay here and try to defend ourselves. Let's go take our supplies back!""That night, Pavle went to steal from the raiders. He didn't come back. Katia did not take it well. A few days later, a girl named Arica came by, looking for a place to lay low. Shorthanded, we welcomed her in.We had run out of food, and were low on supplies to trade for it. Arica had been living on the streets for several years, so she volunteered to go try to steal some food for us. We reluctantly agreed. She made it back that night emptyhanded; the bandits had discovered her and chased her away. The next night, she tried again, and failed again. I saw something change in her, but I wasn't thinking clearly enough to realize what was about to happen.On the following night, Arica returned limping and bleeding, with a backpack full of food. ""I killed him,"" she said in a soft voice. ""The man who ran the garage. He answered the door with a gun in his hand and I stabbed him in the arm. He got two shots off before I slit his throat."" Her voice broke, and she paused, collecting her thoughts. ""His father just sat on the ground and wept as I searched the house."" I was horrified. And yet, Anica had brought back enough food to last us a whole week. She had saved our lives, but at what cost?A wounded defector from the military came looking for a place to stay. Thinking that he might help protect us, we let him in. As it turned out, his wounds were more serious than they first appeared. Katia raided a hospital for medical supplies, but it was too late. He died within the week, as did Anica.Now, half the city is buried in snow, and it is growing even colder. I lack the strength to stand most days, and Katia just sits on the floor crying. We are running low on fuel for our stove, but I will not burn our books. They are the only bit of humanity we have left.			"

												Before I get into the details of this game, I would like to point out a few key things. You may or may not agree with me, but I will express my opinion on a few issues; you are entitled to your own. - FYI: Final Score is at the end -First, with the advent of 3D Shooter games and the phenomenal success of names such as Call of Duty and Halo, we as a culture have been led to believe that war is a glorified game, that there are black and white rights and wrongs and that the only lives that matter are our own. When I speak of the culture, I speak for the entire global gaming culture, not just the Americans, Europeans, Asians, etc. This is simply not the case. War affects everyone, mostly in a negative way. Can we as humans totally avoid war? No, unfortunately. But we can seek to minimize the negative effects it has on the innocent and the civilian population, as well as supporting our soldiers. Let me be clear, I do not condemn soldiers for serving their respective nations' interests and doing their duty; I condemn war itself as an ugly, sometimes necessary evil to be avoided wherever plausible.To return to the first point, popular FPS games have de-sensitized the culture to violence, especially violence against the innocent. This is why This War of Mine is absolutely phenomenal. It is more than just a game; it is a drama, a moral statement and a scream to draw people's attention to the horrors that victims in war-torn countries are facing every day. What's even better is that War Child, a charity that the developer 11bit Studios is teamed with, receives proceeds from every purchase of This War of Mine to help people in war-torn countries improve their lives. There's also a link directly to the War Child donation page on the game's main menu, should you decide to take action.I digress. Now for the part of this review that explains why this game is actually worth purchasing for gameplay value.- Overview - This War of Mine is a survival-strategy game that incorporates time and character management with item development. The game is point and click from a 2D cut-away perspective. This allows you to see for a certain distance until an obstacle such as a closed door or a wall blocks your line of sight, showing only a haze or a black fog. You begin the game in an abandoned house with a few freebie goods to start off with and 2-4 characters, depending on which story you choose to play.- World Interaction - Characters move to where you click, normal/sneak speed with one click and running speed with a double-click. Icons hover above interactable objects: a hand for lootables, open/close door, peek through to the other side of a door, etc. Some doors or cabinets will be locked and will require tools to open, or a door might be barred from one side. You will have to explore cautiously and keep track of time to survive and get a good haul each night.- Time System -Time moves rather quickly in this game, 10 game minutes elapses approximately every 3-4 seconds. Daytime lasts from about 7 AM to 8 PM. During this time, you are stuck inside your shelter due to snipers lining the streets. At night, 9 PM to 5 AM, you may choose a character and a location to scavenge for goods. Each character has a different amount of slots of items that they can take, the average number being 10. You can choose to bring tools or weapons along to help or unlock new routes, but that means that you cannot use those slots to bring something new back. The other characters will have to stay in the shelter, getting to sleep or stand guard for the night by your choice.-Characters and States - Characters have realistic needs and personalities. They will get hungry and need to be fed at least once a day to maintain optimal health. They may get injured or sick and will need to rest to heal, preferably in a bed. Depression is also a looming spectre if you choose to go the absolutely self-centered route (stealing, killing, robbing the hospital, etc.), especially if you have kind-hearted characters. Some characters have addictions and will consume items such as brewed coffee or cigarettes. Each one is unique and some have helpful attributes.- Improvements - You will need to construct everything from beds to gardens to water collectors in your shelter to survive and become more self-sufficient. Each improvement has its own cost in materials to build and will inform you the time needed to finish its construction. Stations, such as the workshop, that allow new items to be built can be upgraded, unlocking more designs for construction.- Music and Art - This War of Mine has a very dark, reflective soundtrack comprised of mostly clean electric guitar with strings accompanying. Some have noted that the music is repetitive; they are correct. As a guitar player myself, I do not mind so much and do not believe it is repetitive enough to cause anyone any unmanageable angst. The art style is equally as edgy. The game's colors are mostly greyscale or brown with a splash of subdued color here or there, usually red. The fog where your character cannot see is made mysterious by a soft, wavering pencil sketch effect. The mood is definitely one of depression and hardship. You can hear different music if a character plays a guitar (well) or if you turn on the radio to a punk rock or classical music station.- Winning -The game is concluded when you reach the randomly-generated ceasefire day. I've had games last from 25 days to 42, and I'm sure they could go shorter or longer.- Conclusion -I don't ever think I've spent a day of my life on something that's made me think about life and war so much. Most of us take a warm bed, three square meals a day and indoor heating for granted. I wholeheartedly recommend this war drama packaged as an enjoyable video game.Final Score: 10/10			"

												You play as a group of survivors living in their shelter.This game plays in a war in our modern world.To survive you have to be scavenging at night.You need some resources to build up your shelter and make weapons to protect yourself.Also you have to feed yourself and keep yourself healthy!I really enjoyed playing this game although it was quite depressive.When you steal someone's food for yourself to survive.They might die just like you.10/10+ Good art style+ Very realistic+ A nice simple crafting+ Game changing decisions+ Emotions+ Random generated world/loot and different starting parties+ Some characters have addictions- Sometimes it's so real it can be depressive!- Combat system is kinda strange "

												There are not many things to say about this masterpiece. It's a game that has its own personality, making it differ from the rest survival games. Depressing atmosphere in conjuction with simple but clever gameplay elements and beatiful soundtrack. There are some difficult choices that you don't face often in video games. Would you help an old couple by giving some of your food and medicine and making your members try to survive harder? Would you try to save a helpless girl from the hands of a dangerous armed man while you are empty handed? Tough choices that become even tougher since the death of a character is permanent.  Highly recommend it to those who want to experience the cruelty and the hardships of war in a different way than the other action games.			"

												It was Day 16 and Pavle had just been killed by a bandit while out scavenging the Supermarket. Back at home newly found companion, the escaped rebel Roman stood guard with our only shotgun while Bruno and Katia rested. Bruno was near death from a raid on our safe house. Katia was shattered mentally from having to kill an innocent man to get the bandages Bruno needed.Bruno died in his sleep over night. The next day, starving and exhausted both Katia and Roman huddled together. The newcomer tried to talk Katia out of her depression, begging her to get up and help him board the walls. That night Roman left her in bed while he slipped out to a nearby warehouse, knowing one more day without food would mean death for them both. When he returned, Katia was gone along with the reamining supplies. Another victim of the war. Her death a mystery, Roman spend his final day huddled in a ball. He had only known these survivors for three days, and now they were all gone. Just like his friends in the rebellion, there was nothing Roman could do to save them. That night he killed himself.♥♥♥♥ THE WAR!			"

This War of Mine 
A Screenshot of This War of Mine
By: Snowfox




Tags: Survival, War, Atmospheric, Simulation, Singleplayer, Strategy, Crafting, indie, Choices Matter, Adventure, Stealth, 2D, Post-apocalyptic, Side Scroller, Difficult, Point & Click, Open World, 2.5D, Platformer, Rogue-like.Overview (sorry for the weird organization, I'm lazy)Being 2D, this game can accomplish things much more easily than 3D games can. This War of Mine is very accessible; character’s actions are controlled by a simple click of your mouse and screen adjustment by using the scroll wheel to zoom in and out and the mouse to position the camera (by dragging the cursor to the edges to move the camera up, down, left, right).A micromanager’s dream. Starting out with 3 people, you are tasked with keeping them well fed, healthy, happy, well slept, and safe from bandit attacks. Any one of these variables, if left unchecked, can lead to the death of a person in your care. The constant need of each of your survivors forces you to manage our resources wisely. I found food to be my biggest struggle.Each playthrough will be different. When you start anew, characters and environments will be randomized. Included in this randomization are characters that come to your front door. In search of shelter, help, or trade (they can have some very useful items).The characters are detailed; each has his/her own traits. Some characters are good at coking, others excel at running, some are good at bartering, and there are even characters who can help keep your civilians happy by boosting morale. The latter character trait is invaluable for keeping your group from spiraling into depression.Simple questions can force you to really think about what the consequences would be and if the cost is worth it. In many areas that you can visit to scavenge for materials, there are people just like you, trying their best to survive with what little food and other supplies they have. Will you steal the food from them or will you look in another, less occupied place in hopes of finding food? There are only so many abandoned areas, so you will eventually be forced to steal some rations from your next door neighbors or try your luck in more dangerous areas.Varied resources with in-depth crafting system. There are 8 workshops you can create that help you generate resources.  They are as follows: stove, garden, herbal workshop, moonshine still, alcohol distiller, metal workshop, animal trap, and rainwater collector.   For example, with the metal workshop you can make the crowbar, knife, lock pick, and many other useful tools by using weapon parts and scrap. These tools are a necessity to scavenge through the places that you visit at night.After the day cycle is over, the night comes upon you and you can choose to send one of your survivors out to scavenge nearby locations. In these areas there are valuable materials such as weapon parts, food, and medical supplies. Backpack size determines how much a person can carry back from scavenging. Most characters have a backpack size of 10-12. There are unoccupied areas, which require no caution, and also occupied areas where you will have to be careful what you take. When you aggravate people in an area (stealing valuables or attacking people), each time you go back to that area at night they will remember what you did. They will sometimes shoot on sight or give verbal warnings telling you to leave. This is where stealth becomes vital. There are also naturally dangerous areas occupied by soldiers and snipers. Previously unoccupied areas may become occupied by survivors such as yourself, looking for shelter.When snow comes, several things change. Most notably, the temperature drops to bone-chilling levels. It is advised to build multiple heaters and upgrade your existing ones to provide for the most efficient heating. You cannot collect water using conventional methods any longer. Instead, you have to go outside and collect snow, which can be melted and purified by using the stove.The Child Charity DLC is a great way to contribute toward a worthy cause and will unlock an extra achievement (but you would buy the DLC to support the children and not just for an achievement, right?).SummaryThis game left a lasting impression, and for good reason. This War of Mine does an excellent job of simulating war and the horrible things that come with it. I applaud the developers for making such an engaging game that brings to light the things in war usually not covered. This game now has a permanent spot on my favorites list and I will definitely play it again after my second, more successful play through.My implemented rating system:Run away! 1-2/10Handle with caution… 3-4/10Buy on sale: 5-6/10Every day purchase: 7-8/10Must buy: 9-10/10This game’s rating: 9/10. If you like simulation games, you will not regret picking this game up. "

												This is an exceptionally good game, and the devs would still continue to add more content and balance some of the game out. The game plays in an ant farm view with pencil line filters. You control 3 survivors of a war torn city, and it's your job to keep them alive. Every day you're faced with moral choices - those are the realities of war.If you've played 'Rebuild' on iOS - an almost similar game set in a zombie infested world. There you're tasks to survive, rebuild your camp, while fighting zombies. If you love that, you'll probably love this too.			"

												What should i say about ""This war of mine""?Its a good game. You control a few civilians in a war raged city, survivors of bombardments, crimes and a lot of attrocities. Your goal is to keep your civilians alive while the war is running or until a ceasefire.Your situation is dire, city running low on food, medicine, ""winter is coming"", raiders and armed looters taking of the life of others, desperate times what really could happen anytime with us as we can never forecast future. There were allways war and there will be wars until the end of mankind.You need to handle sickness of your survivors, battle wounds, beat the hunger, the cold and eventually the sickness of the soul.Most of your survivor have a special ability, an exsoldier is good in fight, other one, a prewar engineer could require less materials for items and some better in running or scavenging, various abilities what you need to profit from if you want to stay alive until the arrival of the peacekeeper forces.The game isnt easy, its challenging, you'll never have enough resources and you will have allways hard decisions.Will you scavenge ammo or weapons at the time when raiders invading homes on daily basis or you will go for medicine for your sick party member?The decision is yours, but there are no good decisions! So now stop reading and try to survive, you will fail before you will win but then the win will be even sweeter:-)			"

												So. Yet another survival game eh? No. Not just another survival simulation. This War of Mine takes a different approach to the survival genre, TWoM tries to convey the psychological aspect of living in a war ravaged city, you still need to collect resources, upgrade things and do all those fun OCD like things you love in this type of game, but it has a very real effect on the characters well being. Listening to a baby cry while you break down a door and steal a families food. This type of thing has an effect on your average person, and so it does in This War of Mine.Your little band of survivors still get hungry, hurt, ill and so on, but now their actions affect group moral too. For example, i sent Katia out to do some essential looting, food, since they were all starving, so she begins looting a small house. The house belonged to an old couple who pleaded me not to rob them, but having little choice, i did so anyway, leaving a little for them. Katia returned that night and felt bad for robbing them, a couple of others felt the same way, whilst the rest thought it was a necessary evil. However 2 weeks of ingame time later, i returned to the house, due to desperate need, only to find the occupants now dead. Actually, Katia found them. So now she's feeling sad and depressed. Sleeping a lot. She blames herself for their deaths? (...Is that a twinge of empathy for a computer game character i just felt?)This game is good at eliciting emotional responses from you. If you let it. I suggest you do, it's great at drawing you in and is more than a game, it's an experience. Excuse me, must go check and make sure Katia hasn't done anything silly. Yep. that's in there too.			"

												First thoughts.I'm just after first run. I survived just 16 days, but I'm quite sure that I'll do better next time and next time...and probably I'll surivive the war after some attempts.I was quite sceptic about this game. I heard a lot of good things, but I had also many doubts...and even with current discount it's quite high price tag like for my standards[hello P(r)oland], but after those few hours of gameplay I don't regret it at all. Frankly speaking I see no reason why this game should be any cheaper in the nearest future, it's simply awesome and worth this price tag for sure.about the game: it's kind of sims you know...start with 3 folks and have to make them happy...but there is a war so you don't try to make them happy, you try to make them alive. There is a lot of possibilities,  a lot of varibles, I think that replayability should be good and not only becouse you fail.""the feelings can't avoid you""I detonated nuke in Fallout 3 with smile on my face, but here when I was stealing some goods from pair of old people (for sure they haven't easier times than my crew) and some granddaddy beg me to not take their things as it's all they have...or at least to not hurt his ill wife...well, I was touched. I guess you need to suffer yourself to understand suffering of others and this game make it.			"

												Everyone is knew what is war, as we ever seen on tv, movie, or history books. But what we saw or read is just a small parts of what war is.I'm pretty sure all of us is only knew war based on the troops, or even national hero side of view, how they reach their victory, how the manager their own strategies for victory, or everything that make them become known and remembered.But, ever you saw the war from the victims side of view ? How they survive, how they eat, how they sleep, how they chat each other, or anything else when the war is happened on their country ?This game is provide us how if we becoming them, getting a resource to build a shelter, seeking a food from the trash can, stealing from the elder, killing another victims to get what they have, helping a your friend to make a shelter, or even kill their enemies, trade your medicine for just getting a small ammounts of foods and everything you have to do to survive.So, you think if you run out of stocks you can kill people easily ? Nope, it will ruin your mental, you will be depressed or even you will suicide after you kill some people.How long you will survived ? Make your own story, your own group, your own shelter, your own strategies to survive, and your own hand to kill and steal.			"

												This game made me question who I am as a person. Aside from Spec Ops: The Line, I can't think of many games that had the power to do that. This game is essentially the polar opposite of the traditional FPS power fantasy. It forces you into the perspectives of bystanders, civilians just trying to survive in a combat zone. If the characters under your control die, there is no ""respawn."" They DIE, because you, the player, screwed up.Is this game fun? No, but that's ok, because it's not trying to be. War is hell, after all. BUT, it is engaging as hell. You find yourself wanting to progress through it just to see what scenarios the game puts you in next. If you're desperate, are you willing to steal things, kill innocent  people, for cans of food, a bag of sugar, a drop of water?In essence, so long as you go into this game looking not for fun, but an experience that makes you question things (most of all, yourself as a person), you will come out of it satisfied.

												8/10Definitely worth buying. It has simple mechanics that make the game easy to play, and let you dive in its immersive atmosphere. You will really feel guilty for... well, I'll not spoiler, just keep in mind you'll receive a few blow in your stomach the first time you'll play this game (and not only the first time, probably).Combat, which is supposed to be a secondary aspect of the game, is a bit rough and personally I have still difficulties with its dynamics - anyway you can complete the game even without a single combat situation.I recommend to purchase the game with the DLC; 1 euro given to the war childs, those remained orphans. Do that.Note: not incredible replay value here. You can go through the game for a while, but probably you'll not go past the 20 hours threshold (which is not bad, after all).			"

												This is a ROGUE-LIKE game. I actually didnt know this. I'm not a fan of that genre, but those who are will enjoy it, and therefore i will recommend it to them. It's a small game, few locations you fast travel to, once there you can loot or trade, you fast travel back, the day ends. You point and click into building the few things you need to keep your team alive. They will die inevitably. And you will start over, and over. Nice visuals, game's based on strategic building, resource management and luck. That's it. If you're into Rogue-likes it's a small game you might enjoy fiddling around with.  "

												Very depressing. This game will make you feel like garbage yet it is one of the best ""games"" I have ever played.There is no game out there, book, or movie that will make you feel as desparate as this game can make you feel. It truly is a war time simulator from the civil prespective.I am heavily invovled in politics, especially in regards to the conflict in Ukraine. This game, while more or less influenced by events in Sarajevo highlights much of what is happening in Ukraine as well. You are emerged into the suffering. You gain much more of an  understanding of what its like to be a civilian in war zone than you ever could without actually being a civilian in a war zone by playing this game.Highly recommend it!Warning though. You will not feel good after playing this game, but you will be enlightened and it will change your perception of war forever.			"

												This game is bloody awesome!I was not too sure what to expect but after reading so many good reviews, I just had to try it.Full of atmosphere, tugs at your emotional heart strings, and I found myself craving for the next night time mission, but when it came, I was scared to go because I knew how important the success of the mission would be.  Until you play, you won't understand.Staying detached from ones characters is near impossible, and when they die it feels like your own survival is coming to an end, but a new character turns up, and spirits are lifted.  But during the night you get raided, someone gets killed and your supplies are stolen!  There are not many high points in this game, but its addictive as hell, and if you suffer from depression, don't play this game!			"

												Amazing game. worth 40 dollars not 20. Its not big on combat but it doesnt matter, its not the point of the game. The point is put yourself in the shoes of others which go through these kinds of things. Sitting in my computer chair, with a mug of coffee nice and safe and wam really made me think hard about this game and made me sad at a few points. when two of my friends were severly wounded, i sent my worst scavanger out to get banadages in a last ditch attempt to save their lives. I found some in a very dangerous place, exactly what i needed, i nearly made it out when i was discovered and shot. Bruno died to save his friends.:( ♥♥♥♥ing 10/10. im entralled, captivated and upset at the same time. can wait to play more.			"

												I've played this a lot in a short space of time, and it really has its hooks into me.  The game is very atmospheric, with a great art style and ambience and provides a unique slant on the horror survival genre.  I don't think I have ever cared about NPCs in a game before as much as I have with this game, it really makes you question and live with the decisions that you make.  Sneaking around discovering and interacting with other people who are trying to survive is good fun, if war can be fun I suppose, and the combat that I have seen so far is challenging if a little basic.  Maybe one or two special moves (kicking someones knee out, an elbow to the face etc, I'm not talking Street Fighter 2!) might add a little to the combat.There are reportedly one or two bugs but I have seen none so far.  I will be sinking many more hours into this game and I would totally recommend this game to my friends.  9/10.			"

												I honestly don't know how i feel about this game....I loved it, everything gets harder and harder, characters have emotions and can eventually turn into a wreck if they cause too much ""unhuman"" things...Like murderer or stealing from people that'll probably die, because of your actions. Same thing can happen If one of their friends gets killed.If they become a total wreck, they will just sit whole day in a chair  and player cannot use them (Interactions between characters helps to calm these things down) , they can also leave your base during the night...There are all sorts of things that can happen during the days, soldiers might be storm the city (which makes lots of places unavailable to loot, cus soldiers are there - obviously)Winter - Can't catch rain water, need to keep your place warmThere's probably even more, but these are the 2 I came across.However, the way the nightcycle works kinda dissapointed me...You pick ONLY ONE person to go Scavenging and the remaining people (Which is 3 cus the max is 4 as far as i can tell) can be chosen an action to perform during the night (Sleep, Guard).. You play as the single character and you're trying to get resources you need from a location you picked.I love the whole thing about looking thru keyholes, sneaking, hiding in shadows...But the combat is pretty bad (fyi - if you manage to get someones attention and hide in a shadow, you might aswell clear entire building full of 6 heavily armed guards - yes shadows are OP)When you come back home, you get a report- What happened during the night- Was Anything stolen?- Was anyone hurt?- How much ammo (if you have) did we use to scare looters away- How much loot did you bringI didn't even get a chance to loot every buidling in town, nor I maxed out my base or upgraded my stuff to make advanced things....And all of a sudden, Day 42, The War Is OVER - You've survived.No, It won't let you continue playing. You have to start from the beggining...Which was pretty annoying considering I havent been to most of the building on the map.Don't get me wrong, the game is fun a lot of fun...You probably won't make it on the 1st-3rd time anyways..It's gonna take you a lot of time, but then again...I played this for 2 hours and then bought it thinking ""This is gonna be a long run game"" and finished it in 5 hours...If you like these kinds of games.. Go for itIf you don't wanna spend your money for what could be a short gaming experience - don'tI also wouldn't recommend you this game, If you're a type of player that doesn't like when this are repetitive, this game as a whole is very repetitive.

Game Visual/AudioThere isn't much can be said about the game's visuals asides from that they're minimalistic. Pretty much the same thing can be said about the game's audio. The visual and audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu.Gameplay""This War of Mine"" from the developer 11 Bit Studios. It places, the players, into a position that they never thought to find themselves in. 'In war, not everyone is a soldier;' a civilian in a war torn country.Simulates what its like to be a civilian to be trapped in a war torn country. Survival becomes very critical because there's danger lurking at every turn. Everyday resources become ones' prized possession. As crimes runs rampant, the rule of logic and order, no longer exists.There are plenty of pre-generated events for the players to choose from. The players can even create their own events and shared them with other players.Morality is heavily present in the game. This gives the players a freewill to choose whether they want to be a good person and help out or a bad person and not help out. The choices that the players makes it can have either a positive or negative influence on the civilians.There are multiple endings to this game it's heavily affected by the players' morality and the course of action they've decide to take.There's a downloadable content called ""War Child Charity."" It features various artwork from various graffiti artists. These artworks are scattered throughout game for the players to find them. They are to reflect the condition of civilians in war torn countries. [Please do note that there are different pricing for this downloadable content but they all have the same content. It depends on how much you want to spend on the downloadable content. It's a charity donation.]There are twenty-two different achievements can be earned from the game. Each of these achievements has certain requirements to completed before they can be obtained.MiscellaneousThere are total of six different trading cards. You only get the three of those cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam's Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and it's Booster Pack Creator.Final thoughts, I felt that this is a really great game to play and enjoy, it can really draws you into wanting more out of the game. As for the game's replay value it's definitely high. I would recommend this game but not at the full price. "

												This War of Mine is a fantasticall polished, emotionally compelling game.  My buddy called is the perfect combination of Day Z and Don't Starve.  I just think it is beautiful and morose and really brings out, what I would imagine would be, the uniques feelings around trying to survive in a situation like this.  It asks you what you would be willing to do to live or to save your friend, and then allows you to react, emotionally, to those decions (which can be brutal, at time).  It is a brilliant game with well thought-out mechanics, a beautiful art-style, and fnatastic soundscape.  I wholeheartedly recommend this game without reservation.			"

												While survival sims seem to be all the rage these days, ""This War of Mine"" puts you in the role of a few simple civilians as opposed to some elite batch of superheroes.  Further, there are no zombies...rather, you'll be facing off against a force that has besieged your city.  During the day you'll be limited by the watchful eye of enemy snipers, but at night you'll be able to scrounge for food, medicine, and other goodies that your group will need to survive. This game may very well be the next survival sim that will hog my monitor for weeks on end.

This ""little"" title is amazing and will be living in my ""Favourites"" list for some time. A base-building, loot-driven survival game played from a cross-sectional 2.5D view-point with character perma-death! How addictive can it get? A whole heap apparently...PROS Challenging and rewarding. This title holds your hand just enough to keep you oblivious to the foot its about to put up your♥♥♥♥♥♥ Interesting crafting and loot trading systems, Your choices and actions have repercussions on your groups morale, The threat of raiders, starvation, hypothermia, depression and in-fighting are ever present and add to the knife-edge nature of the gameplay, An interesting a gritty fully realised game world, Excellent graphics and art style, Great locations and lots of choice,CONS Gameplay eating mechanics can become a little repetative, Charater selection and camera panning could be better optimised, and......I can't really think of anything else... because this game is pretty awesome,CONCLUSIONS...This title is fun, challening, and addictive, with so many great mechanics co-existing and working together seamlessly. The truely exceptional aspect of this title however is the emotional impacts your actions have on the characters within your group as you struggle to help them survive in a civil war-torn city.

With the threat of your favourite looting characters perma-death, or the slow unstoppable demise of your groups morale, which in-turn effects thier ability to undertake tasks and eventually thier mental and physical health, this title achives an ever-present tension in a very unique way.If your a fan of survival games, loot games, base defense games or all of the above, YOU NEED TO PLAY THIS GAME!_______________________RANKING DESCRIPTIONS  Score Description   1 This pile of c%$p made me want to take a break from gaming!   2 Avoid this title like a fat man on a diet avoids cake.   3 Why did they even bother? Oh wait...they didn't, so niether should you.   4 I wouldn't play this unless I was really, really desperate, or the biggest fan alive.   5 While there are some interesting aspects of this title, there are just too many faults to recommend it to anyone.   6 An ""average"" title which has some redeeming qualities, however, be warned that it also has its fair share of flaws...   7 A good game and it probably shouldn't be missed by fans of the series or genre, but be warned there are better games out there which are more deserving of your time and money.   8 An excellent title which shouldn't be missed if you can help it. I found it hard to put this game down, and I hope you do too.   9 A master piece! As close to perfect as any title can get. You are truly missing out on an unbelievable gaming experience if you do not play this game.   10 PERFECT. Nothing more needs to be said All ratings and opinions expressed in this review are subjective, and therefore are effected in part by my own preferences & predisposiitons. I have not received any gifts or gratuities froma any party for this work. "

												While the game has a very sad tone and can be difficult, it is very good.  I wasn't sure about it at first, it is difficult to figure some things out and there is not way to restore back to an early save, you just have to try things out and deal with the consequences.  That, however, really makes the game compelling.  It is challenging and interesting to try different tactics and methods to survive.  I've greatly enjoyed playing it over and over and when you finally make it to the end successfully, it is both rewarding and a bit uplifting.   I highly recommend this game.			"

												This game is without question, one of the hardest games I have ever played in my life. Not due to difficulty spikes though the game does have its fair share of those but rather its one of the hardest games I've ever played due to the overall soul crushing tone this game has. More than multiple times I had to stop playing as I felt my willpower and strength drain away watching my survivors slowly dying as joy and hope turned to ruin much like their own surroundings.You play as 3 survivors in a half destroyed building during a fictional war somewhere most likely in Europe for a good 4 to 6 weeks trying to survive. Each survivor has their own unique use to the player such as better cooking, trading skills, to playing the guitar, or in one survior's case being good with children which isnt all that useful. This works well for realism of this game as not everyone you come across is going to be helpful to you much like in real life and really sinks in the fact that at the end of the day these are normal people who are not really prepared for the brutality of war.After you start your game with your 3 survivors there are no tutorials for what you are to do which would be a negative save for the icons for all your actions are rather easy to figure out. You start breaking down rubble and locks on your doors to get to cabinets and dressers which may have useful materials,parts, food, medicine, or ammo all of which are nessessary to survive. The real challenge in the game is proper management of resources. Do you burn a book for fuel for a heater? Do you build a patch in the wall now or save your supplies for an useful upgrade? Do you trade your last bandages for some food so you dont starve? Not every choice is gonna have a clear answer and what may pay off in the short term can and will mess you up down the line.Another challenge is nighttime the second part of the game where one survivor must venture out to the bombed out city and scavenge for supplies. The very beginning areas are generous but eventually you're gonna have to go to hostile areas and attack bandits, soldiers, and rebels. It is best to avoid all combat when you can not because of the combat mechanics they are simple and work fine. It's more so most of your survivors are not soldiers they are civilians fighting more than one person at a time will more than likely end in your death especially if they have guns.The final challenge is morality as this game will test everything you believe in and push them to its limits. I was astonished at how quickly my willpower faded within the first few weeks of playing. Within one week I had debated robbing an old couples house, killing everyone in the church, killed a vicious psychopath, gave away life saving medicine to a bunch of kids, prevented a soldier from♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥a woman, and nearly died raiding a sniper junction. This game is going to hurt you if you are the kind of person who gets emotional playing video games. You have to go in knowing full well everyone you are playing as is more than likely going to die and that all of your best efforts are going to be for nothing. There is no quick save either so no restarting if you didn't like how recent events turned out. The game benefits from this though as a quick save would've ruined all immersion with the game. This is one of those 'Live and learn"" games where you'll have to learn from previous mistakes as it is unlikely to be able to a complete playthrough on the first try. However there is a beauty in this game, its art direction looks serene with pencil drawn monochromatic color scheme fitting the tone well and simple music in the background adding to the overall atmosphere. Your survivors have their own backstories and even multiple endings depending on if they survive, overall happiness, or if they died either by the winter, lack of food, or if they take their own life.Ultimately i only have one issue with the game and that is taking only one survivor to scavenge at night. Everything else is close to perfection. I give the game 4.5 out of 5 and recommend this to everyone interested in the intial premise. If you can handle the depressing tone and heavy consequences This War Of Mine offers then it deserves a spot in your library.			"

I say simplistic because it's obviously point-n-click combat, but it's still really satisfying getting kills.Even though killing (unless bandit, militia or military) causes sadness/depression.But no worries, you can distill some moonshine to bolster spirits.

												This game is absolutely amazing.  It's so ♥♥♥♥ed up but so beautiful at the same time.  You're a survivor in a war stricken city and have to make decisions that can affect your group's mentality but can help your well being.  One huge mistake can lead to your demise.  One misstep while scavenging can lead to you getting shot up by raiders/rebels/soldiers.You have to figure out how to use your resources correctly.  You're sick but also starving in your group, what sacrafices do you make to eat or buy medicine?  How will you get your group out of suicidial despression?  This game is ♥♥♥♥ed up, but beautiful.  There's no other way to put it.			"

												First play through below (skip to the bottom for the critic of the game).Promising start to my life in a war torn town. Food, shelter, beds and warmth. What more could you ask for?Scavenged around buildings, only took what we need. Life was good considering.We helped our neighbours out and in return they helped us. Then we were raided during the night, in which the two girls of the group were gravely injured. They lay in bed while the other two survivors picked up the slack, hoping to run into bandages to cure their fatal cuts. After two nights of no luck, sent one of the injured to a near by hospital - they bandaged her up and so she decided to help in return. She searched the rubbled for potential lost medical supplies and she found some!She went to hand it in to the doctor who has helped her so many times... and then she started getting called a ***** by the guard. The guard proceeded to blast her head off with a shotgun.Down to three, drastic measures might have to be taken. A survivor travelled to the nearby church in lue of some aid only to find the priest shot down by a bandit. Rightly so, the survivor murdered said bandit with a shovel and aquired a gun. Searched the area for bandages, none to be found! He tip toed through the dark to a neighbouring building, only to be spotted by a bandit and chased. As the bandit closed in he shot the bandit twice in the chest... and paused, thinking that was all the death that would come of that night. He slowly crawled away beaten from this ordeal and promptly recieved a shot in the back by another bandit.Back at base, the female survivor is in and out of conciousness. Her companion, the chef, having to feed her and keep the place warm. After realising the other scavenger has not come back, he goes to seek revenge - taking down the last of the bandits and aquiring some more guns. No bandages to be seen to save his last friend.So the next night he goes to a hotel, praying the tradesmen have stashed medical supplies somewhere near. In his depressed state he slaugthers them all in a gruesome battle of guns, barely making it out alive himself. Yet - no bandages to be found.He travels home to find his friend has died of her wounds... Proceeds to drink some moonshine at 8am in the morning when there is a knock at the door. Two girls asking for medical supplies. The chef slams the door in their face and promptly heads downstairs to find some rope.Game over.Critic of the game follows:Great game and I feel I have barely scratched the surface at 7 hours. You seem to gain a huge sense of attachment to your crew. Lot's of sneaking about to get your needed supplies and building your shelter. However, there is a small amount of storyline to it - however I have never survived long enough to find it :P If you have the cash, and liked the trailer, get the game. You won't regret it!Post 24 hours of play: After playing this game for such a long time there is no way I would change my recommendation. I managed to complete all the achievements (for those achievement nutters out there, this game is easily completable) and found most of the different variations to buildings. Sadly I have uninstalled the game - for now - because I cannot handle anymore depression from it. Hope you guys have as much fun in this game as I do!Although the game is challenging, once you understand how the AI works you can easily take any level down in one or two attempts. However, there is always the risk that you end up loosing one of your crew - go in prepared.  Potential Spoiler Screenshot (my last run through)  "

												I bought this game blind, and I completely do not regret. Cruelty of war, misery, human side of a conflict. This game is an artistic bomb that could affect your hearts. Maybe I'm excessive, or maybe you are insensible. Anyway, the choice is yours, and I'll tell you why.This War of Mine is a survival adventure, your characters are civils in a besieged city. You need to scavenge to live another day, and needs are too many: hunger, sleep, mood, infected wounds, sickness....You start in a refugee, playing 3 characters with their own bio, and a special skill. Those characters are random every time you play, giving you different beginnings. On day, you stay in your own refugee, trying to build a better home with beds, chairs, radio, workbenches. They can be updated to build items like shovels, crowbars, food, weapons... Everything seems necessary to survive, but you should ration all of it.At night, you need to farm things, because bombs have ceased. And here is when true war starts. Different places, randomly unlocked, maybe inhabited, and maybe by monsters. Nor zombies, nor aliens, but humans. Mercenaries ready to kill on sight, soldiers patroling, other hostile scavengers. Will you kill them? Think twice. Will you go back home? In that case, maybe tomorrow nobody can eat.Or maybe you are too lucky, and there's nobody in, or there are just other people asking for help. You are free to choose, but do it carefully. This is a game about humans that never have grabbed a weapon (mostly). Don't be a monster, or it will take its toll.Anyway, next morning will tell. Depression is around the corner everytime.Can't say anything else. Play it, enjoy it, because this is a masterpiece.			"

												ENG\RUSExciting game, the main advantage of which, in my opinion, is randomly spread stuff, filling locations, events, in general, random is the main driving force of the game :) Even when it seems that the game becomes boring and monotonous - bam! and there is something interesting, something radically changing the course of life is happening. One more absolute advantage is the atmosphere of the game: the stories of heroes about their pre-war lives, their thoughts about what is happening and hope for the best, or vice versa - experiences, depressions and frustrations. Everything looks very harmonious and logical. Characters react to each player's choice, on events happening around and accidents, experience food shortages or cigarettes if they need them, sympathize with each other - in a word, sometimes it could be rather difficult to break away from the game :) I am waiting for some new characters, new events and locations, and I hope that the developers will increase the level of complexity, because, despite the seemingly large number of the difficulties faced by the heroes, this game is not hardcore at all, so I want it to be more challenging :D9\10, I recommend this game to everyone, I am sure that you will enjoy it :)P.S. sorry for mistakes if there are any-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Захватывающая игра, главным плюсом которой, на мой взгляд, является рандомный разброс вещей, наполнение локаций, события, в общем, рандом - главная движущая сила игры :) Даже когда кажется, что игра становится скучноватой и однообразной - бац! и происходит что-нибудь интересное, что-нибудь кардинально меняющее привычный быт и задачи. Безусловным достоинством является и атмосфера игры: рассказы героев о своей довоенной жизни, их мысли о происходящем и надежды на лучшее, или же наоборот - переживания, депрессии и расстройства. Все смотрится очень гармонично и логично. Персонажи реагируют на каждый выбор игрока, на происходящие вокруг события и проишествия, переживают нехватку еды или сигарет, если они в таковых нуждаются, сочувствуют друг другу - одним словом, оторваться от игры бывает довольно сложно :) Жду от разработчиков новый персонажей, новые события и локации, а также не помешало бы некоторое увеличение уровня сложности, ибо, несмотря на казалось бы большое количество трудностей, с которыми сталкиваются герои, особой хардкорности у этой игры нет, а хотелось бы :D9\10, рекомендую всем :)			"

Posted: July 27, 2015
												I was lured in by the hype and massive amount of positive reviews, but ended up being seriously disappointed in the game. It looks like those many thousands of positive reviews are there mainly for the –message- the game sends, not the gameplay itself. Even the most helpful review listed for this game is just a few sentences poking at how depressive the game is, not an actual review. The first thing I noticed about this game was it looked like a direct clone of another steam game called –Deadlight- with a smidgen of resource gathering/management from another game called-deadly 30-. Both of those games are also side scrollers, I’m pretty sure a Dev or two for this game pulled ideas from those two and or others to make this one.Other reviews say the graphics are good for this game, but Deadlights is much better in my opinion for a post apoc game and it came out years ago and Deadlight has more scenes/scenarios while this game is confined to destroyed buildings. ****Spoiler warning*****  Here’s a list of things I came across while playing this game that are head scratchers or just don’t make any sense.The survivors know how to make a radio, but no one has the skills to make crude weapons to defend themselves from early raids while you are cleaning out your shelter. The survivors need to collect materials to make a workshop to make crude weapons. Soooo the survivors have the skills to make a workshop, but can’t make simple crude weapons until they can build a workshop. Wait..What?All the survivors start out with nothing but their empty backpacks. HmmmI guess the player is supposed to assume either all of your survivors were caught off guard by an attack somewhere else, but they only managed to grab their “empty” backpacks or all your survivors were caught by bandits as a group and all their belongings were taken nearby, though the bandits let them go free until they reached the shelter. But this conflicts with an early first encounter.A First early encounter at the shelter immediately followed with a groan from me. A Knock on door asking for help to carry an injured person home from being shot by a sniper. Sorry to hear that, but no I can’t help you at this time, I don’t know you and this could be a trap.Ohh but wait, after you decline to help you’re told this was your “neighbor”. Oook, how did I the player know you were my neighbor? But wait, didn’t you as the survivors just find this place as a shelter? How is this person your neighbor if you just arrived with not even so much as a 2x4, knife or scrap of food on any of you? ughObservation - During play, no survivor is strong enough to lift a table/chair or knock over a damaged wooden dresser and smash it to the ground for wood/fuel, they must craft an axe to break things down to collect wood/fuel.Observation-When scavenging, you can commonly find rare items like lock picks but more common items like hammers, knives(even a common butter knife that could be used as a weapon) are nowhere to be found. It also appears every radio and alarm clock has been destroyed during the war and one must be made, since you can’t even trade for one, though parts for one can be found.Observation-How is it that every occupied area around you has people with guns, but everyone in your group is bare handed with not so much as a shiv/knife or a 2x4 when they start.Items like crowbars break down after repeated use on wooden doors in destroyed buildings. What? I could understand a shovel breaking because of a wooden handle, but a crowbar? Saws are also a one-time use item. wowObservation- With Ai NPCs, if they have guns It’s always shoot on sight if you try to scavenge a new area with people there. There’s no “hey who are you, get out of here or I’ll shoot” “It’s hey someone’s there, you’re dead” BANG BANGNo chance for “Oh, sorry I was not aware this area was already occupied, I’m leaving”Observation-How is it possible for an NPC to know you stole something from them if you show up with a different character than the one used to steal? SillyWhy does snow that you collect at your front door need to be melted/purified at your cooking stove when you have a wood heater that is heating your shelter?The survivors can only send out one scavenger per night no matter how many survivors you have and you can scavenge only one place per night even if you are done scavenging in a short time. If you clean out an area in an hour, you’re done for the rest of the night since you’re confined to that building/area all night. No other areas close buy/next door can be scavenged until the next night even if you have 4 hours to spare, you have to end the night or basically twiddle your thumb for X amount of hours until it’s time to go home.The game tries to get you to open your shelter up to more survivors for you to manage/take care of beyond your initial starting group. But there is no point in doing so from a survival standpoint unless you want to read their profile/back story. When I became self-sufficient, food was still scarce/hard to come by with just 3 people. Adding more survivors only puts you in a worse position and there is nothing for the extra survivors to do but sit around, always be cold/hungry/tired or get wounded in a raid. If you could actually use the extra survivors to go scavenging, I could see the point in adding them to your shelter.The survivors can’t go out in the daytime, there appears to be a 24 hour curfew. So for a war that’s been going on for years, there are no temporary trade markets during the day to trade at. Strangely you hear on the radio there are supplies like coffee being dropped off, so why are none of the survivors allowed to leave during the day to get some of this humanitarian aid?In game time goes by in 10 minute increments, with each increment occurring in less than 10 seconds, somewhere around 8 seconds. So if you do have stuff to do, you need to do it quickly before 8pm. The problem with that is that it takes one of your characters 30 game minutes to walk up 1 flight of stairs or go from one floor of your shelter to another. So if you want to go up 3 stories in your shelter to build/make/break something, it will take you 1 and a half game hours to walk up those stairs. This does not include time to actuallty build/break your item. Crazy stuff.I completed the game in 42 days without killing anyone simply by concentrating on becoming self-sufficient, there’s no need to kill any NPCs unless that is what you want to do or risk. The worst thing I did was steal some supplies from the old couple.While the message the game is trying to send is a good one and the charity part is appreciated, the actual game play is unrealistic and is incredibly repetitive after about day 20. It would be even more so if the crime wave did not occur to mix things up after day 10. Don’t be lured in by the massive amount of recommends and wait for a sale, the $20 is too high for the limited amount of content provided.			"

												This game is one of the best I’ve seen this year. Challenging, interesting, and heartbreaking, This War of Mine puts you in the battlefield, as a civilian struggling to stay alive. I have many stories I could share but I dont want to spoil much about the layout of the game so after you read this review, buy it, and play it so you can see for yourself.Graphics- 9/10. Love the 2.5 d graphics with a pencil shade to them. It looks like the trailer (one with soldiers running) when you zoom in close with maxed settings. Controls- 8/10. Point-and-Click, I’ll explain why only 8 in a bit.Handling- 9/10. Sometimes when clicking on a character to move him/her you move a previously selected character to their position… A little annoying but not the worst thing ever. Still, otherwise the looting system works fenomonomly.  Story- 7/10. Simple with background stories, but I wish there was more. I don’t know why. There is a radio with news on the war, interactive characters, and backstories but I wish there was like a cutscene or two of the arrival and departure of your shelter...Gameplay- 8/10. 60% of game is looting/running around, 25% crafting/building, 5% trading… And then theres combat, the last crappy 10% that makes some people leave this game alone forever because they are trigger happy. Ok, let me explain fact from fiction;  	Facts:-Combat is (or so it seems) a 50/50 chance when not a sneak attack.-When you go to hit someone (not sneak) they most likely will hit you first because you are running at them (people don’t understand this)-Sneak attacks when hiding behind something (symbol with guy peeking around a corner) and using a knife/axe/shovel/ is a silent insta kill.-In cover you are still able to get hit and can be seen.-If you fall down you should run because the opponent will be able to get a few hits in on you with his weapon and vise versa.-Shooting with guns is accurate and you can only shoot/hit people.-When right in front of someone with a gun they won't shoot you but they will hit you and vise versa.-Character sometimes will run up to the person you are attacking and do nothing (melee only).	Fiction:-Sneaking does not work. Only one character is silent. At a close range people will otherwise hear you and if you can see them they can see you.Ok now I want to talk about looting;You can only bring one person to loot because if you could bring more then when you encounter hostels you would have to switch between both characters and that would be frustrating. After clearing an area, just go back and loot the crap out of it every night, but be careful because sometimes other people might take shelter there. I don’t know why people criticize the looting system because it is easy and fun in my opinion.Creativity- 10/10. I’ve never seen a Call of Duty or any other war game with people playing as a civilian and having to look for food/necessities.Price-10/10. Worth the price and the money supports the war child fund.Hype-9/10. Above what I thought it would be but the combat is a serious downer. Overall- 8.5/10. Without the combat issues or a future update this game could get the first 9/10 I’ve ever given!I think know why [some] people don’t like this game. The combat, BUT these people are choosing to fight while they could trade and loot and create items to survive. People say you need to kill to survive in this game but thats not true. It just is easier that way. You will steal a few times but will be mostly from bandits and robbers. DONT TURN AWAY BECAUSE OF THIS FLAW!!! Like I said, about a 50/50 shot unless you have patience which i’m sure these down raters don't have… Anyway feel free to ask me questions about the game in the comments. Do note that I finished the game before posting this review. Good luck and have fun!!!			"

												A:Hey guys let's play CoD war is fun. B:Nah it is just a run and gun game, let's play battlefield way more realistic. C:What? Are you all serious? ARMA is the real deal, now that shows you what really is.Me: You have no idea what the hell you are all talking....What am I trying to say? Well my friend, that this isn't your everyday war game, hell I can't call it a war game, I call it a survival game.A conflict is going on, you aren't some sort of an elite soldier that regains health in cover, or respawns if you die, no you are just a person, just like all of us mostly, we aren't exo-suit wearing heroes, or using jets for transportation and etc. We are people. And what happens, when war comes, and people have to survive, since they aren't fighters? They struggle.This game is unforgiving, it shows that war isn't pretty, and it has its consequences , it shows that war is hell, and makes you feel the atleast the minimum sympathy for what happens around the world in real life.You might never look at food the same way, or at killing in a game, you might never enjoy a war game, like you did before, this game, it just affects you, you know?In war there is no happy ending, it is a scar for life.What my point is, you won't run and gun, you will just feel sad, worried, scared, these characters aren't real, but somehow it feels like it would be the same, if they were, in the end, every gamer should try, because this is one hell of a story.

												After waiting some time for this game to release, then getting it and being involved with another, I finally sat down and played at it. Well done game.Your not some super hero in a post apocalyptic world. Your just a normal person trying to survive in a war torn area, hoping it will pass you by.. but as is the case in life, your not so lucky. Your people struggle with hunger, cold, depravity around them. This shows the darker side of a society that has broken down, complete with murder, pillage and rapine.  I have grown a fondness for my people now, and really felt bad when one died. Especially since it was early on, and my history of 'other' games led me to do something stupid with them.. I highly recommend this game for a slight glimpse at the civilian life in a true war zone...			"

												An extremely well-done arcade + time management strategy synthesis disguised as a peaceful group desperate survival in a bombed out town. Gameplaywise It borrows inspiration from Prince of Persia, Mark of the Ninja and.. Crazy Farm-style casual games, but they've managed to mix it all togather so that it provides a unique chilling experience of enormous struggle to see the next sunrise day after day, it really gets you immersed and soacked in the atmosphere of helplessness, starvation and decay of humanity. Or otherwise, with some luck at randomized setup, you might build up a tough gang, steal weaponry, burgle for provisions and almost get all the lockal bandits on their knees.. but then the war abruptly ends and you have to turn back to monotoneous everyday life.Очень хорошо сделанный синтез аркады и стратегии с управлением временем, замаскированный под выживание отчаянной группы мирных жителей в разбомбленном городе. В плане игрового процесса вдохновение было почерпнуто из таких произведений как Принц Персии, Знак ниндзя и... казуалок в духе Бешеной фермы, но они умудрились так соединить компоненты, что создается уникальный ужасающий опыт огромной борьбы за шанс увидеть завтрашний восход день за днем, вас погружает в атмосферу беспомощности, голода и упадка человечества и пропитывает ею насквозь. Или же напротив, при некотором везении со случайным выпадением условий, вы можете сколотить крепкую банду, украсть оружие, награбить провизии и почти поставить всех местных урок на колени... но тут внезапно война обрывается и вам приходится возвращаться к монотонной повседневной жизни.

												When trying to summarize my thoughts on a game, I usually ask myself ""Was this fun to play ?"". If the answer is no, I then ask myself ""was this compelling and immersive enough to make up for the lack of pure fun, by providing a memorable and unique experience ?"". If the answer is still no, then I can honestly not recommend it.This is the result of my experience with This War of Mine, a game that tries to depict the horrors of war from the point of view of survivors caught in the crossfire. It is an indie title with a very fitting art direction, a good soundtrack reminescent of the first Fallout games, and some interesting crafting mechanics. It's relatively difficult and yours survivors will probably not all make it through the war, with random events such as raids, outbreaks of crime, and the harsh winter. Despite my successful run, I quicky got bored as the days passed and the game became more of a routine, not to mention I had so many resources that scavenging became more of a chore than a thrilling escapade. Once you become self-sufficient, the game loses a lot of appeal. By the 20th day, I was wondering when the war would end. By the 40th, I was banging my head against a wall and listening to podcasts to keep myself awake. So in the end, I cannot recommend This War of Mine. It has some undeniable qualities, and someone else might enjoy it far more than me, but in the end it didn't do it for me.			"

												I paid £3.74 for this, as it was on sale. I find it difficult to recommend this game for the full £15.My biggest gripe with the game is it's repetitive grinding and identical play throughs. Nothing is randomly generated in this game - it's just a set of about 20 different locations that you visit on all of your play throughs. The loot and enemy spawns do not vary, and you ultimately get bored quickly when you realise that the game is playing out exactly the same as it did the last time you played.On top of that, an awkward control scheme of ""left click only"" results in some awkward deaths. With the exit to my right, and an army of thugs to my left, I choose the option ""run to exit"". In my case, my character decided to run upstairs, which got me lost in the building and ultimately ended up in my frustratingly awkward demise as I had to manually tell my character to run back down the stairs and past the shotgun wielding thugs.But nevermind, I guess I could just load my save again, right? Nope. There are no save games in this game either. If one of your characters dies, there is no turning back. After the second awkward death in as many hours, I decided to try my hand at surviving with my remaining two characters. This was near impossible - I could not balance their sleep/hunger/medicine enough to both guard my base, and also scavange for more supplies. Eventually this leads to one of the following:a) I leave my base to scavenge: my supplies get looted.b) I stay to defend, and never leave: I run out of supplies.The magic number of three survivors allows you to Sleep / Guard / Scavenge all at one. Take one survivor out, and the cycle is shot to hell.The awkward controls, poor pathfinding, cluttered UI of ""interact"" symbols, and the poor balancing between ""difficult and fun"" make this game a real displeasure to play. It's such a shame - I had been waiting to play this for so long, only to be let down by it's repeated insistance to rub dirt in my eye at every turn.			"

												A post-war/apocalyptic simulator. This would be a great guide for us, if this dystopia world came in real life. This game is testing and questioning my morality, because normally I do the ""good"" gameplay and I didn't have a choice. You have to go to the distance to survive, kill or be killed or die of hunger. After doing that, I had to do my best to help and save other survivors, because of my conscience and guilt. Awesomeeee. 9/10.*Update*Day 15: Got depressed after killing two elderly for the need of food and supplies, became sad after getting raided and shot by an armored thug and almost died.			"

												After picking up this game, I simply could not put it down. It's taken up all of my free time for 2 days straight, and might for some time yet xDFirst, the setting. You take control of a group of civilians trying to survive in a city under siege. You have to scavenge for supplies & materials, build up your shelled out home, and try to survive at all costs. The idea alone is stellar enough, but the execution is phenominal in all aspects.Time and resource management are front and center. From the get go, you already have a limited amount of good to work with and will have to make hard choices. Build a rat cage for extra food? Or is it time to get that heater going in anticipation for winter? Your initial choices have a great sense of agency, because they set the tone for what you will need to do the next few weeks. If you went heavy on food production, you'll probably need to work towards beds & simple things and vice versa.Scavenging is a massive part of the game, and is done very well. Your chosen character can only see what's in his line of sight, and many is the time you will have to peek through a keyhole to see if there's baddies waiting on the other side. You have to make hard choices again, as you can only carry so much in your backpack. Also, will you try to stay benevolent towards others, or is looting with abandon the way to go? The levels too are done really well, with mini puzzles in getting around & hiding spots scattered throughout. This game will give you an unreal feeling of intensity when you're trying to hide from looters or maybe even stab one around a corner.The musical score is 100% fitting for each part of the game. That slow twang as you're at home really just hits home how awful it is being stuck in such brutal place. The fast paced track that always plays during scavenging is my personal favorite. It's sooo intense and perfect for those close calls which happen all too often.Finally, each character has his own traits, backstories, and personality. Fights will breakout between them! Some will steal goods for themselves, or have full on emotional breakdowns. All of it is quick and doesn't detract from the gameplay. It hits that butter zone of being ""just enough"" soooo well that you care about each person a bit, and are tempted to follow along with their bios when you can.This is the best thing I've picked up all year. For me, it's my GOTY. Get this game!			"

												This is a game about how far you are willing to go to survive in a war-zoned city.You start out with 1-4 playable characters, each with their own set of skills. Your goal is to survive, how you do this is up to you. The game begins with you arriving at an abandoned building, and you have to clear out piles of rocks and locked doors to open up the house, this in turn gives you resources you can use to build different things like beds, chairs, ovens, workshops and so forth. When the night arrives you have to venture out into the war filled city to scavenge for supplies where you will meet homeless people, or perhaps an elderly couple that is just trying to get by, do you steal their food? their medicine? and in turn leave them to their fate just so you can survive another day? There are also bandits, traders and people just trying to keep to themselves that will defend what is theirs.You will also be visited by people that needs help, some children perhaps that needs medicine for their dying mom, do you give it to them and risk the chance of you not having enough for your own people, or do you turn them down? Your shelter will also get raided so you might want to put some people on guard duty during the nights unless you want to come back from your scavenging runs and all the food is gone.How you survive is up to you, but be assured that your choices will have consequences for your group. My first playtrough took about 13 hours to finish and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it.			"

												15 hours in and I've done everything, built everything and suffered through whiney survivors, chain smokers and caffine addicts who can't seem to realise it's not a time to want those luxuries and just get on with your damn job. If I was stuck with Bruno or Katia in such a situation I would have left them days ago.I managed to finish the game in around about 10 hours, not very lenghly for 15 pounds imo and the replay value that I was told was there, simply isn't. Nothing new comes into play the 2nd time around, that burning building you loot for the basic supplies on your first night is in the same place and isn't any different to how it was the 1st time and even if you get a different location or two from the first time you played towards the end you'll realise you've done pretty much the same thing all over again.Those 'dynamic' events i read about in reviews are about as dynamic as a college timetable, they happen in the exact same places with the exact same layouts. Sure you get people knocking on your door when your at home but again these aren't dynamic, I played in the same house in 2 different playthroughs and the events from the 1st time happened in the exact same order in the 2nd.Sure the supermarket and church have a couple of different scenarios, friendly looters or a woman about to get attacked in the supermarket or a frtiendly priest willing to trade or bandits that are a cowerdly bunch to say the least and only one has a gun but he's clearly there to give you some stealth kill practice as he's so easy to sneak up on it was like attacking a dummy, same with the soldier at the supermarket.Then you get places like the Warehouse which has no kind of change in their scenario, I always have bandits there that shoot on sight and never want to trade so I'd avoid if your not very good at the whole 'stealth' thing.Which leads me to the stealth, 8/10 it works but occasionally it will glitch and instead of silently walking to a hiding spot you'll alert the whole damn building by charging full pelt at it so stealth is slightly wonky but bearable. But when your caught and surrounded by people who can see you and have guns then your dead, no other way around it and Dead is Dead with an autosave feature that stops you from reverting to an older save. I also found it annoying that this bandit i was chasing, who had no weapon in his hand, managed to beat down my healthy character who was carrying a frigging hatchet! Also even if you have a gun and plenty of ammo, good luck actually hitting anyone before they charge you and stab you in the gut.So yeah the combat is very poor and uneven, the only sure way to get a kill is through a stealth kill from cover, anything else takes a few hits.Sure it was fun the 1st time but for £15 I feel like kinda let down at the poor replay value. Maybe I just got unlucky with my scenarios and the luck of the draw was not in my favour or maybe it really is just repetitive garbage?My raiting 4/10: Definetely original and interesting in concept but it just didn't work for me...Personally it would have worked better as a mobile game.

												This is one of those cases where the concept and cause actually overshadow the game and make the reviews more positive than they should be. This War of Mine simply isn't as good as its review scores. You have to separate the actual game from the exceptionally good social work and awareness the devs are doing. On the latter front, the devs deserve massive applause and praise.But I'm not here to evaluate the social implications of a game. I'm here to evaluate the game itself. On that note, This War of Mine (TWoM) is a decent but not exceptional game. The game takes place in the middle of a war and instead of being Rocket Roger Rambo killing everything, you're just a starving civilian (well, 3 of them to start) trying to get by. You're trying to find enough food and fuel to keep yourself alive  for another day. You're trying to not get sick, blow your brains out or get shot in the head while scavenging for supplies as the bitter winter and bitter reality of your existence set in.The game is broken up into two parts. The first is during the day working around your ramshackle house to grow food, get clean water, board up the windows and not freeze to death. There will be people who come to your door but for the most part this is just inventory management and prioritization - do you use that water to make food, alcohol you hope to trade or just for drinking water? The second part of the game is taking one of those characters and scavenging for supplies at a location. You'll have a general idea of the danger when you go, but you won't know what you'll find until you get there...and most things that go bump in the night aren't in your favor.So the game wants to put you in moral dilemmas like the choice between stealing someone's supplies or letting your housemate die of illness. Some starving kids come to your door - do you give them some of your meager rations or turn them away hungry? That kind of narrative and difficult choices are the crux of the game.Before getting into the game play, I'd like to give this game serious props for the art style and music. Both are exceptional and give the game a distinctive look and sound that add to the experience. There's also a decently healthy mod community even if most of the mods are nothing more than extra characters. All of this adds value to your purchase.At the same time, the game play can be a bit lackluster. Your interactions between characters are limited and thus you're just directing them during the day to make whatever stuff you have around to use. It's repetitive and often breaks down into nothing more than inventory management while out on your nightly raids as you're severely limited in backpack space. These characters must have alligator arms to only be able to carry so little. The constructs of such limited carrying capacity and only one person who can go on these nightly pickups enforces scarcity while building during the daytime. I understand while they are in the game - but both of them just seems entirely artifical and unnecessary. The inventory management is bland. The combat controls aren't great. There are about 25 or so locations in the game and so replay value gets a little thin as only the supplies seem to be randomized. Like most games of this type, once you hit a particular level of supplies the game can get pretty easy.   Still, these issues can be overcome. If you like exploring like me then you'll enjoy going to a new area and wondering what is around every corner in this new building. You'll be excited to find a cache of needed medicine or food. The scarcity will force you into searching areas that you'd like to avoid. And you'll breathe a big sigh of relief when you can get that farm going to keep your guys from starving to death. So even while there are downsides, it can still be an enjoyable time. And again, the game play isn't terrible - it's just been done better elsewhere by many other games. But it's still a decent formula made stronger by the setting and music.Before I sign off on this review, I have one major bone to pick with TWoM. The actions / reactions of the characters aren't realistic at times and that's pretty awful in a game about surviving the horors of war. I basically had one game fall apart when my own home-grown character decided to become super depressed when all he was doing is defending himself from evil bandits. It started a downward spiral that just ruined that experience for me. As someone who was once in a war zone, that's not really accurate for many people who understand that they were just protecting themselves. In a game about the realities of war, overly emotional reactions to events can be a pretty large issuee. Luckily this doesn't come up in every game and you can always try to roll play around it. PS - Get the War Child DLC. It can add some different interactions and family units and it's for a good cause.			"

												This is a very satisfying resource management game (survival genre) with a minimilistic side-scrolling design. It has enough randomness for each playthrough to maintain interest in repeated playing, but not so much randomness that the game becomes too unbalanced. Lack of detailed instructions on the underlying mechanics leads to your early games being a struggle to survive. Replayability is good, but not perfect. The game has numerous combinations of starting conditions and beginning characters. This adds greatly to the variety since each character has a couple unique skills/traits. Once you have completed the game several times and learned how to do things efficiently and safely, resources DO begin to pile up at too fast a rate. This leads to a back-half of the game without tension as you complete simple activities and move on to the next day, waiting for the war to end.Locations you visit to scavange supplies are chosen on a map of the city and are smallish (but perfectly suited to the gameplay) self-contained side-scroll maps. Most of the locations you visit have two versions that effect both the supplies you can scavange and the events/people who you can meet there. The strategic/moral choices are based off of the locations having the possibility of danger, robbing innocents, trading opportunities, or safe abandoned sites. Fairly explicit hints are given to you in the location-choice so that you can make good strategic decisions.Combat does exist in the game. It is simple and has minor stealth and cover mechanics. It is usually either a very fast paced lethal encounter (potentially for both sides) or waiting patiently in a hiding place to stab someone with a knife after possibly attracting them with sound. The mechanics of the game make the violence both tense and consequential.			"

This War of MineA must-buy for anyone who's even remotely interested in strategy and/or good video games. At first I was a bit overwhelmed by the different elements of the game, and this affected my first play-through to the point where failing made me feel genuinely sad. Not because I didn't ""win"", but rather because of the unjustness of the conditions that caused my survivors to get sick or depressed and eventually die. And after 30 or so hours and getting better at the game, I started wondering if that might have been the point: everything doesn't neatly fall into place for civilians in wartime—death is constant. And maybe that's what this game teaches: yes, as you play, things start to feel more and more enjoyable, so to speak, but first you have to go through a harsher, more honest representation of war.Pros:Beautiful artwork, tense atmosphere;Tackles important themes in a surprisingly harsh but honest light;Decent amount of locations to explore, along with new characters and simply getting used to the mechanics adds to replayability;Decisions have tangible consequences;Gameplay adapts to your play style;Great soundtrack;Cons:Lack of tutorial can make things a bit overwhelming (if not downright depressing) at first;Not a lot of scenario variations to increase replay value, in contrast to the above.

												Entire group was starving, sent Pavle to half split tenement building, game said use caution; assumed occupants were hostile, lockpicked the backdoor and hid in the shadows, brutally hacked to death first person who passed me. Saw someone scream ""You're dead!"" Jumped off of second story and hid in shadows again, brutally hacked sentry to death. Saw last person crying over first corpse. Kill her from behind. Realize all four were women, and only one was armed. Take supplies. Character comes home and starts crying.11/10 Would get notice of Pavle hanging himself again.This game features an amazing amount of replayability. I was skeptical at first. And of course, many elements of this game are scripted. However the AI responses, random events, and random attacks generate hours upon hours of gameplay. This game will do some damage to your social life; so be ready for that.The characters have some interesting biographies and personalities, both of which show despite the lack of any voiceovers. Despite being a side scrolling game the environments are very nice and immersive. The locations are logical and the feels are frequent. Such feels.Combat is a bit difficult to understand and predict, at some points it can be very frustrating; and it's best simply to choose a stealthish dirty fighting approach, letting the enemies give chase and then hiding and waiting for them to catch up so you can jump out and beat them to death.HOWEVER; there is a very steep learning curve, you are basically thrown into the game without any guidelines besides characters whining.9.5/10+ Good writing+ Immersive Environments+ Good barter system+ Base building is fun and crucial- No tutorial- Lack of direct controls may get your characters injured/killed			"

												For the first time in a very long time I felt genuine, mirthful happiness at achieving something in a video game. I've never been more relieved or satisfied when it comes to my gaming experience than what I experienced today. I've blown up countless enemies, taken down more dragons than I can ever think of and done the impossible last stand fight and won, more times than I care to remember. Today however, I experienced something I've not had since I was a tiny kid. I sighed with genuine relief simply finding a small stash of canned food. Such a simple and trivial thing hit me very hard today. You see, I played my first run of This War of Mine today. I am not good at hardcore survival games, despite my insistence to play them because I'm bad with prioritizing things. Food and shelter took a backseat to beds and a radio, because I had the supplies. I made a lot of ♥♥♥♥ ups in my first five days and on night five, I was raided while my two sick team members rested. The raiders took everything of value really. My food and medicine, what little there was. For a day and a half, we had no food. Wounded and sick survivors can't exactly scavenge or build much, so they rested during the days. It wasn't until night 8 that I found small stash of canned food. This... paltry amount of food would only last us another day, maybe but it brought the biggest and most satisfied smile to my face. Because ultimately it gave me hope. Real hope that things might work out. I've never really felt that from a game before.			"

												Wow. Never would I think to write another review on such a game like this. This game has convinced me to take a few minutes away just to make this review. For a survival game like this, it not only has great gameplay but has a beautiful story line. Games like this change the way we think, the way we feel. It shows the scary life experience of someone who lives or lived through war. The moment you press PLAY, everything changes. Show this to anyone. And let their experience with the game change them.

												I have to write a rewiew for this game because over all, it is easily the best survival game I have played this year. 10/10!*at least 25 hours of solid game play*well balanced :D it is not too difficult, and not too easy*the plot is well designed, it is dynamic and changes accordingly to player's play style*options of doing humanity's best or worst, and then watch how people react to it*inspiring and judgemental at the same time!*the concept, angle, and art style are awesome!!!*(!spoiler! Do good deeds, and you will have goods in return! Lol)Here is some thoughts for the dev, if you are going to update the game for a more dynamic game play:Controls could be slightly annoying sometimes.I really wish that the weather will influence more of our play style; for instance, crops could have gone dormant during really really cold days(I know we have a heating lamp but... it is not the same as growing things under sunlight). Or, scavenging during a storm makes it harder to hear noises, in the meanwhile you will be harder to detect. I have never had any bandits come knocking on my door, which is very surprising to me. I think under a civil war setting like this, there might be a bit more bandits running around in bright daylight since they appeal to be really well armed. the only danger for my daytime game play was once two soldier came to my door looking for a thief(which is my neigbour, and I helped him, lol). I said I can't help and shut the door on them and they just stood for a while and left... I imagined they'd be a lot more aggrassive so I was nervous. Because some of them just kill and rob and♥♥♥♥♥♥.. But I suppose not all of those soldiers are bad. :P Or maybe I was just lucky. Yet still, I do wish that for once or twice they come and kick our door open during the day, just for drama.			"

												This War of Mine is not your average war game. You don't run around like a maniac with your rifle and shoot everything in your vincinity! In this little pearl you follow and command a group of three random victim haunted by war. You scavange, you steal, you survive or you die.Ok. After this little introduction. What is this gameplay all about?Basicly it's a mix of a sidescoller, survival and simulation game.At day you manage your ""household"". Build furniture, helpful devices, weapons. Anything of use in a war. Beside that you have to take care of your group. They feel hunger, they get sick, wounded, depressive ect. Take care of them or they will die faster as you can say ""Oberweserdampfschifffahrtskapitänsgesellschaft"".When the night starts you organise your group. One of them will scavange. You will then command him to the next building and make though decision. ""Will I rob this old pair?"", ""Should I risk breaking in a bandit's house for better stuff?""But keep in mind that you are not a soldier.The good+ All characters write a journal and react to the situations+ Characters have diffrent 'profession' like cook or trader, which adds a little depth to the micromanagment+ all tools and furniture have a use and highly impact on the groups well-beeing+ the 'healthsystem'+ random maps, replayabilityThe average~ the background music is a bit repetive~ the visuals are fitting for the game but still a bit outdated. Also the pencilanimimations(background) are a bit annoyingThe bad- no character voicesThe score8/10			"

												I've played This War of Mine for nearly twenty hours now and I am amazed by its qualities. The game is so deeply immersive that I didn't even notice the sun go down after beginning play at around 4pm. I found myself still sat playing at 2 in the morning and thinking how the f*ck did I get here ? So beware of this effect.The game puts the player in a scenario that is rarely touched upon by developers and that is the survival of civillians in the midst of war. When hearing my friend talk about the game and watching the trailer I immediately thought of the scenes from the first Austin Powers film where noone cares about the family of the henchmen. It was at this point I realised that many games out there are so focussed around being a hero/heroine and fighting a war mostly by themselves which brings a sense of gratification for every minor objective. This game is the polar opposite. Survivng is not only difficult but frustrating and at points tedious and dull.Now if anyone has bothererd to read this far (which I doubt anyone will read it full stop) you're probably wondering why I recommend this game if I describe parts of it as 'dull' and the simple answer is because of the effect this game has on each player. Every person I know who has played this game has each had a different output from the game and it truly makes you think about the world. As you take control of the several characters you can survive as you unravel more of their stories and their past making you connect with them. For me I became so grossly immersed in the character Arica and when she unfortunately died looting I honestly felt sad. This game, although being totally fictional in its storyline, has brought humanity to a war game so brilliantly. When you help a neighbour it truly feels like you're doing good for a community even though it doesn't exist ! I wont ramble on (great Led Zep song) because I'm only writing this out of sheer boredom however this game has inspired me to donate money to war child every month as it has truly opened my eyes to an experience that I hope to never go through myself but I am more aware of its impact thanks to this game.The point I'm probably not getting across well is that this game can be played by most people (as it is not very demanding graphics wise) and should be because of its true potential to shed light on the horrible conditions some people live in even today if we look at Syria as an example. I rate this game 10/10 as it is truly fantastic in its setup. It's simple, clean and packs a fantastic message for any player with an open mind who's not stuffing their face with energy drinks and treating it like a challenge rather than an immersive experience. If that's the case I would suggest Counter Strike. If you have read this far I would suggest doing something better with your time as this is quite honestly just me typing random words that dont make sense now. Bannana, Dihydrocodeine, Golf, Aberdeen.			"

												""This War of Mine"" is an experience where all you want is for your handful of civilians to survive. You don't play this game to brag about how many days you made it. You don't play this game to play God and shape people's lives at your whim. You play this game if you want a bleak and often tense simulation of the trials faced by non-combatants stuck in a lawless city, trapped in whatever shelter they've found because war has made normal life an impossibility. Note that the developers drew heavily on accounts of the Siege of Sarajevo, which took place from 1992 to 1996 during the Bosnian War.While there are imperfections, 11 Bit Studios has absolutely hit the right note. The characters are neither superheroes nor survivalists. Every morsel of food or fuel becomes a precious commodity, every wound sustained becomes a source of dread. You'll feel despair and irritation as you wait for the harsh winter to end, wondering each night which of your people will succumb to illness, and each chance encouter that turns to violence will leave you with anguish, relief, or maybe a combination of both.The tone is sublimely melancholy, with the music in particular worth listening to long after you're done with the game. The DLCs, also, are of the perfect kind: a free editor's workshop, and a priced art package where 100% of the proceeds go to a charity for children victimized by war. 11 Bit Studios isn't ♥♥♥♥ing around: ""This War of Mine"" is not just a game, but a symbol of what a game can represent. It's an empathetic opportunity to imagine what people throughout history have faced in their darkest days.Because Steam doesn't seem to have the launch trailer shown on its store page, you can find it on the official youtube page here,

												I have already played 15 hours and I have still not finished the game - for an indie game nowadays that should be the first thing you'd like to read.But what I really want to tell you is, that this game is not only a masterpiece that shows you a different side to war compared to all the other shooters out there, but that it is most of all touching.You have to take care of your group in a very sims-like manner.You have to get food, water, material, things to tradeYou have to get most of the ressources you can gather to make it through the war.Give this game a try, it'll definitely change your view on most shooters.

												I love this game, mainly because I love survival games and this is all about survival at all costs. I've played 6 times and  I've beaten the game twice; once with Pavle, Marko, and Bruno where I took in Boris. And once with Pavle and Marlin where I took in the Child Lover (Yvelta or something?) starting in Winter. People say the combat is clunky but I haven't had a problem with it you're killed very easily unless you have either the element of surprise, or an easily defencible position such as on top of a ladder. Finding parts to upgrade your shelter is difficult, and being raided is a huge danger, and unless you fortify your shelter and find a gun you'll almost always lose a few items. After playing about 13 hours the game has seemed to get repetetive and this is the only negative aspect i've found in it. This game is a challenge and requires strategy to beat it. You won't always be able to help the children who come to the door asking for medicine, the starving people you meet while scavenging, or be able to help your neighbors out of a tough situation. And your characters will get sad very sad. But i'd recommend it because it is an interesting experience that accuretely depicts a survival situation where you need to make tough choices in order to survive.			"

												Firstly , If you like easy games - this one isn't for you. In fact, it's pretty brutal, unforgiving and unlike almost every other survival game out there - there's no undead to battle. Just your fellow man, hunger, and mother nature. This War of Mine is a refreshing attempt at the survival genre, and a very successful attempt it was in my opinion. You start off managing 3 people in a house. It's up to you to prioritise boarding up the house to make it secure, getting a radio up and running so you can hear news of the war and other survivors, building a bed so you can get a good night's sleep or building a cooker so you can have a satisfying meal. Every choice has a consequence and drains resources that you have to scavenge every night - sometimes from an abandoned house, other times from a populated house with people just as desperate as you living inside. Make the wrong choice, and it may very well cost the life of one of your guys. An example of my first playthrough..  At the start I pretty much relied on trade and not stepping on the toes of other survivors, but then came that point when there's just the 3 of my guys, poor Pavle is wounded from an unsuccessful raid (and probably gonna die during the night) and they're all starving because I ate my last food item 2 days ago. That 2 bedroom semi-detached down the road is stocked to the brim with food and meds - and it's also guarded by 2 armed survivors who have been fairly decent people thus far. All that's left to do is to lay down and die with a modicum of humanity, hoping a trader will make it through or... pick up my knife and gun and go ""Governor"" on their♥♥♥♥♥ buying myself and my household another couple of days until the next crisis! ...I'm not proud of what I did. They were probably very good people, but now Pavle is fit and well and the fridge is stocked. Another couple of days and the war will be over.. I'm sure! Great little game and fully recommended to fans of this genre who want a change from the norm.			"

												For what is designed to be a touch-screen game, this is actually a surprisingly rich and compelling experience. It's mechanical simplicity makes starting up a run so very tempting, and the presentation of the game just makes it really rewarding to go for just one or two more days.I somewhat wish that certain game features/mechanics were better documented, but I suppose that's part of the point, isn't it? Everyone making decisions based on their best guesses/incomplete information. I wouldn't have robbed that family if I knew the ceasefire was tommorrow, I wouldn't have killed that man if I knew he was unarmed, and so on.I've really enjoyed my time with this game and I really hope to see more titles like this in the future.

Product received for free
												This game make us wonder the result of war looks like, people scavenging for foods, medicine, supply etc. And in this game too we need to make the limited used of our supply per day, especially Winter Time, so many character got sick and almost died (but i manage survived all of them from hell).I like this game so much, especially the story where you survived you unlock another character and you can play again for what 4 - 6 hours maybe haha... But the thing that i like on this game is the emotional of the character, especially if you kill someone for the first time, it's so hard and the character got desperated or broken for worst case. And you can feel the emotion too if your character die, so don't let your character died because it's feels like you just lose half of your life.Next is the system of the game, i like it but for me i need the new map for night time for new experience. So many easter eggs and event even after you on the night time, you always got it everywhere.Overall this game is amazing and i recommend this game for all of you who like to play and experience what it feels like to survive after long warRate: 9/10			"

												With how bleak the game is I got the feeling the game wasn't supposed to be fun but an exploration of the horror of war for civilians, so I ended up feeling kinda guilty when I actually enjoyed it a lotYou take control of a group of 4 civilian survivors in an eastern european city. The city has been taken over by some kind of rebel army and the military is beseiging the city to reclaim it. The objective is to keep the survivors alive for about 6 weeks til the war ends.During the day it plays like The Sims. You build furniture and tools, cook, eat, sleep, and sometimes conduct trade with wandering traders or make choices as to whether to aid visitors who come for helpAt night you pick a survivor to travel to one of a number of locations and loot as much as he/she can carry to aid you during the day or future raids before dawnYou will need to find materials to build furniture and defenses or to use as fuel for heating during the winter, food to not die from not eating, water to cook, medicine in case of illness or inury, weapons and ammo to defend during the night or utilise in raids, and trade goods like tobacco or alcohol to trade with wandering tradersPlayers can craft items and weapons such as a shiv for combat, a crowbar for forcing locks loudly, lockpick for picking them silently once, spade for clearing rubble, saw for sawing through barricades doors etc. Often an area will have locked doors or collapsed passages and players must plan ahead for future raids to ensure they can clear the obstacles they couldnt pass earlierWhen raiding you may encounter hostile people. Some of them are thugs and bandits who are fair game. Others are innocent survivors who may fight to defend themselves or their property, and there are soldiers who are usualyl lethally dangerous and best avoided. Combat is random and depends on the skills the survivor started with and their equipment and the strenght of their foe, and whether or not you or your opponent is injured already and who got the drop on who. As combat is dangerous and injuries take many days to heal and expensive bandages, combat is best avoided. Not all survivors are hostile and some will trade or assist the player. Others must be avoided carefully or killed if the situation is desperate as the player searches for the most valuable items for their inventory space in the time availableDeath is permanent so the player must weigh up the risks and benefits of each action. Do you attempt to sneak past the thugs for the food you need not to starve? Do you steal medicine from an old couple to save your sick friend? Do you try to save a woman from a battle hardened well equipped♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥soldier who will almost certainly kill you? Do you pick through the looted carcass of a supermarkt for those last scraps of materials or risk your life sneaking into the rich but bandit infested warehouse district?Really I loved this game. Highly recommended!			"

												As much as people like to be the hero in most games or the one man army that takes down everyone in an FPS, this game will definitely show a different and, in my opinion, more interesting perspective. You control the citizens and the people who are not able to regenerate bullet wounds in a matter of seconds, can't be revived at a checkpoint, and don't think of killing as a priority. This game, while it may be hard, is gripping. I've found myself at the verge of tears from this game. If you enjoy survival type games, I would recommend this for sure.			"

												My 4th playthrough went like this: My first survivor got shot at fifth night while scavenging supermarket. Second survivor left me after 10th day and robbed me in the process after I provided him a lot of meds, bandages and food so that he could get better. The third one commited suicide the next night because she just couldn't take any more of it. Yes, that's right. This game is very depressive.			"

												What can be said about TWoM that hasn't been said already? It's good. No- It's not good, It's great! Not even that, it is one of the best games I have ever played. Tensions run high, supplies run low, war runs rampent and it is a masterpiece. Furthermore, the soundtrack is simply beautiful. This game is a must have for anyone looking for a challenge, and also to shed a few tears.And the new Anniversary Edition DLC (Which is free,I might add.) adds a ton of great new content and hours more playtime.

												Marco died first. Stopping a♥♥♥♥♥♥ The girl escaped, but good, honest Marco was gunned down in that burnt out shell of a building. Without the vital supplies, wounde Boris made the brave decision to go out into the darkness to give hope to the group.Boris was set upon by a mad congregation. He got out, barely alive, knowing that the resources he'd salvaged were important to the group. Sadly, bandages were not among them.Pavle, in desperation to save his friend, took something he shouldn't at the hospital. He ran when chased, but in the panic took a wrong turn. Cornered, like a rat, he died. It was in vain, Boris died of his wounds that night, the same night the gang attacked. He couldn't have helped Bruno, who was mortally wounded in the fight. Bruno was cold the following day, leaving only Arica, the newest member. Bitterness and depression took her. Two long days and nights until she even had the willpower to move again. She wasn't the same.A son, aiding his sick father, gunned down without a word. The old man beaten to death with a crowbar. Bullets are rare these days.Even when Katia arrived, bright, artistic Katia, the stresses of survival had altered her. In with the brutality she fell. One necessary murder. Two. Three. Obstacles in their paths. There was no depression about the inhumanity anymore. Only necessity.Times grew better, even as the cold drew in, no longer constantly at the door of starvation and sickness, some might even say they flourished, . Flourished much as a briar grows, thick, vicious and thorned, strangling its competition. The war ended, and the frozen dead gave silent judgement on what had been done to survive.But they did survive. 10/10P.S. In all seriousness, the first playthrough I wasn't able to get into the room with the young girl and the soldier. Having to listen to that without being able to do anything about it was one hell of a gut punch. the second playthrough I wasn't going to let that happen again. I don't write reviews. This game changed that.			"

												Maybe I'm a bit desensitized to virtual suffering but the moral choices offered to you all seem forced - like, I was supposed to feel emotional about it but I didn't. I felt much worse about losing Carly in The Walking Dead (Telltale Games) than I did about ignoring the girl in the other room who's about to get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and killed by a soldier. She made for a good distraction and helped me safely loot stuff from the Supermarket. Other moral choices like whether or not to kill this rich family trivially boiled down to ""Will it help me?"".The mood mechanic infuritated me. People got sad from stealing, and depressed or broken from killing. Granted, this game isn't a game about killing but flopping down on the floor in Very Hungry state after just retrieving a bag of food from the dead people's house - that's idiotic! These direct cause-and-effect behaviors further reminded me that the characters in this game are just encapsulations of data visualized with pixels and sounds.Overall, I couldn't immerse myself into this game. The gameplay is somewhat addicting - building improvements to the house, sneaking past or killing guards, profitting on a hard-earned meal - but I couldn't emotionally invest into any of the moral decisions of the game.

												Emotions. Morality. Compromises. Hope.Little are the games that manage to emulate fun AND pass along a life lesson.And in a current worldwide context of violence (ex:Ukraine, Venezuela) it is good that this one can poke us right into the confort of our cosy videogaming chairs. Because to better understand how some people struggle every instant to survive is to better motivate us to try and prevent such tragic outcomes.This is why war should only be a videogame.This is why this game is a GREAT game			"

												I had a really hard time with replay value in this game, the first 2 times I played it, it was really fun, exhausting and frustrating true, but you had a sense of accomplishment regardless.  However, I have since tried to play it other times, using different characters, and even some custom characters, but the game feels the same regardless of who you have.  Even most of the locations are pretty similar.I think what kills the game for me personally, is the amount of resources needed to just survive is high, and the amount of resources needed to upgrade things is nearly impossible to achieve on anything but easy difficulty.  Its true that I only have 14 hours of gameplay, so im not an expert by any means, but I doubt i will be putting any more hours into this game.			"

												War.. No one likes war. You and the survivors try to stay alive in a broken world. During the day you try tomake barricades, beds to sleep on. You cook food for the survivors. But then the night starts. You go out alone in the dark searching for supplies, food to keep your family alive. I found a nice home with lots of foodwhere an elderly man scared me. In an accident I killed the poor man, me and my character could notlive like this so rebooted the game. Let try to play civilized the next game I say to myself. No more killing innocent people.I rather eat rats then hurt other survivors.Awesome game, nice atmosphere, Try to make the best solution for you and your crew!			"

												Great game and decent replayability, clearly worth playing!You're in control of a group of 3 war survivors (that can grow or shrink depending on how you handle things) living in abandonned house. With the help of your mouse (wasn't expecting the game to be 100% mouse controls at first), you must transform that crappy house into an acceptable living area during the days and scavenge the city at night (and decide if you're going to be that♥♥♥♥♥♥ready to steal from/kill anyone) to find food/resources/meds/weapons to survive and thrive.Gameplay speed is a bit uneven (can feel slow during the day when waiting for a random visit to happen if you're looking for a trader/extra recruit and a bit too fast at night when you start getting in combat) but it plays nicely overall.The difficulty is there and the randomness (to keep new games somewhat fresh) doesn't feel ""all-or-nothing"" like in some rogue-like games, even if it's tempting to keep restarting new games to get a starting crew with good traits.Replayability so far is ok, I'm on my 4th or 5th game which might also be the last since it's going really well and might let me win the game (and I'm not that kind of completionist who'll restart a new game after winning just to try things slightly differently). I'd rate the game at 10-25 hours of fun depending on how fast you discover the good ways of getting things done.			"

												Now, this is a story all about how My life got flipped-turned upside downAnd I'd like to take a minuteJust sit right thereI'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called PogorenI suppose like most stories it started on day 1, and like a number of stories amnesia defines day 1. Being hit by some heavy debris during a shelling that wrecked what appears to have been a multiple story building for a large family, surrounded by a crew of four soft caramel chews. They apparently had got the memo that I was a hard piece of candy, and pledged loyalty to me immediately, as long as I saw them through the mess that was This War of Ours.Allow me to describe this crew of motley.There's my workhorse, Bruno. This guy was a grump through and through, would complain all the time, and never stopped bumming smokes. Still he was the most competent individual in that he never seemed to waste any fuel when cooking much of anything. He's the only one who knew how to measure anything, giving you an idea of what I was working with. He was the only one I trusted with establishing our little cartel, because he was the only one I could count on to do the job right.There's the looks, Katia. She's a pretty thing, who people always want to do favors for. She ran the front desk, handled the interactions with people when a smile, wink, handshake and hug were needed. She wasn't a bad scavenger either, but there's a bit of reluctance to ask such beauty to go picking through rubble and god-knows-what, especially when numerous unsavory characters are about.Especially when there's Pavle. He's a real night owl. He was sick from the beginning to the end, but it seems I'm the only one who pegged him as a hypochondriac. Somehow when he didn't get his dose of 'medicine' regularly enough, he'd start showing symptoms. I let him sleep all day, at first because of his shakes, but later because he's the guy to send out at night to find and steal all the treasures that have been left behind locked doors and saw-busting grates. This guy moved like a man with purpose. He'd kill if it comes to that, but he won't like it; can't blame him for that, and besides too much killing is bad for business.Finally, there's, darling Cveta. She filled in a lot of the gaps that would develop. Most of her work was to take work from Bruno when his hands were full, keeping the water flowing, rolling a few not-too-fat ones to be sold, baiting traps, putting another log on the fire,  being another watch as guard, stuff that's hard to mess up. She did have a unique skill in that if someone was bumming the group out too much, she could always make them smile. It's always good to have that around.We started out small, just wanted to barter a bit, were tired of being hungry and unable to defend ourselves. Cigarettes ran low in the city, addicts never could pace themselves, and so we started bootlegging them. There were no police.  We got a bit of excess capital around, got a taste for the lifestyle, saw our morals slip, started bootlegging high proof alcohol, sold it tax-free. After a while we got even bolder, started making home made bandages, and passed them off as the real thing, though we never got any complaints about them. Eventually we were putting anything that looked like it had an active ingredient, into fresh new pills and selling it as Grade-A pharmaceuticals. There's no guarantee, your mileage may vary.Mostly we traded with a hood who would come by our door every few days. Always seemed to have a lot of scrap, still don't know where he kept finding it. We admired his resourcefulness, and never asked a question. There were a few other people here and there, looking for parts, weapons, tools, or whatever was still worth half a damn. When Pavle rubbed out our competition we were the best equipped militia in town. Assault rifles, kevlar, medical supplies, state-of-the-ghetto facilities. We went where we wanted and took what we desired. We could make most of it ourselves when we had the gumption.We always had a mind toward the community though. Helped out our neighbors, helped out the hospital, never killed no one who didn't deserve it, and never took nothing we didn't plan on paying back.Then the war ended. The newly galvanized crew, they wanted to go back to their lives, friends, and families, have real jobs. They weren't criminals, they didn't want to go up against police, dodge investigations, deal with rivalries. They weren't interested in the power, excitement, or debauchery, had no need for colorful knives and expensive masks. I'd helped them survive the tough times, when that time passed, they wanted to forget what I tought them, forget the kind of person I was. They wanted to forget the kind of person I needed them to become for that short while.All four people abandoned me shortly after and we haven't interacted since. There's no regret or shame on my end towards them, and I understand why. Friendship was never the objective; I kept them alive.			"

												got this when it was 50% off.. now it's 60%.. it's a war of mine :(First Impresssion :I've played 2 hours so far and I think this game is great. this review is my first impression of this game. You can manage group of survivors, give them task and meet other survivors in other group, they might asking for help, trading, and maybe some things that I don't know yet. I see a lot of conflicts, like son that willing to trade anything he has to get medicine for his father, and attacker/group of bandits seducing surviving young girl that asking for supplies. There are a lof of scenes that reminds me of walking dead.Updated (1):After playing for a week (20 hours so far -- day 44) this game is kinda patterned but still you can't predict the result, first 2 weeks are harder than the rest of game. This game qualified as very good games, keeping me playing 20 hours is hard as I have over 30 games this week and this one take more intensive play than other newly games I have. I still like the moral and conflict of this game. I think I'll beat this game soon and will have 2nd play with other combination of characters.After 20 hours I think it's OK to sum everything.Pro:-  great surviving simulation/strategy/management game. It's the neighbour from hell + post war survival, walking dead thingy without zed.-  it has great replay value. I think playing it over and over is great.. - great graphics, music, crafting and enemy AI- all characters have their own set of unique skills. Having elder survivor is stilll useful here..Con:- why there is no 2-4x speed up button.. I hate to wait for few minutes to the end of days. If you skip the time to night some items/task that needed time doesn't progress. It's frustrating when you have to wait until the end of day and you have nothing left to do beside sleep and recovering- You can't have all survivors in one campaign, you can only play with 4 of them -- maybe 5  the one(s) who came later is random- Some places are randomly ""locked"", I can't go to garage in my 5th gameplay (after 4x failure)grab it while it's 50% off :)			"

												This War of Mine is not a fun game. If you are one of those who think games ought to be fun, turn around, walk away and pretend this doesn't exist.TWM is a harrowing, depressing experience which puts you in a war torn city, with a small group of truly ordinary citizens. A math professor, a football player, a fireman, a thief, a gourmet chef...One of the very first things you realize is you are not playing this to win. This is war and war is hell, there is no winning. You are simply trying to survive, to keep on going for one more day at a time, hoping for better times.You start out in a heavily damaged house, with holes in the walls and barely any food or materials. Over time you try to improve your living conditions, by making beds, chairs, stoves etc. If you are lucky, maybe you can make some rain water collectors, or maybe even a moonshine distillery?As the days pass and the war keeps raging on, resources become scarce and everyone, the military, militia and even ordinary citizens become more and more violent and depraved, all in the name of survival. Whereas you could trade a few gems for a ton of supplies in the early days, you could end up trading your shotgun for a few pieces of rat meat in the cold and unforgiving winter...In a world where we are all too quick to dismiss the wars in the Middle East or Ukraine with ""not my problem"", turn down asylum seekers based on our prejudices of race, religion and ethnicity, This War of Mine provides us (especially the Western audience) with a fresh perspective and maybe even a lesson in humanity...

												After a few tries, i finnally manage to survived the war. This is a great game (not fun tho...) I would give it 8/10.Here are some stories during my last playthrough. Hope you guys like it.I used to be a fireman, I have a wife and i child and live a normal life. But war seperated us.... It changed everything...I met a couple other survivars and we hide in a damaged house. Can we survive this war?Day 7 - A girl came to our door and ask if she can stay with us, the cook deside to let her stay. I am glad we did, she helped us alot especially in the darkest time. Where is my family? Are they still alive?Day 9 - I went to the supermarket, hoping to find some food and supply so that we can live for a few more days before everything runs out. I heard some sounds behind the entrance door. A soldier was trying to force a girl in exchange to give her some food. I waited a few second because he has a assault rifle in his hands. After a moment of hesitation I can't just stand there and watch this happen. So I rushed in and hit him with my crowbar, he is not down, I though he will kill me, I try to hit him again, he strick faster with his buttstock. After a few round of beating each other to death, I finally killed him. The girl ran away, and I am serverely wounded. I pick up the rifle and grab some supply and went home. Luckily we have a couple bandages. It hurts but i am happy to know that the girl is ok.... at least this time.Day 16 - I went to a military post hoping to trade some food with some moonshine we found earlier. Once i got there, the soldiers was trying to shoot me on sigh! Do they know I killed one of his man? I ran away as fas as I can.Day 25 - I went to a school full of thugs, Info said that there are planty of supply there. We were runing out of everything and if the consistant raid happened the past week continues, it will end us in no time, We don't have any more bandages and only a few ammo left. We were desperate. At the school, i can hear them talking about bad things. I found a dead body by the hallway. At the end of the hallway on the top floor, I heard someone was talking to a closed door. I waited unit the guy went away. I picked the door and found someone was lock up behind, He ran away immediately screaming. I was so afraid it will alam the thugs, they had guns and I didn't. So lucky that they didn't hear it. I slowly walk away and tried to grab as much stuff as a can on the way out. I was careless, I made noise and one of them heard it! They almost chased me down before i ran away. I didn't get a lot of stuff home.Day 26 - I have to go to the school again! We need supply!!!! This time,  I grabed a knife and my shotgun, alone wiith all the ammo left. It is the frist time i bring my gun with me on a run. But this is us or them. I knew what are their platrol route from the observation. I hide in the shadow, i wait one of them to come close. And I striked! He was down. Other thugs knew i am here, I ran away like a black cat in shadow and hide again. They were looking for me, They splited up and kept looking. One of them come to my hiding spot... there is a chance for me to strike... I took his life. The other guy heard the fight, he rush to the scene, I quickly ran to the door and used it as cover. I pulled out my shotgun, he came... I fired twice. He is down. i screach the place carefully because i don't know how many mans they got. I spotted the last guy at the back yard. I slowly approach him from behind, I shot him so that i don't give him a chance to fight back. Now they are all dead, Four lives was tooken by my hands... We cleared the building the following few days, there were plenty of food and supply, and ammo too. Will I kill them if i have to choose again? I don't know... I think i will.Day 30 - It is snowing. It is very cold outside. Our house is warm but it will not atsy that way as fuel is running lower and lower everyday. We chopped off all the closest in the house for fuel. Water is beginning to running low too. We were think about buring the guitar for fuel, but the girl who joined us really want to keep it. No question she is a good musician, She played it way better then any of us. We decided to let her keep it, lestening to her music is maybe the only enjoyable thing in this difficult time. I think the foodball guy will agree with me too.Day 37 - What! i can't believe it! The cook told me today that the war may end soon! He heard the radio new. We have some can food we have been saved up, some rat meat and vegi left too. Meds and firewood is running low, but looks like the snow stopped. We only need to hang on for some more days!Day 38 - I ask the cook if the war end yet? He said no....Day 39 - I ask him again. He told me to listen to the radio myself....Day 40 - Radio said the war may ends in any day now!!!Day 41 - We ate all the meat... i hope we can catch come more rats. Is the war going to end????Day 42 - We... We... We made it !!!!!!!!!! We..... survived...Hope you guys enjoy, and I would love to hear you guys' stories.			"

												I survived this War of Mine on my first playthrough. Let me tell you a story.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Three survivors one day came together and as fate would have it they knew each other, Katia having    interviewed Pavle before and Bruno being the host of his own cooking show.  Now, no matter their past or skills, they would be reduced to nothing else but scavengers, like everyone else. War torn apart the city of Pagoren instantly, leaving everyone lost, scared and in need of shelter. The first few days, Pavle went out and gathered as much supplies as he could, enough to keep everyone fed by exploring abandonned buildings and trading with their savior Franko, always ready to barter when needed and always looking to help. Katia would negotiate best with him and get the most out of it. One day, a couple kids came to their shelter, demanding bandages for their sick mother, bandages they didn't have. They had to unwillingly turn down the poor children and concentrate on their own survival, although they would have spared the supplies they needed if they had it. Days went by and the children came back soon enough, demanding urgent need of bandages once again. They had to be turned down with a heartfelt ""sorry"" for the second time. They came back much later, in dire need of help. Their mother was slowly succumbing to her injuries and needed someone to carry her to the hospital as soon as possible. Of course the group agreed and the mother was saved thanks to their kind gesture. From that day, they would help everyone who needed it and sacrifice their own survival for the needs of others, no matter the cost, their humanity wouldn't be lost. Soon after, a man named Roman who had deserted the militia came in need of shelter, they agreed to let him in and so they had another mouth to feed but another guard for the night. They went through a lot of close calls trying to secure their humanity, it would have been easy for them to just loot the house of other survivors and steal whatever they needed, but they simply wouldn't resort to such atrocities. Instead opting for the much more dangerous routes, cleaning up a warehouse of thugs and bandits, claiming it for their own and avenging the death of Olek the priest at the Church.The first skirmish would prove to be surprisingly easy for Pavle only getting wounded killing the criminals with only a knife in hand. The man felt no remorse for killing such scum of the earth and everyone in the neighborhood felt safer knowing one less group of bandit was wandering around at night. Suffering from his injuries, he would be replaced at night by Katia, having enough space in her inventory to carry the same amount as him. Time would get tougher as war raged on outside, blocking access to many routes and giving them less options to gather supplies.Investigating the Church one night and learning of the fate of priest Olek, she decided to follow Pavle's example and take care of the bandits once and for all and as luck would have it, she did it without suffering any major injuries, axe in hand. The place turned out to be a worthy risk to take and gave them enough supplies to last for a while. Luck would smile on them and with every good deed, came more surprises and hope of better days. Gathering enough supplies from the cleared warehouse and church to reinforce security, secure enough food for days and building an arsenal good enough to ensure their suvival. Books would keep them entertained and the discovery of a broken guitar brought music back into their life, the music of the radio would become redundant at times and everyone but Bruno knew how to play. They even endured the lack of cigarettes and coffee and had plenty to go around. Lady Luck was truly upon them. Then Winter came....blocking even more territories to explore and once again making options thinner.One night, while out scavenging for wood and supplies at the construction site, an almost fatal encounter for Pavle arised and the army almost shot him down, wounding him severely and causing him to be bed ridden...Katia took over meanwhile and did her best to gather all the supplies they needed. Heating up the shelter became a priority and everything else would be gained through trade and barter. Thankfully for them, it was her specialty. She kept them fed, safe and secure for most of winter, that is until she was injured too while on a run...For a time, Roman took the job over, which wasn't easy since his bag wouldn't carry as much as both Pavle and Katia, who would remain bedridden for most of the remaining winter...The times were tough but helping other survivors ensured them enough to survive winter and the harsh time, building two heaters to last during the cold season and harvesting as much fuel as possible at both the church and construction site.Most routes would be blocked due to snow and the options were few and far between...yet, they still wouldn't resort to commiting any atrocities towards other fellow survivors. The part of town that was closed previously became once again available as snow slowly started melting and the promise of unexplored territories became accessible once again.They would loot everything the town had to offer and when the surge of crime came around, they had enough to reinforce doors, keep themselves fed, healthy and stocked on weapons and ammunition. Which would still be a challenge for them in the end, having looted most of the town and having less and less options for survival, yet they still wouldn't resort to commiting crimes or murder. Times became tougher, but they decided to built a small trap to ensure enough food to go around. Crimes became more violent throughout the city of Pagoren and the times became more than tough...they had almost no options left and they still wouldn't resort to the easier options, sacrificing their humanity wasn't an option.Much worse, ammo was running out and the insurance of protection during nightime became more and more of an urgency. Yet, they somehow managed to survive through it all, through bartering with settlements instead of stealing from them, risking their lives when needed and sparing the innocents, the declaration of ceasefire came around the corner. They had made it. All of them, through thick and thin. We had survived, This War of Mine. More importantly, we had retained our humanity.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Stories like these are rare and this one will be treasured by me forever. I believe that no matter the sacrifices, helping each other out in times of need is better than being at each other's throat.War is ugly, War never changes, yet, war is sadly a necessary evil, without it, someone is bound to start one anyway and the cycle will never end...If only it didn't exist or at least wasn't an option.This War of Mine is one of the best Anti-War game i've played in my life, portraying the true casualties of war and the people that simply tried to survive through it, fighting for simple survival, day after day. I bought the DLC and i'm glad to know that the money will go to those who need it, no matter the sum, its a worthy cause. 11/10 would survive and fight to retain my humanity once again.			"

												What do you think when you hear ""War game.""Most think FPS titles like Call of Duty and Counter Strike. But this is a war game, and it's not a FPS (Surprising I know.) In this game you play as not the elite soldiers who roam the city, or the sniper perched in his nest, but the little slug in the garden that is the civilian.(TL;DR A war game, but not a FPS.)Overall good game 8.5/10			"

												I've had the game for about a week now. I've put 10 hours into it during that time. I loved all of it.I hated myself for doing what I had to do. I was angry at being forced into these situations. I was dumbfounded when I wasn't as careful as I thought. I was humbled when lives where ended. I was fearsome to those who wronged me. I was kind to those who were worse off than me. I finally saw the end of war. I regretted a few deaths. Some were unavoidable. I resented some of those who survived. The war ended, and my shelter was more than a graveyard.			"

												This game is quite depressing, you start with 3 survivors, which is randomly chosen for 1 of them, but has a chance to have wounded or sick at the very 1st day(thanks to my first play, which is dumb).It's sneaking mechanics are really good, sometimes you can insta kill people if they don't spot you(they should fix that btw, if I axe'd someone in the back and they instantly died, they shouldn't be able to call for help.)It's AI combat is somewhat dumb unless you get other survivors(which I haven't experienced more than 3 survivors at a time because I would make it to about day 7, get to a almost impossible place to be because they would have the upper hand cause ♥♥♥♥ all.I would love this game even more(after I saw all the survivors from a guide) where you can make your own survivor, like add people you know into the game, give them hinderances(like what if one is a alcholic war vet, etc etc.)Other that from the dumb AI chance fights(which basically discourages any fighting whatso-ever and making this a sneak game, but having guys that excel in fighting)(I mean, I love sneaking, but there are points when I need to kill to leave)This game also is nice mostly because of basically the morality system, like it's tedious after the 3rd depression of a situation you couldn't avoid, but still, lemme tell you a excerpt from my blights and travels:I came to a church, St Mary's Church to be exact, with Katia, a trader that I have grown quite a fondness to because if I was in a situation for barter, she could turn cigs into pure gold, anyhow, I went up and the wounded priest there thought I was a bandit, so he tried to push me away and scream.I got scared, so I pulled out my shovel and hit him, he died almost instantly, a man came from the cellar, and screamed ""WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!"" then charged at me with a knife, I had to murder him to, women and children came screaming to what I have wrought to them, I did only thing I knew how to do, I needed supplies and if that would mean either butchering them or stealing them and leading them to starve.I well, slaughtered them, then proceeded to take all the food I could get, Katia was broken for a few days, I force fed her Moonshine to make her feel better...She is still sad on this run today, I feel like♥♥♥♥♥♥for kinda what I did.It's true what they say, Innocence is the first casuality of war.This game gets a solid 8/10 solely for the story.

												To start off, let's talk about the artwork of the game. For being a sidescrolling click and point, it does have a sense of dark, somber beauty. Much like Limbo, the game has a bit of a darker visual aspect, leading to the automatic connection of absolute despair. Character models are fairly well developed and the environments are put together in a way that feels war-torn. While you won't see every brick your survivors are moving, visually, it does a fantastic job of setting the scene.The soundtrack for this game is one of the few players might not automatically turn off. The music score to this little gem is outstanding and again, definitely helps set the tone for the world they'll find themselves exploring. The general sound effects are also nicely done, players are never long forgetting that the reality is that of mortars, snipers, and machine guns.As stated above, it is a point and click survival game, ran in real time. Players will have a certain amount of hours (roughly 10 minutes of actual time, I believe) for survivors to build, cook, eat, catch up on extra sleep, etc. At night, players will have to send someone out for supplies, while maintaining a defense and resting up extra survivors. Sleep deprivation is an extremely dangerous reality and can affect numerous things from speed, to combat capability.This is where the moral issues arise, when players find themselves desperate for food or materials to simply light a fire. Yes, they could attempt to break into that military base that has a fully stocked kitchen and extra niceties scattered about, but is it worth the danger? On the other hand, perhaps that group of well armed thugs needs to shuffle the mortal coil, as it were. Then again, maybe players find themselves outside the homes of couples and survivors that simply want to try to make the best of things - surely you couldn't steal from the sick, elderly, or infirm, right?Those are the choices ""This War of Mine"" puts players in, every time you go out to find resources, you'll be denying them to someone else. Very few areas of the world are abandoned, there will be no shortage of military or rebel forces, as well as local militias and bandits. Of course, there are those that wish to trade for your goods as well, if you've got what they need.But that's where I found a few flaws with the game, or maybe a few flaws with myself. The game gives you no options, there's no choice, it's steal/kill or die. Even in my attempts to quickly set up an industry of sorts, to become self-sufficient in at least one aspect to lighten the load, I found myself always at odds with my resources. That's a very good thing, however (and this is the big one for me) the game inherently believes characters to be of ""good"" nature.If you find yourself in a situation of fight or flight, the combat system is fairly simplistic but you'll likely find it easier to ambush your targets. But be warned!, each ""innocent"" you kill leads your whole group into depression - every ""innocent"" you steal from affects morale as well. Oh, and speaking of stealing, there's only two ways to handle NPCs. Either leave them alone (and if you're a ""bandit"", they'll flee) or kill them. There's no option for stickups, you /have/ to murder. But again, even if you were simply defending yourself, if they weren't a brigand or military, your characters will suffer.That's where I have my biggest concern with the game. I understand that the game wants players to be ""good"" but when every choice you make is generally ""the best of the worst"" and your characters are constantly falling into depression (or broken) status, it puts a spin on the game that just isn't, in my opinion, totally necessary. Yes, the death(s) maybe should hang on the character that performed the deed, but it /is/ war. War is ugly, and ""This War of Mine"" pulls no punches in reminding us of that.Overall 9/10 This game really wants me to like it, and I do absolutely like it and highly recommend it to others. I just have issues with it's moral areas - But then again, maybe that's something with me, not the game.			"

												Quite different from anything I tried before and well worth the money for that reason alone I think. The game has you trying to survive - and be prepared to play it like that. There is no save. You live and die by your own foolish mistakes, which a lot of us are unused to. But at the same time that is what drives home the ambiance, the feeling of futility and makes everything come together here. This is war. I tried to save an innocent woman by attacking a soldier with a crowbar. Sure I got in the first hit - but then he promptly shot her(my character).. And.. then she was gone. I was lucky i could loot some of her items the next night, but ... gone. No save. No load. and *that is the point of the game*. If you do stupid stuff.. you have to deal with it. So.. Enjoy it. How would you do? What risks will you take? And are you always willing to play the hero if it means loosing your own life? Find out here :) I give this game a very good/excellent rating and absolutely recomend it if you are after something different. It might NOT be for you if you want a lot of action. Think more along the lines of barther, scavending, sneaking and pure discovery.			"

												tl;dr: Incredible game that allows for a level of player involvement and decision making that isn't easily found anywhere on steam.Pros:- Pretty much everything. Buy this game.Cons:- Crashes for me when alt-tabbing out of fullscreen. - Permadeath isn't for everyone. You can trick the game by pressing alt+f4 if you die, as the game doesn't save instantly.- Location layouts change, but only slightly. because of that you gain a significant advantage once you know what a location looks/plays like and how dangerous it will probably be.- you might decide to kill/rob innocents at some point in the game, definitely not suited for all agesA game that changes you and the way you play it in a way that... is incredibly gripping and intense. What makes this game so great aren't it's features, which are decent and fun, but the stories that happen without any prescripted storyline. It is your decision to kill/rob/help people and there are severe consequences, no matter what your decision will be.Apart from that it is a solid and fun survival experience that involves a lot of ressource management and strategy as well as sneaky stealthmissions and scavenging runs during the night. You will have to deal with hunger, sickness and the cold of winter and if you decide to fight someone, your wounds will take days and sometimes valueable bandages to heal. Not every fight is worth picking in this game and most fights happen either out of desperation or cold-blooded calculation. The game looks at you with a sad look in its eyes and says: ""Look what war turned you into."" After only a few hours I had become so involved I couldn't believe it, I even made a video narrating what had happened to me.  Here, let me share it:


YouTube™ Video: Raider's Tale (This War of Mine) - shortstory by Matt Gambler 

			Views: 507		

			NOTE: It is strongly advised to watch the video before reading this. Not your typical video description but I didn't want to ruin the end with my happy voice. :P Wow, what a ride that was!		

I haven't beat the game yet but I most certainly will. Perhaps even multiple times. NOTE: The Warchild-DLC includes only art that can be seen in the game. The money goes to charity and you get the same content no matter how much you decide to pay.			"

Review of ""This War of Mine""[This review is based on my own opinion!]First Impression:This War of Mine have a depressing feeling. You start with 3 People , they have their own skills. With these skills you can help them during the war. It isn't easy to manage all these things sometimes you haven't enough food or medicin or something else. It's  hard because when you want something to eat you have to kill. Graphics:The Graphics is drawn. It is really impressive! But it is not colorful. That makes the athmosphare so depressing.Sound:The Sound is depressing too. But! But its very well done with istruments. The Music fits very well into This War of Mine.Gameplay:You have to manage three people with different skills, these skills can be used for the best loot. You have to kill for survivaling during the war. You can makes different things for example water or heating. You need parts for weapons or something else.Graphics:  8,5/10Sound:      8/10Athmosphare: 9/10Gameplay: 8/10Frustationfactor (less is better): 4/1079/100 PointsMark: 2-My opinion at the end:I recommend ""This War of Mine"" because it remind that war isnt always a good thing. Not everyone is a solider! Keep that in mind!timatthi.xyz			"

												It took me ~7 hours to get through my first playthrough and I've emerged with a recommendation.This War Of Mine is set in a civil war, where you play as the civilians, instead of the well-trained health-regening super soldier, and it managed to set that atmosphere very well indeed.The days are spent tending to the needs of your group - hunger, sickness, gunshot wounds, incessant whining about lack of cigarettes or coffee, crippling depression due to the fact you had to rob old people to survive - and the nights are spent either scavenging the surrounding locations or telling everyone to stay put, all the while hoping the next day doesn't come with a notification about a raid you've endured, during which you lost those last three pieces of uncooked rat you'd been saving.The resources in the game are scarce, added to by the fact that you can only carry so much when you go scavenging. There were days where I felt relieved that we had enough food, water and fuel (♥♥♥♥ winter), and there were others where everybody was starving, some were wounded, and since last night's search hadn't given me what I needed, I was sitting and just hoping that the trader would come by to barter... and feeling great relief when (or, rather, if) he did.It is that tension of ""How screwed are we?"", plus the choices needed to be made in resource management that I think really drew me in, because there's just never enough - someone could get sick, someone could rob you, some children might ask for your medicine because their mother is dying, and so on.In a word, it's an experience - a ""one day at a time"" simulator - and, even if I leave it at just these 7 hours, I don't regret my purchase in the slightest. The game has that portal-esque vibe to it, in the sense that you feel that the entirety of the short experience was worth it (though not in any ""Hah! You said CAKE!"" kind of way).If you can get the game on-sale (I bought mine for 6,50 euros), I thoroughly recommend it, although I'd understand hesitating when it's at full price.P.S. Get the War Child Charity DLC. You get to help those in need AND get an achievment for it. It's a win-win.P.P.S. ♥♥♥♥ winter.			"

												Joined together by fate, three victims of war decided upon a torn down building as their new shelter for the post apocalyptic tragedy they must endure. Time is of the essence as they brought down piles of junk to scavenge as much as they could. Collecting scraps of wood, left over first aid kits and dried meat; anything that helped them survive another day would be an uplifting gift in this terrible place they used to call home.After rallying together of what they could, one of the members has decided that a local abandoned home should have the necessities for them to begin their survival. Confused, distraught and still struggling of what to do in this new world of hopelessness. Pavle began his first steps up towards a heavily-shelled home across the street. He peered through every door that was ajar, only to find the single creature inhabiting this home was a rat that looked starved as he was.Taking what he could, Pavle gathered wood and scraps of leftover food as he headed back towards shelter. He realized that this would become his new job, and prayed that the military would someday save him.Greeted by the echoes of his footsteps, Pavle sets aside the new-found materials for Bruno to make use of. Pavle knew he wasn’t smart, nor did he have the social aspects to ever fit in with his colleagues. As his facial features often confused people that he was always angry. However he always deemed himself an optimistic character, with a lean and fit physique that allowed him to compete in sporting competitions.Unfortunately Bruno was the complete opposite. Smart, overweight, unhealthy smoker, unsympathetic, but nevertheless a chiseled chef. An intensive scholar in the culinary arts, Bruno believes this was his time to show his skills for the purpose of survival.Katia remained upstairs in one of the bedrooms as she fell ill during the war. Thankfully Pavle was able to come back with fever medications on the way back from the scavenge. With no medical supplies going through the borders due to war conflicts, she was left with a fever that eventually developed into many days of sleepless nights and exhaustion. Katia broke down in tears, relieved and outraged that a solution to her pain was only few houses away. But with the paranoia of being shot by militia, there was no chance she would try to wander alone.Bruno would have left her to die, but her plea for help wasn’t a plea. It was a bargain, never has Bruno ever seen someone with nothing but a thin strand supporting their life-line; can convince him to help such a person. He was convinced to help this woman, as he found her characteristics one day could be useful against merchants.Weeks have passed as scavenging, falling ill, and single meals a day were a tireless struggle for survival. Often there was not enough food for two people, and a decision was made that the person off night-guard was the one who skipped a meal for a deal of 6 hours of sleep that night.Not too long ago, a young man in his 20’s requested shelter in their home named Roman. Roman was a former militia but Bruno wasn’t willing to let out personal details of his past to the others. Bruno, being the conniving chef that he was, set Roman off to raid the home that was just on the outskirts of war. He told them that the occupants of the house were corrupted soldiers and that opening fire through the front door would guarantee for bullets to catch most of them.Roman performed what he was told. Roman didn’t know what lied behind those doors except knowing there were soldiers ready to kill. Roman opened fire until the voices behind were silent. He heard nothing but ringing in his ears. Finally opening the door, he realized what he had done.Gathering what was left of the home, he came back with two days of food, and supplies that would guarantee a new contraption that would help on the fight for survival.Greeted by the warm light what now was home, Roman felt nothing of it. He simply took his rewarded dinner and headed upstairs. Katia despite her business approach to every situation, felt there was more to Roman’s scavenge that night than just a raid. She was expecting Roman to stay behind closed doors for a while, but to her surprise. He did not. He told her everything. Katia couldn’t believe it. She didn’t want any of this. She hoped that the military wouldn’t find out or they would be executed on the spot.Roman is now found guilty for slaughtering an elderly couple. They died being ripped to shreds by bullets as they sat next to the fireplace. This was too much for her and felt this needed to be discussed with everyone else. Pavle wasn’t able to comprehend the situation, he turned his head and pretended it never happened.Bruno had no words to say.The next morning, Roman was found kicking and beating Bruno down the steps of the house. Half his life bar remained as Katia tried to restrain Roman from continuing any further. Words were still being thrown at Bruno as he Bruno tried escaping from his wrath. Roman felt hopeless.As Katia left to be chosen for the nightly scavenge, Roman hung himself that night.Everyone was devastated except Bruno. He simply felt sad that there were no cigarettes left in the cabinet. Katia was found upstairs again having a mental breakdown. Pavle refused to get out from bed as well. Low on food, Bruno knew he had to do the scavenging tonight.Although as Bruno walked up the door, a stranger on the other side knocked.Day 31 This War of Mine "

												This game is fresh and new; I greatly enjoy it.It's a post-apocalyptic side scroller that focuses on survival, crafting, and moral decisions.I can not stress enough how well this game was made for being an indie title.The experience is immersive; I found that I had lost 3 hours of my day in what felt like 30 minutes.I would recommend this game for the survival minded few.A few of my experiences:1.) I sent one of my survivors to a hospital to find some food and medical supplies. Armed only with a shotgun and a handful of rounds, I load up on all I can loot and was about to make my way out of the building. I was eyeing a guard and saw that he had an AK-47 looking assault weapon... I wanted it, oh boy did I want it. I made the mistake of pulling my shotgun out and pumped the guard with 2 slugs. He fell over in a bloody mess. I instantly felt remorse, but had a satisfied feeling of obtaining a much more viable survival tool. I then heard footsteps pounding overhead. I made my way towards the exit of the clinic before I was stopped by two guards with automatic assault rifles. Without question they both lit up my character, fifteen rounds each and he slumped over striving for a last breath. I lost a friend that day.I personally felt bad for my actions. One of the few games that is able to instill emotions other than high adrenaline and rage inducing mechanics. I am in love.2.) A runaway theif appeared at the doorstep of my safehouse. Begging for someplace to stay, so I allowed the woman into my home. It was getting dark and I had to make plans for the night. I decided to send the woman out on her first mission to gather supplies and armed her with a knife. She made her way to a quiet house and opened the front door. From within the house a loud cry rang out. ""GET OUT OF MY HOME."" cried an old man jumping out of his armchair. He approached the woman and demanded that she left. Showing no mercy, the woman pulled out the knife and with one flick of the wrist, plunged the cold steel into the man's throat spewing forth a ribbon of red silk. The old man's wife, hearing the commotion decided to enter the room and witnessed her husband's corpse hit the floor. Scared for her life, the old woman ran for the back door. However, she was too late. One swift prick and the knife entered her spine. She died before she hit the floor. The woman took everything the couple owned and fled back to the safe house.I sincerely felt bad for these people. However, I need to survive. I was surprised to see the impact it made on the character and the rest of the party. For I was not expecting such an in-depth experience.			"

												This War of Mine: A different perspective on war...Unlike most games based on war which are based on the POV's of soldiers, in This War of Mine you play as innocent civillian(s) that are just simply trying to survive. Despite which characters you have, each have their own unique stories and personalities that you'll learn more about as the game progresses. As the player, you have a lot to focus on to ensure the survival of your characters such as food, scavanging supplies, maintaining proper temperature, preparing for raids, etc... Of course the central mechanic of this game is decision making, and you'll be facing a lot of tough ones all throughout, as the game does a really good job at testing your morality: Are you willing to give away useful bandages to a wounded mother? Will you rob people for their medications to help your dying friends? Are you going to kill innocents for their valueable supplies? These are just a few of the many questions you'll be asking yourself while playing. You have to be very thoughtful about what you choose to do as your characters will face the mental consequences of your decisions (ex. becoming depressed, start to fight with each other)If you're into survival/strategy games, be sure to try out This War of Mine. Definitely worth the money, and has great replay value as well!			"

												If you look for fun, you are wrong here. However, the game is compelling and incredibly captivating.No other game manages to make you feel like a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥for taking things you need. It sets perspective to the FPS of the world, where you mindlessly blow heads of and get points.The setting is perfect. No zombies or other supernatural ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that would taint this idea. It feels very harsh and incredibly satisfying at the same time. At least if you manage to have something good happen to you (which is very very rare)It has some flaws. If you managed to set yourself up well enough, you can just stay home for a long period of time without worrying about anything but water. Luckily, a ""traveling merchant"" will take care of that need, making it nigh unnecessary to go scavenge.Sometimes it feels a bit clunky in regards to the movement, but it's very minor and mainly nitpicking.Definitely recommend to anyone that loves a real survival game, where killing everything is an option, but not necessarily one you want to take It's not a lightly made decision to shoot the older sister just trying to protect her family, or rob the old couple that can't defend themselfes and just wants to live through the war "

												Really touching game. Personally for me or maybe for us who haven't experienced war before this game bring us to that atmosphere. When food and materials become rare and hard to get, what will you do? kill or be killed? barter for it or scavenge it in very dangerous area? this is what we learn from this game. War is not Fun, war is evil and war bring suffering for everyone. This war of mine do make me enjoy the whole experience during playing it and understand what people suffer and do during the war. during gameplay the decision you make affect the whole game. So don't expect when you kill some bandit your character will become sad and even think is it even necessary. For those who look for survival games, wanted to experience war like atmosphere that feel by the people during war or just find this game interesting and want to play it. i can guarantee you will love this game. give it 10/10 for me and peace for the world. let's hope for no war happen anymore.:) "

												This game is fresh and new; I greatly enjoy it.It's a post-apocalyptic side scroller that focuses on survival, crafting, and moral decisions.I can not stress enough how well this game was made for being an indie title.The experience is immersive; I found that I had lost 3 hours of my day in what felt like 30 minutes.I would recommend this game for the survival minded few.A few of my experiences:1.) I sent one of my survivors to a hospital to find some food and medical supplies. Armed only with a shotgun and a handful of rounds, I load up on all I can loot and was about to make my way out of the building. I was eyeing a guard and saw that he had an AK-47 looking assault weapon... I wanted it, oh boy did I want it. I made the mistake of pulling my shotgun out and pumped the guard with 2 slugs. He fell over in a bloody mess. I instantly felt remorse, but had a satisfied feeling of obtaining a much more viable survival tool. I then heard footsteps pounding overhead. I made my way towards the exit of the clinic before I was stopped by two guards with automatic assault rifles. Without question they both lit up my character, fifteen rounds each and he slumped over striving for a last breath. I lost a friend that day.I personally felt bad for my actions. One of the few games that is able to instill emotions other than high adrenaline and rage inducing mechanics. I am in love.2.) A runaway theif appeared at the doorstep of my safehouse. Begging for someplace to stay, so I allowed the woman into my home. It was getting dark and I had to make plans for the night. I decided to send the woman out on her first mission to gather supplies and armed her with a knife. She made her way to a quiet house and opened the front door. From within the house a loud cry rang out. ""GET OUT OF MY HOME."" cried an old man jumping out of his armchair. He approached the woman and demanded that she left. Showing no mercy, the woman pulled out the knife and with one flick of the wrist, plunged the cold steel into the man's throat spewing forth a ribbon of red silk. The old man's wife, hearing the commotion decided to enter the room and witnessed her husband's corpse hit the floor. Scared for her life, the old woman ran for the back door.

												10/10She's not well, i can tell. She couldn't hide it even if she wanted to. Her mood is broken. Despite all attemps to bring her food, talk to her, telll her to get some sleep. She just seem destroyed by the war. sometimes she keeps to herself at night and doesn't sleep at all. Poor little thing. I wonder, maybe seeing Pavle risk his life for us every night is starting to lay heavy on her heart. I see the light in her eyes every morning when he makes it back. I must admit... I dont know what we would do without him. the fella is doing a whole lotta of good for us.And to make things worse, Bruno is always complaining, i want this or that. I want some cirgarettes. Why is it so cold in here, while Pavle is just trying to get some rest from the hellish night he just had. i can see the look on Pavle's face when Bruno keeps on babling about his cigarettes and his restauant. Were all getting more tired everyday, and hearing Bruno's complaints just doesn't help. I really dont know why Bruno is complaining, he always insist to stay home for the night... claiming we need someone on overwatch. he's right, but i bet Pavle would gladly take a shift or two on watch sometimes. But Pavle goes out almost every night, for him... for us... Heck even for strangers. I never heard Pavle complain about going out at night. I really dont know how he does it, the bandits, the poor peaople begging in the streets, not to mention the snipers who just use the civilians as target practice. Two nights ago, two kids came by our shelter asking for medications. They said that their mother is dying. they said, we just need a few sir, please help us. I could see the way he had a hard time telling them that we didn't have anything. But he said come back tomorow i might stop by the hospital if the weather is right. that poor little girl seemed so happy. Pavle tried to smile back, but he knew too well that the chances that he finds medication were slim...Last night Pavle came back with blood stains on his jacket, he said it was nothing to worry about, its just a scrach. He went strait to bed without even eating, not to mention his guitar, he usualy always plays guitar before going to sleep. I wonder what happened, He must see all sorts of nasty things out there. He never really tells us what happens when he's out. I guess he knows how sensitive Katia is, She doesn't need to hear all the gruesome details of what's out there.God i wish this war is over soon.Today Pavle brought back coffee for Katia, he knows how much she loves it, but nothing does it. i think she really misses her familly. she's falling more and more into dark thoughts. She even told me that she wanted to end it herself... whats the point she said. She then went on how she was sick of it all, how she couldn't take the hunger anywmore.Those kids, they never came back, she mumbled with tears in her eyes. Those poor chiIdrens....I kept on telling her that we needed her. that we all need each other in order to survive this hell. Even made her a coffee, she didn't even look at it. And then Bruno came in the room, i could see it in his face, he was angry, he said, I've never seen you bring anything special for us! I swiftly replied that Pavle might not bring what you want, but he always brings what we need. Then the argument escalated on how he could have made room for something more... useful. Pavle just kept his cool, never said a word, then Bruno said, WELL!, AREN'T YOU GONNA SAY SOMETHING! Pavle just looked in Bruno's eyes, and pulled two cigarettes from his jacket. Bruno just sat there for a moment...and said... You Know, we can sell those for a pretty good amount of food... Pavle then said, i found some veggetables on my way back, would go well with the frozen rats you found. Im sure you can make it taste like the stew my mother used to make,,, after all, you're the Chef. Bruno smiled and left the room. Katia stopped crying and we went on... for another chapter...i will survive... this war of mine... "

Reviews for the Deaf and Hard of HearingOverall Rating: 6/10Gameplay Rating: 6/10Accessibility Rating: 7/10NotesOverall rating is a combination of the gameplay (mechanics and story) and accessibility (how the game includes deaf/hoh gamers).  If you disagree with my take on the game or if something is factually incorrect, please leave a comment below!Low gameplay time on steam; majority of gameplay was from DRM-free version.Game OverviewWhen you start This War of Mine (TWOM), the main menu consists of one primary button: survive.At its heart, TWOM is a survival game.  In it, you must guide the actions of a small group of people as they struggle to survive amidst a war that is ravaging their city.I would recommend this game as a good purchase when on sale.  It is difficult to get started, interesting to play and think about, but ultimately repetitive after you understand the game mechanics.Gameplay MechanicsTWOM is primarily point-and-click.  While you can control zoom levels, the game field is larger than the what is shown at the furthest zoom level out, so you must use the mouse to scroll the screen, which can be annoying.Each new game puts you in a slightly randomized house with a different amount of resources in each iteration.The game's economy is interesting and slightly complex, but ultimately quite limited.  The sheer number of different types of items is where the economy's complexity comes from, and the challenge lies in trying to balance what you bring back on scavenging missions due to limited space and the need to have a variety of items.  Once you understand the system, however, it is not difficult to become self-sustaining and to even develop an excess of tradable resources.Upgrade mechanics in the game are decent, but sometimes too costly for the benefit.StorylineTWOM takes place in a war ravaged (presumably) eastern European nation.  The charm of this game comes from its story more than anything else.  It is possible to simply play the game without getting invested in its story, but why waste the money?The survivors each have a back story and unique traits that can complement the abilities of others to make a stronger team.  Further, each character reacts to the moral decisions you make as the war progresses and some events are triggered.  TWOM frequently nudges you to consider the terrible impacts of war on the innocent people that live in and around it.Gameplay RatingThis War of Mine is rated 7/10 for gameplay.  You will restart multiple times, and, after some point, the game's difficulty will fade away, diminishing its overall replay value.Accessibility OverviewGame OptionsGame options are available before starting a new game, but the menus may be difficult to see due to being low contrast with the background.  Look for the cog wheel in the lower right corner.Available options are music volume and sound effects in Sound options, resolution, quality, and fullscreen in Video, and localization (language and termperature).One note is that the game uses a stylized 'Pencil Effect' that can be set to high or low.   This may provide a challenge for low-vision gamers.Deaf/HOHPros:+ Dialog shows in text for all speech+ Key sounds are visualized (those that affect game mechanics)Cons:- It is possible to miss game events that may have an accompanying sound if they happen off-screen.Notes:TWOM is playable for deaf/HOH gamers.  Sound is not required to experience the game, since it uses visual cues to represent when your characters are making too much noise while sneaking around.MobilityPros:+ Limited input required - essentially a mouse-only game.Cons:- No options for altering combat mode, game difficulty, or accessibility accommodations for these events.Notes:This game relies solely on gross mouse control and frequent clicking.  In combat situations, which are infrequent, it may be necessary to react quickly and make use of fine mouse control capabilities.Accessibility RatingThis War of Mine is rated 6/10 for accessibility.  Mouse controls may prove an occasional challenge for gamers with mobility issues.  The pencil effect adds an aesthetic to the game, but reduces contrast that may be essential for low-vision gamers.---Visit Games Reviews for the Deaf/HoHhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/gamereviewsforthedeaf "

												Awesome survival game, and in general, one of the better games I have ever played. The developers took great care in making a war torn atmosphere, where you face many obstacles in order to have your characters survive. Obstacles include: managing starvation due to limited food supply, moral choices between killing and letting survive, helping NPC neighbors by giving resources or turning them down, and battling injuries and disease. The game also features crafting as an important part of the game. It's important because it reduces resources needed, enhances weapons and tools, helps with defense of your home from raids at night, and helps fight fatigue and hunger. Every decision seems to have a cause and effect that influences how the game develops. Overall, just a well thought out and developed game.10/10			"

This game have depth and you have to carefully manage what you are doing.

												So Marko dun ♥♥♥♥ed up. He killed. He stole. He was shot. Sick. And he slept in a bed for 7 days recovering from wounds he couldn't patch up because he had no meds, he just focused his entire life on building chairs and beds. Why? Because he liked to decorate. He then proceeded to stand, in place, for 12 days straight, not eating, sleeping, nor recovering from his severe depression, anxiety, starvation, and sleep deprivation. One day, Marko said ♥♥♥♥ you and left. He then came back, stole the last of the food and med supplies I had, killed the rest of my survivors, and became a gang leader for the rest of his days. Marko was a pretty nice guy, but you had to get past the fact that he loved his chairs and beds, and his decorative lifestyle, more than he cares for the others around him. Marko don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about you.			"

												It's a good game very good looking and well made, but not a very long lasting game unless you're really into it. I found myself bored of the game after I just ended up doing the same thing over and over and over again. So you if you get bored from grinding, or things of that sort, fairly easily stay away from this game. Also Some of the characters are clearly better than others so it gets kinda frustrating when you're a hour into a playthrough and you realize that this game could be 10 times easier. I would only recommend this game if it's on sale and even then play the first hour. If you don't like it then just return because the rest of the game is just going to be more of the same Those are my thoughts, my dude.			"

												A little disclaimer here. This is first impression not a review but it is so well done i just have to talk about it.This game is depressing and not fun but it is good that wayI have enough of shooting war game and this is one fresh look. Kudos to the developer for not amking another FPS and shows us the other side of the story. Think of this game like ""Papers please"" and ""Cart Life"" mash together into one and bam you get one very cool idea game. I must say it has a little bit elemet of The Walking Dead as well. Every choice you make will affect what happend the next day My first impression is good and this is what games is supposed to be about. It allows us to explore and immense in the difficult choice in real life without the hassle of going through it in real life without actully going into way. My only complaint? Why no tutorial. Sure it breaks the setup and scene but it would have been nice. However, if you the developer reading this can I make a suggestion? You can put in the tutorial but also allow the option to disable it for hardcore player. I look forward to more games publish by you guys. Let me know and I will get it from you the day you lauynch it.			"

												What a beautiful masterpiece. This game has an accurate graphic design and gloomy but charming soundtrack, what helps you to taste the atmosphere in all its glory. The gameplay is divided into two parts, so you won't be bored. During the game you start to love each of your characters, so you subconsciously worry for them. But what I like the most is that game is based on randomness. And all this is happening during the war where not everyone is a soldier, carrying the sacred meaning.			"

												I first heard about this game through my friend on Facebook. I always had a thing for survival games and when he showed me gameplay of it, I was pretty much hooked.At first, I was kinda skeptical paying $25 (at the time) for this game, but I thought ""Hey, why not?"" And I have absolutely no regrets.The gritty survival aspects, sick survivors, injured people on the roads, other survivors needing your help. It took me a while to get used to the controls and mechanics, but when I did I was completely engrossed in the game. The characters feeling so relateable and immersive, I feel like I'm actually there; often finding myself trying to console them, even knowing they are unable to hear me.The characters just feel so real, you know? Like you're actually there.At one point, I needed food. I decided to raid a small cottage. The old couple were there, begging me not to hurt them nor steal from them. I just wanted them to be quiet. I didn't mean to kill him. I just wanted to make him quiet.I killed him. His wife slouched over his body in dismay, I immediately ran. I actually felt my eyes well up as she ran over to him.Marco just... drunk. And drunk. And drunk.A bunch of pencilesque pixels on the screen had never had any emotional effect on me until I played this game.My only regret, if any, would not be being able to buy this game and the War Child DLC more than once.

												This is a brutal game where it throws you into a city of devastation caused by war and as a civilian you must survive it where each day is a struggle for food, security, heat, medical supplies and much more. It is very atmospheric and it will immerse you into the game's setting with its brilliant sounds and unique characters/group where strangely enough, you become attached to them and when they become injured or sick, you make it your mission to get them through it! It is also a refreshing change from other games where you have an entire armoury at your disposal and you run around shooting. This game requires stealth, clever combat tactics, strategic planning of both supplies and scavenging runs as well as trading items to help further the survival of your group.Sounds: 10/10Gameplay: 10/10Graphics: 10/10Struggle for survival: 10/10Overall: 10/10 "

												I can't ever do this game and why it's unbelievably good, justice. The concept of realistic wars in games never struck me as the kind to hold my attention, yet this game, mixed with its survival elements and its whole new take on what war means and what it does to an individual, has managed to do just that, and has done so extremely well.The game is based on true life events from the Siege of Sarajevo in 1992 (and countless more perspectives I imagine). A video in particular, shows Emir Cerimovic's accounts of what daily life was like, struggles for basic needs (no water, food, electric), what it was like to be involved in war as a child, the unimaginable terrors that come with war, seeing those you believe to be good, turn into monsters when filled with desperation and despair. That video, along with several other videos is what made me buy this in the first place. This War of Mine, on all accounts, did close to what I believe to be justice in trying to convey what it means to survive, what you'll do to survive, and what it truly means to be in something so horrific.If you have some spare time, please go and check out 11bitstudios's YouTube channel and have a look at the game.

												Overall I really like the feel of the game as it views life of war from a completly different perspective. You see the game from the eyes of a civilian like you or I and you must do anything to survive trading, scavanging or stealing. Although not many charcters each of them have something to say about how they feel about the events that happen in your game if you help someone shot by a sniper or you steal from your neighbours. I would recommend this game to people who like surviving and like building up your empire from scratch.			"

												9/10Best survival game I have played in a long time. With few more improvements this could get 10/10 from me. May be add Karma etc and may be some interactions between the characters of the current group... would be awesome. I hope they make another game like this with more awesome features.			"

												This game is by far one of my fav games of 2014. This War of Mine well take your soul down a road that well show what kind of person you really are. To explain this i would like to tell you a story about my first game play exp. It started off with three civi survivors of a brutal war, Two males and a female. I decided to take my female to the church my first night and see if I can recieve any help and get a feel for the game. I arrived at the church to find a priest, where I proceeded to speak to him where he informed me he cant help because he was robbed earlier. I decided to take a look around the church not steeling anything just looking around, when I opened a door into their kitchen i was approached by the priest and his ""crew"" where they then proceeded to beat my character until she was dead. I woke up on day two with only two characters left who are now depressed because of thier loss. Now knowing what I know I decided to take the approach I wanted to take in the first place, I'm going to look out for number one and number one only. I speant the next two days stealing supplys from every where i could to keep my remaining two characters alive. on day 4 I found a super market, inside I found food, water, matts, and two people talking, a male soldier and a female civi. The civi was looking for food and asked the soldier for help. He said he would help but he wants something in return, and that something is sex. she said no and he then proceeded to hit her and drag her out back to take what he wanted. not wanting to lose my supplies I left her to to the will of that soldier and his perverse ways. On day 5 I sent out to look for more supplies in some houses because my other character I left back at the shelter was becoming sick and needed meds but i was caught and they shot my character in back while trying to escape.. I woke up on day 6 with one character left who is now getting really sick. There where some houses with low threat and lots of food and meds so i decided to head there in a last ditch attepmt to stay alive. When I arived I found two very old folks a man and his very sick wife living there. He came up to me and asked what I needed and if I could leave him and his sick wife alone. They where just robbed and didnt have much left he said, but needing meds i decided to rob this old man and his wife blind stealing everything they had, he begged and begged me not to take the meds so his wife would live but i stole them any ways. When I got home back to the shelter my character became very depressed, disqusted with his actions of robbing that old couple. Day 7 would become my last day. Completely disqusted with his actions, his loses, and the way the world is, my last character hung him self and commited suicide ending the game. Because of all that I realized I have dark cold heart because after that hole ordeal if I was that last guy that hole ordeal would not have ♥♥♥♥ed me up that bad haha but to each his own. Great game, Great Story, Good Graphics, and hours upon hours of fun 10/10			"

												I do not approve of war. Do you know why I don't approve of war? It interferes with the production of Turbinium and that makes me angry. When I am angry, people die. That is why I decided to play This War of Mine. I enjoyed seeing what it is like for non-Mars Colonial Administrators to survive in extremely tough conditions. The look and feel is excellent and the plot is surprisingly moving and even made me shed a tear, but that might have been from an unrelated spec of Martian Dust. This game reminds me of Papers, Please in terms of impact, and Zafehouse Diaries in terms of game play (though This War of Mine is far better in every way). Highly recommended. I'm hoping I can find Kuaato in the game and nail that freaky sonofa♥♥♥♥♥.Now stop reading this and get back to the Turbinium mines, before I shut off your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ air.Vilos Cohaagen,Colonial Administrator, Mars Colony			"

												This is a brutal game where it throws you into a city of devastation caused by war and as a civilian you must survive it where each day is a struggle for food, security, heat, medical supplies and much more. It is very atmospheric and it will immerse you into the game's setting with its brilliant sounds and unique characters/group where strangely enough, you become attached to them and when they become injured or sick, you make it your mission to get them through it! It is also a refreshing change from other games where you have an entire armoury at your disposal and you run around shooting. This game requires stealth, clever combat tactics, strategic planning of both supplies and scavenging runs as well as trading items to help further the survival of your group.Sounds: 10/10Gameplay: 10/10Graphics: 10/10Struggle for survival: 10/10Overall: 10/10 "

												I have to admit that i  really had a  fear that this game will be boring after first hour.Have to admit that this one  of the best games i played this year, the art style is amazing and appealing to the setting and the story you form by your actions wont be the same as the last one , your objective is to lead your group of people and survive as you do your daily tasks and run for supplys at night.You can trade with people that come over to your hide out or send your own during nights to trade with others, if you cant trade and supplys are running low you feel desperation as you  dont have any guns to fight the thugs so your actions might lead to raid elderly familys from their supplys and foods and leave them to die insted. Crafting the right tools for the right time and careful planing a head will lead you far yet make the wrong choise and waste your  resources and you will be in grave danger.Note:if you have food i suggest dont let it hang for too long because if you get raided the raiders will aim for it! so feed your men when you can!you can help people or you can turn your back to them, and it puts you through the testing your self what would you do in harsh world like this. definatly give this game 10/10 .

												I can't ever do this game and why it's unbelievably good, justice. The concept of realistic wars in games never struck me as the kind to hold my attention, yet this game, mixed with its survival elements and its whole new take on what war means and what it does to an individual, has managed to do just that, and has done so extremely well.The game is based on true life events from the Siege of Sarajevo in 1992 (and countless more perspectives I imagine). A video in particular, shows Emir Cerimovic's accounts of what daily life was like, struggles for basic needs (no water, food, electric), what it was like to be involved in war as a child, the unimaginable terrors that come with war, seeing those you believe to be good, turn into monsters when filled with desperation and despair. That video, along with several other videos is what made me buy this in the first place. This War of Mine, on all accounts, did close to what I believe to be justice in trying to convey what it means to survive, what you'll do to survive, and what it truly means to be in something so horrific.If you have some spare time, please go and check out 11bitstudios's YouTube channel and have a look at the game.

												I first heard about this game through my friend on Facebook. I always had a thing for survival games and when he showed me gameplay of it, I was pretty much hooked.At first, I was kinda skeptical paying $25 (at the time) for this game, but I thought ""Hey, why not?"" And I have absolutely no regrets.The gritty survival aspects, sick survivors, injured people on the roads, other survivors needing your help. It took me a while to get used to the controls and mechanics, but when I did I was completely engrossed in the game. The characters feeling so relateable and immersive, I feel like I'm actually there; often finding myself trying to console them, even knowing they are unable to hear me.The characters just feel so real, you know? Like you're actually there.At one point, I needed food. I decided to raid a small cottage. The old couple were there, begging me not to hurt them nor steal from them. I just wanted them to be quiet. I didn't mean to kill him. I just wanted to make him quiet.I killed him. His wife slouched over his body in dismay, I immediately ran. I actually felt my eyes well up as she ran over to him.Marco just... drunk. And drunk. And drunk.A bunch of pencilesque pixels on the screen had never had any emotional effect on me until I played this game.My only regret, if any, would not be being able to buy this game and the War Child DLC more than once.

												As you can see by my playtime, I enjoyed this game. Almost too much. For the kind of game that it is, it's pretty much perfect. For being such a simple game, it sucked me in more than most AAA quality games have.You play as a group of civilians that are caught amongst a civil war, and your goal is to survive the conflict. During the day, you care for your survivors' daily needs (such as eating, sleeping, dressing wounds, taking medicine) as well as improving your shelter. You are able to build a modest array of different things to help you make it through the war; a cooking table, a water collector, beds, etc. You're also able to improve your shelter's defenses, which is important, because you will be raided from time to time.At night, you are able to scavange the town, looking for useful supplies. You will need to find materials for crafting, food, medical supplies, and other hings to help in your survival - all the while, trying to avoid the inhabitants of the place that you are raiding.The graphical style of this game adds to the atmosphere of hardship and struggle, and so does the music (which was also excellent). Sound effects are good, and the narrative is very solid. The story somewhat takes a backseat, although you really don't need much more than ""there's a civil war going on right now"". You are able to piece together a timeline of events during the war via news stations on your radio, and you are able to find bits of information about the people that live in this town while you're scavenging, giving the NPC's a lot more life to them. It forces you to see them as more than just something to kill or sneak by; it makes you see them as actual human beings whose lives will be affected by your actions.I would highly recommend this game to anyone that is considering it, it was definitely worth checking out. A very solid 10 out of 10, in my opinion.			"

												A fantastic game that I think anyone interested in game design can learn something from.  A story completly written by the player through his/her actions is something that isn't explored often enough in games.  Where other games stories can make you feel as though you're being led on rails, This War of Mine feels fresh, every time.  Every decision in the game is yours to make, or best of all, to not make.  There are so many different actions and paths you can take thoughout this game, and if you're at all interested in games being ""art,"" This War of Mine is as close as it comes in my book.			"

												Day 9 and all is going well for the four survivors. They've got some barricades up, they've got some building materials, weapons and decent items for trade but they're short on food. Night falls and one of them decides to investigate an apartment that they discovered the night before. He thinks his pistol and four bullets will get him past any hostility. They don't. Day 10 and the three remaining survivors are depressed as they discuss the loss of their companion. They get through the day and send another of their number out to scavenge for food. It's another house this time. When caught breaking in he lashes out with his crowbar and before he can grasp what's happening, a father and son lay dead at his feet. He's mortified, but he takes everything they have because he knows that their deaths are for nothing if he doesn't. On the way out, a shotgun blast from another family knocks him off his feet. He's dead. Day 11, and the two survivors left have not had a good night. There's been a bandit raid on their base. One survivor is badly wounded, the other has fallen sick. Their bandages and medicine were stolen in the raid. Both are now starving to death, because there's still no food.TWoM is a mixture of emotive story-telling and rage-inducing changes in good fortune. Surviving requires a good deal of patience and discipline (or luck). The mechanics are simple enough and the game does look and play beautifully. In places it's frustrating - you'll spend ages gathering supplies and you will find that minor mistakes in judgement can get you killed very quickly. Note that there's only one (auto) saved game permitted, and it's cloud based (if you have this enabled) which means no backing up before a risky raid. On the plus side there's bunch of different survivors that, as you probably expect, have different abilities. After playing with the default three for a bit you get the option to start with different combinations of the 8 or so available. Any of these may also turn up at your door seeking refuge during a given playthrough. Each attempt also randomly generates the locations you can visit and will have different ""events"" as the days roll on. TWoM won't be for everyone, but I'm definitely a fan.			"

												Great worker placement game with a unique theme.  It's sort of two games in one because during the day you're managing resources and trying to tend to the characters' needs while making them do tasks, but then at night you scavenge.  If you like sim games you'll probably like this.			"

												This is one of those games where the characters and the decisions you make are something you will genuinely care about. My second run is so far my best (35 days) and man, it was a rollercoaster and a half. It's so easy to play the good guy and help out everyone you can, however it is very easy to forget that your characters are also trying to survive the war. It was heartbreaking seeing my favourite group member steal supplies and abandon the rest when it seemed the end was near (which it was).The mechanics of the game are pretty easy to get used to and once you get things rolling, the in-game days will pass by over and over until something detrimental happens. This is an extremely addictive game and I would definately recommend this to others. A great $17.99 worth of feels.			"

												A nice change of pace from the countless war games on the market. This War Of Mine focuses on civillians caught up in the middle of a civil war, doing what they can just to get by.By day you fix up your house, take care of your survivors, help people who need aid and trade (if you're lucky enough to get a visit from the trader.)At night you decided if you want to send someone out to scavenge (a must if you want food etc.), you pick from various locations to visit and take what tools/weapons you think you will need.Some of the places are empty and easy, others might have bandits hiding out, some will have innocent people just trying to get by. But all the places have something in common, they have something you want!Killing bandits and taking their stuff is understandable, but stealing and/or killing some innocent people for supplies will result in your groups morale hitting rock bottom!As if depression wasn't enough, you have to manage hunger and the cold on top of it!A fantastic game all round, difficult, but great!

												Not quite sure about this one...and I am quite a couple of hours in. I started over well over three times and am now in day 29 or 30 or something. Although the game mechanics are somewhat simple (you only have so much to do until you run out of new stuff to explore) they are quite addictive. Find food, parts, build stuff and consumables, take care of sicknes, sadness and/or depression. You need to plan in advance. Should the next night be a ""food run"" or do you really need more wood for the upcoming winter? It's basicly a LOT of micromanagement and so far, it is entertaining. There's also a lot of really tough decissions to make. Will you save someone but risk your own survivors lifes? Or will you become desperate and loot and pillage your way through every encounter you make? How will your survivors react to what you do? The good thing is that there is no real good or evil. You have to survive. How you do that is up to you. So either you do whatever it takes or you start to compromise and maybe die. A few cons tho :- Some tasks are really tiresome (build fuel, build water filters...each and every day a new).- Although randomly picked by the game at every start, you soon find yourself lacking in new locations with each new game.- Combat is not really controllable. Sometimes while you clearly clicked on that enemy, your survivor runs past him or fails to perform any strike.- The game aims to be somewhat realistc but it really lacks in possibilities when it comes to scavenging. WHY DO I HAVE TO GO OUTSIDE TO GET SOME WOOD, WHILE THERES HALF A DOZEN PERFECTLY GOOD WOODEN PICTUREFRAMES LYING AROUND IN MY SHELTER?!- Water should really be more important than food but so far you only need it for cooking and making booze. Humans can go quite a long time without food but not without water.Lastly I would really wish for more interaction between your own survivors. There's no internal ""conflict"" to be solved, nor any interaction whatsoever (you CAN let them talk to each other when someone is depressed but that's about it)None the less, the game really can suck you in and it IS entertaining. I still struggle with the fact that I accidently mistaken another scavenger for a ""bandit"" and killed him in cold blood but those are the things that happen in war. He had a gun and he could have used it when he saw my survivor. Sometimes it's better to strike first and ask questions later...sometimes.			"

												This War Of Mine is not the kind of game i have played before and if it wasn't recommended by a friend or being livestreamed by said friend i would probably not have bought it myself. Therefore i bought it not long after its release in November 2014 and have been putting quite a bit of time into it since then.Having said that, This War Of Mine is honestly incredibly gripping and addictive! I found myself having played it 12 hours straight right after buying and installing it without realising just how long i had been playing for. At the time of buying this the game basically started completely randomly every time you start over,  meaning you started with different characters at different seasons in the year with different lengths of conflict each time. In one such scenario or story you would start with just one character in your bombed ruin of a shelter, in another you would start with two characters in winter so your characters were more susceptable to illness.The basic concept of the game is to survive the war with whatever characters you start with. You can craft various worktables in order to make weapons or tools and to brew moonshine or grow herbs and tobbaco to make medicines or cigarrettes. You can also craft beds, chairs, heaters, a cooker etc, but in order to build these you can choose one character to scavenge at night. Of course this means that if you have only one character your shelter is likely to be raided at night and your items stolen. You can also be raided while one of your characters is at your shelter during the night but sometimes they will injure your characters to steal your items.The random characteristics of this game can keep you gripped for hours without realising it and the look and feel of the game are so fitting with the games setting. Since this game has released however the Devolopers have released quite a bit of content for it changing just how your characters stories will play out. Firstly instead of completly random stories that you could start with they implemented the ability for you to choose which story you play which means you can pick which characters you would then start with. This gives you a little more choice as to how difficult or easy you will find playing through the story but anything could still happen and your characters could still all become deeply depressed, starved or terminally ill, or worse murdered.New Features / DLCThe developers have also released a DLC content for this game in which all proceeds go to the War Child Charity and you can choose how much you pay for this content - there are three prices all for the same content and it all goes to charity. This DLC content i believe added 'Graffiti' to the various locations that can be scavenged. The Graffiti are War Paintings and a little information about the paintings histories can be found on the main menu of the game when you first open the game from steam.The Developers had also added at some point a new shelter that your characters can randomly start in, i dont think there is a way of choosing which of the two shelters you start in but both i think have the same amount of rooms / space. Also there have been at least two new scavengeable locations added recently which add interesting new things to see and loot. Lastly (as of writing) the developers had also added in a feature called Scenario Editor in which you can create your very own scenario or story. This allows you to control things such as the length of conflict, when winter comes, how long winter lasts and how severe the winter will be. You can choose how many characters you start out with and you can even choose to make a whole new character and upload an image of your choosing to use as its portrait. This means you can take a picture of yourself and play This War Of Mine as yourself!!All in all this is a fantastic game with awesome developers who are continuously adding new free content and massively supporting their game and i can very highly recommend this game to pretty much anyone because it will honestly keep you playing for many many hours.

I played this game with my 2 friends (Eric&Irfan).We play as 3 person with a different skill .They lived together to survive from the war .We must scavenge in the night , We searching for some foods, meds, or materials.I ever stole foods and meds from a pair husband and wife who are old like my grandma.The next day, they died because there's nothing left to eat.I Feel so bad for this , but how can i survive if i'm not scavenge ? i should scavenge too, because i live with 2 another people . They need foods and medical . And i can't let them die , because we're ""family"" .Like one of my favourite movies said "" Ohana . Ohana means family. Family means nobody left behind ""This game is "" This War Of Mine ""You should decide what you have to do and you did not do .			"

												If you go through my profile you notice of the 250+ games this is the first game where I have really gone after every achievment.  The environmental effects and landscape are truely a work of art and add to the environment and feeling of desperation as you play.Add into this a great story of friendship and struggle and people begin to understand that war is not this great call of duty adventure.  Instead it has effects on others and those involved.  I find that this element is brilliant.  As former US Army I can honestly state that war is not fun.   The game however is despite having a strong message embeded into it.The developers deserve to be making money from this and I truely hope we see an expansion of new game which will have more elements, characters, different buildings and the same moral issues present in this game.In closing...  This War of Mine is a beautiful, artistic, outstanding, amazing game.If you do not buy it and play it and love it...Turn off your computer.  Stop gaming.  This War of Mine:  Full 5 stars of 5.    An epic moral adventure into the hell of war.			"

												First of all this game is unique. It has a great atmosphere and you feel like you are in the apocalypse. The came mechanics are simple and easy to learn. It is mostly designed for console but plays just fine on PC. You have to carefully plan and manage your resources. You have a selection of locations you raid but choose wisely because it can be the difference between life and death. This game has a lot of replay value and will be different everytime you play it. The only negative for me is that is no saving system and the progress is only saved after a full day cycle but there are ways around it if you read the forums. Overall brilliant and a refreshing alternative the the games currently out there.			"

												First 2 hours I was dissapointed by imperfection in detail. But this game is not about perfection, its not a perfect simulator. Its about something else - it tells the story. Story of those who were trapped in this cruel world of war and had to learn how to survive. Once you focus on other things besides the mechanics of the game, you will find this game very powerfull, touching and moving. I spend the whole weeking with it and it left something deep within me.I can only hope for sequel.			"

												This War of Mine is heartbreaking, scary, beautiful, sad and morally challenging. The control system is simplistic unlike its complex story of survival which you must unravel....or die, It really is that simple.With lots of different possibillities this seems like it will have endless replay value as no two stories will ever be the same or include the same characters as before.The downside for me is there is only one save file, I think having the option to stop one story to start a fresh but having the option to go back is missing.This is a seriously impressive indie game. Get it now. "

												This game is hard, without a doubt. From the perspective of suffering civilians, This War of Mine is something you typically set out to play for the survival tactic and the interesting change of story; the portrayal of not soldiers, but the lesser-seen gameplay of civilians in war-strewn cities. The connections grown with each individual character and their situation grow stronger and stronger throughout the game. Reading their growing biography with every passing day, seeing their moods alter based off of current events. If needs for supplies are not met in time, the death impacts everything and it really is powerful. I'm honestly excited to see how The Little Ones DLC plays out and curious to see how it effects the overall gameplay.The atmosphere itself is powerful as well, with an art style that is both aesthetically pleasing but suiting the core aspect of the game; the grimy, cold struggle for survival. The music is the most fitting (and indisputably catchy) music possible. Everything about this game is beautiful and terrible, and I love it. Would recommend to anyone.			"

												This War of Mine is an anti-war game that knows that even serious games are in fact still games.The good:+Every playable character has their own backstory and abilities.+The day/night cycle of upgrading your home during the day and raiding in the night is extremely addicting.+The music is fantastic and the sound design is quite atmospheric.+The emotional moments are experienced through gameplay and can be avoided by skilled players.The bad:-Bandit raids become extremely tedious, which might be the point.-In order to fully understand some characters abilities you need to read the wiki, personally I would never have guessed that the math teacher is better at using cage traps.-The graphics are blurry and gloomy, which was probably done to sell the horrible situation, but I'm not sure I'm sold on the effect.-There are a set number of areas to explore and once you know what happens at a certain area you can get through them much faster.Bottom line:This War of Mine is a game that doesn't sacrifice game mechanics in order to make a point and it makes for a great merging of story and gameplay about the horrors of war.

												An outstanding example of when video games are done right, they can be an incredibly powerful tool to teach. We all know war is THE most savage and destructive thing that can happen, and this game does such an epic job at conveying that atmosphere of fear and desperation. There's so much the devs can add as well, I can only imagine this getting better with time.Resource management, stealth, tactics and action all come together to make gameplay feel so good. There isn't explosions going off in every direction, there isn't flashy colours or shouting, it's a slow-paced game told at a pace to help tell the story and the characters in it, which I love. I think the most tense I've ever found a game is this, when you're desperate for food, you've gone to a dangerous place to find some meat and you're trying to quietly search a house without the crazy bandits hearing you and killing you. THAT. IS. TENSE. Buy this game, it's an experience.			"

												A very interesting game that really makes you feel the outcome of robbing someone...or letting someone die...It forces you into really sad decisions. War is Hell...I guess I should say the story of my group I guess...In the beggining we found each other on this building, we didn't had food or anything. So, we searched each building we could find. Marko was our skilled scavenger, Bruno, me, an excellent cook, and Pavle, a football player, who was a good runner. Marko, on one night, went to this quiet house, he found an old couple which had food and medicine, which we really needed, so he made a difficult choice in stealing some supplies. Time passed... Marko was ready for another run, but little did he know that this was gonna be his last time saying ""I'll see you guys in a bit."" to the others. He went to this church. When he got there he didn't see anybody, but when he went down some stairs 2 guys told him to leave, Marko being a good fellow, told them that he wanted to trade, but the strangers kept insisting on him to leave so they punched him and he fought back, but since he was wounded, sadly the 2 strangers killed Marko...Pavle was devastated even more, since he was already in depression, plus, he was sick and was bleeding. Bruno tried to talk with Pavle, but Pavle wanted to be left alone, so he left. That night Bruno went for a run to scavenge, he got to this school where there was rebel soldiers, he went to the door and was greeted by a soldier who told him to leave, but was willing to trade, so Bruno started walking away, but then he realized Pavle needed medication and bandages, so he went in by force and the soldier told him to stop, but Bruno kept searching, the soldier told him ""I'm gonna let you go this time, but next time you won't be so lucky."" As Bruno was about to leave he heard soldiers screaming ""Hey, you, stop!' from the other side of the building. He ran till he got back to his shelter, but it wasn't over yet... He went to the bathroom and saw Pavle hanging with a note that said ""I can't take it anymore"". Bruno fell to the floor crying and started thinking ""Is suicide the only way out of this hell?"".

												IGN said it best when they said "" 'This War of Mine' might be the war game we need."" I will go one step further and say it is the war game we need.You take the role of citizens of the city of Pogoren, trapped in a bitter feud between militia-rebels and soldiers. Unlike any game I've played or heard of, neither side is ""good"" nor is either side ""bad"". Your job is to survive the bloody conflict. Every single day is a struggle to survive. Who gets to eat? Who gets to sleep in a bed? Who has to risk their life at night to go out into the city? And most importantly of all, can we take life of an innocent? All these are questions you'll ask yourself every day.Before you begin 'This War of Mine' I highly suggest you attempt to get into character. Don't go in thinking ""Oh they're just pixels."" Put yourself in the shoes of each of your survivors and attempt to think what you would do. You'll find yourself truly asking yourself the tough questions.I can't recommend ""This War of Mine"" enough. I will not say I was brought to tears, but this game has made me question what I am capable of. ""War is Hell,"" said Sherman, and he was right. 'This War of Mine' does a better job depicting war than any game to date. There is no glamour, there is no honor. There is survival, and in the end that's all you can ask for.			"

A story completly written by the player through his/her actions is something that isn't explored often enough in games.  Where other games stories can make you feel as though you're being led on rails, This War of Mine feels fresh, every time.  Every decision in the game is yours to make, or best of all, to not make.  There are so many different actions and paths you can take thoughout this game, and if you're at all interested in games being ""art,"" This War of Mine is as close as it comes in my book.			"

												This is one of those games where the characters and the decisions you make are something you will genuinely care about. My second run is so far my best (35 days) and man, it was a rollercoaster and a half. It's so easy to play the good guy and help out everyone you can, however it is very easy to forget that your characters are also trying to survive the war. It was heartbreaking seeing my favourite group member steal supplies and abandon the rest when it seemed the end was near (which it was).The mechanics of the game are pretty easy to get used to and once you get things rolling, the in-game days will pass by over and over until something detrimental happens. This is an extremely addictive game and I would definately recommend this to others. A great $17.99 worth of feels.			"

												A nice change of pace from the countless war games on the market. This War Of Mine focuses on civillians caught up in the middle of a civil war, doing what they can just to get by.By day you fix up your house, take care of your survivors, help people who need aid and trade (if you're lucky enough to get a visit from the trader.)At night you decided if you want to send someone out to scavenge (a must if you want food etc.), you pick from various locations to visit and take what tools/weapons you think you will need.Some of the places are empty and easy, others might have bandits hiding out, some will have innocent people just trying to get by. But all the places have something in common, they have something you want!Killing bandits and taking their stuff is understandable, but stealing and/or killing some innocent people for supplies will result in your groups morale hitting rock bottom!As if depression wasn't enough, you have to manage hunger and the cold on top of it!A fantastic game all round, difficult, but great!

												Oh my, where to begin?This War of Mine places your small group of survivors in a run down building for the duration of a war that's taking place as a setting in the background. You and your companions are victims of circumstance and don't actually affect the outcome of the war or take part in it, you're merely trying to survive. The game frequently asks you to make difficult decisions in order to survive. To what lengths will you go to keep yourself and your friends alive?This War of Mine is a bleak game and very moody. If I had to boil the game down to a gameplay description, I'd say that This War of Mine is a resource and risk management game with survival and stealth elements, base building, worker placement, and heavy theme; but it's so much more than that. Every decision you make comes at a cost. Everything you build costs resources and your nightly scavenging excursions can only bring back so much. Do you build a bed for everyone, or do you hot rack and sleep in shifts? Should you trade your medicine since it's worth a LOT, or do you give it to Katia, who is developing a cold that may get worse?I knew this game had a hold on me the very first time I played it. Winter had set in by about day 30 or so and food had become even more scarce. We had resorted to trapping rats in our patched up house for a meager amount of meat every few days if we were lucky. Pavel, our best and agile scavenger, had been nearly killed while looking for supplies and it made the rest of us sad and scared. We had come to rely on him for bringing back what we needed every night. This War of Mine starts with a random group of 3-4 survivors (randomized each time you start the game anew) each with different skills and potentially different vices as well. Some of the skills I have seen so far include 'good cook,' 'trained in combat,' and 'runs faster.' Some skills seem more useful than others and some I haven't found a use for yet (if there is one). The vices I have seen so far include 'coffee drinker' and 'smoker.' The vices affect a survivor's mood. This makes each playthrough different and challenging because you might end up with a very difficult spread of skills and vices to manage. The game also starts in a random season (hopefully not winter, good luck with that).There is no handholding in This War of Mine, nor is there a tutorial. That said, I never felt like I needed one. The UI in TWoM is simple and effective, elegant even. You always know what you can interact with and how. There is a great deal of trial and error here, in a good way.The game is separated into two phases, the day and the night cycle. During the day, you basically assign tasks to your survivors in real time (and the clock is running during this phase, but I wouldn't say you feel rushed by it; I've always had enough time to complete the goals I set). Maybe you want to build a still to produce liquor for trading (or consuming), or build a bed so you don't have to sleep on the floor. You'll do this in the day phase. Also during the day phase, a traveling trader might stop by to barter with you or a neighbor might come asking for help. You can choose to help or ignore these people. Sometimes people will show up asking to join your group. These are decisions you must weigh carefully, as they will be one more mouth to feed, one more person getting sick that needs medicine, etc. But they might also bring something valuable to the table, that is up to you to determine.You can build a lot of different things in your shelter and everything you can build can also be upgraded with very few exceptions. Some of the things you can build include rainwater collectors, a radio (that works), a still, an herbal workshop for rolling cigarettes (to feed vices and also to trade), a metalworking table for making weapons and tools, and lots of other things.When night falls, you are tasked with deciding who gets to sleep (and where), who should stand guard (if anyone), and who will go out to scavenge for supplies (and where). Other survivors can raid your shelter, so if no one stands guard, there's a good chance they will steal some of your things and this should be avoided at all costs as they can run off with a LOT of stuff if given the chance. Even if you have guards, there's always the chance they can be wounded in these raids. When you decide where to scavenge, you're given a set of locations to choose from, each with a description of what you might encounter there so you can come prepared. A bombed out school may indicate you should probably bring a shovel to dig through rubble piles more effectively. A military outpost may have goods for trade, or they may shoot on sight. There's always a risk everywhere you go. Available locations change over time, as well, with new locations opening up, and some closing due to the war or inclement weather. As far as I can tell, these are heavily randomized for the most part as well.There is combat in the game, including stealth kills and a cover system that I have not experimented with too much yet as I try to avoid combat as much as possible (it's super deadly). Most tools can be used as weapons (crowbars, shovels, axes) and you can also find and repair firearms or trade for them occasionally, but ammunition is rare (but can also be crafted with the right facilities and components). Again though, what are you going to give up to be able to craft your own guns? Heat in the winter? A safe place to sleep?I can't say enough good things about this game. It runs super smooth on my Linux computer and it hasn't crashed on me once. Top notch Linux port from War Child, I'm very impressed!I paid 16,14€ for this game during Steam's Winter Sales and feel that you'll get your money's worth out of it. I've been playing it for almost 30 hours so far and I haven't grown bored of it yet.			"

												All right, so This War of Mine is really good, but has some issues that keep it from being great.The Pros:This the first game I have ever played that give you a realistic look at surviving in a war zone and the things you may have to do to survive. It is brutal, unfair but balanced in strange way. You spend day working around you shelter, using things you found during the night or traded for to make things to trade or upgrade your home. You want to be able to make booze, a major trade item, so water and a distillery are two biggies, with beds up there as well. Also being  able to make crowbars, lock picks, and saws are major important, so get a tool bench asap. During the night, you put people on guard, sleep, or scavenge. You have to balance the needs of everyone, and I found that my people would spend most of the day sleeping, doing a few small odd jobs first things, and the night on guard duty, with the exception of sick or hurt people who got more sleep. Its scary to be sneaking around a war zone, seeing the bombed out ruins of a city, as you try to survive. There are other survivors out there, some civilians, others military, and some will attack you on the spot, or if you go in their stuff, or they will leave you alone.The Cons:You can only send out one scavenger a night, which sucks, and I don't like. I'm sorry, but if I have three or four survivors I would send out two to get stuff and make survival easier, risk vs reward. If i get raided and they kill the one peoson left behind, then thats the price I pay. The game is also very slow during the day, not much happens, and there doesn't appear to be a way to fast forward other than skipping to the night, however if you do that then you may miss a afternoon visitor, person selling something or someone who needs help (the later never game me anything for the help which seemed a bit odd, but I was ok with that, made sense).All in All:I like the game, but it's slow and not for everyone. That being said, this was a war game that we needed, show the other side of the excited blow everything up action. This is what happens to the people and what is left behind when the military rolls through.			"

												As you can see by my playtime, I enjoyed this game. Almost too much. For the kind of game that it is, it's pretty much perfect. For being such a simple game, it sucked me in more than most AAA quality games have.You play as a group of civilians that are caught amongst a civil war, and your goal is to survive the conflict. During the day, you care for your survivors' daily needs (such as eating, sleeping, dressing wounds, taking medicine) as well as improving your shelter. You are able to build a modest array of different things to help you make it through the war; a cooking table, a water collector, beds, etc. You're also able to improve your shelter's defenses, which is important, because you will be raided from time to time.At night, you are able to scavange the town, looking for useful supplies. You will need to find materials for crafting, food, medical supplies, and other hings to help in your survival - all the while, trying to avoid the inhabitants of the place that you are raiding.The graphical style of this game adds to the atmosphere of hardship and struggle, and so does the music (which was also excellent). Sound effects are good, and the narrative is very solid. The story somewhat takes a backseat, although you really don't need much more than ""there's a civil war going on right now"". You are able to piece together a timeline of events during the war via news stations on your radio, and you are able to find bits of information about the people that live in this town while you're scavenging, giving the NPC's a lot more life to them. It forces you to see them as more than just something to kill or sneak by; it makes you see them as actual human beings whose lives will be affected by your actions.I would highly recommend this game to anyone that is considering it, it was definitely worth checking out. A very solid 10 out of 10, in my opinion.			"

												Day 9 and all is going well for the four survivors. They've got some barricades up, they've got some building materials, weapons and decent items for trade but they're short on food. Night falls and one of them decides to investigate an apartment that they discovered the night before. He thinks his pistol and four bullets will get him past any hostility. They don't. Day 10 and the three remaining survivors are depressed as they discuss the loss of their companion. They get through the day and send another of their number out to scavenge for food. It's another house this time. When caught breaking in he lashes out with his crowbar and before he can grasp what's happening, a father and son lay dead at his feet. He's mortified, but he takes everything they have because he knows that their deaths are for nothing if he doesn't. On the way out, a shotgun blast from another family knocks him off his feet. He's dead. Day 11, and the two survivors left have not had a good night. There's been a bandit raid on their base. One survivor is badly wounded, the other has fallen sick. Their bandages and medicine were stolen in the raid. Both are now starving to death, because there's still no food.TWoM is a mixture of emotive story-telling and rage-inducing changes in good fortune. Surviving requires a good deal of patience and discipline (or luck). The mechanics are simple enough and the game does look and play beautifully. In places it's frustrating - you'll spend ages gathering supplies and you will find that minor mistakes in judgement can get you killed very quickly. Note that there's only one (auto) saved game permitted, and it's cloud based (if you have this enabled) which means no backing up before a risky raid. On the plus side there's bunch of different survivors that, as you probably expect, have different abilities. After playing with the default three for a bit you get the option to start with different combinations of the 8 or so available. Any of these may also turn up at your door seeking refuge during a given playthrough. Each attempt also randomly generates the locations you can visit and will have different ""events"" as the days roll on. TWoM won't be for everyone, but I'm definitely a fan.			"

Who gets to sleep in a bed? Who has to risk their life at night to go out into the city? And most importantly of all, can we take life of an innocent? All these are questions you'll ask yourself every day.Before you begin 'This War of Mine' I highly suggest you attempt to get into character. Don't go in thinking ""Oh they're just pixels."" Put yourself in the shoes of each of your survivors and attempt to think what you would do. You'll find yourself truly asking yourself the tough questions.I can't recommend ""This War of Mine"" enough. I will not say I was brought to tears, but this game has made me question what I am capable of. ""War is Hell,"" said Sherman, and he was right. 'This War of Mine' does a better job depicting war than any game to date. There is no glamour, there is no honor. There is survival, and in the end that's all you can ask for.			"

												Break through a door and kill an army man, get praised. Break through a door and kill some poor old guy and his blind/deaf wife, and you're a monster.I just don't see how you can win with a game like this!Honestly though, pretty much 8 hours straight play and I am loving every second of this game.I actually got scared when I had to put my guys in danger, and by god did I hold off on putting them in it until I was desperate and everyone was going to starve if I didn't.This game is engaging, and I lost 4 hours somewhere. I am now in trouble with my wife for coming to bed so late, thanks very much TWoM...			"

												War...war never changes.I've never felt so emotionally invested with an ingame character then I have with the characters in this game, when their depressed I feel a bit down myself, and I try to do everything in my power to make them happy again...well as happy as one can been after murdering three men back to back. At one point it was a real struggle to find food for all four of my characters, so when two died I didn't feel remorse...I-I actually felt happy that their would be now plenty of food to go around. I even went to a supermarket to look for some food, came across a soldier harassing some young women, I watched helplessly as he forced her to follow him and..♥♥♥♥♥♥♥her. I DID nothing to help her, I mean WHAT COULD I HAVE DONE. I was completely weaponless! No don't look at me like that! You have no right to judge me! This is War! You would have done the same thing if you had been in my shoes!			"

												This War of Mine. Only game so far to make me feel like a complete and utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.The premise of the game is that the capital of some made-up country has fallen into a chaos after the country's military sealed it off so as to seal off any supply route for the rebels. You now have to survive in there.The game feels like a sister of FTL. Things are completely random, you may go to the same place a different playthrough. But, one time there may be a drunk soldier trying to ""coerce"" a female looter. Or another time, there may be 3 armed bandits that will shoot on sight. Sometimes though, you may need to go into somewhere that isn't vacated, and you will have to steal in order to survive.Sometimes, sometimes, the game throws a complete curveball from out of nowhere. I sent my scavenger to a house that seemed abandoned, and the game said that they had lots of food. Something I run out on a constant basis. Map loads, and I start trying to go in, but then there are two red spots(The game's take on the modern FPS radar). Well that's not just a rat. More often then not that's a hostile. And without fail, one of them shouts that they are armed and not afraid to fire on sight. So of course, I sneak over the roof and lockpick the door on the balcony. Sneak down the stairs and stab the one person that I saw, that was armed. Instantly one of the doors comes flying open, a woman, and hunches over the dead body, crying. The body on the ground was a man.I didn't kill her since she didn't present any harm.Wandering through the house, looting of course, I saw all sorts of things. Set ups that you could do in your own base, vegetable gardens, bed, all those things. Pictures on the wall of the two previously mentioned. I just randomly came into this house, and killed an innocent that was just trying to survive. I mistakenly went from being a goody two shoes, to a bandit.Goddammit.			"

												This game is such an incredible game to play, it's a game that gives the player such an emotional and eye opening experience that they will never forget as you'll get a good grasp of what it's like for those individuals that are or have been involved in a civil war or a city siege.The game starts off with usually 3 survivors in what looks to be an abandoned apartment building, as it's too dangerous to scavenge during the day due to snipers the survivors are stuck in the shelter during daytime, this is the time where the player must manage his survivors by cooking and feeding them, building workshops, stoves, heaters and any other necessary household equipment to keep the survivors going but all of this requires materials and parts which you can start off by scavenging your own shelter in the beginning of the game but when 8pm arrives that's when it's time to go scavenging for weapons, meds, food, materials and any other essentials to survive the war, during this time only one character can go scavenging as the rest have to stay back at the shelter to either get rest or stay guard against any other rebels that try to break in and steal your supplies.Scavenging areas unlock randomly and simultaneously and when you select one it will tell you what loot is available in that area and if it's dangerous or caution is advised when trying to scavenge the area, it will also let you know if the place is currently occupied by any miltia or armed thugs so the player can best prepare with the appropriate equipment before the player commit's to the scavenge.The hardest part of this game is the decisions that you make because each decision has and can have a huge impact on your shelter and the survival of your survivors, several times during the game you'll have random people knocking on your door asking for meds, food, assistance in helping them and if you choose to assist someone in need of help then you'll lose 1 survivor in your shelter for 1-2 days which means one less person to guard your shelter while you go out and scavenge and you don't always get a reward for helping, it's a risk that the player has to take if they decide to help someone else in need while it is useful to get a survivor out of a depressed state and generally uplift the mood inside your shelter, especially if you've had to kill another innocent to steal their supplies. You're pretty much forced to be the good guy in this war as bad decisions to steal too much from innocents or murder innocent people can and will most likely have a negative impact on all your survivors in the shelter and if any of your survivors go from a depressed state into a broken state that survivor will render useless for the whole period of being in a broken state and there is the risk that they will leave the shelter or go down the path of suicide.It's important to time manage well especially during the daytime hours, make sure that survivors are getting enough food, rest, build anything that your survivors currently need, manufacture moonshine and alcohol if needed, put some more food inside your rat trap to catch some more rats for meat, always have at least one survivor rest during scavenge time that way you'll always have at least one survivor to do the daytime chores while the others rest.  it's advisable to get your hands on a firearm as quickly as possible as firearms help in a great deal to avoid being raided during the night, if you don't have any firearms, knives or an axe will do the job, it's important to get established early in the game, build a heater before winter comes, upgrade your metal workshop as early as possible so you can craft an axe to destroy the desks and wardrobes inside your shelter for wood, this will be important for surviving through the cold during the winter time and to build more things for your shelter early on in the game.The player has to survive until a ceasefire which can happen randomly on any day (usually between days 40-50 but it can happen as early as day 25) also the winter usually happens during days 20-30 but it can be random as well, same with crime waves they can happen during any time and usually last at least 7-10 days which increase the chances of being raided each night, during this time especially it's very useful to have firearms. It's also useful to build a radio and check it everyday during the daytime period to get reports of weather changes, areas that are too dangerous to go to, also it will let you know on the radio when a ceasefire is getting close.I got through a 10 day crime wave, 9 days of winter and got a ceasefire on day 43 and only killed 2 innocents during the whole game, however they tried to attack me when they caught me trying to steal from them as I was desperate for supplies at the time so it didn't hurt the moral of my shelter that much, I did however lose 2 people in my shelter one on day 39 due to severe wounds and another in the hospital by a heavily armed and armored militia thug on day 40.It can be a tough game and frustrating for some people to survive and you'll have a lot of choices to make, kill the innocent for supplies? Steal supplies from other innocent people also trying to survive the war? Help those in need at the cost of losing people or supplies that you worked hard for to scavenge? Kill thugs and miltia that deserve to die and steal all their supplies? I'll leave those choices for you to make.    :)Please buy the ""War Child Charity DLC""Help the children that went through or have to go through such atrocities and pain during these depressing times of war.

												First time making a review, but I'll try to be thorough.This game caught me of guard. I'm not usually a person for the point and click games, but this was recomended by a friend. And I will say it is very entertaining. Hey, It ain't your common brainless strategy and shooter survival game. But that's what makes it fantastic! The psychological aspects of war are often overlooked. What's more, everytime someone touch on the subject, you more than often play just you're typical army trained person with a natural talent for killing and surving. Here we have the averege citizens thrown in the chaos that is a city during war times. And believe me, play the game without thinking of the consequences, and you'll end up with a group of mentally broken survivors.I'm not a man for making a pros and cons list of the game. For anyone not intriuged enough by the reviews, I'll go ahead and advise TotalBiscuits recent made video on the game that is avaible on his Youtube channel Cheers.			"

												You could go the easy route and describe This War of Mine as ""The Sims, but set in Hell."" And you'd be right.The game can be better described as an 'entropy simulator': There's plenty of things to pick up initially. Just through initial walks through the area you can find a bunch of resources you can use for initial improvements to make for your war hovel. But eventually, that stuff will start to run out, and you will not be able to play it safe anymore. If you're smart, you'll have someone who is good at bartering and items to supply the demands of rich survivors with, and you might be able to get through the war without blood on your hands.If you're no longer able to play it safe, that is where the real This War of Mine begins.It is easy to lose control of your circumstances concerning what your group needs. If you have to keep pushing your wounded and your sick, they will get worse. But there's points where you just can't, because you need to keep a tight budget on what little resources you have. Raiders will come by, you will get a small winter, and your group members will get hideously depressed from having to hide from the war in a cold, destroyed house. All of these things will add up, and not having what you need to keep them sane and healthy will eventually destroy your chances of seeing the end of the game. You'll have to be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to get what you need, and the mental tax that your actions will cause will be heavy. Sure, you can poke your scavenging survivor to stab an armed thug in the back, but he will hate himself for it the next day. You can brandish your pistol at the elderly couple hiding out in their nice home to take their supplies. You can carefully sneak through homes and take things that survivors not unlike yourself have been hoarding for a rainy day, putting them in  poverty to get what your group needs. And, of course, you can sneak through shadows and stab people in the back, trying to ignore their frightened pleads as you put the blade in to keep others from noticing all for the sake of some things you could have, in better days, gotten from a supermarket for five dollars.This game is one of those games where it can make you feel like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for trying to survive, and the more desperate you have to get to feed your group, the more it works. It's a horrible ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ feeling generator when the game is at it's toughest.			"

												Graphics:  2D setup that combines the detail of Shadow Complex and the art style of Limbo.  Everything is dark and brooding, which really sets the overall tone.  Their lighting system is a thing of beauty as well:  rays of light shine through broken walls and windows, fire barrels give a nice ominous glow in the night.Audio:  Somber acoustic guitar soundscapes reminiscent of The Last Of Us play during the day, and the night scavenging missions feature very tense, suspenseful string and synth arrangements.  Environmental sound effects like artillery shells landing and the crack of sniper fire constantly remind you that you're never really safe.Controls:  Point and click adventure style.  You navigate around the environment by clicking where you want to go, objects you can interact with in the environment have their own separate icon.  While in the safehouse, you control each character independently by selecting their character photo then giving them their own commands. Navigating the menu system is simple and straightforward.Gameplay:  Everything is randomly generated at the start, so no play through is the same.  The safehouse sequences are fairly routine.  Build this, repair that, eat, rest.  The game really comes alive when night falls and you have to decide what to do with your survivors.  Sickness, hunger, and injury are very serious threats to your group, and losing anyone significantly increases your risk of having the whole thing come crashing down on you.  Managing your survivors is key to getting through the siege.  There's also significant danger when it comes to the overall scavenging:  rolling over those weaker than you and taking everything they have makes you a target for vigilantes and decreases morale, and some of the more well-stocked areas tend to be heavily guarded by hostile military forces and other survivor groups who have no compunctions about killing anyone who sets foot on their turf.My one major complaint is the lack of a tutorial or tool hints on the environmental icons.  It doesn't take too long to figure stuff out, but the initial learning curve can lead to some restarts.  There are very few bugs, which is always a plus.Overall Score:  9/10			"

												This Game Truely makes you think about your decisions and will almost almost make you feel like you could always have done something better, spent resources in a more efficient way or on something more useful. It took me losing my first survivor to a shotgun in the back to realise the difficulty factor. I had managed to get by every day without a hungry character, even with the new arrival several days in but when i lost my scavenger that night, it really hits you that at that point you need to find food or everyone else in you shelter will die too.Makes you question your humanity... I like that.			"

												I avoided this game for a while, mainly due to it coming off as pretentious. It was a good idea to look at war from another perspective (such an indie thing to do lol). But is the game fun? Yes, and in fact it is quite well done. This is essentially a base management simulator, that happens to have awesome crafting and is story-rich.Pros:+Graphics are awesome+They really capture the ability for you to drive your own story - you actually do get attached to your characters+Crafting is well done (especially considering that every game now-a-days seems to have mandatory crafting)+There is a real sense of danger in the world, where decisions have real consequencesCons:-In this type of game, starting over always sucks - unlike other base/household management sims where you can go on virtually forever-Like titles such as Don't Starve you always feel behind-the-ball as far as resources go - you are never really *over-powered*-Price initially turned me off, but its worth itI got it on a sale and was really surprised at how entertaining it is. If this seems to be your kind of game, I'd go for it. "

												Meh. I was really hoping for an immersive story here- but you really just get dropped into a resource management scenario without any context, and by that, I don't mean that I was looking for an explanation to anything that was going on in the war, etc. I'm a huge dark souls fan- ambiguity doesn't bother me. The gameplay itself just feels weak. I wanted this game to captivate me. I wanted to sit down and love this game so much that I didn't want to do anything else on my free time. I wanted to love the protagonists, and feel bereft by the loss of them. I wanted to be bullied by soliders, and made to feel weak. I wanted to see newcasts of incredible tragedies and happen across riots in the middle of the streets. I wanted to be marked a criminal for having to make hard decisions for my survival. I wanted to run for my life, and genuinely fear that my rickety house might fall in on top of me during a missile strike. I wanted to meet other civilians whose lives were torn apart by this war, and hear their stories, whether I could do anything to help them or not. I wanted to escape the city, or negotiate peace. But in spite of all that I hoped for, I was made to grind- to micromanage three characters than I felt no attachment to and sit quietly while they took several minutes to sift through piles of rubble, grab a couple resources, consume the ones my characters needed, rinse & repeat. I have Survival games in my library that work much better mechanically- so this didn't give me anything. It was boring me to tears for what little time I could stand to sit with it. And I tried to come back to this game, I read the reviews, I watched the videos again, hoping it could promise me that there was something more than what I was seeing, but there isn't. And I'm really bummed about that. I just can't pick this one up. It's too dull.			"

												Okay.... I am trying to take a deep breath and calm myself before I write the review...Here is the truth.  I LOVED this game, so why would I rate it down?  The artistic value of the game is to be revered.  The game-play is fun, addictive like crack, and balanced all the way through.  It is a survival game that makes you care for your characters because with a little extra thought, proper preparation, and a careful use of resources, the game can be the PERFECT challenge all the way through.  Not so much that you put it away from dying all the time, but just enough so you feel that you can learn from your mistakes when you take the wrong person looting and get him/her shot, push too far into a bandits' base for loot and  get someone killed, or become a bandit yourself and watch your characters hate themselves for it.  It all works!  So WHY in god's name am I rating this game down.... SIGH.  I will tell you at the end, because the ending is is why I am now jaded.This game has this unique blend of survival and platformer elements.  The combat is a little wonky, but this is not an action game.  This is a survival game that pushes your moralities to the limit: do you send off one of your characters for a day to help your neighbors who in the past have shown you kindness, or do you turn your back and keep to yourself so you can keep your base safe while looting?  Killing is not taken lightly in this game.  Most of the characters are not fighters.  They have never shot at anyone before and you must weigh how stressful it will be on them to out-right murder a person for his/her loot.  sometimes it might be best to come back from a night of looting with a bag half full and a heart that is not broken.The characters themselves are all full of life and special in their own way.  One or two are trained in combat, and do not feel the pressure of killing so long as they  are not killing innocents.  Some are good cooks, others are handy-men that  use less resources to build and craft with.  Others can keep children calm and tend to wounded while others are small but stealthy, making them ideal for nightly looting runsLooting is done so well.  Your characters feel no pain from looting bandits, but question themselves for steeling from an elderly family.  The stealth mechanics are solid and intense at many times.  I managed a play-through without ever shooting at anyone. (apart from defending my base from bandits.  Can't be controlled and it doesn't affect your characters depression)  I chose to help all  who asked of it, but stole when I needed to as long as I did not leave someone for dead by doing so, and yes there is a difference between taking what you need in this game, and taking everything, and your character will reflect on that.  Limited backpack space and time turn scavenging into a strategic race for time as you decide whether or not to bring a crowbar and lock-pick, or save the space and only take what loot is easily accessible while scouting out threats, bared and locked doors and piles of obstructing rubble that can be cleared on a succeeding night.  Rubble that can be moved without a shovel,  but will take a lot of your precious time if you chose to do so.Keeping your team rested and fed feels just right, and the amount of given resources is remarkable.  Too big of a team means that more food will be needed than can be provided.  Too small and your base will be raided while you are out looting and sleeping.  Choosing who sleeps at night, who sleeps on a bed or off a bed, and who sleeps during the day can't be taken lightly.  Wounded characters will take rest, first-aid, and time to heal.  A few nights passed that I had to keep everyone at the base and be frugal for a day so the group could recover.The bartering system is well thought out.  There is a traveling tradesman that will show up every few days with goods that can be exchanged for home made moon-shine, home grown vegies, looted and self-made meds and anything else you want to trade.  You can also take specific items with you on  ""looting""  runs to trade with the military, other survivors and even bandits.  Each group seeks different items, and you are not likely to come home with a full backpack, but you will have exactly what you set out for, and some times that is more important.There is also a winter that you must survive.  OMG was it intense.  Keeping enough fire wood burning to keep your characters healthy while still having enough to cook food and craft pushed me to the limit more than once.  I was taking an ax to furniture just to keep the fires going.  Brilliant!  The winter is not too long and comes on at a nice pace so that you have time to trade for or scavenge what is needed in time build a heater for your base. (hint: UPGRADE IT EMEDIATELY!)And lastly, the DLC for this game is heart warming to say the least.  It doesn't add much content to the game, but %100 of the proceeds goes to the War Child charity, and that's just groovy.  The dlc adds some wall-art to the in-game levels.Now... After so much praise, why did I rate this game down?!Small spoilers aheadI WILL TELL YOU WHY!I worked my tail off keeping my crew alive!  I helped EVERYONE that asked of it.  I killed no one, and only stole when I was desperate, and even then I took only what I needed and never left anyone to die.  I brought in a character in need when he asked and he survived with the rest of us to the end....  THE END!The war lasts 45 days max, some people don't like this, I don't mind it so much.  It can end some time before that, but its random.  If you have built a radio, it will keep you informed of whats going on.  INCLUDING THE WEATHER!Day 44 roles around.  I have mastered my team and have prevailed through dozens of bandit attacks, and winter included.  I have an outright stock pile of weapons, ammo, food, supplies, crafting tables, trade goods, and FIRE WOOD.  The forecast from the radio, which you will see in the screen shot, called for ""warm days ahead.""  Winter was about a week in the past at this point and there is only one winter in this damn game!I leave my base on the 44th night to do some light looting because I wanted to pass the time and grab some last minute stuff in the case that there is some end game fight or something.  I leave with  ""WARM DAYS""  in the forecast and a thermostat that reads 20 Celsius.  That is hot for this game, it starts around 15 C.  I get back to -5 C and a team that has frozen to death........... What in the flying F**K is that crap?!?!*edit* Turns out this is a bug that the devs have not felt inclined to fix.  With this knowledge, I will keep the thumbs down rating.  The bug is heart breaking and a game changer that happens at the very end of the game.  I am not a programer, but this cannot be the toughest bug to fix.  The day this bug is remedied is the day I give this game a thumbs upThis is why I cannot rate this game up.http://steamcommunity.com/id/jbaketkd/screenshot/436072840510605697Note: day 39 calls for cool weather.  ""Cool"" weather shows up as predicted on days 40, 41, 42.  The temp goes down a bit during the day time, and I stoke the woodstove.Note: day 42 calls for warm weather, as well as day 45: it drops below freezing on night 44 after nothing but rising temperatures during the day and kills my team.

												this game, this game right here, probably one of the best and realistic survival game ive ever played. This is a game where getting shot by a gun one or two times matter. A lot. Yea you can craft items like guns without a lot of materials or a lot which you actually need to craft a really gun, but hey, games can't be that realistic or it'll be so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ difficult. This game also requires some what of a mutli task ability. One of your member might be straving and another might be sick. This is a difficult game, so i don't reccomend this game to 10 year olds. Probably 16 is old enough but what do i know about life? This game requires choice making too. Choices vary depending on how well your surviving. For example, your whole group is healthy and have a lot of medicine and medkits. However your running low on food. Should you trade someone your medkits for food? What if my shelter gets raided during the night and one or two members gets wounded? Another example is when your whole team is low on supplies. Would you go in an area which contains armed bandits but has tons of suppiles you need or would you go in an area with less supplies but less danger? Choices. The moral is this game takes skills to play, and definitely reccomend this game.			"

												This War of Mine is a breath of fresh air in the bleak and barren moor of survival horror games. You take lead of multiple protagonists surviving in the aftermath of an unforgiveful civil war. Facing trials and tribulations of what war brings. It all fizzle's downs to the basic of primal needs, food, shelter, and to stay breathing. You face gruelling moral decisions and dilemmas that pave the way for your characters psyche and mental well-being. TWOM also has an excellent art direction, game play, mood, and atmosphere. One of the most thoughtful games I have played in a while, to say the least.			"

												This War of Mine is pretty damn fun. Depressing as hell at times, but if you play it right, it all pays off. It does a good job of forcing the player to come up with strategies of how to manage your time. There are hard moral decisions and tough situations you'll have to get yourself out of. It's challenging, but each playthrough you learn from your mistakes and get better.			"

Posted: October 29, 2016
												I wanted to like this game, I really did, but there's enough that ticks me off that I can hardly stand to mess with it.  Starting off, I found the game to be tricky due to the resource management aspect (the whole point of the game), but despite not looking at any guides or using mods, I was doing fairly well my first playthrough.  Nothing fancy, but my crew was surviving.  Yet I hated always being behind and having barely enough to survive, so I tried modding the game with player made content.  All I really needed was an increased inventory or stack size so I could scavenge more items and could actually craft some stuff.  However, with the way this game gets patched, and the issue of its DLC complicating matters, it's really hard to get mods for the game that work consistently.  I've downloaded mods that seemingly should work, but won't load for some reason.  Since that was a dead-end, I tried making my own using the tools, and despite watching a basic tutorial over what I figured would be a simple process, my custom made mod didn't show up or work at all.  I have no idea why not, and I loathe having to put in more time trying to figure out how to do something other games do easily.  Add in how the developers have struggled to make features they wanted in the game to work properly (vests and bags), how I had problems even getting the game to load in the past, that others have also struggled to get the game to play properly, and I really can't fathom how this game rates above a 90.  With that in mind, I'm going to assume that I must be one of the few with this issue, lest I would think this game would be rated far worse than it is now.However, even if I concede these issues as being a problem on my end and not the developers, I still wouldn't favorably review this game.  That's because I don't really consider this to be much of a game at all.  The only control you need in order to accomplish anything in the game is your mouse and the left click button.  Want to move your characters around?  Scroll and left click where you want them to go.  Want them to craft something, eat some food, trade with an NPC, talk to somebody, or heal themself?  Scroll, left click on the correct icon, and watch as a circle fills up over their head as they accomplish their task.  And unlike those pay to win browser games everyone complains about where you spend dead time waiting for items to be built, here you get to watch your characters plod around the house in order to get to the right place first.  That's all you ever do, and there's not enough variety or versatility in what you can do to make it all that interesting.  Filter water, cook, distill alcohol, trade items, and wait for items to craft as you move characters around in a house.  If it weren't for the backdrop of a war going on, this would be a mind-numbingly boring and pointless game.  That's how it comes off to me anyways, and the hack-neyed and trite storyline isn't engaging to me.Now, when night time hits, you do enter into a different portion of gameplay, where you send one intreprid character out into the scary world to scavenge for whatever meager prizes they might find; perhaps some desperately needed bandages or a scrap of raw food to cook with.  Their model even has them stooped over, walking in a sneaky manner as you'll approach barred doors and peer through the keyhole to see what's on the other side.  So, guess how you make them rummage through piles of loot, dig up mounds of debris blocking your way, or break down a locked door.  You click on it and wait for the circle above their head to fill up.  It's no different from the rest of the game!  Even combat is a joke as you click on a button to select your weapon, click on an enemy, and wait for your character to approach and duke it out to the death.  I'm somewhat surprised a circle doesn't fill up over the enemy's head as it shows how much progress you've made in murdering them.  70% of the way there, just a little bit longer to go!  Typically that's what saves these type of games if the resource management or crafting isn't all that exciting, the suspenseful, engaging combat, but it's dull and tedious here.  When one of my characters died in combat, I wasn't on the edge of my seat, I didn't feel sad or upset that the rest of the survivors would be bereaved at their loss (and one of them wasn't, funny enough), I was annoyed because I didn't get the stuff they scavenged and it meant I had one less person to guard the house when I foraged for supplies.  Despite story aspects and personality traits being written into my small crew of 4, 1 of them dying was more of a hassle for resource reasons than it was emotionally stirring or compelling.I would also point out that the graphics are incredibly lazy looking to me.  I grew up playing the NES, I'm not a high-res graphics freak, but it annoys me when a game doesn't even appear to be trying.  Making the game take place in a catastrophe is a nice excuse for them to make the game in gray scale with rough, undetailed graphics.  I think I'd rather see the game be pixellated with some color instead of what I get here.  Sure, you can say that it's a stylistic choice, but they couldn't have polished it up at all?  Maybe toss in some splashes of color for symbolism and to draw the eye instead of your vision washing over a blur of black and white?  Either way, I guess I'm in the minority on this one, but I still wanted to express my own battle with This War of Mine.			"

Intense and deeply involving.Pros:★ Gets you thinking.★ Great back story to this survival game.★ Shines in its ability to have the player make hard decisions.★ Every run through is different from the last.Cons:✖ Would have been better with more locations on the main map.✖ Could have had more Initial starting locations for each new game.This game will have you emotionally involved from the get go as you are faced with a few civilians who are trying to survive a war. You are faced with living off food scraps and low supplies of water to survive while trying to maintain your own health and sanity. Do you screw others over so you have a better chance of surviving? Or do you help those in the community but by detrimenting your own life? Without spoiling the game for you, you're faced with some very difficult decisions.As a side-scrolling indie thriller and with the specific tone the game sends out, this game won't be for everyone. But if you enjoy a choose-your-own-adventure style of gameplay and appreciate the subject of war you'll be hard to say no to This War of Mine.			"

												Before I start my review I want to say this, never have I had a game make me feel the way this game did. The setting and harsh reality of post fallout survival really help this game live up to any expectation you might of had. I went into the game with a small amount of hype and really was interested by the trailer, and the game lived up to be better than I thought it would be and in fact is easily in my top 3 Indie games this year. PROS:Great Art Style and AnimationsTrue feeling or regret or shame for killing someone for suppliesEvery play through is different, no two will be the sameAll decisions will affect your survivalCharacters are easy to fall in love withYour feels....all the feelsSounds and gameplay are both spot onMoral choices really play a partCONS:ALT-TAB is broken, and will crash the gameSometimes I will get a slight stutter but it goes away after a min or twoSmall glitches will happenREVIEW SCORE:9/10So close to being perfect yet so far no game is perfect. Anyone that is wishing to have the true feeling of the weight of humanity on your shoulders and that every choice you make will impact someone’s life somehow, then play this. This is a must buy for me, and I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did. Keep those vegies handy....you will need them.  "

												I love the dark and sad design of this game. It gives you are really good feeling of the terrors and sadness of war. It has so much heart and a big replay value (especially after the ""own story"" upgrade). Getting into the game is pretty hard, your first playthrough will be shocking and sad. But after a while you get used to the mechanic and will have hours of enjoyment (in a way of adventure and tension).So much I try to love this game - It is very frustrating. I have died so many times scavanging because I did not know how to react. The gameplay at this part is way to sensible and you die so fast in combat. Unfortunatelly it is WAY to frustrating to play because of no real tutorial / gameplay help.Still recommendable!			"

This game shows you the harsh reality of the War and how people struggle to survive in harsh condition of War.This game will take you the guilt trip, when you steal and kill someone just to survive.I generally don't recommend buying DLC, but this one - Please buy it (Its for good cause): War Child Charity DLC "

												This game really is a masterpiece and if I had a top 10 list of 2014 while this wouldn't be number 1 it would be pretty close. PROS:This game is stylized and I personally liked the look of the game  however I could understand if some were turned away by the black and white cell shading, I like it even more because it captures the atmosphere of the game which is dark and depressing. If you are looking for an uplifting game, don't look here. Completing this game will generally mean you get some blood on your hands, whether it is innocent blood or a bandit's is up to you. The gameplay is very nice as well, you have to be very vigilant in managing your finite supplies of food, water, and other materials used for building different additions onto your base. This management is difficult to learn what will be optimal for your survival, however once you achieve a good understanding of mechanics it is extremely satisfying to master, thriving in the war torn hell. There is also a randomized element in the game from random people coming to your door to offer you jobs or to ask for your help. This brings up your morals as some of the jobs you're asked to do might be....well let's just say nefarious in nature and it's completely up to you which tasks you spend your limited time completing. From multiple playthroughs I've seen different loot spawn in different places so that is also randomized to an extent making for even more replay value. There are also many different characters present in game that can show up to your door and join your group, all with different backstories, attitudes, and each have unique abilities that will help you in  your fight for survival. For the most part the looting and combat is intense and interesting. You can choose to stealthily creepy around buildings looting or go in guns blazing (if you manage to aquire a gun) the choice is yours on how you want to play the game. CONS:The soundtrack isn't very good, in fact there might not be one present in game as the only music I recall is when you tune your radio into different music stations. Combat/looting also has some quirks, nothing horrible but sometimes when you stealth kill an enemy others across the map will seemingly hear it and come rushing towards your position, this only happened to me twice in my gametime so it's not frequent but it definitely can happen. The characters in game are also not very interesting, each has his/her own backstory and if you pass an event their biography will update with their feelings on the situation. I personally didn't get very attached to any of them and when one died I was more concerned about who was going to go crawling through the dirt for food rather than sad about their passing, even a simple re-naming system for the characters would heighten my caring for their lives. VERDICT:I whole heartedly recommend this game as a fan of management, building, and looting games. If you purchase this game however beware that this isn't an easy experience and you most likely won't beat the game your first, or even second playthroughs. If you do manage to beat the game quickly not only are you better than me but the game has enough replay value where more runs are also very entertaining. I'm not much for number value reviews so I'll just say this game is definately worth adding to your library.			"

												That's my review after surviving for only 18 days.What can I say about a game that make us being a civillian in the middle of a civil war? For sure the game ""This War of Mine"" is one of the best survival games I've ever bought and I'm confident enough to say that if you're willing to buy it: JUST DO.While surviving with your group you gotta make good decisions and think a lot before taking any action. A neighbour needed our help to barricade her home: we did it. Another neighbour asked us to guard her family for two nights: we did it. Everything was so good at our house that I thought ""what could go wrong? we have food, medical supplies and enough stuff for everyone"" and that's where Emilia, a lawyer, comes to our house and join our group. Some stuff went rough on our guys and I decided to send her to the church so she could bring us some stuff like materials and more food, but the priest wasn't as good as I've expected, he didn't think twice before killing Emilia with his mate using a knife, she was there unarmed and wasn't robbing anything. People at my house got so sad and depressed that we couldn't do anything about it, so that's when I come with the idea: why don't we avenge Emilia and go to Church again, but this time we kill everyone in there? WRONG DECISION. Got inside there with Pavle holding a knife and assassinated the priest in cold blood, when his guard showed up I murdered him too and all the women inside there, in resume, I've killed everyone inside the church to avenge one of our crew. Coming home I thought people would be at least a bit happy to see that Emilia's death was avenged, but I was terribly wrong, Pavle got so depressed that he couldn't do anything, Katia was broken too and we needed Bruno to do everything.  For days we weren't able to go out and scavenge and people just kept raiding us, getting all our food and medical supplies. Some days after, Pavle was murdered by thugs in our own house, Bruno left us to follow his friend and got killed, Katia was left alone at home and starved to death.In resume: it's a game where you really need to think and be a good strategist to survive, it makes you feel how the characters feels and I'm sure that everybody who plays it are going to enjoy this awesome game.ps: If you buy the game, make sure you buy the DLC too, it's not expensive and the money is going to charity to help children who were victims of war. It's for a good cause.			"

												If you are looking for something a bit different, that doesn't just reward you with another shiny pixel for shooting some other player in the head, or if you are bored with the regular offerings, then this may just be the game for you.It takes place in a warzone city, based on the conflicts in Eastern Europe. The aim of the game is simple. Survive until reinforcements come and lift the siege. Actually doing it though, is far harder.You start off with 3 or 4 people, and most of a house that seems to be out of the way of the shelling. You need to keep your people well, warm, fed, watered, and happy, or at least, content. Each night, you can send out one person to do some looting in another location. That location may be populated, or abandoned. There may be people trying to live there, or looking for trading partners. Or, there could be soldiers who will probably try to kill you.As the game progresses, and you bring more loot home, you can start crafting - beds, heaters, cookers are pretty essential, but then you also have things like water collectors and rat traps to provide food and water, a radio so you can listen in on the news, and find out what is coming to the city, or even something that lets you grow tobacco or medicinal herbs.Of course, if you acquire too much stuff, and not enough weapons, chances are someone will try to raid you at night, stealing whatever they can, and injuring (or worse) one of your survivors.If you are looking for a happy, friendly game, this is not it. If you are looking at a harsh look at the realities of war from a non-combatant's view, then this is the game you are looking for. Or, if you are looking for something a bit more challenging than usual, this will provide exactly that, while still being fun.			"

												Absolutely amazing. 10/10 I will be playing through this again and again. The devs did a great job compensating for the 2D platform with stunning 3D graphics. Giving this game a new look on this platform style, as well as beautiful particles. The story is brilliant, and anyone with the smallest loyalty, emotion or attachment will get glued to these characters. When I lost a few of my characters I was ready to quit, but the game gives you new characters every few days after one dies. Which is nice but also allows a grim god-like strategy to it. Best game I've been in some time!			"

												The first five minutes of this game I was wondering if this would be my cup of tea.  All three of us were digging through piles of dirt to get to cupboards hoping to find some wood.  Seemed ok so far at best.10 minutes later, by day three, I knew what everyone was talking about.  I was worried, where will we find food?  My little band of three was hungry, tired and sore from sleeping on the floor.  In two quick game days this amazing game made me care about my little band of three to the point that I knew, tonight I'd do anything to find us some food.Or so I thought.  Night time scavenging Pavlo and I chanced upon an elderly couple in a little cottage.  The old woman sick, barely hanging on, but enough food there to last us a while.  Pavlo started grabbing whatever he could, I knew with this haul we'd make it a few more days.  Until the old man spotted us and started following us around... begging, pleading, asking us why?  I can only be grateful this game has no voiceover for the people you encounter at night-time...  His pleas was so heart wrenching, I ended up trying my best not to read what he was saying, but what I had read was enough, everytime another speech bubble came up I dreaded what he was saying and couldnt help but to look.  It all made me feel like the worthless, soulless thief I was, stealing from an old man and his sick wife.Me and Pavlo got out of there...  neither of us could take it anymore.  Pavlo is depressed, I feel terrible...Two days later Pavlo had to kill a couple a couple that attacked him after he stole their rat meat.  He is broken, won't move.  I had to end the game right there, I was feeling just like Pavlo.I took a few minutes to think how we could do better before starting another game.  How we could survive without doing these atrocious, horrible things to others...  Games have gotten under my skin before, but never quite like this.This game gets a 10/10 from me.  It will pull you in, make you FEEL the emotions your little party are experiencing... And after you have shut it down, it will stay with you, make you wonder about every bad thing you had to do.  Was there no other way?  What did we do?  Those people would surely starve, die for lack of medicine?Games don't get to you?  Try this one on for size.    We are on day 21 now... the crime spree has died down, we've managed to survive this long without doing too much harm to others... But food is scarce, we're hungry, we all know we'll have to do... something.... soon.    And I am dreading it.			"

												Excerpts from a war diary:Day 1: My name is Bruno. I was a chef once. Had a cooking show. It was a good life. Doesn't matter now, here in the middle of a war. Now it's just me and a couple people I've met, trying to survive together in this hellscape. Katia, a former reporter, and Pavle, a football star, or so he says. They seem like good people, at least.Day 2: We've established ourselves in an abandoned house. Found some useful things, made ourselves as comfortable as possible. We have decided to take sleeping, guarding, and scavenging in turns. Maybe we can make it through this.Day 4: Had a visitor today; someone desperate for help. Apparently a shell hit a tenement nearby, buried some people in the rubble. Pavle ran off to help. He's a good man; we'll do without him for a day.Day 7: Pavle went on a scavenging run to the super market last night, but didn't return. We're worried. Katia has volunteered to go look for him tonight. I hope nothing has happened to him...Day 8: Pavle is dead. Katia found his body last night at the super market. He apparently went down fighting, crowbar in hand; but he'd been shot. A woman Katia found there told of a girl who'd been saved from an assault by a soldier the night before. It seems Pavle jumped in to save the girl. She got away; he died a hero. We weren't together long, but we'll miss him.Day 10: It's difficult with one fewer person to help, but it's also one less mouth to feed, at least. And Katia managed to salvage a good bit from the store. But it's already running low.Day 11: A girl came to the house today looking for somewhere to stay. Her name is Zlata. She's cute, and she's got a lot of positive energy. We let her join us. Should help bring things back up after losing Pavle. Katia and I have been pretty depressed since he died.Day 13: Zlata has been great. She somehow knows just what to say to make us feel better. Though we are all a bit hungry from lack of food. Hopefully we can find some more soon.Day 15: As if the hunger wasn't bad enough, the looters make it intollerable. They've been hitting us relentlessly the last few nights. We've lost a lot, and have gotten a few scratches for our trouble. Katia says it's time to go for a sure thing. She plans on going out to rob a quiet neighborhood to the north tonight. It's not ideal, but we're getting more and more desperate. I just hope we can live with ourselves when this is all over...Day 16: Katia got some good food and meds from a house last night. She said she stole them from an older couple. She's pretty torn up about it. Said the old man pleaded for her to leave them alone. She took as much as she could bear to take from them. Tried to leave them some food and medicine. This war is no good for anyone!Day 18: Katia came back from a scavenging run with some serious knife wounds! We knew the area she went was dangerous - she took our knife with her - but apparently this city is full of psychos now! She said she got the jump on this guy, but he still messed her up before he went down. But she managed to save someone from them. We've patched her up as well as we can and she's sleeping it off. I'm not sure she's going to make it without better care though...Day 20: Zlata is gone. She went out last night to look for more medical supplies for Katia, but she hasn't come back. She's gone, like Pavle before her. Katia is still in bad shape, and looters hit me last night too, so now I'm not much better off. What a miserable month it's been. No sign of improvement either. I'm beginning to wonder why we are still trying...Day 21: Katia finally gave in last night. She was a fighter, surviving as long as she did with those wounds. I'm alone now. No food, only a few meds left by some idiot who thought I'd hold them for someone else. Doesn't matter. No one is making it out of this mess. Going to head to the construction site in town tonight. I hear there may be good supplies there; but more likely a faster death than bleeding out from my wounds. It's been three weeks since this hell began. I'm ready for it to be over anyway... So I guess this is goodbye.== Good game, solid mechanics, enveloping personal stories, dark, touching, desperate. A good (bad) experience that I highly recommend, but don't expect ""fun"" in the classical sense. It's basically an interactive tragedy. Unless, perhaps, you make it through. Which I have not so far.			"

Seemed ok so far at best.10 minutes later, by day three, I knew what everyone was talking about.  I was worried, where will we find food?  My little band of three was hungry, tired and sore from sleeping on the floor.  In two quick game days this amazing game made me care about my little band of three to the point that I knew, tonight I'd do anything to find us some food.Or so I thought.  Night time scavenging Pavlo and I chanced upon an elderly couple in a little cottage.  The old woman sick, barely hanging on, but enough food there to last us a while.  Pavlo started grabbing whatever he could, I knew with this haul we'd make it a few more days.  Until the old man spotted us and started following us around... begging, pleading, asking us why?  I can only be grateful this game has no voiceover for the people you encounter at night-time...  His pleas was so heart wrenching, I ended up trying my best not to read what he was saying, but what I had read was enough, everytime another speech bubble came up I dreaded what he was saying and couldnt help but to look.  It all made me feel like the worthless, soulless thief I was, stealing from an old man and his sick wife.Me and Pavlo got out of there...  neither of us could take it anymore.  Pavlo is depressed, I feel terrible...Two days later Pavlo had to kill a couple a couple that attacked him after he stole their rat meat.  He is broken, won't move.  I had to end the game right there, I was feeling just like Pavlo.I took a few minutes to think how we could do better before starting another game.  How we could survive without doing these atrocious, horrible things to others...  Games have gotten under my skin before, but never quite like this.This game gets a 10/10 from me.  It will pull you in, make you FEEL the emotions your little party are experiencing... And after you have shut it down, it will stay with you, make you wonder about every bad thing you had to do.  Was there no other way?  What did we do?  Those people would surely starve, die for lack of medicine?Games don't get to you?  Try this one on for size.    We are on day 21 now... the crime spree has died down, we've managed to survive this long without doing too much harm to others... But food is scarce, we're hungry, we all know we'll have to do... something.... soon.    And I am dreading it.			"

												I will make this review as short as possible, with as little spoilers as possible. This is one of the greatest games I have ever played and it is one I hope is expanded upon with either DLC, content patches or sequels. This War of Mine is deceptively simplistic to play, yet under the hood is a very detailed, deep and moving game about the horrific consequences of war. The hand drawn look of the game, creates a bleak looking visual interpretation of a war torn world where colour is devoid, as is the love for life for the protagonists. The player is set to make countless life or death decisions for a handful of people who need to be guided through a month or two of what seems to be a civil war in a fictional Eastern Europe style city.  I don't normally play platform type games, especially ones that look like Snakes and Ladders but after only an hour or two of playing - I found my decision to purchase the game was completely worth while.You can play this game quite easily with just the mouse and it is easy to pick up and play. It took me about 16 hours to finish the game and did so without any guides or cheats, nor did I watch any ""Lets Play's"" on YouTube, and in itself made the experience even more rewarding. The story while not so deep (ie not very story rich) is still very moving, and one can easily become attached to the people you will be controlling.The game on occasion reminded me of SIMS, in which you control a persons needs and had a small resemblence to tower defense games or something along the lines of Civilisation where you build, upgrade and defend a base.While playing the game, I did not encounter any bugs or crashes and the only issue I met was in terms of game play mechanics. I found that I really did not need to upgrade many househole items and instead I decided to hoard materials to trade for food or save stacks of items I could burn, ready for when winter came along.The game could have lasted longer and had more story - and thus would have required me upgrading certain aspects of my base - but alas I did not need to as the game did not demand it. The game could have had a DLC with different story lines, such as maybe an alien invasion or a zombie apocalypse and of course I would not rule it out happening in the future, and I will be keenly watching an eye on developer news. This is a testament to the game's success, as I rarely keep an eye on specific developer releases once I have finished a game.At the end of the day, this was a very addictive game - and easy to pick up and play. I was left with a bittersweet feeling when the game ended for me after 46 days. I was happy that I managed to *win* the game on my first try - but I was quite sad because my daily dose of war was over; Quite ironic if you think of it.I look forward to more games from this developer and hopefully an expansion to this game. I also think if this game allowed mods via the Steam workshop - the games content could be expanded by it's own players giving this game a much longer shelf time.I give this game a solid A+ or a 9/10. If you are unsure as to whether to purchase this game or not, trust me that you will not be disappointed.			"

Introduction:For anybody considering getting this game... this is a hidden gem.This War of Mine focuses on what other war games simply do not. The lives of regular people who are affected by the war, civilians. The thing to think about is, what would -you- do if war broke out around you, and you had to struggle to survive? Would you be willing to turn your back on neighbors and friends? Would you risk your own health and safety by sharing supplies with strangers, or leaving your shelter to help others?This War of Mine takes on a more personal tone in regards to player experience. If you've ever read any first person war documentaries, this feels like you're playing one. You read the bio entries of your sheltered civilians, and empathize with them and their struggles every step of the way. Survival is really only half of the game, personal comfort and distractions is the other half.This is one of those games that I figured, even if I like it, it won't take long to beat and I won't put a lot of hours into it, but I was wrong. I am over 60 hours right now and still playing it, and the only part of the game I even considered remotely boring was doing a solo Marko run and ""playing the squirrel."" The Anton and Cveta scenario was just downright frustrating, but I imagine that two older people trying to survive with only eachother in the middle of a war would probably have a hard time making it.Pros:+Varied morality based on each citizen's life/lifestyle.+Scavenging and combat system is well rounded and not entirely unrealistic.+Excellent crafting system that compliments the games trading system.+The survival aspect of the game forces you to manage resources and prioritize crafting.+Addictions require you to consider an added level of comfort for those who have them, as well as an additional way to cope.+Excellent personal stories and biographies give you an emotional connection to the civilians in your charge.+Random events that add flavor to the everyday struggle in your shelter.+Artistic style and game atmosphere.+Varied survivor personalities and skills.+Survivors with skills that are useful in real-life, but not-so-useful during a war, gives perspective to how war affects everyone.+Alcohol can be used to help sad people feel better, but also as a trading item.""Everyone should choose one happy memory. And it can't just be good, it has to be grand. When it gets so bad you just want to sit down and cry, when you life seems forfeit, you close your eyes and go back to your happy moment. It's not easy but you have to try."" -The Survivor MarkoCons:-A few minor bugs, most pertaining to the morality system. (Example: Citizens getting sad from ""stealing"" in a location where there used to be armed thugs. Everyone there is dead, it's not technically stealing anymore, and even if it was, it was from bad guys that one of your civilians already killed. (and were happy about it)-Some aspects of the game are particularly easy to exploit. (Examples: You can change the random event of that day, or someone getting sick, or a few other aspects, just by leaving the game and restarting that day. Another example is that you can prevent resources from being stolen during a raid by starting a building project, and then canceling the project the next day to get your resources back.)-Sometimes during the day you wish you could speed it up a bit while waiting for your civilians to dig through rubble or catch up on sleep, but you can only ""end day"" which is often more time than you wish to skip. A speed-up/slow-down feature would be nice. Also a ""pause"" feature that allows you to issue commands to your people at once, without having to try to flip between them as quickly as possible.-It gets fairly repetitive after a few games, luckily there is an alternative shelter you can play in that helps to combat the repitition a little.-Could definitely use more survivor options, base options, and customization of both of these things in both the regular game, as well as creating your own story.-Could do with much more crafting possibilities and game items. Even the couch that you can sit on in some scavenging areas but can't craft for your own shelter is a good example.-Depending on the length of the game, the construction space of your shelter can be very limited.-Something like a craftable safe to keep select items more secure during raids would be a helpful concept.UPDATE: -I almost forgot the most annoying con. ""Alt+Tab"" or basically any minimizing from full-screen mode will crash the game. The only ""fix"" I have found for this, is to switch to Windowed mode at the title screen, and then switch back to full-screen. For some reason, ""Alt+Tab"" works after that!""I've been running into either unsufferable rubes or outright criminals. But I feel that you're different. And for a scientist with an established position like me, the company of people of comparable mental capacity is paramount. Besides.. ah, bloody hell, I can't stand faking it anymore! I'm just an old fart who knows nothing. I'm so grateful for your company. I've been out there alone for too long. Way too long."" -The Survivor AntonThe Good and Bad:+/-Save Intervals. It would be nice if it saved it at the start of every night, as well as every day, but it also forces you to re-do an entire day, if you decide to exit out of the game when something goes wrong at night.+/-The rainwater collector can be placed pretty much anywhere. It doesn't make sense to place it anywhere.""I used to be an optimist - one of those people who'd have sworn that war wouldn't come. Wars happened far away, in third-world countries. Or so I thought. Even when I was listening to the news getting scarier day by day, I did not believe all that was about to happen."" -The Survivor BrunoRECOMMEDED?Without a doubt. Even if this game costed twice as much, knowing what I do from having played it, I would buy it.			"

												This War Of Mine reminds me that danger lurks from every corner. It is not only the lack of food and medicine that could end your life, but there's always the constant threat of bandits who will take everything you've worked for away from you. And how did I work for my supplies? By murdering innocent people. I thought the threat was over when I stole food from an elderly couple, but the aftermath of that decision caused the character who commited the murders to leave, while the other survivors were depressed about the loss of one of their own.I don't know what caused the world to go to sh*t, but I do know that there are multiple threats to be aware of. Depression. Hunger. Violence. I didn't even survive long enough to experience the threat of (possible) betrayal. This is a truly accurate war simulator. I don't know if I /want/ to call it a game because I often associate that with having fun and with This War Of Mine, you won't have fun.But this is an experience I'd definitely recommend, if you're up for it. Those who are susceptible to various triggers such as suicide might want to stay away from it.			"

 Brief Description of Gameplay This War of Mine is a game in which your goal is to manage a group of civilians in their attempt to survive while trapped inside a city near a warzone.The game is 3D but characters move around on a 2D axis.This War of Mine is played primarily using the mouse.  You click to select which character you want to control and simply left click the location you want your character to move to.  Buttons appear on objects in the environment when you can interact with them.  Typical actions include things like searching, hiding, climbing, lockpicking or prying things open and so on.Weapons can be selected using the mouse as well.  While a weapon is drawn, contextual buttons will appear in the environment allowing you to take cover behind walls and tables and other things.You play one day at a time.  There's a day phase where your civilians are in their shelter and your task is to take care of their needs and build things.At night you can choose to select one of your civilians to go scavenge.Resource management is a big focus in this game.Acquire materials / food / weapons through whatever means you can.  Barter, loot, scavenge, steal, take by force.  Aid other people, take from them or even murder them.  The game does little to restrict your actions, but be prepared to face big consequences depending on what you do.....Pros Uses several forms of procedural generation to give each playthrough different challenges to deal with. The number of areas accessible for scavenging and the time frame in which they are accessible is always changing. The layout and contents of those areas is constantly changing. The game surprises you with all kinds of sudden and difficult scenarios where you have to make decisions that carry big consequences. Care is put into crafting some interesting and diverse backgrounds for the civilians you can play with. Your civilians aren't cold or emotionless.  If you do something they don't like, it'll affect their mood/morale. Maintains a dreary atmosphere that fits well with the setting. Explores war from an infrequently used perspective, which makes the game feel unique. Nice artistic style.Cons This game can be intensely time consuming. Depending on what's happening and where you choose to go at night, the pace of the game can be very slow.  This fits the idea of being focused on survival in a warzone though so it's kind of appropriate. Combat, danger and death can be sudden and hectic.  Once again though, this actually kind of serves the game's purpose well. Sometimes, playing through the daytime portions can feel a bit dull and repetitive as you'll simply be eating / bandaging / sleeping and so on.  I do have to admit that this is probably a good picture of what it'd actually be like for survivors though.If you're bored, have plenty of time to spare and don't mind the slightly sluggish pacing,  I definitely recommend this game.

												Excerpts from a war diary:Day 1: My name is Bruno. I was a chef once. Had a cooking show. It was a good life. Doesn't matter now, here in the middle of a war. Now it's just me and a couple people I've met, trying to survive together in this hellscape. Katia, a former reporter, and Pavle, a football star, or so he says. They seem like good people, at least.Day 2: We've established ourselves in an abandoned house. Found some useful things, made ourselves as comfortable as possible. We have decided to take sleeping, guarding, and scavenging in turns. Maybe we can make it through this.Day 4: Had a visitor today; someone desperate for help. Apparently a shell hit a tenement nearby, buried some people in the rubble. Pavle ran off to help. He's a good man; we'll do without him for a day.Day 7: Pavle went on a scavenging run to the super market last night, but didn't return. We're worried. Katia has volunteered to go look for him tonight. I hope nothing has happened to him...Day 8: Pavle is dead. Katia found his body last night at the super market. He apparently went down fighting, crowbar in hand; but he'd been shot. A woman Katia found there told of a girl who'd been saved from an assault by a soldier the night before. It seems Pavle jumped in to save the girl. She got away; he died a hero. We weren't together long, but we'll miss him.Day 10: It's difficult with one fewer person to help, but it's also one less mouth to feed, at least. And Katia managed to salvage a good bit from the store. But it's already running low.Day 11: A girl came to the house today looking for somewhere to stay. Her name is Zlata. She's cute, and she's got a lot of positive energy. We let her join us. Should help bring things back up after losing Pavle. Katia and I have been pretty depressed since he died.Day 13: Zlata has been great. She somehow knows just what to say to make us feel better. Though we are all a bit hungry from lack of food. Hopefully we can find some more soon.Day 15: As if the hunger wasn't bad enough, the looters make it intollerable. They've been hitting us relentlessly the last few nights. We've lost a lot, and have gotten a few scratches for our trouble. Katia says it's time to go for a sure thing. She plans on going out to rob a quiet neighborhood to the north tonight. It's not ideal, but we're getting more and more desperate. I just hope we can live with ourselves when this is all over...Day 16: Katia got some good food and meds from a house last night. She said she stole them from an older couple. She's pretty torn up about it. Said the old man pleaded for her to leave them alone. She took as much as she could bear to take from them. Tried to leave them some food and medicine. This war is no good for anyone!Day 18: Katia came back from a scavenging run with some serious knife wounds! We knew the area she went was dangerous - she took our knife with her - but apparently this city is full of psychos now! She said she got the jump on this guy, but he still messed her up before he went down. But she managed to save someone from them. We've patched her up as well as we can and she's sleeping it off. I'm not sure she's going to make it without better care though...Day 20: Zlata is gone. She went out last night to look for more medical supplies for Katia, but she hasn't come back. She's gone, like Pavle before her. Katia is still in bad shape, and looters hit me last night too, so now I'm not much better off. What a miserable month it's been. No sign of improvement either. I'm beginning to wonder why we are still trying...Day 21: Katia finally gave in last night. She was a fighter, surviving as long as she did with those wounds. I'm alone now. No food, only a few meds left by some idiot who thought I'd hold them for someone else. Doesn't matter. No one is making it out of this mess. Going to head to the construction site in town tonight. I hear there may be good supplies there; but more likely a faster death than bleeding out from my wounds. It's been three weeks since this hell began. I'm ready for it to be over anyway... So I guess this is goodbye.== Good game, solid mechanics, enveloping personal stories, dark, touching, desperate. A good (bad) experience that I highly recommend, but don't expect ""fun"" in the classical sense. It's basically an interactive tragedy. Unless, perhaps, you make it through. Which I have not so far.			"

												I don't normally like survival or indie games but something about this game hooked me as soon as I saw the trailers. If nothing, I wanted to give it a chance because I respected the message it tried to give across. I'm glad to say I didn't regret. Everybody already mentioned the unique aspect of the game, that you play as a group of civilians trying to survive instead of soldiers so I am not going to focus too much on that. I am really glad that the makers took a risk by showing an actual civil war in place (which resonates very well in these days, unfortunately) instead of the overused zombie apocalypses we have seen over and over. The graphics are fairly simple but well done. The grey-washed color scheme and blending of hand-drawn backgrounds with digitally created characters and objects really works well together. What little there is, is done really well.Gameplay is usually good. Fairly simple point and click. During the day, you are in your hideout. You have a toolbench where you gather raw materials to build beds, different types of workbenches, beds, stoves, heaters, distillers and so on. Nearly every single one of these items have a vital role to play and you want to make sure you can have a headstart so that you will be producing trade goods (alcohol, cigarettes etc...) as much as you can to keep up with your needs. The season, weather, supplies and characters you start with are randomised and that means you can have a better or worse start and while this has some impact, it is sensible and is a good challenge for you to manage yourself. Every character has some use and are better geared towards either taking care of your home (the mechanic, the cook) while others are better towards scavenging (the fighter, the runner, the expert scavenger, the heavy lifter, the thief). There are a few characters whose skills seem very specific to the point of uselessness (Cveta for instance). Maybe I was not able to find their specific uses. But having a group consisting primarily of one type of characters or the other will definitely impede your ability to survive.At night, you go out scavenging and this is where things get more complicated. While the first few houses you find tend to be empty, as you keep going, you will find houses inhabited by soldiers, rebels, bandits, deserters and hapless survivors like you. How you deal with them will have a huge impact. I found the stealth and combat mechanics somewhat finicky but was able to get used to them fairly quickly. Anything you can interact with has a symbol on top of them which you can point and click in the usual fashion. The one issue I have is that there are no tooltips to explain what the action exactly is. In my initial playthroughs, I found the difference between the icons for ""loot-unowned-item"" and ""steal-owned-item"" the hard way. Similarly, during combat, the icons for ""take cover"" and ""take cover and shoot"" are so small that you will find yourself doubting which is which. While most of the gameplay issues and difficulties could be explained with characters not being soldiers to perform a combat task well, things like these have little excuse. Another issue I had was that some traders seemed to be on a bit of a hair trigger. In one of my first playthroughs, I managed to get access to the town square (where a lot of traders are present). Apparently, running towards them even if I was holding no weapons is a no-no because suddenly, everyone turned on me to attack. It seems like you need to approach them carefully. Sorta makes sense in a warzone I suppose, but it just doesn't make sense to have one rebel going ""Hey, wanna trade?"" while his friend goes ""DIE!!!"" Similarly, interactability with non-combat characters feels a bit too limited. A good example is the house with the old couple. The game seems to want you to have a morality struggle - Do you rob the old couple even as they are begging you not to or do you leave them alone? But nowhere is the option of saying ""My friend is sick, I really need some medicine"" or ""Give me any medicine you got or I will shoot you"". As it stands, you can't convey why you are trying to get into their house. How they responded and how you react to that would have a far more meaningful morality consequence, not to mention would still be sensible within the game's world.Gunfight as a whole is ill-advised and even when I had access to AKs and shotguns, I stuck with hiding around and stabbing people with a knife if combat was required. Almost any enemy is likely to outclass your guys with weapons and bullets are finite. Especially in the crime phase later into the game, your house will be raided nearly every night and you're better off keeping your guns and bullets for that and use any excess guns for trading. In general, sneaking is fairly well done. Definitely better than combat.The atmosphere is spot-on. The colors, the music cues, the little mood bubbles of the characters and the occasional challenges and ""quests"" (for the lack of a better word) really help set the mood. And these little things help you get attached to your characters. When you help your neighbours or save a girl from a drunken soldier, you will likely not do that out of an expectation of a reward (and often there is none) other than feeling good that you've done a good deed. It makes the characters feel content but I've noticed how often it make *me* feel good too. Similarly, robbing people or ignoring them even as they beg for help made the characters and myself feel absolutely sh*t. The decision of where you go in the night, what you need, if you think short term or long term and how you react to an unexpected situation makes the core of the game and can sometimes turn a good situation really bad really quickly. It is weird how attached you grow to your characters and have emotional responses even when it is independent from the game.In terms of story, there isn't much in focus. You are just trying to survive, after all. But each character has their own background of which more and more is revealed as the game goes along. If you win, the epilogue will show what came of their stories. It is a nice touch but can get a bit weird with characters that join your house later. I had a guy join the group a day before ceasefire was declared and the epilogue went on about how he met the woman he had lost contact when the war broke and so on but because he had just joined the group, I didn't know any of that so it felt as if it came a bit out of nowhere. Outside the personal stories, listening to the radio, listening to people speaking during scavenger runs and notes you find give you a better idea of the scale of war, the causes behind and how others have suffered, all help enrich the game's world.I've read a lot of reviews mentioning bugs and crashes. I had no such issues during my playthrough. It seems like the game is optimised for Alienware computers, so it might be why it ran without any problems for me. On a side note, the Alienware optimisation means the game actually synchs up with your computer's LED lighting (if you have any) and changes the color of the LEDs according to what is going on in the game, which is pretty cool.Overall, definitely recommend it.

												The first five minutes of this game I was wondering if this would be my cup of tea.  All three of us were digging through piles of dirt to get to cupboards hoping to find some wood.  Seemed ok so far at best.10 minutes later, by day three, I knew what everyone was talking about.  I was worried, where will we find food?  My little band of three was hungry, tired and sore from sleeping on the floor.  In two quick game days this amazing game made me care about my little band of three to the point that I knew, tonight I'd do anything to find us some food.Or so I thought.  Night time scavenging Pavlo and I chanced upon an elderly couple in a little cottage.  The old woman sick, barely hanging on, but enough food there to last us a while.  Pavlo started grabbing whatever he could, I knew with this haul we'd make it a few more days.  Until the old man spotted us and started following us around... begging, pleading, asking us why?  I can only be grateful this game has no voiceover for the people you encounter at night-time...  His pleas was so heart wrenching, I ended up trying my best not to read what he was saying, but what I had read was enough, everytime another speech bubble came up I dreaded what he was saying and couldnt help but to look.  It all made me feel like the worthless, soulless thief I was, stealing from an old man and his sick wife.Me and Pavlo got out of there...  neither of us could take it anymore.  Pavlo is depressed, I feel terrible...Two days later Pavlo had to kill a couple a couple that attacked him after he stole their rat meat.  He is broken, won't move.  I had to end the game right there, I was feeling just like Pavlo.I took a few minutes to think how we could do better before starting another game.  How we could survive without doing these atrocious, horrible things to others...  Games have gotten under my skin before, but never quite like this.This game gets a 10/10 from me.  It will pull you in, make you FEEL the emotions your little party are experiencing... And after you have shut it down, it will stay with you, make you wonder about every bad thing you had to do.  Was there no other way?  What did we do?  Those people would surely starve, die for lack of medicine?Games don't get to you?  Try this one on for size.    We are on day 21 now... the crime spree has died down, we've managed to survive this long without doing too much harm to others... But food is scarce, we're hungry, we all know we'll have to do... something.... soon.    And I am dreading it.			"

												I will make this review as short as possible, with as little spoilers as possible. This is one of the greatest games I have ever played and it is one I hope is expanded upon with either DLC, content patches or sequels. This War of Mine is deceptively simplistic to play, yet under the hood is a very detailed, deep and moving game about the horrific consequences of war. The hand drawn look of the game, creates a bleak looking visual interpretation of a war torn world where colour is devoid, as is the love for life for the protagonists. The player is set to make countless life or death decisions for a handful of people who need to be guided through a month or two of what seems to be a civil war in a fictional Eastern Europe style city.  I don't normally play platform type games, especially ones that look like Snakes and Ladders but after only an hour or two of playing - I found my decision to purchase the game was completely worth while.You can play this game quite easily with just the mouse and it is easy to pick up and play. It took me about 16 hours to finish the game and did so without any guides or cheats, nor did I watch any ""Lets Play's"" on YouTube, and in itself made the experience even more rewarding. The story while not so deep (ie not very story rich) is still very moving, and one can easily become attached to the people you will be controlling.The game on occasion reminded me of SIMS, in which you control a persons needs and had a small resemblence to tower defense games or something along the lines of Civilisation where you build, upgrade and defend a base.While playing the game, I did not encounter any bugs or crashes and the only issue I met was in terms of game play mechanics. I found that I really did not need to upgrade many househole items and instead I decided to hoard materials to trade for food or save stacks of items I could burn, ready for when winter came along.The game could have lasted longer and had more story - and thus would have required me upgrading certain aspects of my base - but alas I did not need to as the game did not demand it. The game could have had a DLC with different story lines, such as maybe an alien invasion or a zombie apocalypse and of course I would not rule it out happening in the future, and I will be keenly watching an eye on developer news. This is a testament to the game's success, as I rarely keep an eye on specific developer releases once I have finished a game.At the end of the day, this was a very addictive game - and easy to pick up and play. I was left with a bittersweet feeling when the game ended for me after 46 days. I was happy that I managed to *win* the game on my first try - but I was quite sad because my daily dose of war was over; Quite ironic if you think of it.I look forward to more games from this developer and hopefully an expansion to this game. I also think if this game allowed mods via the Steam workshop - the games content could be expanded by it's own players giving this game a much longer shelf time.I give this game a solid A+ or a 9/10. If you are unsure as to whether to purchase this game or not, trust me that you will not be disappointed.			"

												This game really is a masterpiece and if I had a top 10 list of 2014 while this wouldn't be number 1 it would be pretty close. PROS:This game is stylized and I personally liked the look of the game  however I could understand if some were turned away by the black and white cell shading, I like it even more because it captures the atmosphere of the game which is dark and depressing. If you are looking for an uplifting game, don't look here. Completing this game will generally mean you get some blood on your hands, whether it is innocent blood or a bandit's is up to you. The gameplay is very nice as well, you have to be very vigilant in managing your finite supplies of food, water, and other materials used for building different additions onto your base. This management is difficult to learn what will be optimal for your survival, however once you achieve a good understanding of mechanics it is extremely satisfying to master, thriving in the war torn hell. There is also a randomized element in the game from random people coming to your door to offer you jobs or to ask for your help. This brings up your morals as some of the jobs you're asked to do might be....well let's just say nefarious in nature and it's completely up to you which tasks you spend your limited time completing. From multiple playthroughs I've seen different loot spawn in different places so that is also randomized to an extent making for even more replay value. There are also many different characters present in game that can show up to your door and join your group, all with different backstories, attitudes, and each have unique abilities that will help you in  your fight for survival. For the most part the looting and combat is intense and interesting. You can choose to stealthily creepy around buildings looting or go in guns blazing (if you manage to aquire a gun) the choice is yours on how you want to play the game. CONS:The soundtrack isn't very good, in fact there might not be one present in game as the only music I recall is when you tune your radio into different music stations. Combat/looting also has some quirks, nothing horrible but sometimes when you stealth kill an enemy others across the map will seemingly hear it and come rushing towards your position, this only happened to me twice in my gametime so it's not frequent but it definitely can happen. The characters in game are also not very interesting, each has his/her own backstory and if you pass an event their biography will update with their feelings on the situation. I personally didn't get very attached to any of them and when one died I was more concerned about who was going to go crawling through the dirt for food rather than sad about their passing, even a simple re-naming system for the characters would heighten my caring for their lives. VERDICT:I whole heartedly recommend this game as a fan of management, building, and looting games. If you purchase this game however beware that this isn't an easy experience and you most likely won't beat the game your first, or even second playthroughs. If you do manage to beat the game quickly not only are you better than me but the game has enough replay value where more runs are also very entertaining. I'm not much for number value reviews so I'll just say this game is definately worth adding to your library.			"

Intense and deeply involving.Pros:★ Gets you thinking.★ Great back story to this survival game.★ Shines in its ability to have the player make hard decisions.★ Every run through is different from the last.Cons:✖ Would have been better with more locations on the main map.✖ Could have had more Initial starting locations for each new game.This game will have you emotionally involved from the get go as you are faced with a few civilians who are trying to survive a war. You are faced with living off food scraps and low supplies of water to survive while trying to maintain your own health and sanity. Do you screw others over so you have a better chance of surviving? Or do you help those in the community but by detrimenting your own life? Without spoiling the game for you, you're faced with some very difficult decisions.As a side-scrolling indie thriller and with the specific tone the game sends out, this game won't be for everyone. But if you enjoy a choose-your-own-adventure style of gameplay and appreciate the subject of war you'll be hard to say no to This War of Mine.			"

												When other games show you that War is all about Soldier this game shows you that ""In a war not everyone is a Soldier"". This game shows you the harsh reality of the War and how people struggle to survive in harsh condition of War.This game will take you the guilt trip, when you steal and kill someone just to survive.I generally don't recommend buying DLC, but this one - Please buy it (Its for good cause): War Child Charity DLC "

This War of Mine explores the harrowing realities of living amid war.Its resource management, life-sim and exploration mechanics are simple. Each day plays out in two phases. The clean split between day and night creates the steady metronome that keeps you pushing through This War of Mine. You're tasked with feeding survivors, ensuring they get a good night's rest and looking out for their physical as well as mental health.Systems This War of Mine's are designed to push you towards moral quandaries, where you're trapped by basic human needs, and shown how they can so easily corrupt otherwise upstanding people.Like a grim version of The Sims, players click around to move characters and on icons to assign tasks such as making food, building, clearing rubble, rifling through resource points or administering aid—either medicinal or moral. All of this is reliant on having the appropriate resources, which are gathered at night when a character can be sent to scavenge while the others sleep or stand guard. Locations include abandoned squallers, schools, hospitals, churches and more. Areas with more valuable resources are either inhabited or defended, while the safer places yield less.Everything outside line of sight is enveloped in a fog, giving the exploration real tension. Walking is silent but slow, while running comes at the risk of making noise, denoted by emanating circles of sound. Enemies emit these same tells, as do rats scurrying around. NPCs that hear the sounds or spot you in their line of sight will investigate, The defenseless cower, some propose a barter, others respond with deadly force. The slow, deliberate pacing accentuates the languishing, oppressive atmosphere.This War of Mine is one the most thematically interesting games.			"

												I started with four people and made it to the ceasefire with all four of them alive, but only after spending 20 hours of non-stop mass deaths on every playthrough. This game has excellent art direction and sense of place; you KNOW after spending a week in-game that the city is a horrible place to live in. The day-to-day resource management is appropriately challenging; choosing to build an herb workshop rather than a rat trap could mean that no one in your house will make it to the end. Needs an optional tutorial though. I understand the developers' intention to show that you are a band of desperate people trying to figure things out, but I feel they should at least have something for people who are totally new to simulation/stealth games.However, I found myself being very engaged with the day-to-day struggles, and even now I am going back into the game to see if I can get another group of survivors to make it through the siege. I hope that there will be Steam Workshop support in the future, as I can see a lot of possibilities with the world of This War of Mine: Endless Mode, tweaks to traits,  maybe even new survivors. I strongly recommend this game to people who are willing to try a war game where no matter what you do, you can't stop the war yourself, and instead you're just trying to live long enough to see the end of it.

												This game confronts the player with the harsh realities of war. The player plays from the perspective of a group of civilians in a fictional war-torn city, trying all that they can to survive in the difficult circumstances, holding on until 'the end'.There is a mixture of assertive and reactive elements (due to RNG) to this game, there is also a sufficient number of avenues for players to explore within. The 2D layout and the arcade-styled movement within makes it quite engaging. This game does however, suffer from the lack of significant replayability after two or three successful playthroughs.Nevertheless, it provides a poignant reminder of the effects of war, done very well within the confines of a game. It is highly recommended.			"

												Too often in games I can be cold and very heartless. I relish being the 'bad guy' in a lot of games, often opting for the 'easy choice' of choosing the mentality of 'the needs of one, outweighs the needs of the many'. I wanted a new challenge and perhaps something that could change my 'evil persona' in games... and boy, do I get a challenge with this game.This War of Mine is in a word; Brilliant. It's art style is very monochromatic, dark and pencil drawn, something which compliments the game's overall feel and direction. The musical score works really well with certain types of situations and often helps set the mood of a wore torn country that had clearly seen better days.But for me, while all of the details are important in the art style and music, the real impact this game has had on me is it's core mechanic; it's game play. Too often in modern games, players are not confronted with tough choices. When there are choices in games, they are often very clean and cut (do this and this will happen, don't and it won't - etc). I feel that because of this, players are not given the true consequences of their actions in games therefore making it much easier for players to turn 'bad' and reap the rewards. For me this is often why I went rogue. In This War of Mine, I simply cannot do it and when I have to, I feel terrible about it.Taking charge of a group of three survivors in a worn torn city who have shacked up in a abandoned building, the player is immediately confronted with a wide selection of problems right from the offset. One of your group may be sick, hungry, sad or simply tired and it is up to you to provide the fulfillment of their most basic needs in order to keep them alive. Sure, you can scavenge for stuff in your own dwelling but the resources found there will only get you so far so you must find additional materials/food from other areas around the city. Venturing into the city gives you no promises and it thrusts you into situations that make you question your morality. An example can be that you have a sick friend back at your shelter and you have gone into a home that you know has an elderly couple inside, one of which is very ill. Do you take their medical supplies to save your friend and risk destroying the morale of your group (because you stole from people who truly needed the supplies), or do you leave them be and potentially lose your party member, which in turn could create the same amount of dismay within the group? Other examples can simply come from making a bad call, i.e. getting your scavenger into situations that they went prepared for and killed, not returning back to the safety of your 'home' in time before the sun came up, or choosing to take additional survivors into the group whom of which you couldn't really provide enough resources to cover their basic needs.Because of the choices that you have to make and the knock-on results that they can bring, you pay the consequences or enjoy the rewards of your choices. Personally, it's refreshing to play a game that questions morality and adequately changes the gaming dynamic because of these calls.  This War of Mine gave me that new challenge in the choices that I make in games. I no longer wish to be the bad guy and when I do it in this game, it's not without reason. I really recommend this game to players of fifteen years older or more.			"

												This War of Mine is my new answer to the question, ""Are Video Games a Legitimate Art Form?"" In This War of Mine, you play an every day group of survivors, making tough, brutal decisions on how to survive. Battling sickness, injuries, looters, and the ever looming threat of death, your main goal in each of the Day/Night phases is making it just one more day.Good: EXTREMELY atmospheric. The visuals, music, and even the UI evokes a sense of desperation and despair. The characters just FEEL real. Their daily diaries do a good job of putting you in the shoes of desperate survivors. The choices in this game, the ones that hit you in the gut, are all natural and emergent. There's never a popup asking you if you want to steal for survival, there's just an unarmed old man asking, ""Why are you doing this?"" while you take meat for your two friends who haven't eaten in two days. The art style is... just beautiful. With the gameplay in ""This War of Mine"", they could have easily settled with 2D graphics, but instead they created a moving and engrossing setting with very real feeling characters. I LOVE 2D games, don't get me wrong, but I felt their treatment of the set pieces in this story really added to the experience for me.Bad: Sometimes the characters are a little hard to control. I found myself unable to make one of my characters do something for an entire day. Only happened once though, and that's about all I have to say negatively about this game.Ugly: War.			"

												A depressing, heart-wrenching reminder of what man is capable of doing to his fellow man in times of utmost necessity.Would you stick by your principles and morals whilst all around you abandoned theirs? Would you refuse to steal, or to kill? Would you stand by your guns and remain steadfast in your morality, your humanity, even whilst your family are freezing; starving; dying of disease? Many wouldn't.I didn't.And that, I believe, is the true value of this game. It made me think, a lot more than any other game I've recently played. It made me sit down and think about what I was doing, and why I was doing it.And it made me realise something:These characters, these people represented by pixels on a screen, could be any one of us, given all the wrong circumstances. With that knowledge also comes the understanding that, at some point in time, in some oft-forgotten conflict, a real human being decided they had no choice but to do exactly what you just did.That broke me, personally, for a while.It's depressing, it's soul-crushing, and yet it's somehow still so compelling.It's us, as a species, trying to survive the torture that we create for ourselves.War is hell.

												One of my favorite games this year, much more than I expected it to be. This War of Mine is not simply Papers, Please thrust into a crafting/scavenging game. Instead, This War of Mine does a phenomenal job of conveying the desperate situation civilians find themselves when in the middle of a war zone. Every scavenging decision feels like a gamble. Address short-term needs or long-term investments? Steal from the elderly? Kill? Managing and crafting in your home shelter a continuous process of managing losses. Do you use the wood for fuel to stave off the cold, or do you board up your walls to protect against bandits? Can we really spare the last of our meds on an old man who will probably die anyway? Combat is messy, often unexpected, and traumatizing. You will not encounter very many fail-states in this game, as that would be contrary to the theme of desperate survival. What you will face is a slow march of ever worsening conditions, with the dim, almost non-existant hope, that a cease-fire will be signed to end all of soon and bring the game to 'victory'.In the mean time; however, two of my survivors have died, the remaining two are depressed and are coming to blows, and I only have enough food for one of them today. Who do I feed?			"

												This game is a masterpiece. worth every penny I spent on it and I have played only few hours.The randomized scenarios, moral dilemmas and some hard choices that you will need to make and that will determinate if your survivors will pass out or if they will live another hard day, make this game one of the best games of 2014.Of course there are some points that could be better, such as the possibility of using more scavengers during the night or even a co-op (something like the inminent Don't Starve together) could be awesome. But in general terms you are paying for a fully enjoyable game here.Anyway, if you are wondering what game to buy due to the lack of new good/original games and you don't mind to play a single player game, you should go straight for this one.The last thing that you should know is that this is more likely a ""hardcore"" game -I prefer to call it ""oldschool""-, with that I mean that there are no tutorials or helps of any kind. Only simplified descriptions of every item/tool, so you will need to find out how everything works. In fact, the methods are pretty simple, but you will maybe die trying somehow, but hey! remember that this is what the game is about.  "

The choices in this game, the ones that hit you in the gut, are all natural and emergent. There's never a popup asking you if you want to steal for survival, there's just an unarmed old man asking, ""Why are you doing this?"" while you take meat for your two friends who haven't eaten in two days. The art style is... just beautiful. With the gameplay in ""This War of Mine"", they could have easily settled with 2D graphics, but instead they created a moving and engrossing setting with very real feeling characters. I LOVE 2D games, don't get me wrong, but I felt their treatment of the set pieces in this story really added to the experience for me.Bad: Sometimes the characters are a little hard to control. I found myself unable to make one of my characters do something for an entire day. Only happened once though, and that's about all I have to say negatively about this game.Ugly: War.			"

												Simple but fun survival mechanics. Multiple play throughs are a thing. I've only completed one full play through and I got the poor girls daddy killed because I was still not used to the stealth / path finding mechanics. That was my 3rd attempt at completing a play through because when one first starts this game - they will want to restart every time you get someone killed. But after you realize it's a story about the gruesome reality of war then you can move on and keep surviving with the rest of the members of your group. When I first got someone killed on my first two play throughs I restarted each time. One because you feel as if you lost an actual human being with a heart and sole. Second of all because this game gives you no tutorial on the combat mechanics. So it can be frustrating when you're trying to test them out when you first start. After you realize that the mechanics are very simple then you get used to it really really fast.      Enjoy the survival mechanics of the game during the day and then each night you can pick and choose who you want to stay at your shelter to guard or sleep. You can also choose to bring someone out for a scavange. This is where the action/stealth mechanics come into play. Very simple system with a simple point and click style. Simple, effective and fun. Very entertaining. I see now why this game won cultural awards. This game will pull at your heart strings. It tells a story. You're meant to pay attention to the small instances of story that pop up. Writing on the walls, photographs that capture the events of your play through. Even small bits of ones journal as well as the interactions you have with one another as well as other survivors in different areas that you can trade with. Watch out for thugs. They WILL put a bullet in you and you WILL lose one of your characters especially when you first start because you will feel the urge to test the mechanics out. Also, be careful where you click because sometimes your guys will decide to take a path straight into a bunch of armed thugs if you're not careful.    This game is dark and depressing. But in a beautiful way and I am still excited to play through several more play throughs because there are several areas that I still have not even chosen to explore yet. The game also gives you different scenarios to choose from and each one is unique in different ways 24 hours so far and I'm going to take a break now. This is definitely a game that I will periodically come back to and play.     This game will make you teary eyed. If you have a soul.			"

												Wow. I don't ever write reviews for games, but I feel that this one definitely deserves it. For starters, I felt that the idea of playing as a struggling group of citizens rather than a soldier was brilliant and definitely a game changer in the world of survival games. The graphics and gameplay have been incredible so far, and I see no signs of that changing. The depth of the game really gets you hooked, and I've had a hard time putting it down. All in all a great game, and I would recommend it to anyone who has $20 to spare. Or doesn't. It really doesn't matter. Just buy the game and see what I mean.			"

												A depressing, heart-wrenching reminder of what man is capable of doing to his fellow man in times of utmost necessity.Would you stick by your principles and morals whilst all around you abandoned theirs? Would you refuse to steal, or to kill? Would you stand by your guns and remain steadfast in your morality, your humanity, even whilst your family are freezing; starving; dying of disease? Many wouldn't.I didn't.And that, I believe, is the true value of this game. It made me think, a lot more than any other game I've recently played. It made me sit down and think about what I was doing, and why I was doing it.And it made me realise something:These characters, these people represented by pixels on a screen, could be any one of us, given all the wrong circumstances. With that knowledge also comes the understanding that, at some point in time, in some oft-forgotten conflict, a real human being decided they had no choice but to do exactly what you just did.That broke me, personally, for a while.It's depressing, it's soul-crushing, and yet it's somehow still so compelling.It's us, as a species, trying to survive the torture that we create for ourselves.War is hell.

												I've had this game for a while and I still love it, which can't be said for a lot of games.Not only are the visuals aesthetially pleasing, they also fit the theme of the game really well. Every single time I play, I go through every single emotion imaginable. The way individual events play with your heart and how each character has their own storyline and what makes it even better is that at the end, it's not an immediate cut off; you're told what happens to them after the ceasefire. This game is one of the most dramatic, exciting and heart wrenching games on the market and is worth every penny. Not only that, there's an additional DLC that you can buy which adds artwork to the game and the money goes to charity (you can also decide how much you spend, to a certain extent).However, there are a few things that I would like to see improved in the future as I believe it was touched on but not competely developed. Each character has a certain personality, explained in their biography. When certain events happen, their biography is updated with how they feel about the situation that happened, for example, if you choose to kill an NPC for supplies, some don't care while others actually do. What bothers me is that even though certain characters aren't affected by these, they still become sad, depressed and broken, leaving them completely useless. I would expect a character that actually understands the concept of self defense and the fact that sometimes we must kill for supplies and even says that they understand it, to not become so depressed. Another thing is during the day, sometimes there are events in which a survivor has the choice to leave the base and help an NPC out. It would be nice to add another choice to go with them, perhaps for an extra reward where you can physically help them out, such as clearing rubble, fixing up a base, healing people etc. (You could see it as a minigame during the day).All in all, I really recommend this game and I believe there is also room for improvement. If you're even thinking about it, buy it. You will not regret the decision and the replayability immense, with the difficulty changing every single time.			"

												Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ This is what being an Indie Dev is all about. They pushed the boundary of storytelling and presented a game that is full of the most depressing narrative I have ever played. If there is only one game this year you want to purchase, ditch every AAA title and go here. This War of Mine is gritty, dark, and one of the most imaginative games I've seen in awhile. It will push you to the brink of depression without reminding you that its just a game and to not worry about it. First play through I made it to Day 16. In the last couple of days my team went through numerous raids, sustained life threatening wounds, and fended off severe illnesses. On day 13, I ran out of food and decided to raid a home inhabited by an elderly couple that I knew couldn't defend themselves, I took everything I needed and they started calling for help. I decided that the risk of whatever may happen if help arrived wasn't worth the reward or their lives so I did them in. I took everything they had. I watched as my survivors sunk into deep depression about what they had did just for a nights meal. The next 3 days were filled with a downhill ride of depression, death, and abandonment. Much as I imagine what any person put in that situation would go through. This isn't just a game, it's an emotional trainwreck.			"

												This is one of the best games I have ever played. It's not fun. It won't make you happy. In fact, it might make you miserable. Though you can meet the win conditions and manage to outlive the conflict it never feels like victory. Every action taken for survival must be weighed against the ultimate consequences for your crew.Yes there are puzzle aspects, and a good gamer will find ways to maximize their chances of survival. But ultimately this game forces you to make terrible choices, and manages to make you feel their consequences. This is the type of game that students should be playing in school as it manages to communicate some of the horrors experienced by non combatants in war.Buy it. Play it. Remember it.			"

												While I'm not normally fond of side scrollers This War of Mine is a rare exception. You play as a group of civilians held up in a run down old house in the middle of a war zone (civil war to be exact). How will you survive? Go out at night and find those must needed meds, or food. Trade with others barely holding on? or will you just take what you want.This game will have you choosing between letting your people die or gunning down that kid and his elderly parents for a couple of cans of food and maybe, a bottle of meds. All the while praying your base doesn't get raided and those people you are now murdering a small family for, are not killed.For those that don't like to look at the meaning behind their actions (in a video game) or the story you'd best not get this. Everyone else will see this game for what it is, a hard, soul-crushingly depressing, remorseless look at the horrors of war that'll have you playing just to see your guys though this hell hole until a cease fire is finally announced (picked at random).Those that are sensitive to emotionally taxing experiences may want to also avoid this game, at times you may be given the choice to help that woman being dragged off by an armed soldier, that main lying in the middle of the path with a sniper edging closer, and closer to you, or if killing that elderly couple is worth saving three lives.While this game is a side scroller it more then makes up for it in the meaning behind every action you take, and the consequences. If I had to give it a score? 9/10 and it only loses 1 because I had to kill a kid with my rifle to stop my group from starving. :(~ Edit for Steam Awards =P			"

												I've put many hours into this game and still find it fun with many more hours of replayability! <3This game is fun if you enjoy survival games where you have to manage surviors and resources and at times get slapped in the butt.Pros:Perfect balance of growing in strenght with the overcoming challangesEye-candy graphicsPerfect atmosphereHours and hours of funSemi-intresting charactersHard to master but easy to get in toFeels rewardingCons: Exiting the game during the night run will revert you back to the beginning of the day, so any changes in your shelter/surviors will have to be repeated.Non-stealth combat pretty much suicide/not an option even if you have the best gear due to how painful it is to recover if you do survive.Combat is a ""roll the dice"" chance of hitting the enemy unless you do a hidden takedown. Doing a backstab will take enemies to 20% health but due to how random it is, they can still kill or wound you in which case press alt + F4 and restart the day/night.Survivors are emotional timebombs waiting to go off the second you steal or kill someone however these is currently a glitch where returning to a dead thug's location after dealing with them(which is good karma) to loot the place may count as ""stealing from innocent"" even though that should not be the case. Doing more bad deeds will result in the surviors killing themself if you cannot keep them happy with various supplies(coffee, booze and cigarettes).In alot of cases looking up a location on the wiki before going there will save your life, in a sense... though you will get punished if you dont (with no knowlage of the place).Each surivor has a specific trait which will help you..... however in some cases they can be very useless or critical to you. An example of this is Roman who is trained in combat and can instantly take down someone from a backstab and pretty much kill one shot with a shotgun which makes him one of the best survivors. A good example of a bad one is Anton who has the trait ""Good Mathematician"" which does nothing. However each survivor you get is random over the campain but you can quit the game and press continue to get a diffrent survivor when one does arrive.			"

												Time to stop playing FPS for a moment and think about its consequences.Personal point of view, you can surely ingore that if you want. When you point at a soldier's head in a game, will you think about his life? His lover? What will happen to his friends & relatives after you shot him? What will happen to his little girl, his greatest treasure that he want to protect to death? No, you would just think,""Oh another headshot, I'm doing fine."" Real life is always not fun. BUT that is NOT the reason you vote for war & protest in a referendum. whe you just think that fighting is ""fun"". ""Oh war is fine we like shooting each other in the face we are the youth we can protest what we against we don't afraid the consequence"". I was totally terrified when I imagined what our children will be when they grew up in a peace world with bunch of great war games that told them how to fight/shoot against each other. Yes the war can never ends. but what if we show the consequence before our chilren can start the next war?That's why I like this game so much. It did what other FPS & war games can never do.Buy this product in any worth.Honestly, when you see a bunch of developer/publisher that the purpose of the game was not to impress people. but to save innocent children from war, you should definitly buy his product.Not for your consciences, but for their bravery & determination from doing that.11/10 Best anti-war game for so long.

												Truly, what an amazing game this is! I've been sucked in for well over 12 hours in one sitting, something that very rarily happens for me with an indie game like this. (The play-time counter is broken for some reason...) The soundtrack is really good, it perfectly illustrates the doubt and fear in this group of survivors you're trying to lead. The gritty art style is very, very nicely done. The sketchy look and dull, grey colors do a really good job of showing this ravaged urban area. The stealth system is quite advanced, and the combat is random and really nervewracking (Think of XCOM). Losing a beloved member of the group is really a deep pain, and it echoes throughout the group. They mourn their dead and might even become depressed. The looting is very rewarding, and the limited inventory space forces heavy inventory management. Nothing like sneaking through a bandit camp and stealing all the goods that they themselves have stolen from others. The trading is very fun and well done, and it forces a lot of tough decisions. Do I want tobacco/alcohol that I may be able to sell for a good amount of food/materials, or do I want to just bring a smaller amount of materials or food and avoid the risk of not being able to sell it when I need food the most? The decisions you have to make are tough. I found myself robbing an elderly couple in pure desperation, only to stop for a moment and realize what I'd just done. The game has good replayability to a point, as it's somewhat randomized.All in all, one of the best, if not very best, survival indie games I have ever played. 10/10, would starve to death again.

The game provides you a glimpse of how people in real-world, when faced with War & brutality at its worst, survive. You live and breathe with these people everyday. Making preparations, saving resources that could enable you to survive another day. However, you're forced to scavenge for supplies, and that's where the real hard part comes in. You're forced to steal from people who really need it. People like the elderly couple, the sick people in the hospital, a son looking after his old parents, a wounded man trying to find his way back home to his infant boy. All these things, pull at your heart strings in ways I've never experienced in any game before. Perhaps, it would make people understand that the situation in Syria, the biggest humanitarian crisis since World War II, is something that shouldn't have happened in the first place. Unless we learn to get along with each other and come to terms with how we live our life, wars will continue to happen.Live & let live....Peace....			"

												One of the best Resource Management/Survival game out there right nowYou start out with three random survivors (I got Bruno the cook, Katia the depression queen, and a random dude either pavle the runner or Marko  with 15 slot back pack).Basically you have to survive and struggle during a massive war between the gov't soldier and the rebels. To survive you have to scavenge nearby areas for food, materials and weapons.With limited resources, you have to make a choice whether who gets to eat Bruno's delicious stews, medicines and the guitar solo. You also able to make your own supplies like moonshining, growing ""herbs"", collecting rainwater/snow, trapping rodents and making cigarettes. If you upgrade your workshop enough, you could make armors, ammo and guns. When killing either a bandits or old people, Remember your survivors have FEELINGS. they will FEEL bad especially Katia, actually DON'T let Katia kill people ever.   Because what happens they get depressed, if they get depressed too long they will commit sudoku Overall 10/10 Would trade moonshines again			"

												The first thing we think about ""war"" game, of course it's action, explosions, etc. But now we have a game which make us  think about this type of games Now we are not soldiers with best equipment and supplies, we are ordinary people. This game isn't about war itself, it's about people trying to live during it, trying to get everything need like shelter, food or medcine. This game make you empathize characters and people you meet, but that doesn't mean everyone is kind , the main danger during time like this are people, this is the first thing you have to be careful with, otherwise everything can turn sad. ""This War of Mine"" make us think what will we do if something like that happens to us, how to plan your surviving tactic,  how not to die in this world of war.Platformer style really fits gameplay, it's really interesting to watch and play like that. Gameplay is good, it's comfortable and nice to play this game, controls are simple and easy to learn. But in my opinion there some problems with stealth and other trivia, by the way that doesn't spoil the experience of playing. Developers made huge achievment, they showed us that there is something special left, that you can make small, but in the same time something huge, that's risky step, but they did great work.			"

												В большинстве игр нам предлагается быть самым бравым бойцом на поле боя. В этой с бойцами лучше не встречаться вообще. Это обычно не приводит ни к чему хорошему. Наше дело прятаться от бандитов, охотиться на крыс в подвале и искать растопку для печки, чтобы не замерзнуть.+ Набор хорошо проработанных персонажей+ Интересные локации (от перезапуска к перезапуску кампании локации меняются кардинально)+ Множество предметов + крафтинг+ Реиграбельность- Есть несколько шероховатостей в игровой механике, которые, в общем, можно и не заметить			"

												Time to stop playing FPS for a moment and think about its consequences.Personal point of view, you can surely ingore that if you want. When you point at a soldier's head in a game, will you think about his life? His lover? What will happen to his friends & relatives after you shot him? What will happen to his little girl, his greatest treasure that he want to protect to death? No, you would just think,""Oh another headshot, I'm doing fine."" Real life is always not fun. BUT that is NOT the reason you vote for war & protest in a referendum. whe you just think that fighting is ""fun"". ""Oh war is fine we like shooting each other in the face we are the youth we can protest what we against we don't afraid the consequence"". I was totally terrified when I imagined what our children will be when they grew up in a peace world with bunch of great war games that told them how to fight/shoot against each other. Yes the war can never ends. but what if we show the consequence before our chilren can start the next war?That's why I like this game so much. It did what other FPS & war games can never do.Buy this product in any worth.Honestly, when you see a bunch of developer/publisher that the purpose of the game was not to impress people. but to save innocent children from war, you should definitly buy his product.Not for your consciences, but for their bravery & determination from doing that.11/10 Best anti-war game for so long.

Started yesterday, finished today :Dthis game had me at ""hello"" ;) im not sure if its my favorite or my least favorite game though... its the first game that has me kinda melancholic even after i survived - which gamewise should be a success. I think I have a more insightful view of war now than I had before. That being said I never supported war in the first place, however now i can relate to the victims even more (i think). So + atmosphere (music, sounds, graphics) seemed perfect to me , goal of the game itself (besides making money for the people creating it) was amazingly accomplished = to show what war is like for civilians, if i gave it more thought i could probably come up with more positives since I cant think of anything negative gameplaywise- gametime (as i said, started yesterday afternoon, finished today), even though that might be a good thing, since any more time playing it might have had me depressed for a longer time,no explanation as it comes to e.g. how to turn ice into water (ingame, not real life (that one i can figure out))  - then again the civilians don't have any guides either as it comes to surviving.The price might be a little high, for that little gametime. 10 - 15 € would have been more reasonable but whatever.Thats the best criticism I could come up with. I loved the game!! Or hated it!! I dont know! At least i have strong feelings towards it!! :D			"

												I bought this game last night, pretty much sight-unseen. It was then suddenly four in the morning.I'm not sure how much credibility a review written after five hours of gameplay can hold, but I thought the first sentence probably covers whether or not I'd recommend it.In terms of actual reviewy type things, I can tell you this:The gameplay is excellent, filled with the tension you'd expect to experience living in a besieged city. This atmosphere is executed brilliantly, the art style, music and pacing all lending more to it, allowing you to really put yourself into the space presented to you with your poor, semi-displaced trio of housemates.I've played a lot of survival games and all of them have one conceit or another to explain the situation (zombies, spiders, zombies, aliens, zombies etc.) but the more realistic story in This War of Mine (a story being played out in the world in a number of places right now), in my opinion, lends it a more visceral, wholly real, experience.If you're a fan of the survival genre, or a fan of artistic, atmospheric games, I'd suggest that you will not regret handing over your money for this one.

												Damn good, and super immersive.  My 1st session lasted a lot longer than I thought it would.  Finding a balance between risk vs reward is a huge part of this game, and there's always been a sense of tension while I was playing; whether it was because we were only finding scraps of food when everyone was hungry, or when a gunman is lurking just around the corner of where you are looting. Lot's of moral decisions to make as well that may or may not reward you with some kind of supplies.The only downside I can think of are somewhat wonky combat controls, but you'll more often than not be avoiding combat anyway.So far I'd give it a 9/10.

												I read a lot of good things about this game before I finally got to play it. And for once everybody was absolutely right!!It is totally absorbing in a way that's as entertaining as it is depressing.  Slowly you become more and more involved with the war victims in the game and although it is as desperate as it probably is in real life every little victory is immensely satisfying. I never managed to play beyond day 30 yet but somehow I keep restarting and giving it another try. Although the setting is much more harsh the game reminds me of Expedition Conquistadores at times. (making your choices of where to scavenge at night and doing all the necessary chores in daytime. Also the  involvement with your characters) This is one hell of a game and I'd strongly recommend it to anyone who likes a challenge in a somber but realisttic setting. There's a lot of choices but no fast paced action, but it's probably more intense than all the Call of Duty's put together.			"

												This War of Mine could be called the offspring of DayZ and XCOM: Enemy Unknown (whose older sister was The Sims), both excellent games that are strategic, tense and merciless. But beyond that, nearly all simularities end, unless you play This War of Mine.This aptly named title, is a 2D survival game where you control a group of survivors, holed up in a shabby cottage-like structure, trying to ignore the horrors of the war going on outside and focus on living.Your first (in-game) day is essentially getting your cottage ready, you will need to get rid of rubble, grab all the supplies still within, and create furniture for your home. Sounds kinda like the Sims, right? Yeah, well, throw the idea of not letting your Sims eat food out the window now, because it gets merciless from here.The night (much like most survival games) is where the true danger is at. You are going to exhaust your supplies pretty quickly unless you go out scavenging, so it is essential you go out and collect more supplies. This is where night comes in. At night, you want to select what your party is going to be doing for the remainder of the night. Do they guard, sleep, sleep in beds, or scavenge? I generally had 1 guarding, 1-2 sleeping on beds (you have to make the beds, so don't expect them to be happy if you don't have them) and 1 scavenging. The person you have got scavenging is the only person you will control for the rest of the night.You select the site in which your scavenger will... scavenge. He/she will be controlled by you for the remainder of the night. Considering it is your first night, chances are, you have no weapons, no lockpicks, nothing. Just you, your wits and your stealth ability.You start to enter the house, slowly creeping around to make sure no one that might be in the house hears you.You scrounge around in a few cupboards, not a lot. That's when you see it: The icon that shows a hand reaching for a diamond. Do you want to take from private property? Do you want to take from people? Do you want to become a bandit? You take it, feeling guilty for your actions, and continue on.You make it back only just in time, before dawn so you could get home without a Sniper seeing you.Then, as if last night wasn't stressful enough: You've been raided. Your guard is wounded.You now have to take the time to nurse to him, sort your supplies, build all the things you need and countless other things. You start doing your work when you hear a knock on the door.A kid wants your help, he has no more medicine to tend to his mother and pleads for your help.It is up to you to decide all these moral choices, but there will always be a consequence for your actions. You may have done the right thing, but you lost some valuable supplies. You turned them down because you need them, but now your survivors are doubting their situation.I may have described the typical night, but you still need to address your teams morale, cook food, and so on. Actions such as killing people and stealing from helpless affect your team's emotions, sometimes causing PTSD. It is good to see a game take killing so seriously, it isn't done too often. Their emotions can cause them to degrade others, stop being motivated in doing their tasks, and even making them leave your group. It is something you always need to think about before taking action.Time moves interestingly in this game. Time will move 10 minutes about every 15 or so seconds. Once it reaches 8 PM, it transits into your night duties. During the night, you need to get out of there by 4:30 AM, otherwise you may not make it back. You can end both day and night early if you feel that you will be wasting time waiting. But time is of essence and you must use it wisely for your survival.The art-style consists of very little colour, with a lot of pencil detail. While it does a good job at setting the dreary mood, I did think it could have been a bit more lush and vibrant, and it can get a little straining on the eyes. Although it has good icons and controls so you get the hang of it pretty quickly, This War of Mine does lack a strong tutorial. While something can be said of realism and throwing you in the deep-end, I do feel that some people might struggle initially. It is rather hard to describe this game, because it's a game that is rather new in concept, a rather surprising sight considering the recent popularity of survival games.Overall, I really enjoyed this game, everything is thought out and all the ideas have been well executed on. It could do with some improvements, but this game does a fantastic job at showing the horrors of war in an engaging way, while also proving to still have solid game mechanics. It is a must buy for any fan of the survivalist/war-story genres.8.5 out of 10.			"

Posted: December 31, 2014
												UPDATE: With the new editor, this game can also double as Baltimore Simulator 2015. This game is basically Ukraine Simulator 2015.The Good:- There isn't really a tutorial, which helps to create an atmoshpere of caution as you play through the game. You get relatively few characters to use, each with their own benefit, so losing even one may have dire consequences.- The gameplay has the right amount of challenge to it. If you play smart, you should be alright but if you do not, you will not survive. The fact that the game is unforgiving also helps to evoke the sense of desperation present in the characters' situation.- The environment. With the right tools, you can begin to destroy things like cabinets to scavenge them for parts.- The art style. The way the game handles shading, and your characters' field of vision, is great.- The game evolves as you play. Did you leave a pile of wood in that rubble, for later? Getting back to it may suddenly become impossible, between the fighting and the snow. And if you do get back to it, there's no guarantee it'll even be there, if the area you're going has people at it. It makes the choice between that can of food, or that bunch of planks, all the more important.- Your characters give you feedback about the choices that they make, and their feedback can have tangible results in gameplay. Generally, the more horrible you are to your fellow man, the sadder your little group becomes, which seems to effect how quickly they move, or perform tasks.This game is very immersive. If you were a fan of the Fallout Series, but also enjoy a more ""serious"", even dark, atmosphere, this game is definitely for you.The Bad:- The game gets repetitious, during the day cycle. - ""Realism"". This War of Mine does a good job of drawing you into the setting, but at the same time there are a lot of little things that break one's suspension of disbelief. The way the game squishes time means that it can take your people a half an hour to climb two ladders and walk a hundred feet to answer the door. In a game focused on gathering and survival, there are a lot of things that you can't scavenge. Doors, and the planks barring the doors, I'm looking at you. Papercuts also generally don't require rolls of bandages to combat. And closing doors doesn't seem to increase the temperature in your shelter any, when it starts getting cold. Also, why I have to purify my water before I boil it, I'll never know.- The game's ""Good choice/bad choice"" moments are pretty generic ""do the good and inconvenient thing/do the bad and helpful thing"" survival choices. Where the decision making really begins to get murky, is with the internal choices such as ""Who gets to eat?"" (Sorry I let you starve Bruno, but the irony of the cook starving was too amusing).- The level of interaction you have with other people is limited in comparison to games with similar themes.- There is no tutorial. This is also in the Good category. This is also bad because the game does not explain how combat works, so the first few times a situation goes sideways you will probably lose due to figuring out what does what.This is a slower-paced game. If you are a fan of flashier/shooter games, and not a fan of micromanagement, this game probably isn't your cup of tea.All in all? I'd rate this game a solid 8.5/10.			"

												This is a war game unlike any I've ever played. Instead of playing as a soldier on the frontlines, you're playing as a band of civilians trying to survive the war-torn city. You have to scavenge for food and supplies, craft essential things like beds and stoves, and even deal with other survivors. Keeping your survivors in check by feeding them, making sure they're well-rested and not sick, and keeping specialized ones (one survivor is a better scavenger, for example, while another is good at cooking) alive is no easy task. This game definitely shows the civilian side of war, doing whatever it takes to survive.			"

												Went into a bombed school to try and trade for food. Guy saw me take one gear from a non private property box and told me it was his. I ran and jumped him with my fists only to get gunned down. Sent a second man to finish the job and killed the guy in his sleep before also dying from blood loss right after. At this point everyone else was starving or wounded. Took more stuff from the school as the third guy and I got gunned down running out of the building. The fourth was a girl. Who walked in willing to trade as her frail starving body huddled against the stairs with every step. I climbed in only to be told to get out. I crouched away slowly and they told me to hurry up. I got to the main door before turning around once more to give them my best pair of starvation glazed eyes, but they were tired of my slow♥♥♥♥♥so they shot me once and I died. GG. Will play again.

												I didn't played a lot yet, but managed to complete the first day and first night.The game is just great.During the day it is a kind of base manager, when you are giving specific tasks to your surviors.I was wondering how to feed them and how to heal them.Find out there was a possibility to build some furnitures, it is hard to choose between a bed and a stove.During the nights scavenging is pretty tought. You can just carry limited amount of stuff and you need to choose between the building materials and food. And those weird noises from behind the wall.I just grabbed what I could and run away, I was really afraid that somebody might attack me and steal the food I just found.Great experience so far.			"

												Amazing game, it's not mechanically difficult but rather it's difficulty lies in the choices you have to make in order to survive. Will you take food and medicine from an elderly couple who have no chance of surviving without it? If someone is begging for food will you give it to them or just let them starve? Will you kill a thug? what about a soldier? These are the kind of decisions you have to make and every one you make will affect your character(s). The atmosphere is heavy and the soundtrack is intense. In the hours I have played I think I only caught like 2 or 3 noticeable bugs so the developers definitely did a great job, I highly recommend it. Can't wait for Frostpunk!			"

												in short, i dont recommend cause its basically a really depressing version of the sims (old games)and theres too few actions, and imo dragging a scenario for 30+days, dosent make it ""more real"", it just makes it more tedious (imo thier actually just farming ""hours played""though the game is fairly decent graphic and function wise, it couldve been morecause honestly, i cant imagine theres nothing to do (as a civ in a warzone)than set up stills and scavenge by night...actually and im sorry if im wrong, but if this is supposed to be a REAL protrayal of life in a warzone, then this game is probably doing a great disserviceits a war repressed life simulator, but even so, its really basic, theres a crap load of realisticstrategy and actions missing, though im sure they left out the more complex thinking for ""sensitivity"" since again, this is a life simulatorthough i dont prescribe to those notions, i understand why(theres a difference tween being tastefull, and ""whitewashing"", this is whitewashed)some realisim factors bother mei definatly wouldnt choose to set up in a 4 story buildingwould have more security than a reinforced door and ""alarm"" (if im looting, probably wont use the front door)any self respecting person would clean out the debris (safety, morale and you want the space)the idea that your catching mice to feed 3 people and only set up 2 trapswould not waste the resources to make my garden look like a hydroponic lab(frame in a few rows of dirt and be done) (and its more economic to expand 1 gardenthan to set up more)also i would hope that people with addictions like smoking or coffe wouldnt get depressedand kill themselves, to me that sounds like gross overstatment,you have way more to worry about,and again, i would hope that the overwhelming majority of people would get used to it(not suicide a few days later)and since im not purchasing the DLC, ill comment on that here,children are NOT useless, they can do everything in the game that adults can,though id supervise them making meds or ammo and wouldnt give them a shotgun or asault riflealso children adapt just like adults, (sometimes better) overtime child should numb up to the circumstances, not be in perpetual fear and depression, its the undoing of those affects that presents more challengesalso a child being worked shouldnt cause depression, often they take pride in thier ability to helpaddendum* in respose to comments, to kinda justify why i focused on ""realisim""im on the fence, i cant be sure they intended to just float about the subjectand capitolize on peoples interestor they wanted to portray life as a civ in a warzonebut lacked the bagonias to actually go into itim the kind of person who sees ""based/inspired by real events""and believes ""in principal"" it sould be a realistic accountingbecause if you dont hold it to standards...poke`mon is ""inspired by real events""how is pet market supplied? people go out and capture animalsbreeding programs arnt in place for many pets(anything not cats or dogs) those that do (especialy dogs)have imbreeding issues (purebred = imbred ~70% of the time)if we look deep into that argumentthe difference tween pet ownership and pokemonis each owner didnt catch thier pet themselvescause right down to contests breeding and unfourtunate fightingdont only exist in pokemon, its real tooand while i understand its a silly comparisoni feel it does help make both points1, that the game is either, scraping the barrel for moneyor is purposely white-washing a rather serious issue2, that they should have an obligation to be realistic if thier gona claimto be ""based/inspired by real events""			"

WRONG!-Day 17: I put San as guard and somehow they managed to steal everything. You are supposed to be a wolf!-Day 30: We take in a new survivor, Dymitr.However he failed to mention he was sick, no big deal rigth? WRONG-Day 40: Winter comes, Dymitr condition worsens. We got meds no big deal rigth? WRONG-Day 51: Our meds are gone we used it up on Dymitr and he still nowere near healthy. But everyone else is fine, nothing to worry about? WRONG (againX4)-Day 62: Everyone else gets sick except for Jigo. But Jigo never has gotten sick before he must be imune, nothing to worry about? WRONG-Day 65: Jigo gets shot and is very tired from overworking him. San is getting better and i got a knife she can use, everything is good? WRONG-Day 66: San gets cornered by rebels and gets r@ped by their guns but she still manages to pwan a rebel (she dies). I still got Jigo and a few guns, everything is chill? WRONG-Day 69: Ashitaka is deppresed his b!tch died and he wont move at all. Dymitr is not well and keeps beating up Seita at nigth for no reason. I still got Jigo, all good? WRONG-Day 72: Dymitr dies because of sickness. Well this means Seita can sleep at nigth now... WRONG-Day 73: Ashitaka left our sorry butts even after we managed to craft meds for him.

												It was certainitly an interesting game, but I don't reccomend it because I swear it's trying way too hard to be edgy and depressing. For example, you kill ANYONE and the entire ♥♥♥♥ing team get depressed and starts questioning life and♥♥♥♥♥♥ I started my second playthrough, and was sneaking through a church and found this guy bragging about killing the priest who shelterd the sick and homeless during the war. The man was taking all of the church's stuff after killing everyone there, and when he spotted me tried to shoot me. So I stabbed the little♥♥♥♥♥♥to death. I take what I need, and go home. Hell, I even sparred another group of people a house over who ended up chasing after me with an AK-47, and when I had the chance to stab one, I decided to let them go. Then I get home and character is ""depressed"" and won't stop moaning about how ashamed she was of what she did. Come on, that's ridiculous. To make things worse, the rest of the team becomes sad. I can understand people getting sad when you steal from the elderly, but I genuinly can't engage even the most bloodthirsty tyrants without everyone getting sad. Stop trying to make me feel bad for killing murderers, because I don't feel bad about it. Additionally, the difficulty is fun at first, but just gets stupid at some points. It gets to the point where your people are getting sick and injured for no reason. I keep a furnace with kindling in it 24/7 to keep my place warm, yet everyone gets sick because of the cold 2/3 of my team ended up terminally ill as well. I put people on gaurd every night, and build defnses, yet we get raided every night. A hard game is fine, but a cheating game is not. If I can't counter these problems, why put them in and pretend I can counter them? An interesting idea, but it needs some polishing before I can reccomend it.			"

This War Of Mine Game ini bener bener slow and mellow banget. Susananya sedih, putus asa, dan pelan banget membuat lo gak sadar bahwa lo udah menghabis 5 jam ++ ketika pertama kali main game ini. This War Of Mine bener bener membuka pandangan baru terhadap perang dan pengalaman yang jarang banget ada game lain. Kalau lo liat game lagi sale, lo musti beli.Score total = 8 dari 10 Storyline : 8 jam gue bermain dan kayanya sih gak ada storyline. Dari awal sampai akhir lo mempunyai kebebasan bagaimana caranya lo ingin survive. Walau pun begitu, disetiap karakter terdapat semacam background cerita kecil yang... kayanya nih yah... sama sekali gak mempunyai efek begitu besar didalam gameplay. Jadi, ya basically, lo bakalan memulai game dengan 3 orang karakter random dengan background ceritanya masing masing dan lo musti memanage ke 3 orang tersebut untuk survive.Display : Ini adalah game 3D side scrolling game. For some reason, elemen grafiknnya cukup kuat disini. So beberapa tempat yang lo bakalan datangi bakalan hancur. Jelas banget bekas peperangannya seperti lubang peluru, tembok hancur, atap rubuh, pintu di blokir, ban dibakar, gelap, grafiti dll. Efek yang paling menarik adalah efek pensil disetiap tembok. Seakan akan lo sedang 'menonton' sebuah lukisan. Animasi yang ditawarkan juga sederhana aja. Mulai dari default sampai combat keliatan mulus dan udah dipoles secara sempurna. Gue sampai sejauh ini gak menemukan bug atau glitch didalam game ini. Music : Jujur gue jarang banget membahas aspek musik didalam game tapi gue punya pengecualian dengan game ini. Perpaduan grafik dan musik ini membuat lo galau dan putus asa. Musiknya itu melow banget... Serius, musiknya berhasil menyedot gue kedalam game. Gue tuh rasanya baru main satu jam, tapi begitu gue nengok ke jam dinding, eh udah 8 jam aja. Ini baru satu kali main lho.. baru satu kali pencet tombol play di Steam. Gameplay : Survival, looting and crafting. Yup, tiga kalimat ini udah jelas banget ya. Misi utama lo adalah survival ditengah peperangan. Lo musti bertahan diri dari panggilan alam (lapar atau sakit), bandit, bahkan teman lo sendiri. Nah, untuk bisa memenuhi kebutuhan lo, mau gak mau lo musti looting. Pertama kali main, gak akan ada tutorial. Jadi lo langsung muncul dengan 3 orang karakter dan sama sekali gak tau musti apa yang dipencet atau apa yang di klik. Duh... Nah, ketika lo udah berkenalan dengan control, mulai deh. Hal yang pertama kali lo musti lakukan adalah looting markas lo sendiri. Lo bisa search di lemari, meja, dsb lah. Begitu udah cukup resource, segera buat workshoop dan toolshop. WAJIB BUAT SHOVEL DAN CROWBAR karena itu adalah 2 tools untuk looting. Setelah itu bebas deh mau buat apa.. ini review ya bukan tutorial jadi you figure it out lah.. okay balik maning, setelah lo looting dan crafting, lo musti cari resource lagi ditempat lain. Begitu end of the day, lo bakalan memanage tugas karakter lo. Satu disuruh jaga, satu disuruh tidur, satu disuruh scavenge ya itu terserah lo. Nah begitu lo menyuruh scavenge, gameplay bakalan masuk ke tempat lain dan tugas lo adalah looting. Ingat, lo cuman punya waktu 1 malam untuk looting. Lo musti pulang sebelum matahari terbit atau ada kemungkinan besar karakter lo mati. Begitu karakter lo kembali, do that crafting, cooking, sleeping and stuff.Kesimpulan : This War Of Mine adalah game bagus yang bener bener niat. Game ini menekankan gameplay sebagai senjata utamanya. Harganya juga masuk akal kok dengan fitur yang ditawarkan. Fair price. Kalau lo suka survival looting dan crafting dengan spek komputer standart, ya lo bisa coba lah game ini. Gue jamin, lo ikutan galau. Jujur, butuh tingkat pemikiran dan daya filosofi yang lumayan untuk main game ini.			"

												This game really doesn't have much behind the shiny coat of paint it dons. Stripping it away reveals an overly simplistic inventory management game with rudimentary stealth and combat mechanics.And don't get me wrong, I love inventory management. But this game is bogged down by so many annoyances that add up, resulting in a game that is extremely tedious and boring to play. Some problems could've been avoided by adding a timer speed up, some could have been avoided with some balancing. Why do I have to watch a character dig a pile of rubble for two minutes and have nothing to do meanwhile? The shelter management is a joke, it could've probably been a text-based screen and it would've been much better. It is RIDICULOUSLY easy if you survive after the first few days. You will be drowning in expensive resources after you learn to prioritize what to loot. Trading is balanced poorly - why would you ever waste your time travelling to a trader when you can just scavenge meanwhile and sell/buy the junk you need from the trader that comes to your house every 3-4 days?And as much as the theme and atmosphere of this game is praised, most of it falls flat because of bad game mechanics, and the other times is just so obnoxiously ham-fisted. You can loot an elderly couples house of all food and medical supplies and replace it with wood blocks, yet they will somehow manage to live happily until the end of the war. The game just tells you to feel bad without actually showing anything happening due to your actions, save for a few rare exceptions.I can only recommend getting this during a sale, for a touch device preferably. Expecting an interesting narrative or captivating gameplay will leave you disappointed otherwise.			"

												This game was at the top of my wishlist since it came out. Due to various backlogs, I decided not to buy at launch and instead wait for a sale. The 60% off a few days ago did it for me. Sadly, I must say, I am pretty disappointed having now played the game. There is absolutely no overreaching narrative. Whatever threadbare narrative the game has, is repetitive (character dialogues for example) or predictable (the letters/notes you occasionally find). This game is all about the gameplay, and on a personal level, I am not fond of such mechanics. Collect/loot stuff to craft items/weapons/equipments etc. Micromanaging. I wouldn't have mind if this was a vessel to a great narrative, but it is not...it is the focal point of the game. Again, I repeat, I am not fond of such mechanics, hence why I am disappointed in the game. It's not a game for everybody, that's for sure (but if that's the case, I'm surprised with the 96% rating). If there's one thing the game does exceptionally well, is that it makes you feel depressed while playing it. No kidding. Everything moves at a slow pace. Sometimes you just can't do anything cause your characters are broken/depressed/tired. It's also quite unforgiving, and is a game meant to be replayed many times before you can ""win"", but having already played twice into the 20-days region, I cannot imagine playing again..just seems too repetitive if I do that. I'll not recommend it based on my personal experience and expectations, but the game is well-made enough that if you like such gameplay and don't care about narratives/story, then you should get it.

Posted: April 1, 2015
												I really want to recommend this game, but for reasons that I will explain, I just can't.Firstly, let me just say that this is the most unforgiving game I have ever played. I am not opposed to difficult games; I played a lot of FTL: Faster Than Light, for example. But this game's difficulty is utterly ridiculous and it is locked in ironman mode, which means that making a single mistake will completely and irredeemably screw you over. And you WILL make plenty of mistakes, over and over again. Every time this happens, you will lose 4-8 hours of playtime.For example, let's say you didn't make enough ammo to defend your shelter during the night. And let's say during the limited time you had during the day cycle, you'd done everything else right - you'd made food, filtered water, crafted some things, got your characters rested up and healed, took meds, traded, etc., but you forgot that one crucial task of making ammo. Well, now raiders have come in the night and stolen all of your food (as raiders always take the most valuable items). Now you have to sit back and watch your characters starve to death, or perhaps you'll have to risk stealing from a military base or rebel camp in order to get what you need - and of course, these dangerous locations are filled with swarms of heavily armed enemies who have infinite ammo and perfect aim.Or perhaps you didn't collect quite enough materials to build a heater when winter came? Well, now your characters are going to get sick and freeze to death. Or perhaps you clicked the wrong button during a scavenge and caused your character to stop sneaking? Now your character is dead because they alerted a swarm of enemies. So many little things can go wrong, and each time they do, you're forced to watch your characters die - often slowly and painfully. In most cases, there is absolutely nothing you can do.To make matters worse, the game is extremely bad at explaining itself. There is no tutorial of any kind. You are dropped into the game with no idea of how things work whatsoever, and this is a problem, because some of the game's mechanics don't make a lot of sense.I will use the example of the first time I really attempted combat. I wanted to raid a rebel camp, so I armed one of my characters with an AK-47 (the most powerful weapon in the game), and a knife, in case he ran out of ammo. I managed to sneak up on a rebel all alone, from behind. I figured that shooting an unarmored, unsuspecting target in the back with a burst of assault rifle fire would be an instant kill, but no. He stumbles a little bit, and then rushes at me with the force of a cheetah on steroids. I blast him again and he finally goes down. Now I'm lower on ammo than I'd like to be. Then I see a swarm of other rebels responding to the noise. I panic. I see a desk nearby that my character can apparently use as cover and hide behind it. I think to myself, ""Yeah baby! I've got a chance to win this fight after all!""Nope. The rebels see me and fire with perfect accuracy, inflicting full damage. My character helplessly dies. Apparently, the cover mechanic does absolutely nothing. I felt a bit puzzled as to why they included a cover mechanic at all if that's the case, but regardless, I strongly felt that they should've explained this to me at some point before I invested six hours into my savegame and ended up losing one of my most important characters.Other problems occur when you misjudge how NPC's will react to you. This won't be your fault, because the NPC's in this game do not act like people. Once, I sent Zlata into to the hospital area. When she was there, she tried to open a locker with a crowbar. The locker was not marked as a ""stealable"" object, but nevertheless the game treated her action as a crime, and there was a civilian nearby to witness it. So, I got Zlata out of there as fast as I could - I didn't even finish opening the locker. I hoped that the hospital staff would forget about it. The next time I visited, I sent another character, Katia, just to be safe. But apparently the guards knew - through telepathy, I guess - that Katia and Zlata both lived together, and so they treated Katia as though she was the one who had committed the crime. They blasted her to bits without hesitation or remorse. I was left scratching my head at this.Further problems occur when you bump up against the game's confusing and arbitrary limits on craftable items. For example, I had two animal traps, and I figured that I'd make a third, as they were proving to be an excellent source of food. So, I sent out a scavenger to collect all of the materials necessary to build another one. When he got back, he couldn't craft it. Why? Apparently the limit for animal traps is ""2"". No reason given, it's just an arbitrary limit. I had plenty of space and enough materials to build it, but that didn't matter. The game simply refuses to let you succeed in your own way; you must play by its nonsensical rules.Another big problem is that everything is determined randomly, so circumstances completely outside of your control can also screw you over. Certain areas of the city are sometimes blocked off due to ""heavy fighting"", and during the winter, certain areas of the city cannot be reached due to ""heavy snow"". And if every location you CAN reach has already been picked clean of resources, you have no choice but to watch your characters slowly starve/get sick/get depressed/die, risk stealing and get killed, and probably flush yet another savegame down the toilet.The reasons I WANT to recommend this game are simple: It has beautiful graphics, fluid animation, great music, an original premise, and makes excellent use of photography. Most of the time when you are scrabbling through ruins, racing against the clock and managing your resources, the game feels good. The parts of this game that work actually work beautifully. It is evident that a lot of love has gone into this game, and for these reasons the game is deserving of respect. It attempts to be a simulation of what it's like to be a civilian living in wartime, and at this it often succeeds.But as a game (that is meant to entertain) it utterly fails. The only emotion you will feel as you play this game is frustration, and that isn't fun. The rough edges also leave something to be desired.Get it on sale if you're truly interested.			"

""Review - This War of Mine""IN A WAR, NOT EVERYONE IS A SOLDIER.I totally recommend this game to everyone who wants to experience a new type of war game. This game has emotion, thrill and excitement. You make your own story. Your survival depends on the decisions you make. Will you kill someone just to survive or will you help everyone you see and thrive in hunger and sickness.In war, it's hard to fight and defeat your enemies but what more if you're just a civilian? In this game, you play as a civilian with your group trying to survive in the midst of war. Resources are very scarce. You have to scavenge for food, meds, weapons, etc. in order to survive. You also have the option to make a trade/barter with other civilians or even with bandits, thugs and soldiers but beware that not all of them are trustworthy. Here are some awesome realistic things that I like:Highlights:+ Real Conscience is included - When you do a bad thing (hurting, killing), the whole group suffers a ""Sad"", ""Depressed"" or ""Broken"" state of emotions.+ When all hope is lost, you can control your characters to encourage the others that it's not the end.+ Suicide is also present in this game. (When all hope is lost.)+ When all of your characters have lost hope, they will be unable to move even if you order them.+ Your main goal is to survive until the war ends. (The date of the war's end is at random.)+ Make big decisions like would you help others outside your shelter for a night in exchange of downsizing your shelter's numbers. (You might get raided.)+ Realism - When you attack or do something bad in a certain area with a character, they don't forget what you did. If you say, kill someone at the hospital area. If you return there, the soldiers will immeadiately shoot at you once they see you.+  When one of your characters is severely wounded, your character moves very slow and rests while moving from time to time.+ When one of your characters is ill/sick, they can recover by just staying in bed.Update Features:+ You get to choose your starting group or gamble it all with a random group.+ When starting a new game with a certain group, not all maps are the same. I'm not sure but I think there are 3 different maps in the game.+ Depending on the group you choose, your shelter will be different. It can be the original big house with a lot of fixing to do and there's also another one which does not need any fixing at all.+ Each group combination has now there own backstory as to how they got together.+ You can now make your own story with the new level editor. You can create your own characters from the templates provided, choose their backstory, select which places will be available for the story, set how long and how dreadful the winter is and finally, choose how many characters will you have in the group.NOTE: I already finished the whole game before the update features were added. The new features were meant to increase the game's replayability.There's not much room for mercy. It's either you survive for another day or you die. Remember that in this world, there are no right choices but to survive.			"

												I made one wrong choice and one of my crew died a lonely, brutal death. In that sense, it's incredibly realistic, I should imagine (without any experience of living in a war-torn country, I can only surmise this).Sad thing is, if I'd have chosen to run instead of (attempting to) batter two people to death with a shovel, I'd have escaped with the much-needed food and supplies, my game would look very different and my other survivors wouldn't be close to starving.I'm sorry Pavle - I let you down. To the rest...well, I tried.UPDATE: It only got worse from here on out. Roman died the next night in the same way as Pavle. Then, just as things were looking up and we started stockpiling vital supplies, Bruno betrayed the others and ran away with all the food, meds and bandages. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Marko left one night without a word. Arica did a Bruno and left with what little I had left. Finally, unable to cope with the betrayal and the terminal illness she had, Katia committed suicide.I'm left here feeling empty and also incredibly angry at Bruno, as that was the turning point, I believe.Next time I'll have to get hold of weapons earlier, secure my shelter and make some tradeable items. I got to day 32, near the end (I think), but it was all too much...*sobs*Long story short: compelling war game from the other side of the war, with quite an emotional punch.			"

												I love games about war and warfare, like casual FPS or RTS games, but I knew those games are not showing the real face of horror. A war is terrible and we can't even imagine what can bring.This War of Mine was the perfect example what a war can bring and in a war you are not always the awesome spec ops guy with big guns... in this game you are the civilian who try to survive day to day in... Hell. Games like this can teach us a lot of things.As for the game...-Nice unique visuals (at least for me)-Nice events and story telling-Characters are real living beings, you can symphatise with them-Nice survival and craft system-FEEELS and SNIPERS on every corner (OK just kidding:D Feels are more dangerous than snipers in this game xD)-Scavange is a responsible task-Choices have impact on your characters and on the game-Violence, murder, stealing is NOT always the only option!-You will find new difficulty after every dayI really enyojd this game, and I hope more people will get it, because games like this have future. If you up to a little challenge, and you're not a depressive type, plus you saw enough BLOODY-SCREEN-SO-REAL MLG FPS sh*t games and you want to see what a war can bring... this game is for you.			"

First gameplay:Day 21:Borris: died while searching for supplies in a little hotel, couldn't absorb shotgun shells.Day 22:Katia: as Borris had the bandages and medicine when he died, we couldn't stop her bleedings, she died because of that.Day 27:Pavle: while Bruno was away, seeking for food at night, Pavle decided to get away and died from a gunshot in the back.Day 40:Bruno: even thought he wasn't ill or hurt, even tought he was fed and had a lot of supplies, he decided to kill himself because he was too sad.Review TLDR:Let's be honest here, this game is one of the best game I've ever played. It clearly deserves a perfect and non-ironic 10/10.Final reviewIntroduction:I bought this game almost a year ago (2nd January 2015), and I first played it back then and, because I failed my first playthrough, forgot about the game for a while after making a first review which was this summary of my first experience with it. I decided that for this winter holiday 2015 that I'd give it a second shot, and I managed to survive ! With my brand new eyes, I decided to make a full review of this awesome game that is This War of Mine.Storyline:You are a group of survivors during a fictionnal civil war that tries to survive and get through it. During the day, you are in your shelter, and you can build a lot of useful stuff like beds, furnace, radio, weapons etc. There are some random events where for example a trader will com to your place and you can trade your items for some other supplies. During the night, you visit (not so) deserted places to try and find some more supplies, such as material, woods, weapon parts, food, medicine etc. In this time, your shelter can get attacked, so you'd better keep someone away in your home, if you don't want to get robbed or killed in your own home (note that you don't control anything, it's done automatically).Strenght of the game:This game has a lot of strong aspect that I'm going to discuss here.1. The graphics are really appealing to me. I loved the pencil-like texture applied to the whole game. It's dark, but it puts you in this civil war athmosphere.2. Another aspect of the game design that I liked a lot is the characters you control, because they really feel like civilians, and you can relate and connect to them. It's done through their bio and their reactions, that feel really human and plausible.3. While I'm at the reactions of you characters, this is what make the game really sad and heartbreaking. Your characters will regret killing and robbing people, as much as they'll regret when one of them dies or is sick. You feel the need to help and protect them, and this type of reaction is something that really breaks your heart.4. In addition to the character's reactions, the music is another aspect that is well done. It's melancholic, it's accoustic, it's perfect for this game.5. Let's talk about the gameplay. It's a point and click game, you play it entirely with your mouse. You have a lot of actions to chose from for every situation, the mechanics are well-crafted and pretty strong for this game.6. Other things such as the radio programms or the places you can go at night add to the immersion, as they are realistic for a civil war.7. My final positive point for this game is the DLCs and the game in itself: every benefits made from this game go to charity for War Child, an association that helps kids around the world where they face war on a daily basis, providing food, supplies, schools and much more to them. Just for that aspect, I even bought it in a shop where I found a physical version of the game. I may have paid twice this game and chosen to pay the DLC 20 bucks, but I regret nothing, as I know it's for a good cause. I think more charity groups should do games like this: they are great games and a great way to donate to charity, a way where everyone wins something.Weakness of the game:The question here would be ""has this game any weakness at all?"" because it's a strong game in every aspect you could imagine. Well the only negative point I would make is the fact it's not that kind of game you can play anytime you want just for fun. It's not a funny game, but is the subject a fun one? No not really, so it's understandable that it may be a depressing game. That's why I don't play it often, because it's sad and tragic.Conclusion:All in all, this game deserves to be purchased a hundred times. It's a well-crafted survival point and click game with a really deep and sad athmosphere where you can relate to your characters. It's sad, it's well-done, and it's for charity, so I don't see any reasons of why you shouldn't buy this game.VerdictIn a whole, the game is almost perfect, it may have this flaw where you don't play it often, but otherwise it's one of the best game I've ever played. It's an intriguing and tragic experience that everyone should try at least once in their lives. For me, it's a strong and non-ironic 10 out of 10. "

												Damn good game. Compelling and addictive.The game is at first a little challenging but after understanding all the mechanics it's quite easy and you can't get as much replayability to it. However the Devs are doing good work on improving that and the workshop mods so that they can affect the entire mechanics and game settings. I expect the game to have much new-found interest in it after this change and to be even more enjoyable.Damn good.			"

												Really good game. It fills the void that Gods Will Be Watching so horribly failed to fill. Most of the decisions in the game are intuitive and aren't answered by a yes or no. For example, there could be a situation where you have to choose between trading with a family in a house or sneaking in and robbing them. The characters are all very human, and react realistically to what you do. Despite being depressing, it's extremely addictive. I spent four hours in the game and the time just flew by. Replayability isn't an issue either, there are several different characters that you might get when you start a new game and loot is kind of random. The buildings are more or less the same each run, but the day that they are available changes, so you'll find yourself entering buildings in different orders and discovering different things.			"

												This War of Mine is a two dimensional (for character movement, but 3 dimensional objects) survival game about the civilians left behind in warzones. Personally, I found it to be heart-moving and a new experience.Gameplay: During the day, you can fix food, wounds, your home, craft things, weapons, etc. Your initial characters are randomized and they have different bonuses which will allow you to react to the different challenges and random events which appear on your in-game doorstep. At night you will send one to scavenge, and leave the rest to either sleep or guard, in case of raids. Crafting is not really like other games like Terraria or Don't Starve because resources are never really plentiful, and luck isn't a huge factor. Crafting is really about resource and time management (although days are long enough to be stress free, you can only do so much in one day). There are no special items (other than weapons) which cannot be acquired in multiple ways, but you need to choose between many important things to survive. For instance, if you have no food and injured people, you may want to build a guitar so that not everyone becomes depressed for when you kill innocents to take their things. It's depressing but planning is required. Notes: 2D style reminds me of Deadlight.Pros:Nice resource management rather than typical crafting.Emotional statementEncourages donation to charitiesRandomization keeps things interestingCons:Gets repetitiveVery hard (though only a weak con, and learning curve helps)-Especially if you're in a rut			"

												This game is so depressing.... It's exceptional but incredibly sad.Everyone has their Day 1-5 stories and I won't do mine by day but rather as a series of how my life went:-Started off fine. Went out, collected materials including some food (enough to feed the three of us).-Looters kept breaking in and I didn't know how to reinforce the perimeter. Food became scarce.-I started taking bigger and bigger risks.-It all went down hill when I encountered a priest. He was searching for ammunition when I entered and it spooked me so I stabbed him. I think I made a mistake...so did the character.-Suddenly depression starts spreading in my base (by now we had a fourth member).-The tipping point was in our biggest hunger. I knew we needed to turn the tide so I went where I knew there was a lot of food. I knew I'd be stealing but better us than them right?-Well in the effort I killed one guy, scared the rest, took their food. The last thing he said to me was ""please, you can't do this to us! I'm begging you!"" I ran.-Depression was so strong that one of my members left.-Eventually only three remained, one too depressed to do anything.-I sent my most capable man out and he ended up getting wounded and the wound was later infected.-The depressed guy went out on his own to find his family and was killed by bandits.-The wounded guy died from his infections (unable to get to the hospital).-And the last guy was so depressed that I had him walk to Sniper Alley and die so he could finally ""find peace"" as he called it.Basically, it's pretty damned sad.Extra Note:I've never survived past 19 days. It's incredibly difficult but apparently people have made it to the end. I can't manage. Typically my biggest trouble is getting enough water to cook my meals. And my survivors get so sluggish and depressed when forced to do something. Then the comforting process is so long. They really need to support each other emotionally but it takes too much time out of the day.			"

												Finally, a survival game where you're not the one running around with a gun. This game gives food for thought and emotions which everyone should experience, despite the fact that it's very sad. You won't have fun playing it, but you will definitely be happy you tried this game.Also, buy the DLC, please.			"

												A unique view on the whole war issue which unfortunately befalls a large part of the world. In this war game you do not play as the hero who wields a knife or 360 no-scopes people, but rather helpless victimes of the war: children, women, and even ordinary men. Buy purchasing the game, you not only award yourself with this gem of a game, but also contribute toward a better cause by supporting Child of War charity. 10/10 would scavenge again			"

												First of all do not play this game if you already are a depressive person. It won't make you feel any better.This is a game that will make you suffer for you every decision being it 'good' or 'bad'. There are no medals, there is no honor, only civilians crying for help. You must scavenge for surviving but eventually you'll be forced to go into dangerous territory and maybe you'll have to choose to kill or die... just remember: you are not a born killer. You will get depressed and even be a completely broken person that just can't do anything else. Your mind just crack out of depression and leading you to maybe even worse...This is a point an click game where you'll have to survive in any possible way for an unkown time. You never know when the war will end and it will feel like forever. The combat is really simple wich does not means by anyway that you will succeed on your engagements, on the contrary. You might have to steal, maybe even threaten innocent people or watch hopelessly while a soldier forces a mother to do him a ""service"". Being a nice guy all the time will have it's consequences, so you'll have to really ponder if you really can afford being nice.This is a game that will make you comprehend what a war really is like, although only real survivors will ever understand the true horror.

												This game is utterly amazing. It combines an old gameplay style with modern graphics, a basic yet great resource system, and compelling characters who each can benefit in their own way. Sometimes I find it difficult to pry myself away from it. Each minute is a pressuring moment- wether it be sneaking within a military outpost to steal supplies or risk a few of my canned food for a complete stranger attempting to survive just like us. However, I would find it incredibly intriguing to include a child or two which can join your band of survivors. I know this may be alot to ask for, considering all the people who would probably get all 'Mothery' about it, but I would think most of my plathroughs would have made it farther with a child. For instance, children are extremely small and can be more productive then adults and may heighten morale due to their 'bubbley' personality. Not all children are like that, but still. Perhaps the child could beg for food? It could open up so many more doors if children were included.			"

												This game..When I first saw This War Of Mine, I was pulled in by the idea of the tables being turned.. Rather than another FPS or something similar, this takes you into the lives of the people caught in the middle of hell. People who have to fight and scavenge off others who are just as poorly off, to survive a little while longer and perhaps make it through the war.As I started playing, I thought by the looks of it, it isn't something I can hugely immerse myself into. How wrong I was. On my second scavenging night, the paranoia of being caught, the anxiety of time not being on your side and the stress of needing to find as much stuff as possible to not have wasted a night is insane. By this time, I already was so drawn in that I felt connected with the group I had managed to keep alive for nearly 10 days, their light just barely alive. A while after, a person in my group, Bruno, died from severe wounds after we were robbed by force. The other two, were too broken to even move because they could no longer take it.. With no one left around to console them, it was over, I was done for. I had failed to keep my group alive, their regret of my choice to steal from other survivors breaking them further was too much.This game, makes you question everything, and opens your eyes to the real hardships and horrors of war. War is a terrible, terrible thing in of itself, and this captures every piece of what it's like to be a poor survivor stuck in the middle perfectly. This war of mine is a tragic masterpiece and a horrible bit of art in every meaning of the word.I cannot send enough praise to the developers way for capturing this so well.			"

												This is a nice game of resource management and taking chances. Although it is mostly skill that gets you through combative encounters, enough can go wrong with little mistake on your part to cause severe problems for you (such as a good character who is severely injured or killed). There's enough meat to this game for you to want to read about the other characters and try to figure out which ones make for the best teams. The save system is a bit brutal as it auto saves. So it's hard to run through the game correcting small mistakes with reloading. Instead, your small mistakes become game-long woes that you have to add to your list of problems you have to overcome. There's also some strategy in the way you trade resources. For example, there's a vendor that sometimes shows up at your house and he is excellent to buy bulky but inexpensive construction materials from so you can save your scavenging inventory space for better things.There is some variation in the levels you get and how they are initially set up. Some areas have guards placed in slightly different arrangements so that in one playthrough getting all the loot at some outpost is much easier than in another playthrough, but it is slight and not all zones have it (and typically they just have an either or setup and it isn't elabourate). It's a shame they didn't make more use of that mechanic.One big con I had was, SPOILER ALERT, no bad guys ever came to your door. You would think since you're in the middle of a war that the invading army might show up at your place and like extort food or something from you or you'd have to fight in your own home to defend it or whatever. Kind of a shame since it would be cool to have the ability to plan out and build your defenses.The game isn't very long and there's not a whole heck of a lot of replay to this game even though that seems odd considering it's a rogue like. But there's just a lot of boilerplate crap you need to get through in the beginning of a new game and things don't really heat up until quite a bit later...and then it's just one little mistake and you screw up your entire game and it autosaves and you throw your hands up and quit.That's actually a pretty bad thing about the game. I mean, the sound and artwork is great for its theme. I'm so happy that this isn't about zombies even though it literally perfectly fits for that theme. I would love to see more skills and mechanics put into the game  and more interesting levels with more complicated puzzles or plots or character interactions bartering etc.The somewhat variable time limit of the game is nice to keep things balanced, but it would be nice if I could just continue playing in a sandboxy mode or something. I don't know. I guess what I'm saying is I wish there was more...which usually means the game is worth a thumbs up, despite it's problems. "

												One of the best games that I've ever played. This War of Mine is a side-scrolling point and click game. You start out with three survivors,each with a story. You'll continue to unlock stories from each survivor's past as you progress through the game and you will also be able to recruit a fourth survivor later on in the game. So far, I've only seen two different sets of survivors. Sometimes you'll start out in a broken down house in the winter. Sometimes you'll start out in the same broken down house in the spring. The items that you find in the house are never the same. In this game, you're expected to fulfill the needs of the group of survivors that you control and scavenge for materials,food,medicine and weapons. During the night, you have the option to stay in your house(Which no one ever does unless if they're fully stocked somehow. @.@) or you can pick one survivor from your group to scavenge.You'll be playing that survivor during scavenger mode. Each building has a different lay out and some surprise events might be triggered when you enter the building. You have the option to kill whoever you meet and then rob them of their things OR you can play as the nice guy who just moves around and scavenges through rubble(Good luck with that).During the day time you have the option to upgrade your house that your group of survivors are living in,cook,craft items,barter with other survivors if they come to your house or help with special events that happen from time to time.For a game made by an indie company,game's playable and I found no bugs in it(I'm looking at you Ubisoft).You're not in the shoes of an elite one man army killing machine(Well maybe except for the stealth kills in scavenger mode). You're in the shoes of survivors that aren't unstoppable. It's one of the very games that we needed and a game that I haven't seen in a long time.Overall this game is amazing I'd say 9/10. There can be a few improvements to the game-play but the games good enough in my opinion. Game's not revolutionary but it's fun.			"

												Tl:DR This game means to you what you let it.This game is not the sort of thing everyone is going to get the intended effect with. It's not a survival horror game, it's not even really a game. I don't mean that in the way that it is lacking in any sort of gameplay elements.  Rather, I mean that if you go into it thinking it's just going to be a thematic 2D ""The Forest"" or any of those 'craft and escape the island' games, you're not going to leave with that same impression. The way I see it, there are two types of responses. ""This game was boring"" and ""I'm emotionally scarred that was so sad"". Part of that difference lies in how much you are willing to invest yourself in making stories for each character beyond what is given to you. If you take the speech bubbles as ALL your characters ever think, of course you're going to feel this is flat and unenjoyable. But if you look at this game, and try to imagine yourself and the people you care about as being in this situation, and twist the events and experiences into true moments in the world, it's going to be a hard play. Maybe you'll cry when a friend who you've been trying to save finally dies from sickness, because you couldn't keep the shelter warm enough. Maybe you send a reliable scout out to gather materials and he ends up getting shot and killed. Maybe you see a pair of children, trying to get medicine for their sick mother, and sadly tell them there is no way you can help them. Maybe they walk away, and you watch them go, knowing they'll never make it. Hoping against hope that they might. Wondering, as you lay in your home with nothing but the bite of cold and the sickness and barely enough strength to make it to the door as you hear the knocking again, how this is going to end.If you go into this with a vivid imagination and compassion. It's going to crush you more than once. If you go into it expecting it to be a fun little crafting survival game and take only what it gives you, it's going to bore you. You get out of this what you put into it.			"

												It's been a while since I've played, and I didn't play for long when I did. There's a reason for that. I don't want to trivialize what happened.I started an average game with an average cast. Of them, one stands out in my memory: a soccer player who could run a bit faster than everyone else and who could carry a decent amount, too. He was my first pick for forays outside. Me and him, we were able to dart in and out of places easy, make deals with other survivors, and come back home safe.That was, until one fateful night.We went to what we thought was an abandoned house. Bit out of sorts, shelled, but still standing nonetheless. I walked up to the front door, thinking I'd greet any survivors and possibly work out a deal with them. In retrospect, I should've been more understanding when they pursued me, and I should've ran away instead of further into the map. Hell, at the end, I drew a knife I found on them and tried to defend myself. But their shotgun blew my soccer player away.The man I had relied on was dead.In my mind, there was only one thing left to do: retrieve his body and bring justice to those who murdered him. I returned to a shop I had been to earlier. They sold handgun parts, but I couldn't afford them, so I killed them. I killed a man's son in front of him while he cried for me to stop. Then I killed him. Rest for the weary, I thought. He was going to die soon without that medicine the man was trading for, anyways.Of course, the young man I killed would've lived longer, but I omitted that.I started omitting a lot of things, honestly.After going back and systematically killing every member of the offending family that murdered my soccer player, I felt I had carried out justice. But that wasn't the end to this ""justice"". I went to a supermarket and found dirty raiders, looters, and bandits. They're improper folk, I mused. The world'd be much better off without such ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ children. And so they died, too. For justice. As time went on, lives ended, and round after round was chambered, this perversion of justice came to a climax. I was down to one man. All the others had died in combat, including during raids on my home carried out by the families of those I killed. Honorable deaths, all of them. None of them like my soccer player. I armed my one man with an AK and stormed a hotel that was being used as a distribution hub for human trafficking. Many died. So did I. I could have started another playthrough. I did, actually. But not far in I realized that I had already taken all I needed to learn from this game, and that playing it further would be - pardon the expression - an injustice to what I had learned.It was at the end that I realized what this game was getting at: humans can rationalize a lot. Sure, I was detached from it all. I wasn't seeing through my eyes and smelling their blood and feces. But the decisions I made - for ""justice"" - were inherently flawed. In putting down what i thought to be monsters, I became one myself. And to uphold a moral, I broke it beyond recognition.			"

I had failed to keep my group alive, their regret of my choice to steal from other survivors breaking them further was too much.This game, makes you question everything, and opens your eyes to the real hardships and horrors of war. War is a terrible, terrible thing in of itself, and this captures every piece of what it's like to be a poor survivor stuck in the middle perfectly. This war of mine is a tragic masterpiece and a horrible bit of art in every meaning of the word.I cannot send enough praise to the developers way for capturing this so well.			"

												Great game.A much-needed perspective on the 'glory' of war many spoke of. In light of abundance of war-style FPS, RTS, RPGs which boast of the valour and honour many sought after on the battlefield, now see the valour and honour of man and women off the battlefield.On a side note, one of those rare games, that actually reminded me how precious much commodities with which I am blessed with, a stark reminder that the world is not just all nice and pretty on my side of the planet.(I haven even finish yet, I am so reluctant to face the inevitable, I can't stand death)			"

												Welcome to Ukraine simulator.  You play as three people who are trying to live in a warzone.  A universe where you only use water to cook your food and not to drink.  Everybody gets really hungry and tired all the time, which really bums me out.  Also you can tell it is really good by all the other reviews that says it is good.  These reviews focus on artstyle and sound.  The stencil art makes it look like a drawing which really adds to the realism.  The game mechanics are also really good.  Most games have you pressing five or six buttons to complete the game, but this game only has you worrying about left and right mouse button!  The simplicity really adds to the experience.  This game could also be a horror game so watch out, because everytime I see the still photos of the characters blink I want to drop kick my computer.  Games like this that have strong messages are really rare nowadays.  Especially when the message is as simple as ""war is bad.""			"

												This game is what a true survival game should be. It's so different compared to all the mainstream survival nowadays. First of all, loot and storage system, unlike other survival games where you will only find it hard to survive the first few days and then after continous looting, you will be fine for the rest of the game. This game however will cause you to really strategies how you are going to manage your resources as you will be running low on everything from the start of the game until the end. The game is hard to play at first but after you get used to the mechanics, it should get easier but it's still gonna be harder than mainstream survival games (Took me few restarts to finally get used to the game as I don't want to lose any survivors throughout the playthrough). Each survivor has unique abilities which makes the game more fun as it gives you the choice to choose which type of survivors you'd like to play with through out the playthrough.			"

												Love The Game its very sad and realistic it may have a 96% positive reveiw but thats an understatement in my books it fits atleast a 99% one of my favorite things is how interactive the worls is and how attached you grow to your charectors I was crying when Bruno was killed by a bullet to the head then pavle runs to save him then he gets killes then Katia runs and hides as they steal everything i cried and cried it was sad and brutal such an emotional game get it worth everycent but i wish they would give more insturctions on how you star off but after a few tries you get the hang of it ive done only two playthroughs and let me tell you it was worth every second the sounds are supperp so is the artstyle very gritty but calming when your in peace. Buy it especially if its on sale or not id probebly wait tell the Holiday sale lowers iut hopefuly a bit more if your ok with waiting but even if you pay the full asking price its worth it.Pros-Interactive Inviroment-Randomised playthroughs-Attaching charectors-wonderful art style-Realism like if i were to run out of food oh well im screwdCons-Not A very good tutorial like instructions and stuff-I wish you could send more people Scavenging but not really a KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANBuy It You Will love it well worth its asking price trust me.

												This game is so depressing.... It's exceptional but incredibly sad.Everyone has their Day 1-5 stories and I won't do mine by day but rather as a series of how my life went:-Started off fine. Went out, collected materials including some food (enough to feed the three of us).-Looters kept breaking in and I didn't know how to reinforce the perimeter. Food became scarce.-I started taking bigger and bigger risks.-It all went down hill when I encountered a priest. He was searching for ammunition when I entered and it spooked me so I stabbed him. I think I made a mistake...so did the character.-Suddenly depression starts spreading in my base (by now we had a fourth member).-The tipping point was in our biggest hunger. I knew we needed to turn the tide so I went where I knew there was a lot of food. I knew I'd be stealing but better us than them right?-Well in the effort I killed one guy, scared the rest, took their food. The last thing he said to me was ""please, you can't do this to us! I'm begging you!"" I ran.-Depression was so strong that one of my members left.-Eventually only three remained, one too depressed to do anything.-I sent my most capable man out and he ended up getting wounded and the wound was later infected.-The depressed guy went out on his own to find his family and was killed by bandits.-The wounded guy died from his infections (unable to get to the hospital).-And the last guy was so depressed that I had him walk to Sniper Alley and die so he could finally ""find peace"" as he called it.Basically, it's pretty damned sad.Extra Note:I've never survived past 19 days. It's incredibly difficult but apparently people have made it to the end. I can't manage. Typically my biggest trouble is getting enough water to cook my meals. And my survivors get so sluggish and depressed when forced to do something. Then the comforting process is so long. They really need to support each other emotionally but it takes too much time out of the day.			"

												This game..When I first saw This War Of Mine, I was pulled in by the idea of the tables being turned.. Rather than another FPS or something similar, this takes you into the lives of the people caught in the middle of hell. People who have to fight and scavenge off others who are just as poorly off, to survive a little while longer and perhaps make it through the war.As I started playing, I thought by the looks of it, it isn't something I can hugely immerse myself into. How wrong I was. On my second scavenging night, the paranoia of being caught, the anxiety of time not being on your side and the stress of needing to find as much stuff as possible to not have wasted a night is insane. By this time, I already was so drawn in that I felt connected with the group I had managed to keep alive for nearly 10 days, their light just barely alive. A while after, a person in my group, Bruno, died from severe wounds after we were robbed by force. The other two, were too broken to even move because they could no longer take it.. With no one left around to console them, it was over, I was done for. I had failed to keep my group alive, their regret of my choice to steal from other survivors breaking them further was too much.This game, makes you question everything, and opens your eyes to the real hardships and horrors of war.

												This is a nice game of resource management and taking chances. Although it is mostly skill that gets you through combative encounters, enough can go wrong with little mistake on your part to cause severe problems for you (such as a good character who is severely injured or killed). There's enough meat to this game for you to want to read about the other characters and try to figure out which ones make for the best teams. The save system is a bit brutal as it auto saves. So it's hard to run through the game correcting small mistakes with reloading. Instead, your small mistakes become game-long woes that you have to add to your list of problems you have to overcome. There's also some strategy in the way you trade resources. For example, there's a vendor that sometimes shows up at your house and he is excellent to buy bulky but inexpensive construction materials from so you can save your scavenging inventory space for better things.There is some variation in the levels you get and how they are initially set up. Some areas have guards placed in slightly different arrangements so that in one playthrough getting all the loot at some outpost is much easier than in another playthrough, but it is slight and not all zones have it (and typically they just have an either or setup and it isn't elabourate). It's a shame they didn't make more use of that mechanic.One big con I had was, SPOILER ALERT, no bad guys ever came to your door. You would think since you're in the middle of a war that the invading army might show up at your place and like extort food or something from you or you'd have to fight in your own home to defend it or whatever. Kind of a shame since it would be cool to have the ability to plan out and build your defenses.The game isn't very long and there's not a whole heck of a lot of replay to this game even though that seems odd considering it's a rogue like. But there's just a lot of boilerplate crap you need to get through in the beginning of a new game and things don't really heat up until quite a bit later...and then it's just one little mistake and you screw up your entire game and it autosaves and you throw your hands up and quit.That's actually a pretty bad thing about the game. I mean, the sound and artwork is great for its theme. I'm so happy that this isn't about zombies even though it literally perfectly fits for that theme. I would love to see more skills and mechanics put into the game  and more interesting levels with more complicated puzzles or plots or character interactions bartering etc.The somewhat variable time limit of the game is nice to keep things balanced, but it would be nice if I could just continue playing in a sandboxy mode or something. I don't know. I guess what I'm saying is I wish there was more...which usually means the game is worth a thumbs up, despite it's problems. "

""Review - This War of Mine""IN A WAR, NOT EVERYONE IS A SOLDIER.I totally recommend this game to everyone who wants to experience a new type of war game. This game has emotion, thrill and excitement. You make your own story. Your survival depends on the decisions you make. Will you kill someone just to survive or will you help everyone you see and thrive in hunger and sickness.In war, it's hard to fight and defeat your enemies but what more if you're just a civilian? In this game, you play as a civilian with your group trying to survive in the midst of war. Resources are very scarce. You have to scavenge for food, meds, weapons, etc. in order to survive. You also have the option to make a trade/barter with other civilians or even with bandits, thugs and soldiers but beware that not all of them are trustworthy. Here are some awesome realistic things that I like:Highlights:+ Real Conscience is included - When you do a bad thing (hurting, killing), the whole group suffers a ""Sad"", ""Depressed"" or ""Broken"" state of emotions.+ When all hope is lost, you can control your characters to encourage the others that it's not the end.+ Suicide is also present in this game. (When all hope is lost.)+ When all of your characters have lost hope, they will be unable to move even if you order them.+ Your main goal is to survive until the war ends. (The date of the war's end is at random.)+ Make big decisions like would you help others outside your shelter for a night in exchange of downsizing your shelter's numbers. (You might get raided.)+ Realism - When you attack or do something bad in a certain area with a character, they don't forget what you did. If you say, kill someone at the hospital area. If you return there, the soldiers will immeadiately shoot at you once they see you.+  When one of your characters is severely wounded, your character moves very slow and rests while moving from time to time.+ When one of your characters is ill/sick, they can recover by just staying in bed.Update Features:+ You get to choose your starting group or gamble it all with a random group.+ When starting a new game with a certain group, not all maps are the same. I'm not sure but I think there are 3 different maps in the game.+ Depending on the group you choose, your shelter will be different. It can be the original big house with a lot of fixing to do and there's also another one which does not need any fixing at all.+ Each group combination has now there own backstory as to how they got together.+ You can now make your own story with the new level editor. You can create your own characters from the templates provided, choose their backstory, select which places will be available for the story, set how long and how dreadful the winter is and finally, choose how many characters will you have in the group.NOTE: I already finished the whole game before the update features were added. The new features were meant to increase the game's replayability.There's not much room for mercy. It's either you survive for another day or you die. Remember that in this world, there are no right choices but to survive.			"

												This game makes me feel so depressed when I have to murder people just for food and resources. If you like a survival game with a twist this the game for you. First of all on your first day everything is in rubble, even your house so thats why you have to clear it and get to the other resources. Then build your crafting places to craft your survival needs. Then the night hits! You have to scavenge, scout, sneak, and murder. The main resources you will need is at night (You can skip day) You only have a certain time before day otherwise it will take longer to come back. Well thats just scratching the surface of this game and I hoped you found this helpful.			"

												What a left turn This War of Mine is. 11 bit studios previously made the markedly un-serious Anomaly games, festivals of tactical explosions, air-strikes and all the other hoo-rah wargasms we’re generally exposed to. A sombre survival game exploring the vulnerability of civilians trapped in warzones wasn’t where I would have pegged them to go next.These twists on the formula are where I’m finding my interest in survival games peaking. As Pip pointed out in her interview with senior writer Pawel Miechowski, it’s taking what zombies have long been a metaphor for and going literal. Now 11 bit have announced we’ll get to be war-torn on November 14th and thrown a trailer into the mix as well.			"

												Tl:DR This game means to you what you let it.This game is not the sort of thing everyone is going to get the intended effect with. It's not a survival horror game, it's not even really a game. I don't mean that in the way that it is lacking in any sort of gameplay elements.  Rather, I mean that if you go into it thinking it's just going to be a thematic 2D ""The Forest"" or any of those 'craft and escape the island' games, you're not going to leave with that same impression. The way I see it, there are two types of responses. ""This game was boring"" and ""I'm emotionally scarred that was so sad"". Part of that difference lies in how much you are willing to invest yourself in making stories for each character beyond what is given to you. If you take the speech bubbles as ALL your characters ever think, of course you're going to feel this is flat and unenjoyable. But if you look at this game, and try to imagine yourself and the people you care about as being in this situation, and twist the events and experiences into true moments in the world, it's going to be a hard play. Maybe you'll cry when a friend who you've been trying to save finally dies from sickness, because you couldn't keep the shelter warm enough. Maybe you send a reliable scout out to gather materials and he ends up getting shot and killed. Maybe you see a pair of children, trying to get medicine for their sick mother, and sadly tell them there is no way you can help them. Maybe they walk away, and you watch them go, knowing they'll never make it. Hoping against hope that they might. Wondering, as you lay in your home with nothing but the bite of cold and the sickness and barely enough strength to make it to the door as you hear the knocking again, how this is going to end.If you go into this with a vivid imagination and compassion. It's going to crush you more than once. If you go into it expecting it to be a fun little crafting survival game and take only what it gives you, it's going to bore you. You get out of this what you put into it.			"

												This is a unique game that shows the side of war where civilians are trying to survive in a desparate, nearly apocalyptic world.

												I am first impressed by the graphics of this game which is in a style of darkness and dimness. Very delicate but not that upsetting. In the game you should search the houses for supplies as you do in DON'T STRAVE but this game can't be joined. :( And the plots are so uninspired and limited that  after 3 hours' playing it gets tiresome. Workshop and ur own story mode are the great highlights for this game. Merits overweigh demerits in a word. A nice game to kill some time but not that meaningful as I thought.			"

Dying and killing are such earthbreaking consequences of high-risk. high-reward decisions - and the other survivors will feel it too.But if you can, please try it. Please feel the pain and suffering of those who are defenseless and just want a normal life. That there are real-life refugees and their children who suffer like this and worse, who die to escape - and politicians wants you to believe they are the bad guys.The end goal of this game is to make you feel that.

												The Mood:Once I started playing, I could not put this game down.  Its a heavy game.  It sets the mood perfectly and there's never a moment that you're waiting for something.  You are always in need, on edge, and nervous about how bad its going to get trying to obtain that next thing.  Your characters may have a very difficult time with a lot of situations, so its not really about how you feel about what you're doing, its about how the people in the story feel about whats happening.  Killing or stealing from the innocent will have long lasting effects on the person committing the actions, as well as the rest of the group once they hear what happened.  Some characters will need to smoke to keep their sanity, others will drink coffee.  Sometimes when something terrible happens you may need to use some survivors to comfort the others.  Perhaps you want to build a guitar for a group member that can play and lift everyone's spirits.  Maybe build a radio that has some contact to the outside world.  The crafting system is very deep and intuitive and all survivors have some special trait about them.  Everything has an emotional impact and it grows an attachment to the characters more so than I wouldhave imagined.The Combat:The combat in this game mechanically is nothing special.  You select what you want your survivor to wield when they're out scavenging.  Based on what you're wielding, you will get different options.  For example, if you have a gun out your guy will take aim at anyone in range and it will display you a icon to fire.  If you're hiding or behind someone you'll get an icon to attempt a backstab attack.  None of this is particularly innovative or interesting, however there's one BIG difference compared to a lot of games.If you engage in a fight with someone else and they take a hit or you take a hit, often times, both parties sort of freak out and try to leave because nobody wants to die needlesly.  You're rarely just going to areas to kill bad guys and then take their loot, it plays out a lot more humanly (is that a word?) than that.  I was in a situation where i was looting and some people didn't like where I was doing that.  One came at me with a knife and he made me bleed, I hit him with a hatchet and he seemed to immediately just want to run away.  Neither of us wanted to fight any more really, just take as little loss as possible because medicine and bandages are hard to come by for everyone. TLDR: Combat isn't about killing the other guy, its about surprising and damaging them to the point that they run away, unless the situation really calls for some cold blooded murder.Replayability:I'm pretty sure I marathoned a 15 hour single playthrough.  Now thats only one playthrough with 1 group of survivors, of the 6 total starting groups.  You have different endings for each character based on how bad things got and how close you were to not making it at the end.  The war ends at some random time based on your group, you have to listen to the radio to know when its coming.  The locations that you're able to travel through progressively widen as you play the game, and even though the locations on the map are the same, the layouts and the scenarios that happen at these locations vary each playthrough.  There is a lot of randomization to keep things fresh.  Loot, trader visit frequency, some variation in scenarios at all locations, if other survivors come to visit your shelter, you get the idea.  I'm definitely looking forward to my next playthrough with a different group of survivors.10/10			"

												This game is NOT fun.. It`s depressing. Still very good though, and very memorable. Instead of press f to feel (I`m looking at you COD), it throws a lot of difficult choices your way and forces you to take a moral stand. The atmosphere is very dark and depressing, so if you are looking for a fun, casual game skip this one. If you are looking for a reasonably deep mix of base/party management and point-click gameplay set in a war-torn eastern europe, look no further. Parts of the price you pay goes to the charity ""War child"" as well, which is a great move by the devs.			"

												This War of Mine is a very enjoyable videogame if you're looking for a break from fast-paced games. You can make your own story to survive in or go with a randomly generated one. You can also choose your own survivors, make your own, or go with the characters the game chooses. The game is difficult, but in a fun way. And you get really attached to the characters you control, and when you lose one, it's almost heartbraking. To sum it up, recommended.			"

												This game makes me feel so depressed when I have to murder people just for food and resources. If you like a survival game with a twist this the game for you. First of all on your first day everything is in rubble, even your house so thats why you have to clear it and get to the other resources. Then build your crafting places to craft your survival needs. Then the night hits! You have to scavenge, scout, sneak, and murder. The main resources you will need is at night (You can skip day) You only have a certain time before day otherwise it will take longer to come back. Well thats just scratching the surface of this game and I hoped you found this helpful.			"

												I absolutely love this game, i got it 2 days ago and i have only stopped playing it for school and homework and... well... this review. My only issue is that when i have scavenged all the stuff around me i am left with nothing but sick or injured people that just wont recover, my only choice is to attack a house filled with armed bandits which sucks because the guns are not on eshot kill from anywhere so i die all the dtime when i take one bulet with me. I think that knifes should be an instant kill from behind instead of just a half health damage because it makes them aware of my presence and then they kill me easily, although this type of game is perfect because its not so easy that if you can sneak p behind them then you win the game but its just easy enough so that you dont go mental when you play and you dnt overwhelm yourself with supplies. I love this game with a passion.			"

												This game is so full of action and it really makes you think strategically. During the war, you start out trying to live off of whatever you can find left in your house. Then as resources get sparse, you're forced to leave and seek out other resources and also start stealing (it's inevitable!). People will fight you for resources, so eventually it gets to the point where you either kill or be killed....but the consequences don't end there!Adrenaline rushes, sweaty palms, yelling at the computer, and hesitating to pause the game. I'm freaking addicted. A brilliant game!! Highly recommend!			"

												During my school years i was going through the library when i stumbled upon a book called ""i remember Beirut"" by Zeina Abirached. it was a comic book about the authors childhood living in Lebanon during a civil war, which sadly goes on today. I never even heard of Lebanon and every person at school i talked to about it never heard of the country as well. I even attempted to talk about it in one of my history projects, but then i realized i couldn't and had to go on about Gallipoli that the school system thought was so ♥♥♥♥ing important to learn the third time. There are so many places in the world that are strife with war that should been talked about in the news, but the only countries the news wants to show are Jerusalem and Syria, which sadly many people might know the country because of the conflict.""This war of mine"" is a form of justice that the developers wanted to show to the world, about a subject that is not looked up to a lot in gaming, hell even most media. I always like my fast paced action games such as ""F.E.A.R"", and even sometimes implemented humor like ""Postal 2"". But sometimes you just have to come back to earth and look at the harsh realities of human nature that has gone haywire. Its a game that doesn't shy away from mature themes on war and even if it doesn't have a spectacular combat system it makes up for on how it's presented.gameplaythe controls of the game is fully mouse use and works well for the most part. you do everything with it, from moving to selecting to placing to attacking to all that sort of stuff. the reason for this could be for the fact you play as an entire group. you have two cycles, one where you manage your group and  you shelter in the day, and one where your desperately scavenge a selected location during the night.the day time cycle is when you have to manage your stats of your survivors and possibly improve your shelter, you can make various crafting stations and miscellaneous stuff such as chairs. sometimes people come to your shelter to exchange goods or to ask for help for possibly goods in return. Even the characters you have all have unique stats and personality. some like to smoke and others like coffee, you don't have to do their needs and their happy to help out. you only have a certain amount of time during the day and your constantly rushing to do the basic necessities to survive the next day. it a little bit funny how the music is so calming when your constantly rushing the survivors, but that is little comfort where the biggest problems come from scavengingYou can only scavenge at night and have a limited amount of time like daytime, the character you choose can depend on how much they can carry and its a very big factor in this game. you only have a limited amount of slots and how much you have can carry can depend on life and death. but the areas that are safe from hostile are finite, and soon you will have to be robbing bandits or military outposts, or worst of all, other survivors.now the combat in this game also works well and there are various areas where you can hide and take cover. the combat it even more intense with a permadeath system that if you one of your survivors die, they die for good. the combat isn't really hard once you get the hang of it but that is not the worse of it.the game has a built in mood mechanic that changes if the characters do something heroic or evil. now keep in mind you do control your characters and not their personality, if you get them to kill a bandit or soldier or save someones life, they'll be happy or care very little. But if you get them to kill or rob a survivor, sometimes they'll become depressed to the point that they will start crying or worse, commit suicide. their mood can depend on what they will do and if they are content, they will be really hard to depress unless its extreme scenarios, if they are their movement is lowered and their actions take longer. it's a very well implemented mechanic that is very fitting for the game tone.artificial intelligencethe npc have their own personalities and reactions to the presence of the controlled survivor when your spotted by them. there are ones that will just ignore you, or threaten you to leave if they are survivors or sometimes soldiers. then there are ones that will kill you on site which are bandits and mostly soldiers. the game has a health bar and if their health is really low, sometimes they will beg for mercy, or run if you killed most of their team. If your not spotted and watch them, they have their own idle animation, like reading a book or going to sleep.atmospherethe whole game itself is as depressing as the trailer said it would be. you will be constantly having to get needs that shouldn't be hard to get in our time, like food, water medicine, and a lot of other problems that are death threatening. even the beginning of the game when you first start has no other button in the menu, except the word ""survive"".The background also sets the tone for the rest of the game like a pair of shackles with a man and a child holding hands and looking out to the distance of smoke and decay, with a dilapidated wall saying ""♥♥♥♥ the war"". you start it up and here you go, a group of survivors and a little backstory of these poor people, and the rest is up to you. I did manage to survive on my first run but was the worst play in my life which i didn't want to do. one survivor died, and another with post traumatic stress disorder.there is no hand holding in this game, there is even no tutorial, because it wants you to push you to the limits. its a look into the cries of people that have never been heard or given a lot of justice. your group is no superhero, they are like you and even feel remorse from the pain of others. you can go through the game without killing outright good people, but you still won't save everyone. the whole game isn't bleak and depressing, you can help others in times of needs like giving medicine to children. It will give you a massive smile on your face when you get as many people out of this alive and still pure to themselves, i sure did.negatives the whole placement of stuff can be an♥♥♥♥♥ especially where the buttons are placed. putting the ""end day"" button next to ""our stuff"" has led to many days where i couldn't finished my tasks because i tried to look at our inventory. now you can exit and reload the save, but it goes back to the beginning of the day and then you have to do it all over again.the ai in combat is also thick as well, here's a scenario.two soldiers kill a rebel, i'm hiding and when one of them falls down the hole i kill a soldier, i though he would leg it but my survivor can hear him climbing the ladder to where i am and i wait for him with the shotgun, then i kill him. what im saying is that if i was somewhere where there was one entrance. every armed enemy will come rushing at you one by one. a little bit more thought into the characters ai would have made for an engrossing experience.conclusionthe whole game is set in a make believe country of Poregon and even that it makes a good impression to be one of my favorite games. It's a game where every single problem you experienced is because of war. there is nothing good coming from it for any good person. it works well as a game that conveys its message. this is a game that manages to help people understand the struggles of refuges.and if you think the war child charity is a scam, herehttp://www.polygon.com/2015/4/2/8331411/this-war-of-mine-charity-dlcthere is dlc for the game and each has funds towards war-child, a charity for chidren in war torn countries. the game will teach you something like ""Undertale"" and if your a parent, buy this game for your child or children. you will not regret it.

												A really well made game!You can easily get attached to the characters in the game, expecially with ""The Little Ones"" DLC.I remember letting my people starve for days, because of lack of food, but NOT the child. Hearing the kids cry is really heartbreaking in the game, or when your favourite survivor dies.Gameplay is two part.1st:You are at your home base, taking care of things, like getting people to rest, make warm food, improve your shelter and that kind of stuff. This is where you usually get faced with the things you did during the night. (When someone is so broken, because s/he had to kill some elderly people for some food, and won't move)2nd:The night time, the game is mostly wants you to be sneaky as much you can, since you are just a weak civilian even a few knife wound could kill you. You can trade, loot, rob, kill, break down wooden objects to get the things you need to survive.Once you get a hold of a decent weapon, and enought ammo (the easiest way for me was just killing a bandit by hitting the back of his head with a crowbar) the game turns a bit easier, but still its difficult, you are not get to become a Rambo, so taking out multiple enemies without cover is still suicide.And you don't want to die, because of the others...10/10			"

												This war of mine is just simply, a fantastic game possibly in my top 5 favourite games ever.... Almost beats GTA 5... But it's just something different, something... Unique. It hits you hard with the feelz, having to steal food from elderly people that are desperate for anything! Having to kill a old couples 30 year old son and then watching them watch there son... Drop to the floor. Having to steal medical supplies from severely injured people, just to help your group. It does hit you hard in the feelz, doesn't it.SummaryProsCharacter combination choosing2 different spawn locationsGood/Unique CharactersGreat visualisationVery very VERY hardRepitativityHard to stop playingOkay trading systemConsNo button to continue after beating gameNot enough scavenging locations (3-5 more would be perfect)Horrific fighting systemCan only trade Ciggarettes/Moonshine (For narcotics) no Drugs...A little more crafting variations?This game would be a 10/10 if you could continue after beating the game or possibly fixing the fighting... It's just scary how bad the fighting is.... But overall a masterpiece  "

												I cannot begin to describe the grip this game has on you when you play it. It may be a full fledged game, but in my opinion is also an experience. If you like survival/simulation games but also want a story, this game will do wonders for you. Rather than being merely another shooter where you gun down wave after wave of armed foes, this game shows the real impact of war - not just on those fighting one, but those caught inside of one. Definitely something for all to try out.			"

												I thoroughly enjoyed this game. It took a while, only getting to day 5 or 10 before everything went wrong but if you keep at it, it is well worth the time. Great game as is. Of course, anything can be better/more/bigger/whatever. This game is great just as it is. Fun, quirky, sneaky, predictable but then again not, constantly pushing you to make it big or die trying.Depending on when you start - either in good weather or cold, you have to make adjustments to what you focus on. Obviously food is always a priority and anything that helps get food such as wood and materials. From that point it comes down to focusing on fuel early if you are in cold weather, or focusing on protection if you get the increased night attacks. One way or the other, you have to make the best of it and scrounge what you can - what is a priority now. If you get the basic start, then find high end meds to trade with for large quantities of materials etc and get to building!I have successfully made it through to the end 3 times (45 days twice and 30 days once) and the game was different in how it played out all 3 times, but the focus and basic strategy is the same. What to build and when, and so on. Lots of game guides out there on that stuff.The people you end up with to start greatly affect success. For me, Cveta/Anton/Emilia/Arica are useless and just mouths to feed with little up side. Some might argue Arica can sneak well - who cares?! Marko carrying a pack of 15 slots, Boris with 17 - these are your mules to bring back more, each night, and get ahead of what is coming. Brunos cooking skills are a great upside in saving water which from the start of the game you should focus on always getting more and more of it. Water is used for cooking and for growing veggies which are critical to getting deeper into the game. Fuel is your other ""always focus"" whether through trade or through chopping stuff up. Marin is ok for making things quicker and at less expense, and Katia does get some advantage in trading. Roman gets bonuses to killing people and not feeling bad about it. Nice! The ""meh"" bunch are Pavel/Zlata who really are just more mouths to feed.If you get the dream team of Marko (or Boris) as mule, Bruno to cook, and Roman to kill I dont see how you can lose this game. Send Roman in to take one or more out per night in high danger areas - notable first to any place you can scrounge a weapon or make one, then go to high rise apartments to take out the two snipers to get sniper rifle, then to military outpost to pick the first 4 guards off before going deeper in over the next night or two to finish off the rest, until all clear, then send in your mule to pick up the good stuff in large quantities. Get Bruno cooking, making water, and grwoing stuff and you are golden. Adding a 4th mid way through the game? Hope it is Marin or Katia but just because they are a bit more usefull than the others and they help defend at night.At the height of night attacks, keep 3 up at night, otherwise go 2 until all defences including the door are built and then you can go with one guarding.Dont shoot the man protecting his sick father, nor the priest - they are great for trading - they have tons of stuff and will usually trade well with you for high end meds. Dont shoot civies - just go after deserters, thugs, snipers, military and no problems with people getting all upset back at home. Dont shoot the militia - they too trade great to you if you dont steal their stuff. The doc at the hospital also has some to trade. I also saw no need to steal from the old couple in the quiet house. Lots of other stuff without robbing the elderly!I love this game and have recommended it to everyone I have spoken to who likes video games. Great idea and I hope they either expand it or put out another deeper game in the future. Great job programmers!!!			"

Buy it especially if its on sale or not id probebly wait tell the Holiday sale lowers iut hopefuly a bit more if your ok with waiting but even if you pay the full asking price its worth it.Pros-Interactive Inviroment-Randomised playthroughs-Attaching charectors-wonderful art style-Realism like if i were to run out of food oh well im screwdCons-Not A very good tutorial like instructions and stuff-I wish you could send more people Scavenging but not really a KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANBuy It You Will love it well worth its asking price trust me.

It's exceptional but incredibly sad.Everyone has their Day 1-5 stories and I won't do mine by day but rather as a series of how my life went:-Started off fine. Went out, collected materials including some food (enough to feed the three of us).-Looters kept breaking in and I didn't know how to reinforce the perimeter. Food became scarce.-I started taking bigger and bigger risks.-It all went down hill when I encountered a priest. He was searching for ammunition when I entered and it spooked me so I stabbed him. I think I made a mistake...so did the character.-Suddenly depression starts spreading in my base (by now we had a fourth member).-The tipping point was in our biggest hunger. I knew we needed to turn the tide so I went where I knew there was a lot of food. I knew I'd be stealing but better us than them right?-Well in the effort I killed one guy, scared the rest, took their food. The last thing he said to me was ""please, you can't do this to us! I'm begging you!"" I ran.-Depression was so strong that one of my members left.-Eventually only three remained, one too depressed to do anything.-I sent my most capable man out and he ended up getting wounded and the wound was later infected.-The depressed guy went out on his own to find his family and was killed by bandits.-The wounded guy died from his infections (unable to get to the hospital).-And the last guy was so depressed that I had him walk to Sniper Alley and die so he could finally ""find peace"" as he called it.Basically, it's pretty damned sad.Extra Note:I've never survived past 19 days. It's incredibly difficult but apparently people have made it to the end. I can't manage. Typically my biggest trouble is getting enough water to cook my meals. And my survivors get so sluggish and depressed when forced to do something. Then the comforting process is so long. They really need to support each other emotionally but it takes too much time out of the day.			"

												Tl:DR This game means to you what you let it.This game is not the sort of thing everyone is going to get the intended effect with. It's not a survival horror game, it's not even really a game. I don't mean that in the way that it is lacking in any sort of gameplay elements.  Rather, I mean that if you go into it thinking it's just going to be a thematic 2D ""The Forest"" or any of those 'craft and escape the island' games, you're not going to leave with that same impression. The way I see it, there are two types of responses. ""This game was boring"" and ""I'm emotionally scarred that was so sad"". Part of that difference lies in how much you are willing to invest yourself in making stories for each character beyond what is given to you. If you take the speech bubbles as ALL your characters ever think, of course you're going to feel this is flat and unenjoyable. But if you look at this game, and try to imagine yourself and the people you care about as being in this situation, and twist the events and experiences into true moments in the world, it's going to be a hard play. Maybe you'll cry when a friend who you've been trying to save finally dies from sickness, because you couldn't keep the shelter warm enough. Maybe you send a reliable scout out to gather materials and he ends up getting shot and killed. Maybe you see a pair of children, trying to get medicine for their sick mother, and sadly tell them there is no way you can help them. Maybe they walk away, and you watch them go, knowing they'll never make it. Hoping against hope that they might. Wondering, as you lay in your home with nothing but the bite of cold and the sickness and barely enough strength to make it to the door as you hear the knocking again, how this is going to end.If you go into this with a vivid imagination and compassion. It's going to crush you more than once. If you go into it expecting it to be a fun little crafting survival game and take only what it gives you, it's going to bore you. You get out of this what you put into it.			"

You start off with a group of survivors, stuck in a dirt hole of a house barely held together by wood and cloth.Gunfire and explosions can be heard close by, but that's the least of your worries.You have a handful of tools, some wood and some food that might last you for the day,and there seems to be no end in sight to the war.A major milestone, It's more of an experience rather than a game.This War of Mine drops every single money-making aspect of AAA games in the market and provides a totally new perspective in war. The graphics are dark and gritty without being boring, the music is sad and slow yet hopeful. The gameplay is slow and, on paper, is simple.. but the way everything is packaged, provides the most unique gaming experiences ever. "

Genious concept, but sometimes frustrating implementation.How would modern war look and feel like for normal people? That is the question this game is trying to answer for the players. And it does it in a quite immersive and unique fashion.Intense atmosphereThe War of Mine wants you to ""write"" the story for a group of citizens, which found shelter in a city at war. You are controlling their actions and are responsible for their survival. They need food, safety and warmth and how you get that is all up to you. You can give the characters their own personality by the way you play - friendly, passive, aggressive or something in between. Based on your actions, the characters will struggle with different type of issues - hunger, depression or sickness. The atmosphere you receive from all that is fantasticly emotional and feels like you are a witness of war.Huge amount of varietyNot only are there tons of ways you can play out the story for the characters, but there are also many different scenarios for each scene, which add a lot to the replay value of the game. Even if you get through the game entirely, there is nothing that stops you from starting all over and writing another story.Not flawless implementationWhile the gameplay, the atmosphere and the variety are great, sometimes this game can become frustrating because of it. Since you are expecting a realistic behavior at all times, you can get caught off guard by it because it is not the case for everything. For example in reality it should be easy to kill somebody with a knife after sneaking up to him from behind. But that is not the case in this game: They just lose a bit of health, turn around and shoot you. And then you lost a character, just because you expected the game to act realistic on that action. And there is no direct save-load-system to try out such mechanics.Overall I still highly recommend this game for pretty much anybody. It is surely worth the couple of bucks for the unique experience (even educational-wise) it offers.			"

												If you are looking for some different survival experience, this game is definitely a good choice. First of all before I talk deeper about the game itself I need to say that this is not a shooter or some zombie survival game, if you think it was something like that it is for sure not the game that you should get.Before we start I need to say that you should be aware of that this game can be really time intense, since you will focus on doing progress. But now let’s talk about the game, the game you get your chance to control 2 – 4 (5?) Civilian-Survivors in a city under siege with the only goal to survive till its end.The game Started and the first thing you will notice it is a kind of Slider- / Point & Click Game which makes the game even more interesting. For now we just have one BIG goal! The goal to survive the siege with all our Survivors, no matter on what way you want to go through the game, it is open to you! BUT keep in mind all your actions will take effect on the mood of your Survivors.You can try to beat the game as a brutal badass assassin, which is killing all civilians, raiders, deserters or soldiers, in order to get materials, medication and food back home to improve the surviving chance for your community. Also rejecting, to help other survivors that randomly appear in front of your base and asking you for help.Or just like a trader, which is scavenging empty buildings in order to get base materials back to base and later trading them off for better goods like medications and food. Also supporting other survivors is playing a big role for you, since this is increasing the mood within your community.There are plenty of other ways too but it would be too hard to describe them in this small space ;).So as you see I talked about Mood in the last part. Yes, right the mood one of the most important things in TWoM, every decision you make will either increase or rapidly decrease the mood of your fellows. Also you have to take care of hunger, illnesses, injuries or sleep, if you don’t pay attention to those people, you will lose them due starvation, injuries, heavy diseases or even suicides.It is a very complex game and again every decision you make, every action you take will affect your gameplay at the end. It could mess up the game and you will not even make it past day 12.I will not provide any in game tips in my review, only one keep it warm in your building or you return back to your base and you have survivors on a stick ;) during winter.Personal Rating: 9.0Sounds/Music: 9.5 (The music is matching the ambient, which is matching this kind of survival game. It is traumatizing)Gameplay: 8.5 (The controls are easy to manage and also the Movement controls are working as intended and other actions)Storyline: 9.0 (At some point people will say WTF??? Storyline? Yes, if you check every Survivors BIO it will tell you a little story about them, even so this Game is showing of what is ongoing during a siege and it is indirect telling you a lot about it how it is to survive etc. even if it is just a Game at the End)Graphic: N/A (The graphic is amazing for this kind of game and it is matching to the music and the situation)Thanks for reading this review, if you find any errors or typos keep them :P			"

												What a game, deprived me of my life for three solid days. Had to put ""getting all the achievements"" as the last goal. I still feel like returning to it, but just as with any addiction you'll never be able to have just this ""one go"".The game started off with showing how terrible I am with taking care of other people, especially with scarce necessities. It shows what necessities needed by the playable characters monologue. Items can be found, crafted and/or upgraded, and through the items' descriptions you learn what to acquire to manage this. From this you venture into the unknown realm of this war of yours. Continuously throughout the game you learn through punishment, i.e. death, sickness, depression and/or wounds. Never assume that getting that particular item through scavenging and/or fighting toughs will be appreciated, as most aspects in the game aims to question your conscience and/or morale. Graves will appear, monologues will fill the air with self-doubt, depression is the mistress that reigns the sheltered characters. I sat there, thinking that I had it all figured out, I knew how to make these people survive. When suddenly it became clear to me, I know nothing. Even the ones you take in, shelter, feed and nurse back to health might backstab you. Whilst helping NPC’s might gain you some items, it will allow the characters to feel some pride with their own morale. Friend or foe? Only through enough trials and retrials will you see the complex outlay of the map and the different scenarios encountered. And, sadly, not even then you’ll know the right choices. As there are none, there’s only survival. Fin. 59hs ♥♥♥♥♥♥es.P.s. serious about the choices, exhausting♥♥♥♥♥♥that. "

												11 bit studios 'This War of Mine' is a 2014 survival game.  Inspired by the 1992-96 Siege of Sarajevo during the Bosnia war, this game focuses on the civilian perspective of war, which differs to the normal military perspective.  The main goal of the game is to survive until the ceasefire, using the tools and materials the player can scavenge with the characters they are given.   Every action you decide to make will affect the survivors you are either given (if you play a developer-created story), or choose (if you play a custom story).  You are forced to make life-or-death deisions driven by your conscience constantly.  If you decide to kill, not only will your characters enter a time of depression, you (a general statement, those of you 'hardnuts' out there won't) will feel it too. Gripping, emotional, borderline addictive.			"

												I revisited TWoM with the most recent update 1.3 and decided to finally write a review. I had done my last playtrough some weeks ago and now I'm hooked again on the game. Despite the bleak setting and athmosphere the constant cycle of base building and scavenging is very addicting. I do like the fact that you can easily lose your survivors if you get too risky and try to rambo through the city. I think that really gives a sense of being an average person trapped in a civil war. Gameplay and graphics are really very unique. Replay value is greatly improved with the new possibilities for creating customized scenarios.			"

If you play correctly though you can manage to keep all of your people alive throughout the war and generally feel good about yourself afterwards, or you can have all your people either kill themselves or be killed and feel incredibly bad about yourself later, your choice. 10/10 story and gameplay.

												This War of  Mine is a beautiful atmospheric, immersive masterpiece. One of the best survival games i have ever played. The realism aspect of this game top notch, every action you take has a consequence. I had to steal medicines from the hospital during a desperate situation as everything is scarce. During my next visit to the hospital, i see patients dying and the same doctor who patched me up before, on his knees crying. This is just a single example of the multitude of choices and consequences in the game. You get to choose a group of people at the start of the game, each person has their own personalities and perks, some of them get depressed after you commit a crime to survive, some of them accept it as its the only way to survive. I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves the survival genre.			"

												What can I say? This game will take you on an unexpected journey of thought-provocation and self-reflecting emotional punches to the feels. HOW it leads you on this journey is perhaps this games greatest strength. There is a look and a feel while playing that can only be described as a kind of empathetical dispair. The music, the graphcis, the overall atmosphere in each enviroment, the conversations and events, it all comes together while playing this game to form a near-life altering experience.I don't want to spoil any events or any game play. There are plenty of screenshots and images availble if you want an idea of it its like to play. But what those images cannot transcend into you is the emotional experience that comes free of charge with this masterpeiece.Is this game dark and gloomy? Absolutely. Does that hinder playability or replayability? Not for a second. The dark and gloominess is what gives this game its elite character. I personally especially enjoy playing this game during the fall on cold, cloudy, and rainy days. It fits the weather perfectly and may even enchance the experience of playing.Give it a go. You won't be dissapointed! 10/10			"

												This game is a great take on the war time survival genre. The art style is amazing and well done, along with the characters personalities. You start to really care about these people as you play through the game, and it hits you that much harder when tragedy strikes (and it will). Spend the day carfully allocating resources, crafting items like weapons or food, fixing or maintaining your home, and keeping health and moral up.Spend the night scavenging the chosen areas, bartering with other survivors, sneaking though hostile camps stealing their goods, or searching abondoned sites for valuable items.This War of Mine is an all around great game with high replay value. I highly suggest it if you're into survival style games.			"

												I was eager to buy the game until I read some of the negative reviews, but do not be discouraged! This game is perfect, especially those who love to feel.I started my game with 3 survivors, Marko, Bruno, and Pavle.Marko was the scavenger of the group. That's where he was best. He did start out a bit sick though.Bruno was the cook of the group. He made amazing meals for us - when we actually had the food for it. Before the war, he was a professional chef with his own TV show. He started perfectly healthy.Pavle was a professional football player. He was quick, but didn't have much else to offer. Still, he was a nice guy with concern for the group, and he pulled his weight, switching guard shifts every other night with Bruno. He started out slightly woundedMarko and Bruno were buddies before the war, and we found Pavle on the streets. Together through these tough times they became great friends.But let me tell you about my first week of the game.We started out nearly empty handed. I made one chair (in addition to our current one) and a heater. I made Marko scavenge this abandoned house for the first, say, three days? We found some neat supplies but not much food. We ran out quickly. The second day I built a bed so Marko could sleep during the day and Bruno/Pavle could have somewhere nice to sleep.Starvation crept on my survivors, as well as sleep deprivation. We got raided on our second night, and bruno defended the house with his bare hands. Sadly, though he was slightly wounded in battle. The fourth night I made my way to the ruined villa. Two people lived here, I had known them from my previous game. Emil and his wife. After searching their house for food, I was peeking through the door where his wife was. She started walking toward me, and I thought:""I have to kill her, I have to.""So she opened the door and screamed ""Emil! Someone is here!"". I took a big slash at her with my knife and took half of her health. Suddenly, she climbed a table and jumped up to the next floor while Emil, armed with a knife, jumped down to attack me. I took a swing and took a third of his health.""This is easy"" I thought.It wasn't.He lashed at me and took a third of my health. I retaliated and did the same. ""I can't lose more health, I don't have the bandages for it!"" He took another slash at me and brought me down to a third of my health. ""One more should do it."" But I was too slow. He took the final blow and killed Marko. Quickly realizing what happened, I panicked and Alt+F4-ed the ♥♥♥♥ out of there. Try again.I go back again, but this time I didn't have my knife. I didn't make off with much on the fourth night, I only got a few supplies from searching the rubble outside their house and in their basement. She found me again and I sprinted to the exit. Didn't want a repeat of the previous game, except worse.By the fifth night everyone was tired or hungry. Supplies were low. I managed to trade some of our electronic parts for food. Some woman came back and said she wanted Bruno's help with boarding up her house. I sent Bruno to her house (He didn't get any sleep or food, but I felt good about helping). I went back to the villa and that's when I scavenged plenty of supplies. While I was in the basement the girl came downstairs and I had to kill her. It was over quickly and she didn't fight back. I didn't have any lockpicks so I couldn't open their cabinets, but I stole some supplies from their drawers and all of their meds. For some reason the fridge did not want to open.Sixth day, tired, hungry, etc. Bruno was very tired and hungry. I allowed him to sleep, and him and Pavle to eat the last of our rations. I traded, worked, and then set off.The sixth night I raided. I found out that the girl was not Emil's wife. His wife had already died, and he was a wreck. She was a mere stranger whom he found on the streets of the torn war, wounded and all. He helped her back to health, and that helped him get over the loss of his wife.Emil was torned by sadness, and thats when the feels hit. It was all my fault. I did this. I killed his only friend and took his only supplies. I raided his fridge finally and took the biggest surplus of food ever. I took so many things from him that night.The seventh day was beauty. Marko went straight to sleep, only very hungry, sad, and very tired. His sickness had left thanks to Emil's meds. Bruno cooked us four nice meals to eat, and then traded to get even more supplies. Pavle did some work for us as well. Everyone was no longer hungry, Marko was only tired and sad, and Bruno only had slight wounds. Pavle was up to full health.As for the game itself:Pros:- Controls aren't that hard to figure out- Rich stories for role-players. Lots of feels.- Simulation strategy- Sandbox like, new story every time (from what I hear)- Very fun.Cons:- No tutorial- I feel like it should have more gameplay features, but it's fine.- Difficult.9/10			"

												I would recommend for the original idea and the overall universe and feelings.+ Emotional+ Immersion+ Difficulty+ The first few hours are awesome+ Every run is supposedly different- It can be ""mastered"" and lose its charm instead of getting better- There are much better strategies than others- Too random (this is part of the charm but some might really hate it...)- Too easy to exploit (quit to menu -> load again and the day restarts and random events happen differently until it pleases you). Can also use alt+f4 and do the same trick in case of mistake. I know it's the player's choice to do that but it should be harder.- There are ""tricks"" to play better that I don't like (eg. feeding during the 2nd day of hungry allows to divide by half the needs of food compared to feeding at any other time).- Balance between characters a bit off (some are awesome and others are rather useless).In summary this is a game to enjoy for its scenario and immersion, not for its balance and enjoyment of getting better.

												This War of  Mine is a beautiful atmospheric, immersive masterpiece. One of the best survival games i have ever played. The realism aspect of this game top notch, every action you take has a consequence. I had to steal medicines from the hospital during a desperate situation as everything is scarce. During my next visit to the hospital, i see patients dying and the same doctor who patched me up before, on his knees crying. This is just a single example of the multitude of choices and consequences in the game. You get to choose a group of people at the start of the game, each person has their own personalities and perks, some of them get depressed after you commit a crime to survive, some of them accept it as its the only way to survive. I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves the survival genre.			"

												Let me first start off by saying - this game is BRUTAL. Brutal meaning even when your survivors have enough food and supplies - they'll still get depressed if you don't have coffee for the mornings and cigarettes for the evenings. They might even kill themselves.Brutal meaning if your survivors are starving to death and you choose to steal from some old people (still leaving some food and supplies for them),  your survivors will not be grateful, but instead have mental breakdowns and kill themselves.Brutal meaning if one of your survivors gets injured whilst scavenging (but yet returns alive with the much-needed supplies), the remaining survivors will have mental breakdowns and kill themselves.Brutal meaning even if one of your survivors (or more) sees the end of the war, but you had to resort to stealing or killing to survive, they'll just wind up in prison or on the streets. And they'll probably kill themselves.Overall, I'd recommend This War of Mine. It's brutal. It's depressing. Such is war.			"

												Intensely serious and dramatic, built on top of a game whose mechanics are very simple and mostly adequate. Taken as a pure game, it's nothing fancy, and arguably resembles a mobile game in just how simple it is to play. But with its rich sound and stark visuals, it really deserves to be played on a full monitor. Like many indie games, it doesn't set out to be a fun and addicting game, but rather to create an experience and make you feel ""there"". It does this very well, with a sense of overarching dread and impending doom made worse by every little mistake. You never quite have enough food, or if you do, enough medicine, or supplies, whatever. No playthrough will ever be perfect and you'll be left to decide just what you can afford to sacrifice. Combat is something you're generally supposed to avoid, though that's no excuse for how awkward is actually is. Seeing as the game autosaves whenever you do much of anything, you may end up losing a survivor to the strange mechanics, which is a frustrating experience. Other than that though, this is a bleak and depressing survival sim that's nonetheless very enjoyable to play even though it left me feeling pretty devastated. Most importantly, it portrays a situation that's all too real in the world, and is very good at inspiring empathy in the player that may well translate to real life. That the only DLC is a donation directly to children affected by war just reinforces the solid intentions of the developers.			"

I hope later one they'll be more things to craft, new objects to find, more places to go, and then obviously the game will have to become a little longer. I haven't beat it yet because I get ballsy and take on people that I shouldn't at the time lol. Anyway, super fun game.

												This game is one of the best experiences I've had as a player in my entire life.I am more fond of survival games than most, but that is irrelevant. It cannot be denied that This War of Mine's depressive setting, heart-felt music and slow-paced while intense gameplay deserve a place among the best of these last years.It is remarkably original, primarily for dealing with the topic of war, an over-exploited matter when it comes to PC gaming. And yet this is a completely different scenario, for you are not just facing a complicated situation, nor trying to solve a problem through fighting. There is a lot more depth to it, as you first acknowledge when you start the game, encountering a set of characters that will accompany you through your initial (and probably rather dramatic) attempt to survive the cruelty of war.But there is nothing more charming than a game that gets you to see the enchanting and devastating nature of human error, and that is something This War of Mine excels at doing. It is an unforgettable experience, and one that changes your perspective on bellic intervention, on the sufferings of the people that are at this precise moment affected by them, and, above all, on your own power to change things for the better.That is why I consider this game more than just a source of cheap entertainment, but a message that was put into the world in the most brilliant manner. Above all, if you decide to give it a chance, I hope it makes you have as many good, stressful, sad and intense moments as it did for me, so that you can understand and learn as much of this game as I was lucky to do through my 53 hours of playing (and counting).

												I must say, this game is awesome. It is a bit similiar to Don't Starve, but much much darker. The main idea is that you need several resources. You can obtain them by scavening, stealing, bartering or even armed robbery. And often you come to harsh moral dillemas; these people have the medicine my people need. They won't trade. Will I rob them of it? The resources are either materials you can use to craft new stuff / reinforce your shelter, or consumables (food, clean water, ammo, cgiarettes etc)You never find enough to do everything so you often have to choose. Will I reinforce the shelter so that it's harder to rob us? Or will I use the resources to build an additional bed, so that 2 people can sleep in the same time? Or maybe I should build an additional alcohol still and make more moonshine for trade? The depressing, grayosh graphics work very good and help create a great sad, blank, holepeless mood - just what you need to get a glimpse of how ♥♥♥♥ed up war is (in the same time the gameplay is engaging enough to sort of ballance the depressive mood). It is not as dark and touching as Papers, Please or Walking Dead, but it is still an awesome game. I kinda miss 2 things in the game: - More story mode would be great. If you could have 1 main hero who also idk looks for someone who might be somewhere among the survivors or tries to escape or whatever else I suppose it would allow for more immersion; - Character development would be nice ( I mean if my dude build several structures he would become proficient in post apocalyptic construction work. In the same time the dude that spend most his time sneaking and looking for resources to scavenge would become much better at that, no?)Altogether it's an awesome game. If you like crafting/survival games or/and 'deeper' games (like mentioned Papers, Please or Walking Dead) you will probably enjoy the hell out of this game :) I'd give it 8-9 / 10  "

Dying and killing are such earthbreaking consequences of high-risk. high-reward decisions - and the other survivors will feel it too.But if you can, please try it. Please feel the pain and suffering of those who are defenseless and just want a normal life. That there are real-life refugees and their children who suffer like this and worse, who die to escape - and politicians wants you to believe they are the bad guys.The end goal of this game is to make you feel that.

												The Mood:Once I started playing, I could not put this game down.  Its a heavy game.  It sets the mood perfectly and there's never a moment that you're waiting for something.  You are always in need, on edge, and nervous about how bad its going to get trying to obtain that next thing.  Your characters may have a very difficult time with a lot of situations, so its not really about how you feel about what you're doing, its about how the people in the story feel about whats happening.  Killing or stealing from the innocent will have long lasting effects on the person committing the actions, as well as the rest of the group once they hear what happened.  Some characters will need to smoke to keep their sanity, others will drink coffee.  Sometimes when something terrible happens you may need to use some survivors to comfort the others.  Perhaps you want to build a guitar for a group member that can play and lift everyone's spirits.  Maybe build a radio that has some contact to the outside world.  The crafting system is very deep and intuitive and all survivors have some special trait about them.  Everything has an emotional impact and it grows an attachment to the characters more so than I wouldhave imagined.The Combat:The combat in this game mechanically is nothing special.  You select what you want your survivor to wield when they're out scavenging.  Based on what you're wielding, you will get different options.  For example, if you have a gun out your guy will take aim at anyone in range and it will display you a icon to fire.  If you're hiding or behind someone you'll get an icon to attempt a backstab attack.  None of this is particularly innovative or interesting, however there's one BIG difference compared to a lot of games.If you engage in a fight with someone else and they take a hit or you take a hit, often times, both parties sort of freak out and try to leave because nobody wants to die needlesly.  You're rarely just going to areas to kill bad guys and then take their loot, it plays out a lot more humanly (is that a word?) than that.  I was in a situation where i was looting and some people didn't like where I was doing that.  One came at me with a knife and he made me bleed, I hit him with a hatchet and he seemed to immediately just want to run away.  Neither of us wanted to fight any more really, just take as little loss as possible because medicine and bandages are hard to come by for everyone. TLDR: Combat isn't about killing the other guy, its about surprising and damaging them to the point that they run away, unless the situation really calls for some cold blooded murder.Replayability:I'm pretty sure I marathoned a 15 hour single playthrough.  Now thats only one playthrough with 1 group of survivors, of the 6 total starting groups.  You have different endings for each character based on how bad things got and how close you were to not making it at the end.  The war ends at some random time based on your group, you have to listen to the radio to know when its coming.  The locations that you're able to travel through progressively widen as you play the game, and even though the locations on the map are the same, the layouts and the scenarios that happen at these locations vary each playthrough.  There is a lot of randomization to keep things fresh.  Loot, trader visit frequency, some variation in scenarios at all locations, if other survivors come to visit your shelter, you get the idea.  I'm definitely looking forward to my next playthrough with a different group of survivors.10/10			"

You start off with a group of survivors, stuck in a dirt hole of a house barely held together by wood and cloth.Gunfire and explosions can be heard close by, but that's the least of your worries.You have a handful of tools, some wood and some food that might last you for the day,and there seems to be no end in sight to the war.A major milestone, It's more of an experience rather than a game.This War of Mine drops every single money-making aspect of AAA games in the market and provides a totally new perspective in war. The graphics are dark and gritty without being boring, the music is sad and slow yet hopeful. The gameplay is slow and, on paper, is simple.. but the way everything is packaged, provides the most unique gaming experiences ever. "

												11 bit studios 'This War of Mine' is a 2014 survival game.  Inspired by the 1992-96 Siege of Sarajevo during the Bosnia war, this game focuses on the civilian perspective of war, which differs to the normal military perspective.  The main goal of the game is to survive until the ceasefire, using the tools and materials the player can scavenge with the characters they are given.   Every action you decide to make will affect the survivors you are either given (if you play a developer-created story), or choose (if you play a custom story).  You are forced to make life-or-death deisions driven by your conscience constantly.  If you decide to kill, not only will your characters enter a time of depression, you (a general statement, those of you 'hardnuts' out there won't) will feel it too. Gripping, emotional, borderline addictive.			"

												This game is surprisingly the most emotional game I have ever played.. although you won't hear any dialogue from your characters, whereas all you have is a short biography that expands over time based on the decisions that you make in order to survive, you surprisingly become very attached to each survivor. You just KNOW that each life is valuable and sacred, and you would do anything to keep surviving in this difficult time.The game will give you a huge amount of freedom of choice. Do you want to stay civilized and ethical when it comes to trading? Will you respect the territory of other survivors and come in peace, asking to barter for goods? Or will you sneak in at night, killing everyone and looting the place for medication and supplies?Each survivor reacts differently and there are certain choices that they aren't willing to follow through with. For example, there is one survivor who is an ex soldier and ran away after the conflict of war became too much for him, I traded an axe for some meds because the NPC's dad was very sick... and then I killed both of them with the same axe took all the meds, food and a gun. As a player, I felt horrible. But I needed those supplies. I needed my group to survive. But here's the thing. The next morning, almost all of my survivors wouldn't move. They refused to do the chores like check the water filter, cook food, harvest the garden and board up the windows. Just, no one wanted to do anything because they all felt devastated about what transpired the other night.And that ex soldier of mine? Had ""Broken"" as a status ailment.I cried that night...			"

												If you are looking for some different survival experience, this game is definitely a good choice. First of all before I talk deeper about the game itself I need to say that this is not a shooter or some zombie survival game, if you think it was something like that it is for sure not the game that you should get.Before we start I need to say that you should be aware of that this game can be really time intense, since you will focus on doing progress. But now let’s talk about the game, the game you get your chance to control 2 – 4 (5?) Civilian-Survivors in a city under siege with the only goal to survive till its end.The game Started and the first thing you will notice it is a kind of Slider- / Point & Click Game which makes the game even more interesting. For now we just have one BIG goal! The goal to survive the siege with all our Survivors, no matter on what way you want to go through the game, it is open to you! BUT keep in mind all your actions will take effect on the mood of your Survivors.You can try to beat the game as a brutal badass assassin, which is killing all civilians, raiders, deserters or soldiers, in order to get materials, medication and food back home to improve the surviving chance for your community. Also rejecting, to help other survivors that randomly appear in front of your base and asking you for help.Or just like a trader, which is scavenging empty buildings in order to get base materials back to base and later trading them off for better goods like medications and food. Also supporting other survivors is playing a big role for you, since this is increasing the mood within your community.There are plenty of other ways too but it would be too hard to describe them in this small space ;).So as you see I talked about Mood in the last part. Yes, right the mood one of the most important things in TWoM, every decision you make will either increase or rapidly decrease the mood of your fellows. Also you have to take care of hunger, illnesses, injuries or sleep, if you don’t pay attention to those people, you will lose them due starvation, injuries, heavy diseases or even suicides.It is a very complex game and again every decision you make, every action you take will affect your gameplay at the end. It could mess up the game and you will not even make it past day 12.I will not provide any in game tips in my review, only one keep it warm in your building or you return back to your base and you have survivors on a stick ;) during winter.Personal Rating: 9.0Sounds/Music: 9.5 (The music is matching the ambient, which is matching this kind of survival game. It is traumatizing)Gameplay: 8.5 (The controls are easy to manage and also the Movement controls are working as intended and other actions)Storyline: 9.0 (At some point people will say WTF??? Storyline? Yes, if you check every Survivors BIO it will tell you a little story about them, even so this Game is showing of what is ongoing during a siege and it is indirect telling you a lot about it how it is to survive etc. even if it is just a Game at the End)Graphic: N/A (The graphic is amazing for this kind of game and it is matching to the music and the situation)Thanks for reading this review, if you find any errors or typos keep them :P			"

Genious concept, but sometimes frustrating implementation.How would modern war look and feel like for normal people? That is the question this game is trying to answer for the players. And it does it in a quite immersive and unique fashion.Intense atmosphereThe War of Mine wants you to ""write"" the story for a group of citizens, which found shelter in a city at war. You are controlling their actions and are responsible for their survival. They need food, safety and warmth and how you get that is all up to you. You can give the characters their own personality by the way you play - friendly, passive, aggressive or something in between. Based on your actions, the characters will struggle with different type of issues - hunger, depression or sickness. The atmosphere you receive from all that is fantasticly emotional and feels like you are a witness of war.Huge amount of varietyNot only are there tons of ways you can play out the story for the characters, but there are also many different scenarios for each scene, which add a lot to the replay value of the game. Even if you get through the game entirely, there is nothing that stops you from starting all over and writing another story.Not flawless implementationWhile the gameplay, the atmosphere and the variety are great, sometimes this game can become frustrating because of it. Since you are expecting a realistic behavior at all times, you can get caught off guard by it because it is not the case for everything. For example in reality it should be easy to kill somebody with a knife after sneaking up to him from behind. But that is not the case in this game: They just lose a bit of health, turn around and shoot you. And then you lost a character, just because you expected the game to act realistic on that action. And there is no direct save-load-system to try out such mechanics.Overall I still highly recommend this game for pretty much anybody. It is surely worth the couple of bucks for the unique experience (even educational-wise) it offers.			"

												Amazing game! Hoping for more in depth characters and stories!Just a couple of ideas- Add animal's such as cats and or dogs, this will give you and or your group an emotional attachment towards them-Animals can hunt for food or help guard your shelter, like a cat that can hunt for rats, or a dog that can look for anything that is of value-Animals have to be fed too, cats can be fed canned food while dogs are fed raw food-Ability to name your new companions-Add new survivors-Increase the amount of survivors in your shelter-Have the survivors talk to one another-Add things that you can find that are random that suit the location that you are in, such as a toy in the school, or condoms in the Brothel, things like thatThats all the ideas I got for now, you guys seem to be well involved with the community, listen to ideas that would make sense. And please for the love of Jeebus don't turn this into a zombie game.Love yas <3			"

												Tired of being happy? Just had a good day? Always wanted to have clinical depression? Then this game is just for you!Seriously though, this game is surprisingly good. For one, it's a survival game that isn't about zombie outbreaks, nor do you play as super soldiers; you control a group of survivors in a war torn area that has been torn apart by war. The whole idea of juggling responsiblities between your group of survivors such as scavenging, guarding your home or sleeping is really well handled and creates a challenge while making you think about your choices. For example, you're running low on food, so send someone out seems the best idea. But, one of your guys is wounded from a recent attack, and your other guy is sick, so leaving them behind to guard the shelter may not end well, but you still need the food or else they'll be hungry for a couple of days. It's all about balance. The only problem I have with it so far is the questionable replay value.I would seriously recommend this game to anyone, just don't play it when you need cheering up, there's some heavy stuff here.

												While I have only played a mere 12 days or so in the game's timeline I am very much enjoying my experience with This War of Mine. The gameplay is simple yet enticing with the unexpected looming behind each scavenge mission. The realism comes into play when your group begins to feel the depressing effects of the horrors of war. The art style is phenomenal and is the #1 reason I noticed the game. A step in the right direction for the survival genre -- and yes, no zombies is a welcomed change! If you like survival, RNG style events and looting then you'll enjoy this artistic look at what it means to live This War of Mine.			"

												This War of Mine is a game where you’re playing as a civilians surviving in a war zone. It’s a survival resource management game.It attempts to bring up issues such as war crimes, bandits and looting through scripted scenarios as well as through gameplay. While the gameplay helps reinforce the tire situations a war ruined city might bring to its denizens, it falls short with its scripted scenarios.The gameplay consist of keeping your survivors well fed, happy and healthy till the end of the war. Most of the game is randomized to a certain extent. This means they randomize your starting survivors and balances out what resources you’ll get. To keep your survivors alive and happy till the end of war, you can scavenge, trade, craft, steal or kill for your resources.There’s two phases, a day phase and a night phase. Both phases have an active game time, so time management is crucial. The day phase is when you craft and keep your survivors happy. Every day at 10am there’s also a chance for a random encounter. These encounters could either be a trader, a present from a neighbor, or someone asking for help. The latter two are posed as moral decisions the player has to make, which does not heavily impact the gameplay. Such as, a gift could be from someone who wants you to hold on to medical supplies to a sick friend of theirs, whom might not have survived. These situations are always static, so taking in the medical supplies is always a negative choice. While people who ask for help would always be asking for medical supplies, food or an extra hand. Giving out an extra hand, means you lend out a survivor for a full day/night cycle.The night phase is where you obtain your income of resources by scavenging. You can send out one survivor to scavenge, which you would control actively. While the rest of your survivors can either stand guard or sleep. There is never a lack of resources no matter what starting hand you’ve been dealt by the game. There will always be enough resources in any given game for you to survive with a good ending without having to kill, steal or depend on random gifts. I believe this is a slight issue with balancing, as once a player realizes their optimal route, there is nothing to prevent them from obtaining perfect ending.The main threat to anyone’s survival is how they handle their time and resources. A poor management of your resources can quickly snowball into a fatal situation. Such as, if you have not barricaded your house during heavy outbreak of crimes, then you will have a higher risk getting wounded each day. This means you’ll lose time by sending survivors to heal up at the hospital instead of scavenging for useful resources, or consume medical supplies which would have been useful to trade for food.There is one gameplay design which bothers me. One hands you’re dealt is having only one survivor for the entire duration of the war. This means the random encounters where neighbors ask for help can’t ever be satisfied. The game does not allow you send out your only survivor, which essentially means skipping a full turn. In terms of balancing, this shouldn’t make any difference if there’s a chance of getting injured while aiding a neighbor. The player instead is given two choices, wasting the night phase in defending the house and having no income of resources, or spend the night scavenging and risk having their stuff stolen. Barring the player from assisting means your survivor will become more depressed as you refuse them. This disadvantage obviously can be countered due to the overabundance food, but the issue lies in not allowing the player to make their own decision to send out their only survivor. This means in terms of maintaining the story and integrity of the character is broken, as the game denies the player of making their own decision.The scripted scenarios you can encounter during the night scavenging phases quickly loses its novelty from the first encounter. There’s usually two scripted events for each scavenge location, the location’s name and/or description also changes depending on which one it is. It adds a little context but fails to bring depth to the situation around you. Such as the game vilifies the soldiers in the war, but there’s very little context beyond what the survivors sees. A drunk soldier, taking advantage of their power to♥♥♥♥♥♥civilians, or the sniper’s indiscriminate killing of civilians. While these atrocities do occur, the way it is framed into a scripted scenario makes it lose its importance as the player becomes jaded to the experience.This War of Mine succeeded in giving the player a glimpse of different perspective of war, but misses on balancing the game to invoke an experience of full desperation and disparity. If you're looking for something new, this could be it. But if you're looking for a well balanced challenging game, then this isn't it.			"

												This war of mine is a survival simulation game that puts you in control of a group of people that are trapped inside a war ravaged city.The gameplay of This war of mine centers around trying to survive til wars end by scavenging,stealing,killing and building various workbenches and upgrades inside your shelter.The management aspects of this game is very important as resources are used very quickly and upgrades for the various items in your shelter require larger and larger amounts of your precious resources.Knowing when to hold onto a resource is just as important as knowing when to use it or trade it away.Long term planning is a must if your group is going to survive as building objects at random will quickly result in death due to a lack of a much needed resource.Combat is fairly simple and gets the job done.Simply equip the desired weapon and click on your intended target.Variety is added in the form of close and long range weapons with the addition of stealth takedowns from shadows or behind if you met the criteria to execute.But by far the best aspect of This war of mine is how it pulls at the heart strings of a player by confronting you with many emotional and moral choices that directly effect the mood and mental state of your characters. Some examples of this is giving you the option to steal from the old and helpless.Or perhaps murder an innocent person for the weapon they possess.Without trying this war of mine makes you place a value on human life,yours and those you met, you will often find yourself  taking advantage of others to ensure your own survival.My personnel experiences in-game have had me robbing an old couple of all they had,just so that i could later trade those goods for food. Or killing a innocent man after he caught me stealing from his food stash. After playing for only a few hours i found myself giving greater value to medications and guns than the people who happened to be holding them and would gladly kill just to bring those items back to my fading group.This war of mine brings the dark and cruel reality of war into the forefront and never lets you forget it.

												I snuck into a house with only my knife.  I heard voices talking but didn't see what they said.  I went through a room on the bottom floor, but there was a hole in the roof, and someone with a gun spotted me through the hole.""I'll kill you!""  The person went back and came down a ladder looking for me.  I hid myself in the shadows and waited.  They walked by my position, and I lept upon them without even thinking.  Not a chance they saw me coming...My character threw them onto the floor and stabbed them over and over until the person was dead.  More people heard the violence and came down the same ladder.  I couldn't hide again; it was them or me. I charged at the one that came down first, but she just pushed me away and ran past me.  She ran to the person I'd just killed.""Boenza...No!  Boenza, I don't believe this....""  The female character keeps crying and saying the name Boenza.  She doesn't even acknowledge me.  I loot Boenza's body right in front of her; she doesn't try to stop me.Another character, a male I believe, came into the room.  He was holding a rifle and could have dropped me right then.  He just looked at me and started shouting.""Leave! Get out of here!""  I thought he would shoot me.  God knows I deserved it.Sickened, I turned around and just walked out with the woman audibly crying over Boenza's body.  The man just watched me leave with nothing besides Boenza's gun.Was Boenza their child?  Why had she yelled that she would kill me?  I guess she was trying to protect her parents; trying to be the hero we see in war far too often.  I didn't want to die, so I killed her with a knife, in what was probably her own home.  I tried to kill her mom, but she was tougher than me and just brushed me aside because trying to care for her daughter was more important.  I looted that girl's body in front of her mother because I needed the gun.Then there's her father...He saw his wife crying over their dead daughter's body, and past them he saw me with my knife which would have still had blood on it.  He could have killed me with his rifle.  Most of you would have because this is a game, right?  He just shouted for me to leave over and over again. They were better people than me, including Boenza; I wish Boenza had won our fight.Best. Game. Ever.			"

												I bought This War of Mine on a bit of a whim upon its release and have since played it to about the 40th day. These are my thoughts on it.Basically, you are trying to survive as best you can in a war torn land, starting with literally nothing but each other and the house you claimed for your own use.The art style of the game fits the game, while the musical score alternates between gloomy dread and uplifting, depending on whether you are scavenging or doing things in your home. But better than both that is the sheer atmosphere it seems to exude from every pore.The game really makes you feel like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ human being, should you refuse to give help to your neighbours, kill innocents and rob them as well. Yet often you are left with little choice in the matter, for readily available, unclaimed supplies starts to become a premium after a mere dozen runs or so. The alternative is to steal from the bandits themselves, and considering they are more skilled in combat than your untrained civilians and usually more well armed, this is a potentially deadly endeavor. Overall, the game was one I enjoyed and found highly engrossing, and would highly recommend it to anyone who likes post-apocalyptic scenarios that doesn't include zombies. There are enough monsters in us all for that afterall.			"

												Wow... as the description says, a survival game like no other. You play a group of civilians trapped in a beseiged city in the middle of a war.  Snipers keep you from scavenging during the day.  Lack of food and medicine force you out into the world to hopefully find enough to make it through another day.  Other survivors populate the game, some just trying to eke it out the best they can, some have turned to banditry, some inadvertently try to push you into banditry.  The more days pass by the more you are tested in the limits of your own morals and humanity.  It's a very engrossing, well-crafted story and very easy to become engaged with the various survivors in your group.  You get the impression that someone involved in the creation of this game was in some way connected to a similar situation as it is very good at portraying the horrors.  It is a very addictive game, very easy to get sucked in and play for hours at a time, and either survive the war to the end or die off, and then take a ten-minute break and then go right back in and start a new game.  My friends who play this game and I joke about this game can get to be very depressing and make you feel bad because of the situations and horrors of war and yet it is still so bloody addictive and fun.

												This game. This game will make you do horrible things.The beginning is quite average, you have some food, enough supplies, etc. Each day, you have less safe places to scavenge. Each day, it gets harder and harder. You'll begin to steal from people. You'll begin to kill for the resources you crave. You're going to lose people. Your team will slowly crumble. They'll break down. They'll die of sickness. They'll bleed to death. They'll get shot, battered, or beaten.All this, because of your choices.There are no right or wrong choices, only yours.			"

Apart from the immersive experience of a war from an aspect that has rarely (if ever) been covered by other games, it really fills you with the sense of desperation people in this situation must have - when you find yourself having to choose between bringing home medicine for someone who's sick, or bringing home food so they can eat for another day. There often aren't any good choices, just bad ones and worse ones.It's a game I'll play forever.			"

												This is a strategy and item management game set during war. You start out with 3 or more characters and you have to cater their needs by collecting and crafting items such as wood in order to make beds, food and gas in order to make cooked food etc. As someone who has a hard time with learning curves, I found this game fairly easy to pick up and learn. The game is a challenge though because you need to cater all of the needs for your character which can be a lot to manage. In order to collect items, you have to send one person you are managing out to scavenge. You do this by choosing a location and searching there. Each location has different items and danger threats. You have to be stealthy here and the game will sometimes test your morality. For example, I once broke in to a house which was presumably empty, but it turned out that there were some old people living there, who were completely defenceless and couldn't do anything about me stealing their stuff, so unless you are completely heartless, you will find moments like this very depressing. This also has an effect on a sadness mechanic which, if it gets really bad, will require you to cheer up the person by either getting another character to talk to them, or by getting them drunk!There are a lot more mechanics to worry about as well. You will need to collect water and fuel in order to cook food, as if you don't cook it then multiple food will be required for each person in order to fill them up properly to check off their hunger status. Some characters also smoke meaning you will require tobacco, and other characters will have other traits such as ""good cook"" and ""fast runner"". Different characters have different item limits on what they can carry from scavenging as well. The game is actually VERY stressful and isn't exactly fun in the traditional sense. However it is very compelling to play despite the stress and sad moments. The game also has a mode where you can create your own scenarios. E.G. How rough the war is, how many characters you want to start with, how rough the winter time (which brings a load of other weather effects making the game EVEN HARDER), and also how many days it will take before the war ends. So if you want a challenge, this game delivers. PERSONALLY, I found the game far too stressful to play for too long, which is why I have only put in a few hours in to the game. I feel like if I could manage the stress in the game, I would play it a lot more, because this game is VERY compelling, will really poke at your emotions and overall is an enjoyable time, despite being very stressful and depressing. Honestly I am actually pretty sad that I can't play this more.			"

												""War is Hell"" the best way to describe this game. Honestly I don't know where to begin with this one. Every steam review before mines has covered what this game entails in terms of the gameplay design and apporach. And I must say, they were very accurate.This War of Mine is insipired by real events. You take charge of 4 random survivors each one of them has a story to tell as you try and survive a hellish situtation in a war torn city. You will have to make tough choices in this one that could overall affect your group or affect the people around you. And this game really does a solid job at making you care about the characters you control and the NPCs you interact. The micro-management system (building stuff, ration out supplies, etc.) makes the game more strategic as well. There are times where you can go without a few days worth of food. But! And eventually, you will have to safeguard your safehouse while sending out someone to gather supplies and start taking really good care of your survivors. Stuff like takes the game to the ""Thinking cap"" approach. Do you ration out supplies almost everyday? Or do you wait until they become very hungry? Stuff like this will keep players on their toes. You can also create your own ""story"" within this war-torn city with selected locations and characters that are either premade, modded, or created by you. The only downside is that you can't create the background. Everything is premade or modded. Which is nice I guess but that would've been a neat thing to see.Lastly the DLC furthers enhances game as you can now select families or children. Which takes the game to incredible heights that also does a solid job.I can go on and on with this game. Point is, This War of Mine is a well crafted game that takes players to the morality side of gaming. And it does an excellent job.Recommend!			"

												I'm gonna keep this short. It's a very, very good game. I could elaborate for paragraphs and paragraphs but in the end it'd all be one convoluted way to say ""it's a great game"". I never felt bad about killing a person in a game until now. I actually feel horrible for killing a trader that begged for his life as the last knife stab went in (I wanted to stop but it was too late)			"

												Our troop of four was doing so well, Pavle, Anton, Cveta and Zlata.  We had so much hope as we all did our share to clear the busted hovel we saught refuge in.  Pavle, being the strong young one of the group had offered to collect supplies while Antone made supplies and boarded up the holes in the wall.  Cveta and Zlata took turns cooking and bartering.  There seemed to be a glint of hope amidst the war.  That is...until Pavle didn't return one night.  We heard from the neighbors that he had been killed on his nightly supply run.  He was the best chance we had at gathering food and other things we needed.  He always took his gun with him, why the hell didn't he take it that night!?  Depression set in amongst us as we decided who would go for supplies next.  Anton of course offered as he didn't want us to risk being in danger until things settled down.  Zlata insisted she go first because she didn't have any back problems, apparently she didn't have any problems killing a priest and his clergymen for food either...Her wounds were so deep, we barely kept her alive that night. Every last bandage we had was used on her and we were surprised that she lived through the night with the amount of blood that she lost.  Then she fell into a deep depression.  She wouldn't eat, wouldn't talk and wouldn't move from the floor.  Cveta couldn't cope with it anymore and when the men came with food, she chose the liquor.  Anton tried to get us some food two nights ago, but was shot when he tried to help a young woman from being♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by a man in body armor.  After this news got back to us, it took its toll more on Zlata than it did me.  She slit her wrists while Cveta was out looking for more liquor last night....she saw it coming and gave her the last of the medication to try and ease her pain, keep her asleep and from killing herself, Cveta didn't have enough pills to do it right. At least Cveta died with dignity at the bottom of a bottle when she left me...The mortar shells and sniper fire fills the sky so much today, I'm afraid the sun will never taste my tears again... "

												This War of Mine will make you stop and think before you do something, the smallest mistake when sneaking through a house with armed thugs can be fatal. You start of with 3 survivors, a scavanger, a cook and a runner. The first (ingame) hours are used to scavanging your house for materials so you can get some beds, a stove or maybe a workshop. After that it's out to find supplies and events may happen such as finding an homeless guy asking for some food, you can eather kill him or give him some food now or later if you plan on comming back. The morale choices you do affects your survivors, someone might get so depressed that getting drunk is the easiest way out of it.This game had me hooked for 5 hours straight, so this furry gives a paw up for this game! :3			"

												Let me explain how this war.. ehm this game ruined my life. So the story starts with me buying this game. I was unsure first because when ı watch some gameplays and read about 5 or 6 reviews  the game seemed repetitive to me, you know looting the same locations over and over etc. But than the nature of this game lured me in. This is another survival game yes but it is different. First of all you are not facing stupid zombies or some kind of mutant animals, monsters and so on instead you are facing war itself and you are just an ordinary civilian trying to survive, not a lean, mean killing machine. On the other hand the game(war) will force you to make some hard decisions which takes your ""innocence"" away. For example you'll ran out of food most of the time, at first you'll scavenge empty and safe places but those places will not produce food and you will ran out of food again. So you'll try to produce your own food, you'll build traps to catch some rats if you are lucky, you'll build small gardens to grow some vagetables but those will not be enough because you will be defending your shelter from unfriendly neighbors in the meantime. Eventually you will choose the ""easy"" way. You'll start stealing, forcing people to give you what you want or killing them when they are not willing to give. You will change, a lot. WAR WILL CHANGE YOU!!!Atleast it changed me. I mean i did something ı didn't before. I made some charts to keep track of food, meds, materials etc. I labeled them by locations, ı did it carefully. It is important because ı didn't even make one for my thesis :DTo cut to the chase; I can't get enough of this game and ı strongly recommend it. Buy it. Buy now or else...(maybe ı can pay a visit to your shelter and steal some food and moonshine) p.s. : İf you resist ı even take that precious broken guitar of yours.			"

Your hideout is a wrecked shelter in need of repairs, you can scavenge this place early on to start off and gain resources, everything is a factor to your survival, you need water, food, and heating, you can build apparatus to help achieve this, but you always need to balance your limited resources, and rest, because you are up against the clock and bang...the suns down and now you need to go out and hunt for those precious supplies. Now you need to balance again, do I sleep, guard against a potential raid to me, scavenge and what do I take with me if I go out scavenging? A weapon, bandage for someone in need or a crowbar to break in, each item taking up space you could otherwise use for more scavenging?!The amount of diversity and choice in this game is amazing, you can come back one night a hero, the other a monster, or not come back at all, you're group continues regardless, the question now is do you have what it takes to survive the war?

												Take in survivors? Raid bandits? Steal from the innocent? This game makes you think about a lot of things. Every day is a new struggle that feels so authentic it harrows you. Never have I played something so gritty. Between starving to death and dodging sniper fire, you start to appreciate the smaller things. The elation you feel when you discover a fridge full of food, or nurse a fallen comrade back from the brink of death, parallel some of the highest moments from scripted storylines such as The Walking Dead. Your characters reflect on their pasts and the things they have done recently to stay alive. They rejoice and celebrate heroic acts and sulk after more questionable undertakings. They show concern for themselves, but more importantly, eachother. Apart from the slightly limited speech bubble dialogue, they seem like real people.The graphical style is fairly unique and gives you no illusions of safety or comfort. Everything around you screams warzone. The interface is simple, yet effective; circles show availiable actions in the environment around your characters and progress is shown by an orange meter around the circle. Every action has an appropriate, and often completely satisfying, animation to accompany it. Hatchet fights anyone!? Combat feels fresh, and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Go in guns blazing? Hide and wait for an attempt to assasinate? or just plain sneak and hope to avoid a fight altogether. Your choice is important. Guns are no joke and sound attracts (usually unwanted) attention.9.5/10 - I would definitely recommend getting this game.			"

												Eek...So who wants to go to a dark and depressing abyss where you don't end as a winner with lots of monies and cookies, but rather a worn-out survivor with varying degrees of psychological damage? If not, then I guess don't play this game. But you would be missing out, because you don't see games like this very often at all.My closest comparison to this game would be Spec Ops: The Line because both take you into very dark places and when you finish it you are more likely to feel exhausted than jubilant. Unlike Spec Ops however, This War of Mine has no set storyline to follow. None of the countless horrible events you can come across in this game are guaranteed to happen for you, and everything you do in this game is entirely your choice. So in that regard it is a step up from that lovely adventure into a sand-storm ravaged Dubai. Because in this game, when you decide to have your characters do something horrible, it was your choice. Nothing forced you to do that. And you (or rather, your band of survivors) have to live with that.This game is about as unpleasant as it gets, and yet despite that this game was necessary since it shows the often forgotten side of war: the civilians whose hometown ends up becoming a battlefield. I can't say you will have fun (you probably won't, even if the gameplay is quite good), but I can say that it will be an experience you will think about for quite sometime.Enjoy being plunged into a world of despair and desperation. Woohoo! x_x			"

Watching my survivor starving.I'm a cruel person.Having enough being the guy that got ordered to shoot the badguy and capture the objective?Now try playing from the perspective of the people who's in the war, but not fighting.This War of MineThat said, this little game is just perfect.Management-complexity wise is not easy, but also not impossible. Mosf of the time your survivor will starve, but that's ok as long as their not dead. :pThe day-night gameplay cycle also complement the game's survival theme. Prioritize between lot of space to bring stuff home, or bring some gun and armor to clear the scavenging location from the enemy.Morale and Killing system here holds the player to not become a murderer spree and cold hearted b@stard/b1tch, unless you risk your survivor having mental breakdown, escaping from your shelter, or worst... suicide.Your survivor, when enough material/supply have been gathered, can build crude facilities to support their daily struggle, like Water container, Small plantation for food, or Tool Workshop and many other. Other's will see use if you come across some specific scavenging location.. Few facility are for late game, to produce currency item to trade. Knowing which facility is for, will help greatly in your survival.If you have completed 1 playthrough, now try again with fewer survivor, harsher climate, more dangerous war flow, and choosing hard location.Let's see if you can survive.

												First off I will say I am primarily a First Person Shooter player, but I have really enjoyed This War of MIne.  This game really tugs on the heart strings and every choice you make plays on the characters morale and mindset.  Do I help the old couple with meds or raid their things so I can survive?  Do I help the girl in the supermarket and risk being injured or dying myself?  These are a few of the challenges you will run into as you try to survive the war.  Highly recommended.			"

												This game has been in my library for some time. I finished it twice and then left it. After seeing there has been a free anniversary update (how often do we see publishers do this?) I decided to take up the game again and am finishing it for the 4th time now. Each day is split in day and night.  Daylight is to dangerous to be outside in the war torn city so you will be repairing the house you live in, craft furniture, cigarettes, weapons or moonshine, cook, grow vegetables, take care of the wounded and sick and sleep without being scared of robbers.Night time one of your survivors can venture out in the city to scavenge for construction materials, food, medicines, help out people caught in the crossfire of the war while your other survivors need to choose between guarding the house against robbers or getting some sleep and healing wounds and or diseases.A small jewel of a game.Different characters with their pro´s and cons, different starting houses, different buildings and buildings setups and occupations make each replay unique.Music, artwork, colouring and stories give a grim view on people struggling to live through a war.Several ways of supporting NGO War Child through purchasing dlc´s Can absolutely recommend this game!

												Arica was killed by a man living in the bottom of St. Mary's church. The night prior she had killed a man toting a gun with a hatchet before he could shoot her down, and returned home to have a mental breakdown after finding out Rowan and Anton had a fight. Roman, being ex-militia, wanted revenge for her death, so he took up his axe and went to St. Mary's church. He knocked on the basement door, and when he saw the man who had killed her he struck him dead. Two women ran over to mourn over the man's dead body as Rowan trudged through the house, looking for valuables to take, but hearing the two women frightened and crying made him want to leave despite feeling completely justified in his murder. Arica's death sent my group into a downward spiral of despair and hopelessness until Roman finally built the garden Arica had been scavenging parts for for weeks. I like to think they call it ""Arica's Garden"", and at every meal they remember her sacrifice and bravery.			"

This War Of Mine; Full ReviewThis War of Mine is a 2014 war survival video game developed by 11 bit studios. The game, which was inspired by the 1992–96 Siege of Sarajevo during the Bosnian War, differs from most war-themed video games by focusing on the civilian experience of war rather than frontline combat. This War of Mine was released for the Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux operating systems in November 2014. Android and iOS versions were released in July 14, 2015. A PlayStation 4 and Xbox One release titled This War of Mine: The Little Ones has been announced for a January 29, 2016 release. This version features new missions and charactersThe game starts you off in a bombed house and you must improve it with barricades and fortifications, The game also allows you to add several items which may improve the state of the characters that are desprately trying to scrounge by.This game is in no way a light subject or a cheery game, because it focuses on the struggles of civillians inside the war, don't pick this game up if you are looking for a cheery lighthearted game because this isnt going to provide you with it, instead pick up this game if you are looking for a hardcore survival/sim game.The main objective of the game is to survive until the end of the war sometimes that time is quick sometimes not, either way scavenge for food, weapons, and materials to survive.PROS  Very fun Very hardcore simulation/survival game  Amazing art style  Not another stupid Zombie survival  Good crafting/building system  (this is a semi-pro) Very hard resource management  Good replayability  Different skills  There is morality and you can go insane  Nice atmosphereCONS  Gets boring after learned everything  Game gets tedious and repetitive  No speed upFINAL VERDICT87/100			"

												This game is just incredible. I'm gonna be a stereotypical reviewer and list out the the things I liked/disliked about this game.Liked: Challenging Made you think about the ethics of what you're doing Fun to explore Realistic character reactions (Some characters can get depressed after stealing or killing) Unique characters Unlike most shooting games, you aren't some god who can shoot 100 people and get out unharmed. Instead of walking into a house with an AK-47 and shooting everyone to get their stuff, you have to be smart on if you want to attack, if you want to sneak through, or if you want to just leave. Sound effects & music. They make the game feel MUCH more intense.Disliked: Can get fairly repetetive at times. You have to restart @ the beginning of the day or the beginning of the night when you leave. You can't save in the middle.So ya, as you can see there aren't really many negatives to this game. It's one of my favorite games - right up there with Portal 2!			"

												It began no different than any other day... Typical morning coffee and donut on the way to the bottomless pit of work. Texting the wife to see how her day is moving along. Trying not to fall asleep to the droning voice of my mouth-breathing boss. The petty checking of emails we pretend make us important to society... It was all just a mind-numbing, typical day...Then the sirens started.In the distance I could hear the bombs detonating across the city. I myself was amongst the masses of the paniced city, each of us struggling to get past one another in a feudal attempt to find our families. Each street blurred in my vision as I sprinted ever faster to try and reach home. I could already see the looting beginning out of the corner of my eyes. I seen mothers with children getting trampled. Fathers shot trying to pick their families back up again. I wondered of my own family. I hadn't been a faithful man, but I was praying this day. Inside I knew, there was no home left. There was no wife. There was no daughter. All I could have truly prayed for... was the bombs hit them before the looters made their way.It's now been a week since this war began. I couldn't even tell you why it started, or even who started it. All I see are uniforms; be it the soldiers of a standing army or the gangs of looters, even a trader that stops by my three story pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥we call home. Well, the three of us; Our♥♥♥♥♥♥heap we call home. It took a few nights of scavenging to get us situated. I can only carry so much in one backpack. You can't expect much when you have to stay to the shadows to avoid getting shot down by a sniper. There's no doc to pry a bullet from me, and I can't say I trust this 'good cook' of ours to remove it either. The real problem though began only yesterday...Many of the places we had decided to send me had been cut off due to heavy fighting. What was left had already been picked clean in previous nights to help us get this shanty up and running. We needed materials for weapons, food, workbenches, stoves, anti-biotics - you name it, we need it. With most of it done, it was now just a matter of keeping food and water on the table. Since our trader friend failed to show for the last two days, the fighting restricted where I could go, and our traps had been barren of any rats; we were left with one option... The ruined house was nice, for what it's worth in this war-torn time. I was peering through the keyhole and looking at the couple and their son moving inside their home. They weren't leaving the main room, and there was no other way in. I barged through the door, and started sifting through as much as I could. I knew I had to push past them and make it to their food supply, likely in the kitchen (old habits die hard I learned). The son was of a different mind... I couldn't fault him, we all would have done the same. I can still here the click of my pistols trigger as two bullets released into the misty night air. The echo of gunfire stinging my ears from being fired indoors... The dark despair and pain settling on the parents eyes. I wondered if this is how my daughter laid before my wife. Reaching out for mommy to help her... Mommy knowing she couldn't, and our daughter just...I swallowed the bile rising in my throat. It was the first man I ever killed. I always saw it in the games and the movies... but this was different. He didn't scream. He didn't cry out... He just tried to reach for his parents with his shakey hand while his breathing slowly gave way. I couldn't bear to watch the scene any longer, and decided it was best to move in for the food and leave before dawn came. So I did. I took the last of their food, which was hardly more than five meals for my three friends and I. I charged out of the house as quickly as I could. I heard the father whispering under his breath... ""Kill me...please"" as I pushed back outside.I killed a man... I killed a family... so we could all live for one more morning. My crew was thankful... but I wasn't. They weren't there to witness what I had to do for the meals... They didn't see the eyes of the hopeless. They just saw their next meal, their life being extended for another day or two... I can't ever forget what I saw; I saw this war of mine become more of a reality. I saw how a desperate man places more value on his life, his companions lives, than anothers...  I saw the barrel of my .4510/10 Wouldn't know if I could steal from them again.			"

												A linear game with a great backstory. This War of Mine isn't your average war videogame. The choices and the actions you take will or sometimes won't matter. Every action your people take will have consequences.This War of Mine has simple and nice graphics, beautiful art (DLC, and you should totally get it as it supports charity) and a deep storyline. The game itself is art. Not all scenarios are the same and with the addition of mods from the workshop (which you can create via the game itself), everyone has the chance to explore and experience various scenarios with different kinds of characters.This War of Mine gives you a different perspective to war and its consequences.

												Awesome tycoon-style gameplay. Incredible message, mood, and general point. The issue is, the message and the gameplay clash strongly, since the latter is very fun. Even though the game is tough and your party will most likely get destroyed, the scavenging and survival themselves rarely leave you frustrated or depressed; there is always the feeling that if things go south, you can attempt something new. Characters sad? Stop looting and try honest barter. Not enough materials? Go on a killing spree. It doesn't necessarily mean you'll succeed; I'm talkig about the feeling of never being in a truly desperate situation.Which is truly an awesome feat of game design... but isn't it supposed to be the opposite?I guess the thing is, This War of Mine expects you to play with your own head, making the conscience of the player a mechanic on its own. When characters complain and suffer, you're supposed to feel bad, even if there are no straightforward penalties.Do you? That probably depends on the player. I'd say on consecutive walkthroughs the chances are slimmer, while the unrestricted fun of gathering resources never goes away.Still, it's great that this game exists.			"

												""War is Hell"" the best way to describe this game. Honestly I don't know where to begin with this one. Every steam review before mines has covered what this game entails in terms of the gameplay design and apporach. And I must say, they were very accurate.This War of Mine is insipired by real events. You take charge of 4 random survivors each one of them has a story to tell as you try and survive a hellish situtation in a war torn city. You will have to make tough choices in this one that could overall affect your group or affect the people around you. And this game really does a solid job at making you care about the characters you control and the NPCs you interact. The micro-management system (building stuff, ration out supplies, etc.) makes the game more strategic as well. There are times where you can go without a few days worth of food. But! And eventually, you will have to safeguard your safehouse while sending out someone to gather supplies and start taking really good care of your survivors. Stuff like takes the game to the ""Thinking cap"" approach. Do you ration out supplies almost everyday? Or do you wait until they become very hungry? Stuff like this will keep players on their toes. You can also create your own ""story"" within this war-torn city with selected locations and characters that are either premade, modded, or created by you. The only downside is that you can't create the background. Everything is premade or modded. Which is nice I guess but that would've been a neat thing to see.Lastly the DLC furthers enhances game as you can now select families or children. Which takes the game to incredible heights that also does a solid job.I can go on and on with this game. Point is, This War of Mine is a well crafted game that takes players to the morality side of gaming. And it does an excellent job.Recommend!			"

												This War of Mine pulls all the media curtains and shows the harsh reality of war. A stark contrast to videogames in general -- War is not Fun. When we peer through our smartphones for the media-filtered news from the comforts of our room, it becomes impossible for us inhale the actual air around a War. In fact, we have become dangerously desensitized to these horrible events. No matter which side is the right or wrong, one things for sure, the general population of the participating countries end up suffering the most. But they don’t get any spotlight, as blood and bullets make good TV, pain and agony don’t. This War of Mine reminds us the genuine definition of War. Do I recommend this game? Yes, I can't recommend it enough. "

												Seriously, I can't handle the emotional and moral pitfalls this game forces you through. The choices you have to make to ensure your rag-tag group of survives lives just to see another day. But that just makes me want to play it even more so. Why? Rather than your typical, ""Choice A is bad, choice B is good"" scenario that most games present you, This War of Mine makes every scenario a moral grey area. Will you survive the honest way, trading and bartering goods between your neighbors, but putting extra pressure on your survivors to make sure they scavenge supplies or else risk trading away their own? Or do you decide to resort to thievery and even murder to get what you need, but in the process risk not only your survivors' physical health, but their mental well-being as well.Truly a game that everyone should play at least once to experience the feeling of trying to keep a group of people together under extremely stessful circumstances, This War of Mine does an excellent job of providing a feeling of loss, hopelessness, and utter despair, yet at the same time, can provide a sense of accomplishment and camraderie that is hard to find in a lot of current games.

												This War of Mine will make you stop and think before you do something, the smallest mistake when sneaking through a house with armed thugs can be fatal. You start of with 3 survivors, a scavanger, a cook and a runner. The first (ingame) hours are used to scavanging your house for materials so you can get some beds, a stove or maybe a workshop. After that it's out to find supplies and events may happen such as finding an homeless guy asking for some food, you can eather kill him or give him some food now or later if you plan on comming back. The morale choices you do affects your survivors, someone might get so depressed that getting drunk is the easiest way out of it.This game had me hooked for 5 hours straight, so this furry gives a paw up for this game! :3			"

												What i did in 2 hours.(sorry for bad english btw).After a while my people was starving so i raided an old couple's house.My character was sad for a long time for what he did because that old couple is propably dead because of me.I tried to stay away from places with danger because i didn't want anyone to die.But after a while my people was starving again.So i took my knife and went to supermarket which is very dangereuse.In supermarket i saw a soldier and a young women.Women was looking for food.Soldier offered food but only if she makes him 'happy'.Women did'nt want to but soldier went on her.So i was already feeling bad for what i did to that old couple and i wanted to help someone.i took my knife and went on an armed soldier and killed him from behind.I would had die but i didn't.I saved a women, looted supermarket and found a gun.This is a game that depends on your choices.Your people will bw happy, will suffer, will die because of your choices.(none died in my group just yet but some of them are badly wounded).

												Our troop of four was doing so well, Pavle, Anton, Cveta and Zlata.  We had so much hope as we all did our share to clear the busted hovel we saught refuge in.  Pavle, being the strong young one of the group had offered to collect supplies while Antone made supplies and boarded up the holes in the wall.  Cveta and Zlata took turns cooking and bartering.  There seemed to be a glint of hope amidst the war.  That is...until Pavle didn't return one night.  We heard from the neighbors that he had been killed on his nightly supply run.  He was the best chance we had at gathering food and other things we needed.  He always took his gun with him, why the hell didn't he take it that night!?  Depression set in amongst us as we decided who would go for supplies next.  Anton of course offered as he didn't want us to risk being in danger until things settled down.  Zlata insisted she go first because she didn't have any back problems, apparently she didn't have any problems killing a priest and his clergymen for food either...Her wounds were so deep, we barely kept her alive that night. Every last bandage we had was used on her and we were surprised that she lived through the night with the amount of blood that she lost.  Then she fell into a deep depression.  She wouldn't eat, wouldn't talk and wouldn't move from the floor.  Cveta couldn't cope with it anymore and when the men came with food, she chose the liquor.  Anton tried to get us some food two nights ago, but was shot when he tried to help a young woman from being♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by a man in body armor.  After this news got back to us, it took its toll more on Zlata than it did me.  She slit her wrists while Cveta was out looking for more liquor last night....she saw it coming and gave her the last of the medication to try and ease her pain, keep her asleep and from killing herself, Cveta didn't have enough pills to do it right. At least Cveta died with dignity at the bottom of a bottle when she left me...The mortar shells and sniper fire fills the sky so much today, I'm afraid the sun will never taste my tears again... "

												In This War of Mine, players control a small group of civilians as they try to survive during a civil war, in the fictional city of Pogoren. Its a really unique experience, emotional and brutal.Gameplay is split into two sections: day and night. During the day, your survivors are at home. You need to keep an eye on any negative status effects - when they're hungry, give them some food, if they're sick, give them medicine, bandage their wounds and make sure they sleep when tired. You can build equipment such as a stove to cook food, a workshop to craft tools and weapons, rain collectors and filters to get clean water, traps to catch small animals to eat, beds to sleep in, a furnace for heat. And you can craft valuable trade items like cigarettes and booze.During the night, you can select one survivor to scavenge local buildings for supplies, while the others either sleep, or guard your home from bandits. There are lots of areas to visit around the city, and you'll encounter some tricky situations. There are only a couple of completely abandoned areas where you're free to take everything without consequence. Sometimes friendly people will trade with you, but if you don't have anything valuable, would you steal from them instead? Would you murder innocents and take their stuff so your own people can survive? Some areas are occupied by dangerous bandits, who will attack you on sight - but if you're desperate, you might have to risk it.The combat system, like the rest of the gameplay, is managed through a point and click interface. Left click to walk to a location, right click to run, left click icons to interact with an object or person. I found the combat to be very hard, but I think that is probably by design. Our survivors aren't trained soldiers, and powerful guns are rare and expensive. So far I've tried to avoid combat as much as possible. There's no reloading or respawning, so death is permanent.There are several scenarios to play through, where you'll start with between one and four survivors, and sometimes another will ask to join your group. Even that can be a tough choice - an extra pair of hands can be useful but its another mouth to feed. Each survivor has their own story and some of them have a special skill. For example Katja can get better value in trades, Bruno spends less resources when cooking and Arica can sneak quietly.Its the kind of game where you'll generate your own stories. I thought my second attempt was looking good, until we got several days of snow. I couldn't keep the house warm enough, so Bruno froze to death overnight. Realising that every meal would cost me more resources, I started to take risks in the dangerous areas. Arica stealth killed two bandits but a third one shot her dead. Katja went to the same place the next night, figuring one more bandit would be easy enough. Turns out there was more than one and they shot her dead as well. Now alone, and very desperate, I had Pavle murder an old couple and steal all their food, but the next day he was depressed, wouldn't eat anything, and overnight he committed suicide. Game over. But its failures like that which made my next, successful run feel so good. TWOM is a fantastic game and I thoroughly recommend it as a full price purchase.			"

												While I have only played a mere 12 days or so in the game's timeline I am very much enjoying my experience with This War of Mine. The gameplay is simple yet enticing with the unexpected looming behind each scavenge mission. The realism comes into play when your group begins to feel the depressing effects of the horrors of war. The art style is phenomenal and is the #1 reason I noticed the game. A step in the right direction for the survival genre -- and yes, no zombies is a welcomed change! If you like survival, RNG style events and looting then you'll enjoy this artistic look at what it means to live This War of Mine.			"

												The most impressing event i experienced is passing the Sniper Junction, an injuried father beg me to sweep the sewer in order to look after his child. Although i didn't want to do him a favor: i just wanna steal or rob the diamond, medicine and food,  after sweeping the sewer, the poor man heared the voice and took me to his house( we paused several times because of his injury). By the time i want to kill him to check if i could get some valuable stuff, he just shaked his little cute babysitter and said:'' Baby, this may not your favorite, but you have to eat it all."" Then, he showed me a box which has 5 diamonds. I couln't see his expression, it must be a big sweet smile i guess.  For the first time playing the game, i had killed so many soldiers, the common people( even the old Couple). I felt shame on myself, i just killed the old Couple yesterday night in Quiet House and found 2 diamonds from the old lady. I simplely consider it as a war game, just a game!  SO i became a evil killer regardless of others lives. As results, my role didn't survive 2 weeks. As an anti-war game, it left big impression on my inside. And i absolutely believe that i cannot survive in Modern War.   May no war exist anymore! May peace fills with the whole world.			"

												I've played through this game a couple of times now and would absolutely recommend it to anyone who likes the survival genre. While the mechanics are similar to other games and there is no real exploration element it does set a very unique atmosphere. You are playing civilians who pretty much start out with nothing except some bits and pieces of parts and wood scattered around your compound. The game itself has a fairly steep learning curve but it is a short curve. You might fail once or twice. Those games are probably going to be more memorable than the successful ones as it hammers home the suffering in a war torn country.You can choose to be ruthless, brave or cautious. Should you choose the agressive path you will probably find the game easy, however the point is you need to invest yourself in the lives of ordinary people. When are you desperate enough to kill for survival?The DLC proceeds go to charity so do pick that up too!Only gripe I have with this game really is the save mechanic that saves at the beginning of the day and at no other time. Sometimes I would really have liked to save after the day ended as I do not always have the time to go through the night mission before logging off.Get it though, it is worth it!			"

												This game touches a subject that most games don't: the lives of civilians during war. And I have to say, it does the work brilliantly. You'll feel the bleakness of the atmosphere and the despair of your survivors. And more often than not you're forced to take meaningful moral choices: when you really need supplies, do you try to sneak around a warehouse full of patrolling bandits and risk getting shot, or do you barge in a small house owned by an elderly couple and rob them blind? Whatever you choose, the game won't blatantly tell you if you're right or wrong, but your characters (and you) will remember your actions.One of the best parts about this game is the survivors. Each of them has their own story and personality, so they feel like real, believable people instead of machines. You'll want them to survive, and you'll feel terrible if one of them dies for whatever reasons. In addition, the endings for your survivors are cleverly built in as well. Even when you've survived the war, you may find that you just haven't won at all, as your people fail to find their families and friends, live an unhappy life, or even commit suicide out of guilt. The moment when each of your characters earns their happy ending is the most heartwarming moment ever.Even when I've completely mastered this game, I still found myself coming back to it over and over again. I'm not exaggerating; this is a game that everyone should play at least once.			"

This War Of Mine; Full ReviewThis War of Mine is a 2014 war survival video game developed by 11 bit studios. The game, which was inspired by the 1992–96 Siege of Sarajevo during the Bosnian War, differs from most war-themed video games by focusing on the civilian experience of war rather than frontline combat. This War of Mine was released for the Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux operating systems in November 2014. Android and iOS versions were released in July 14, 2015. A PlayStation 4 and Xbox One release titled This War of Mine: The Little Ones has been announced for a January 29, 2016 release. This version features new missions and charactersThe game starts you off in a bombed house and you must improve it with barricades and fortifications, The game also allows you to add several items which may improve the state of the characters that are desprately trying to scrounge by.This game is in no way a light subject or a cheery game, because it focuses on the struggles of civillians inside the war, don't pick this game up if you are looking for a cheery lighthearted game because this isnt going to provide you with it, instead pick up this game if you are looking for a hardcore survival/sim game.The main objective of the game is to survive until the end of the war sometimes that time is quick sometimes not, either way scavenge for food, weapons, and materials to survive.PROS  Very fun Very hardcore simulation/survival game  Amazing art style  Not another stupid Zombie survival  Good crafting/building system  (this is a semi-pro) Very hard resource management  Good replayability  Different skills  There is morality and you can go insane  Nice atmosphereCONS  Gets boring after learned everything  Game gets tedious and repetitive  No speed upFINAL VERDICT87/100			"

												It's the love child of The Sims and Oregon Trail; however when my Sim was sad, it didn't tug at my heartstrings like this game manages to do. This brilliant strategy game has your survivors looting, crafting, combating, and bartering all while trying to manage their basic survival needs like sleep, health,  food, and comfort. The choices you make are important because some characters are better at cooking others at running. These characters have truly come to life because of how their actions may take a toll on their conscience. Realistic setting, great strategy, and sensitive subject matter tackled eloquently makes this game a high recommendation.			"

The night prior she had killed a man toting a gun with a hatchet before he could shoot her down, and returned home to have a mental breakdown after finding out Rowan and Anton had a fight. Roman, being ex-militia, wanted revenge for her death, so he took up his axe and went to St. Mary's church. He knocked on the basement door, and when he saw the man who had killed her he struck him dead. Two women ran over to mourn over the man's dead body as Rowan trudged through the house, looking for valuables to take, but hearing the two women frightened and crying made him want to leave despite feeling completely justified in his murder. Arica's death sent my group into a downward spiral of despair and hopelessness until Roman finally built the garden Arica had been scavenging parts for for weeks. I like to think they call it ""Arica's Garden"", and at every meal they remember her sacrifice and bravery.			"

												This game has been in my library for some time. I finished it twice and then left it. After seeing there has been a free anniversary update (how often do we see publishers do this?) I decided to take up the game again and am finishing it for the 4th time now. Each day is split in day and night.  Daylight is to dangerous to be outside in the war torn city so you will be repairing the house you live in, craft furniture, cigarettes, weapons or moonshine, cook, grow vegetables, take care of the wounded and sick and sleep without being scared of robbers.Night time one of your survivors can venture out in the city to scavenge for construction materials, food, medicines, help out people caught in the crossfire of the war while your other survivors need to choose between guarding the house against robbers or getting some sleep and healing wounds and or diseases.A small jewel of a game.Different characters with their pro´s and cons, different starting houses, different buildings and buildings setups and occupations make each replay unique.Music, artwork, colouring and stories give a grim view on people struggling to live through a war.Several ways of supporting NGO War Child through purchasing dlc´s Can absolutely recommend this game!

This War of MineRecommended for those are into survival- simulation, time management and high replayability value.Note : I buy this recently, with the Anniversary Edition update included. TL;DR version  Items (Alphabetically) Score (1-3/3)   Control and Gameplay 3/3   Fun Factor 2/3   Graphic 2/3   Replayability Value 3/3   Sound 2/3   Story 2/3   Value for Full Price 2/3  LONG VERSION1. Control and Gameplay : point and click game, with some ""panic system"" at times. Minimum loading screen. Autosave system. Even at high res setting, it does not lag. Quite realistic and easy to learn. 2. Fun Factor : I am not quite amused by timed- management games, but it give me adequate times to think and act wisely. Will get used to quickly deciding actions in just a minute. 3. Graphic : Unique sketchy and black-and-white-ish artwork is really suited the gloomy and mellow war atmosphere. The small details is impressive, but limited variations on item designs.4. Replayability Value : you have custom mode stories and more content could be downloaded at workshop (the dev encourages it, they prepare a clickable link to workshop on start title). Nice bonus for adding a surprise free update/dlc after 3 years of release date (the anniversary mode- add new locations and npcs).5. Sound : nothing spectacular, but the music fits the theme well.6. Story : fresh point of view, quite uncommon to play as the victims (while usually we get used to FPS as the soldiers). Some stories, they require tissues while playing at it.7. Value for Full Price : to support the great indie developers out there, why not? But honestly, it's quite overpriced for college student like me. And also, I am interested to pay the dlc (which 10% of it is a charity) with the price gap in sale.Thank you for reading!			"

A true group survival simulator. No zombies, no T-viruses, no nonsense. It's worse. It's real.It's such a realistic survival experience, that you feel for your characters. You live as them and you help one another for real, in spite of self.It's like sims just much more brutal and emotional. A sim burnt by a stove? pfft. I did that on sunny sundays. ""This War of Mine"" is your harshest weekdays compared to that.Decisions decisions. You can play it heartlessly and egoistically when your pals are dying and your neighbours are too, but I dare you to delve into this atmospheric and grim game and not feel sympathetic. This is the war of yours. War of theirs.And watch out. The winter is coming...Upd.It only has become better with the addition of Anniversary edition mode and The Little Ones DLC.In a sum they add new locations (which are very welcome), new characters, new game mechanics, new NPCs, new setups. But what is REALLY new is KIDS.You got kids characters now in your party, sometimes paired with an adult, and it's a real party member, and it's a KID in a WAR... So you should care about them and you can also teach them to do and make things and they don't take separate beds. And of course they are not as useful as an adult in a party of 4 and they can't go on a scavenge run or defend shelter, in fact it's kind of a complication, as is often with kids in real life, to be honest, if to be seen purely practical.But we all know this game is about emotions, about realism and about decisions. So this again is a decision and it's only making this game a bit harder sometimes but also more interesting. "

												This war of mine is a fantastic game. It scratched all the itches that I had going into the game from the description. Oh and the DLC idea, amazing. For those of you who haven't seen yet or assume that it's only one part of the game that is all black and white, it's not. Don't let that discourage you though, the theme alongside the music for this game is perfectly suited and it adds a lot of atmosphere to the game. The whole game plays out as a cross sectional doll house style which works really well. You are not a solider or hero. Let me say that again, You are NOT a solider or hero. You will struggle, you will lose people along the way and you will despair at the constant dire situations you find yourself in. This game has done an amazing job portraying the struggle or regular people trapped in a war locked country trying to survive. Sure you can try and take people on using force to take what is theirs but you can also try to scavenge and stay morally and literally safe. This game throws a lot at you in the beginning and it does take a little while to get the hang of all aspects but even once you have (by the start of the third scenario I had the game figured out entirely) the game still offers a lot of challenge especially at the start. Balancing the need for food, security, warmth, sleep, preventing illness and injury as well as treating those issues is a constant for most of your game. Usually you are dealing with multiple issues at once while still trying to get your base up and running.I've had a lot of fun on this game, I picked it up for around $8 USD during a sale but honestly for me it felt worth the full price. The DLC for this game comes in three different prices that all do the same thing. It gives you an achievement, adds a bunch of graffiti art to previously available locations, these unlock an achievement once you have found them all. Most importantly of all though, all the money from DLC purchases goes entirely to the charity War Child. I couldn't believe it when I saw that, what an amazing idea to make achievements and the DLC go towards a good cause. I bought it and while most people don't care about achievements I'm proud to have both of these two because they do actually mean something for a change. A couple of little negatives to round up the review. Once you know how everything works the game gets easier, not entirely easy but a lot of the challenge and excitement of trying to figure out the game is gone because you follow a lot of the same principals to getting yourself established. When you have nothing to do in the base it can get a bit annoying to wait a minute or two for the day to end while you just sit there. You can click end day and move straight into the night but you could miss out on a potential visitor to your base by doing this. (1 per day max). The combat can be quite clunky and strange to get use to. Sometime you will encounter a few bugs but nothing game breaking, the worst I had was a random -5 degree day not during winter and 18 fuel for fire disappearing from my inventory. Overall I definitely got my money and times worth from this game, I recommend it strongly to anyone that this style of game appeals to even remotely. 8.5/10 "

												During my school years i was going through the library when i stumbled upon a book called ""i remember Beirut"" by Zeina Abirached. it was a comic book about the authors childhood living in Lebanon during a civil war, which sadly goes on today. I never even heard of Lebanon and every person at school i talked to about it never heard of the country as well. I even attempted to talk about it in one of my history projects, but then i realized i couldn't and had to go on about Gallipoli that the school system thought was so ♥♥♥♥ing important to learn the third time. There are so many places in the world that are strife with war that should been talked about in the news, but the only countries the news wants to show are Jerusalem and Syria, which sadly many people might know the country because of the conflict.""This war of mine"" is a form of justice that the developers wanted to show to the world, about a subject that is not looked up to a lot in gaming, hell even most media. I always like my fast paced action games such as ""F.E.A.R"", and even sometimes implemented humor like ""Postal 2"". But sometimes you just have to come back to earth and look at the harsh realities of human nature that has gone haywire. Its a game that doesn't shy away from mature themes on war and even if it doesn't have a spectacular combat system it makes up for on how it's presented.gameplaythe controls of the game is fully mouse use and works well for the most part. you do everything with it, from moving to selecting to placing to attacking to all that sort of stuff. the reason for this could be for the fact you play as an entire group. you have two cycles, one where you manage your group and  you shelter in the day, and one where your desperately scavenge a selected location during the night.the day time cycle is when you have to manage your stats of your survivors and possibly improve your shelter, you can make various crafting stations and miscellaneous stuff such as chairs. sometimes people come to your shelter to exchange goods or to ask for help for possibly goods in return. Even the characters you have all have unique stats and personality. some like to smoke and others like coffee, you don't have to do their needs and their happy to help out. you only have a certain amount of time during the day and your constantly rushing to do the basic necessities to survive the next day. it a little bit funny how the music is so calming when your constantly rushing the survivors, but that is little comfort where the biggest problems come from scavengingYou can only scavenge at night and have a limited amount of time like daytime, the character you choose can depend on how much they can carry and its a very big factor in this game. you only have a limited amount of slots and how much you have can carry can depend on life and death. but the areas that are safe from hostile are finite, and soon you will have to be robbing bandits or military outposts, or worst of all, other survivors.now the combat in this game also works well and there are various areas where you can hide and take cover. the combat it even more intense with a permadeath system that if you one of your survivors die, they die for good. the combat isn't really hard once you get the hang of it but that is not the worse of it.the game has a built in mood mechanic that changes if the characters do something heroic or evil. now keep in mind you do control your characters and not their personality, if you get them to kill a bandit or soldier or save someones life, they'll be happy or care very little. But if you get them to kill or rob a survivor, sometimes they'll become depressed to the point that they will start crying or worse, commit suicide. their mood can depend on what they will do and if they are content, they will be really hard to depress unless its extreme scenarios, if they are their movement is lowered and their actions take longer. it's a very well implemented mechanic that is very fitting for the game tone.artificial intelligencethe npc have their own personalities and reactions to the presence of the controlled survivor when your spotted by them. there are ones that will just ignore you, or threaten you to leave if they are survivors or sometimes soldiers. then there are ones that will kill you on site which are bandits and mostly soldiers. the game has a health bar and if their health is really low, sometimes they will beg for mercy, or run if you killed most of their team. If your not spotted and watch them, they have their own idle animation, like reading a book or going to sleep.atmospherethe whole game itself is as depressing as the trailer said it would be. you will be constantly having to get needs that shouldn't be hard to get in our time, like food, water medicine, and a lot of other problems that are death threatening. even the beginning of the game when you first start has no other button in the menu, except the word ""survive"".The background also sets the tone for the rest of the game like a pair of shackles with a man and a child holding hands and looking out to the distance of smoke and decay, with a dilapidated wall saying ""♥♥♥♥ the war"". you start it up and here you go, a group of survivors and a little backstory of these poor people, and the rest is up to you. I did manage to survive on my first run but was the worst play in my life which i didn't want to do. one survivor died, and another with post traumatic stress disorder.there is no hand holding in this game, there is even no tutorial, because it wants you to push you to the limits. its a look into the cries of people that have never been heard or given a lot of justice. your group is no superhero, they are like you and even feel remorse from the pain of others. you can go through the game without killing outright good people, but you still won't save everyone. the whole game isn't bleak and depressing, you can help others in times of needs like giving medicine to children. It will give you a massive smile on your face when you get as many people out of this alive and still pure to themselves, i sure did.negatives the whole placement of stuff can be an♥♥♥♥♥ especially where the buttons are placed. putting the ""end day"" button next to ""our stuff"" has led to many days where i couldn't finished my tasks because i tried to look at our inventory. now you can exit and reload the save, but it goes back to the beginning of the day and then you have to do it all over again.the ai in combat is also thick as well, here's a scenario.two soldiers kill a rebel, i'm hiding and when one of them falls down the hole i kill a soldier, i though he would leg it but my survivor can hear him climbing the ladder to where i am and i wait for him with the shotgun, then i kill him. what im saying is that if i was somewhere where there was one entrance. every armed enemy will come rushing at you one by one. a little bit more thought into the characters ai would have made for an engrossing experience.conclusionthe whole game is set in a make believe country of Poregon and even that it makes a good impression to be one of my favorite games. It's a game where every single problem you experienced is because of war. there is nothing good coming from it for any good person. it works well as a game that conveys its message. this is a game that manages to help people understand the struggles of refuges.and if you think the war child charity is a scam, herehttp://www.polygon.com/2015/4/2/8331411/this-war-of-mine-charity-dlcthere is dlc for the game and each has funds towards war-child, a charity for chidren in war torn countries. the game will teach you something like ""Undertale"" and if your a parent, buy this game for your child or children. you will not regret it.

												A really well made game!You can easily get attached to the characters in the game, expecially with ""The Little Ones"" DLC.I remember letting my people starve for days, because of lack of food, but NOT the child. Hearing the kids cry is really heartbreaking in the game, or when your favourite survivor dies.Gameplay is two part.1st:You are at your home base, taking care of things, like getting people to rest, make warm food, improve your shelter and that kind of stuff. This is where you usually get faced with the things you did during the night. (When someone is so broken, because s/he had to kill some elderly people for some food, and won't move)2nd:The night time, the game is mostly wants you to be sneaky as much you can, since you are just a weak civilian even a few knife wound could kill you. You can trade, loot, rob, kill, break down wooden objects to get the things you need to survive.Once you get a hold of a decent weapon, and enought ammo (the easiest way for me was just killing a bandit by hitting the back of his head with a crowbar) the game turns a bit easier, but still its difficult, you are not get to become a Rambo, so taking out multiple enemies without cover is still suicide.And you don't want to die, because of the others...10/10			"

												I cannot begin to describe the grip this game has on you when you play it. It may be a full fledged game, but in my opinion is also an experience. If you like survival/simulation games but also want a story, this game will do wonders for you. Rather than being merely another shooter where you gun down wave after wave of armed foes, this game shows the real impact of war - not just on those fighting one, but those caught inside of one. Definitely something for all to try out.			"

												The most impressing event i experienced is passing the Sniper Junction, an injuried father beg me to sweep the sewer in order to look after his child. Although i didn't want to do him a favor: i just wanna steal or rob the diamond, medicine and food,  after sweeping the sewer, the poor man heared the voice and took me to his house( we paused several times because of his injury). By the time i want to kill him to check if i could get some valuable stuff, he just shaked his little cute babysitter and said:'' Baby, this may not your favorite, but you have to eat it all."" Then, he showed me a box which has 5 diamonds. I couln't see his expression, it must be a big sweet smile i guess.  For the first time playing the game, i had killed so many soldiers, the common people( even the old Couple). I felt shame on myself, i just killed the old Couple yesterday night in Quiet House and found 2 diamonds from the old lady. I simplely consider it as a war game, just a game!  SO i became a evil killer regardless of others lives. As results, my role didn't survive 2 weeks. As an anti-war game, it left big impression on my inside. And i absolutely believe that i cannot survive in Modern War.   May no war exist anymore! May peace fills with the whole world.			"

Even the characters you have all have unique stats and personality. some like to smoke and others like coffee, you don't have to do their needs and their happy to help out. you only have a certain amount of time during the day and your constantly rushing to do the basic necessities to survive the next day. it a little bit funny how the music is so calming when your constantly rushing the survivors, but that is little comfort where the biggest problems come from scavengingYou can only scavenge at night and have a limited amount of time like daytime, the character you choose can depend on how much they can carry and its a very big factor in this game. you only have a limited amount of slots and how much you have can carry can depend on life and death. but the areas that are safe from hostile are finite, and soon you will have to be robbing bandits or military outposts, or worst of all, other survivors.now the combat in this game also works well and there are various areas where you can hide and take cover. the combat it even more intense with a permadeath system that if you one of your survivors die, they die for good. the combat isn't really hard once you get the hang of it but that is not the worse of it.the game has a built in mood mechanic that changes if the characters do something heroic or evil. now keep in mind you do control your characters and not their personality, if you get them to kill a bandit or soldier or save someones life, they'll be happy or care very little. But if you get them to kill or rob a survivor, sometimes they'll become depressed to the point that they will start crying or worse, commit suicide. their mood can depend on what they will do and if they are content, they will be really hard to depress unless its extreme scenarios, if they are their movement is lowered and their actions take longer. it's a very well implemented mechanic that is very fitting for the game tone.artificial intelligencethe npc have their own personalities and reactions to the presence of the controlled survivor when your spotted by them. there are ones that will just ignore you, or threaten you to leave if they are survivors or sometimes soldiers. then there are ones that will kill you on site which are bandits and mostly soldiers. the game has a health bar and if their health is really low, sometimes they will beg for mercy, or run if you killed most of their team. If your not spotted and watch them, they have their own idle animation, like reading a book or going to sleep.atmospherethe whole game itself is as depressing as the trailer said it would be. you will be constantly having to get needs that shouldn't be hard to get in our time, like food, water medicine, and a lot of other problems that are death threatening. even the beginning of the game when you first start has no other button in the menu, except the word ""survive"".The background also sets the tone for the rest of the game like a pair of shackles with a man and a child holding hands and looking out to the distance of smoke and decay, with a dilapidated wall saying ""♥♥♥♥ the war"". you start it up and here you go, a group of survivors and a little backstory of these poor people, and the rest is up to you. I did manage to survive on my first run but was the worst play in my life which i didn't want to do. one survivor died, and another with post traumatic stress disorder.there is no hand holding in this game, there is even no tutorial, because it wants you to push you to the limits. its a look into the cries of people that have never been heard or given a lot of justice. your group is no superhero, they are like you and even feel remorse from the pain of others. you can go through the game without killing outright good people, but you still won't save everyone. the whole game isn't bleak and depressing, you can help others in times of needs like giving medicine to children. It will give you a massive smile on your face when you get as many people out of this alive and still pure to themselves, i sure did.negatives the whole placement of stuff can be an♥♥♥♥♥ especially where the buttons are placed. putting the ""end day"" button next to ""our stuff"" has led to many days where i couldn't finished my tasks because i tried to look at our inventory. now you can exit and reload the save, but it goes back to the beginning of the day and then you have to do it all over again.the ai in combat is also thick as well, here's a scenario.two soldiers kill a rebel, i'm hiding and when one of them falls down the hole i kill a soldier, i though he would leg it but my survivor can hear him climbing the ladder to where i am and i wait for him with the shotgun, then i kill him. what im saying is that if i was somewhere where there was one entrance. every armed enemy will come rushing at you one by one. a little bit more thought into the characters ai would have made for an engrossing experience.conclusionthe whole game is set in a make believe country of Poregon and even that it makes a good impression to be one of my favorite games. It's a game where every single problem you experienced is because of war. there is nothing good coming from it for any good person. it works well as a game that conveys its message. this is a game that manages to help people understand the struggles of refuges.and if you think the war child charity is a scam, herehttp://www.polygon.com/2015/4/2/8331411/this-war-of-mine-charity-dlcthere is dlc for the game and each has funds towards war-child, a charity for chidren in war torn countries. the game will teach you something like ""Undertale"" and if your a parent, buy this game for your child or children. you will not regret it.

												A really well made game!You can easily get attached to the characters in the game, expecially with ""The Little Ones"" DLC.I remember letting my people starve for days, because of lack of food, but NOT the child. Hearing the kids cry is really heartbreaking in the game, or when your favourite survivor dies.Gameplay is two part.1st:You are at your home base, taking care of things, like getting people to rest, make warm food, improve your shelter and that kind of stuff. This is where you usually get faced with the things you did during the night. (When someone is so broken, because s/he had to kill some elderly people for some food, and won't move)2nd:The night time, the game is mostly wants you to be sneaky as much you can, since you are just a weak civilian even a few knife wound could kill you. You can trade, loot, rob, kill, break down wooden objects to get the things you need to survive.Once you get a hold of a decent weapon, and enought ammo (the easiest way for me was just killing a bandit by hitting the back of his head with a crowbar) the game turns a bit easier, but still its difficult, you are not get to become a Rambo, so taking out multiple enemies without cover is still suicide.And you don't want to die, because of the others...10/10			"

												I cannot begin to describe the grip this game has on you when you play it. It may be a full fledged game, but in my opinion is also an experience. If you like survival/simulation games but also want a story, this game will do wonders for you. Rather than being merely another shooter where you gun down wave after wave of armed foes, this game shows the real impact of war - not just on those fighting one, but those caught inside of one. Definitely something for all to try out.			"

												Hit me right in the feels.---- MY FIRST SERIOUS REVIEW ----Okay, this game really makes you think about your actions. There is no save button, more like this is a roguetype game. There is no restart button after you die. Instead the others mourn your passing and have to manage without you and your strength. Lets say you play Grand Theft Auto. You murder an innocent couple, then go on listening to ""Adult Education"" by Hall & Oates on the radio. This game is much different. My situation was dire. I had no food at home, except for a few pieces of raw chicken. I had to get food. I walked into a house and a man stood there while I looked at him holding a knife. He says kindly ""Please put that down..."" But he would hurt me if I did touch their items. So I stabbed him. He yells limping to the staircase ""RUN!"" and his daughter helps him up the stairs to hide. I felt so ashamed I didn't bother them any longer. I left meds for them and took some food, not all of it. I left promptly with my crew feeling ashamed.Like i said, rite in the feels ;(			"

												This war of mine is just simply, a fantastic game possibly in my top 5 favourite games ever.... Almost beats GTA 5... But it's just something different, something... Unique. It hits you hard with the feelz, having to steal food from elderly people that are desperate for anything! Having to kill a old couples 30 year old son and then watching them watch there son... Drop to the floor. Having to steal medical supplies from severely injured people, just to help your group. It does hit you hard in the feelz, doesn't it.SummaryProsCharacter combination choosing2 different spawn locationsGood/Unique CharactersGreat visualisationVery very VERY hardRepitativityHard to stop playingOkay trading systemConsNo button to continue after beating gameNot enough scavenging locations (3-5 more would be perfect)Horrific fighting systemCan only trade Ciggarettes/Moonshine (For narcotics) no Drugs...A little more crafting variations?This game would be a 10/10 if you could continue after beating the game or possibly fixing the fighting...

												This has got to be one of the most beautifully done games I have ever played. In itself you find yourself feeling things you never thought you would feel while playing a game, and balancing those feelings with the sort of life changing actions you have/choose to make.Playing as a survivor during a war struggling to survive from starvation, illness, wounds, other survivors, and the military, rather then a automatic weapon wielding one man army sent to slaughter hundreds of enemies in the name of your country/organization/religion/whatever. And its that sort of thinking outside the box with how most games are being done now that makes this game a true piece of art.The combat is unforgiving, just as it should be. If you choose to engage in some kind of combat you had better be prepared to really think about how you are going to take on the obstacles in front of you. Its easy to get wounded, get chased off, or even die if you are not careful.Scavenging during the night also plays its role, having to balance what is necessary with what isn't. Planning for the future winter by stocking up on canned goods and firewood. Getting the tools and materials needed to truly secure your home, and fix it up with facilities to keep your survivors both happy and alive. Mix in a little trading and you really need to look at all your looting options. Do you take the can of food? Do you really need it? Or is the pile of wood a better choice? Sometimes you will find yourself really balancing it out to because missing some key pieces when your survivors are either hungry, cold, or depressed can really change how the next few days play out.The music is utterly amazing. Its simple, quiet, and really sets the mood properly with the artistic style the game is designed in. There are times I just left the game on pause while I do some house work, to have that nice ambiance.My advice, play the game as if you were one of the survivors, don't think of yourself as a player/god controlling these people. When you do that you really start to care about your survivors, what their stories are, and what sort of things they are having to do, let alone what actions you take and how it will effect them.All in all this game stands out for one main reason. It has a soul. It doesn't need those million dollar CG trailers, seizure inducing lens flares spammed across the screen, sharks with freakin laser beams, Press X to feel aspects that all the recent triple A games have. Its just a well done game with a soul, and as a gamer what more could you ask for?			"

I then kill someone chasing me with a knife and everybody is starting to give up. You got to be kidding me.

It really immerses you into the setting, and has you try your best to get these people through the horror of war. You start to take a liking to some of the characters, and you want them to push through. I had to make some difficult and unethical decisions along the way. However, all of these aspects kept me coming back for more.			"

												This game is an amazingly immersive experience. I got totally shrecked the first 4-5 times I played it before I started to become more familiar with the mechanics and how to survive. I made it through the winter and into the spring time when the war finally came to a close around about 60 days in or so. I was absolutely hooked on this game, I didn't want to stop playing it until I'd beaten it. And to be honest, when I finally did beat it I was a little bit sad that it was over. But at the same time, I was happy for my fictional in-game characters. They wouldn't have to do those despicable things to survive anymore. The♥♥♥♥♥♥ murder, and pilaging was over. And then I sat in my desk chair for several minutes contemplating everything I'd done in those 60 days to survive. Thinking about how those things really happened to REAL people back in the seige of Sarajevo during the Bosnian war in the 90's. I've never played a video game that made me think about real life(...and death) such as This War of Mine.10 out of 10, would recommend. To anyone. Play this game now, before you forget about it. Also, don't be put off by the difficulty at first. After an hour or two of playing you will be a lot better at surviving guaranteed.Shout outs to all who had to go through the seige of Sarajevo. I know This War of Mine is just a game, but it's a game that gave me a MUCH MUCH greater respect for ANYONE who's gone through such a terrible war and had to get their hands dirty to survive. And to those who did all that they could to help other innocent civilians while putting their own lives at risk.			"

												Fantastic.  Yes, it does get a wee bit repetitve after a couple weeks into the experience, but even that helps the immersion in my opinion.  The game relies heavily on your application of imagination and willingness to role play.  I love games that drop you into the world and you provide your own story.  Do you want to be ruthless or go hungry to avoid hitting that one untouched locale with good people just trying to survive?  Do you intervene when people in the world are victimized or take a ""better you than me"" approach and go about your business while the bad folks are distracted?  It's very much a sim and not a typical war game.  I enjoy it immensely, but once again I'll warn you that the game expects you to bring something to the table to maximize your expeience.  The random nature of the game also allows for a great amount of replay value.A bargain at 20 bucks.  Do it.			"

This War Of Mine is such a game and probably one of the bext action survival games you will play this year. In a war torn world you start the game in control of 3 main characters. You goal is to hunt, explore and survive the harshness of the world as you struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. It's simply SUPERB. - Just get it!			"

												This game and papers please should seriously be a part of a secondary school social studies curriculum. Ive actually made a personal study of stuff like the wars in georgia and serbia and this game does a great job with the atmosphere of dread one could expect from living through that.But this game also takes it a step further and proves why games are an awesome medium for serious art, in any other medium if the story ended with everyone dying of either murder or starvation your reaction would probably be ""Oh, I guess it was intended to be a downer story.""But here, where survival is in your hands and your control your reaction to every setback is very visceral.

Out gathering supplies in an abandoned church and from seemingly out of nowhere gets stomped to the ground by some guy with a shotgun who just executes him in cold blood.This game is HARSH.

												The game has you managing your supplies by determining who gets to eat, and who gets medical treatment if sick. Gathering supplies from outside (Only at night since it’s safer) has you putting your home at risk from looters if not properly protected. Also building improvements like barricades, beds, booking facilities, moonshine stills, all help to keep your civilians alive. Even keeping the house warm with a stove becomes imperative, when deciding to use fuel for either cooking or heating.The game has no tutorial or instructions on what the best approach is, rather it’s left up to you. Do you want to survive? Help others? Become bandits and rob others? Even take part in the war by attacking military posts. All rather difficult tasks, and none really goes through as planned.My game started off with three young men, Marko, Bruno, and Pavle. Bruno was the cook who feared venturing out, caring only for survival. With the mentality, better them than us. Marko and Pavle the strongest of the two as far as scavenging and defending. As the game progressed I ran into an elderly man named Anton who excelled in creating items and gave him shelter.The game has you investing in your characters and fabricating their personalities in your mind as you make choices that put them at risk. Towards the end of my game winter sets in and supplies become scarce, while sickness becomes more common. Pavle ends up dying trying to back home through Snipers alley, an obvious reason why it’s called that. Marko dies trying to steal supplies from bandits that own a brothel. Left with a sick Anton and the cowardly Bruno. I set Bruno to avenge Marko as a last ditch effort. I imagined Bruno having lost his fear in desperation and anger. Making him kill three armed men with a shovel as he ambushed them from different locations of their hideout. The risk brought in a big reward.However returning home he only found that Anton froze to death in his bed. Bruno was now alone, suffering depression, but getting what he wanted from the start, just to survive.			"

												This game is so sad. I don't mean that in a negative way, either. It forces you to make tough decisions. Will you try and play the righteous path, where you barter and trade with your neighbors? Good. However, what if the trader doesn't have what you need at the moment? You don't want to let your group starve, do you? Well let's go scavenge a nearby building for food and supplies. You sneak into the structure, gathering food and building materials to just try and get you buy. You aren't taking everything, heck, you can't even carry that much. As you're searching through the cabinets for the canned goods and medicine you need, a hostile opens the door to your right and attempts to unload a magazine of ammunition at you. Through quick thinking, you descend down the stairs and wait for him in the dark corner so you can achieve the element of surprise on your well armed oppenent. He rounds the corner, and you stab him until he collapses onto the floor with a gurgling thud. You begin looting his ammunition when you hear more footsteps descending down the stairs. You ready yourself for the second onslaught, but it passes you by an collapses on your former opponents corpse into a sobbing heap. When the red haze of bloodlust clears, you realize that it was an elderly man and his wife. She moans uncontrollably and laments the fact that her love is now gone. He wasn't a hostile looter, he was an elderly man in a secluded building trying to make sure no one stole his sick wifes medication. You then have an epiphany. You realize that he wasn't an evil doer bent on ending your life. You realize that you, in fact, are the bandit.Edit: Before the trolls come out from under their bridges, no this actual scenario doesn't happen in the game. I wrote a short fictional story to avoid spoilers. This TYPE of thing does happen, however.			"

												!!! Updated Review !!!I used to think like a Battlefield player, where if there is a war, will join a squad to defend my country, move as a team, reach objective strategically, and win the mission then. But this guy over here, made me cry like♥♥♥♥♥♥ The damage because of the war to evironment, to humanity is really really heartbreaking.Going to a house near the outskirt of the town, get in with stealth but found an old couple trembling and begging to not took things they have. Got 2 friend sick in the house, and 1 starve, feels like really hard to take theirs food and belongings. Going home with a ""physicologically depressed"" player, trying to calm and her down cheers her up, not working and found she suicided the next day, at that momment feel like♥♥♥♥♥♥ decided to go back to see the old couple condition, might be returning some of their goods, found both of them suicide in 2nd floor bathroom. Empty inside mind and heart, quit the game, lie down on my bed, contemplating of what I've done.10/10 feel depressed!Enjoy!End.Original Review:This game is making me complicated, and far away from what I imagine if I'm at a war zone. This make me think deeper of how our heroes in Indonesia fought against colonialism and imperialism. World War 1, although the zone was far away from Indonesia, but they took our source to support them at the war. The same also for World War 2.This game has successfully make me to re-think how's life at war zone. I used to imagine being a soldier to fight for my country, but the tag line is true, in war not everyone is a SOLDIER. Horrible scavenging life in order to stay alive, hurting and even killing people when you pushed to the corner, wondering if I can live one more day peacefully. Surely brought me deep down to the death hole.One scene that broke me, when I got in a house outskirt ot town, where an old couple trying to be safe and stay alive, they both running like running from death because they noticed someone broke into the house.Oh maan, and yes the next day when the chars back home, he's mentality broke like♥♥♥♥♥♥ and so did I.Recommended for you who wanted to experience another side of a war.

												This War of Mine is amazing. It has the old ‘just one more turn’ quality common to games like Civilisation and as a consequence will consistently keep you up well into the morning hours. The game is defined by several layers of play, all of which fit seamlessly together in forming a deeply moving and often ‘emotionally taxing’ experience. The first layer-of-play is orientated around exploration and scavenging in which you will be called upon to move, point-and-click style, three protagonists around your base and various other environments in search of building materials, food and weapons. The second layer-of-play is the crafting system in which you will be called upon to manage supplies, upgrade equipment and maintain existing infrastructure in the bombed-out apartment block you call home. The third layer is defined by character management in which you will have to carefully maintain the physical and psychological health of your characters through the provision of food, supplies and entertainment. The forth layer involves the strategic map which allows you to journey to other locations around the besieged city, collect supplies and interact with various realistically depicted NPCs. The fifth layer manifests as a very intense platform-based stealth system which allows you to kill, sneak and steal in various environments. The sixth layer is defined by an emergent morality system in which both NPCs and your characters react realistically to your actions, lamenting death, cursing murder and ultimately resorting to begging and sadism under different circumstances. The seventh and final layer involves interacting with NPCs for trade and barter. All of these layers-of-play blend together extremely well, providing a highly immersive experience. The game makes you truly feel like you are a survivor on the brink and demands much in the way of emotional fortitude when you put your characters in harms’ way. I cannot recommend this game enough. 10/10.			"

												A really great game, every action that you take makes you take a second and think about it. The characters make you feel regret if you steal or murder others to survive. When I played this game, I felt as if I were struggling with them. Early on I was scared of everybody, people who knocked on my door, people where you could scavage. However, as you continue to play, you realize that everybody is trying to survive as well. Some may want to help, some may need help, and some are just thugs trying to get by. There's a reason for every action that takes place in this game, and the developers have done an amazing job on simulating the emotion and issues that these characters face. For example, when I was running low on everything, I decided to scavage the quiet home. There were only 2 people in that house, an elderly couple who could not fight back. They pleaded for mercy, they had many materials, but everytime I would loot something, the old man would beg for me to leave and to not raid them. I felt bad raiding their things, knowing that they would perish because of my actions. I tried to ignore it, however when I got back to the safehouse, every member had judged me. They were mentioning how cruel the character I controlled was, because I had stolen from a defenseless couple.This game however could improve a little on its story and variety. Sometimes you feel as if it's hopeless, or that you're not getting anywhere. The cost of crafting neccessities may be a bit high sometimes, and can cause problems even after you've gathered enough supplies. This is a definite purchase, even for its price.8.5/10			"

												Fantastic.  Yes, it does get a wee bit repetitve after a couple weeks into the experience, but even that helps the immersion in my opinion.  The game relies heavily on your application of imagination and willingness to role play.  I love games that drop you into the world and you provide your own story.  Do you want to be ruthless or go hungry to avoid hitting that one untouched locale with good people just trying to survive?  Do you intervene when people in the world are victimized or take a ""better you than me"" approach and go about your business while the bad folks are distracted?  It's very much a sim and not a typical war game.  I enjoy it immensely, but once again I'll warn you that the game expects you to bring something to the table to maximize your expeience.  The random nature of the game also allows for a great amount of replay value.A bargain at 20 bucks.  Do it.			"

Posted: June 18, 2015
												This War Of Mine opens with an Ernest Hemingway quote: “In modern war... you will die like a dog for no good reason.” This is very much indicative of the way the game consciously rejects the action-packed setpieces of countless blockbuster shooters that glorify and romanticize war in favor of portraying war realistically through the eyes of civilians trapped in a conflict they have no say in or part of, fighting for survival and experiencing life at its most cruel.Like a good arthouse film or album of experimental music, This War Of Mine is very much a mood game. It strongly evokes feelings of intense unease, dread and despair, so while I wouldn't say that playing it is necessarily a fun experience, it is an immensely absorbing and compelling one. In a starkly pencil-sketched nation ravaged by civil war (no specific war in human history, just a nameless armed conflict with some Soviet-esque flourishes), you control a party of survivors and are tasked with their item management, regulating their eating and sleeping regiment, nursing their wounds, making decisions about the fates of other survivors they encounter, and essentially keeping them alive. They are just as likely to die from crossfire during a scavenging excursion for vital medication as they are from taking their own lives out of desperation over the bleakness of their situation.While the game ultimately does what it sets out to do, maintaining strong gravitas throughout, it falls short in some areas, primarily characterization. The cast of playable characters all feel cut from the same cloth – we're presented with a photo of each (12 in all) accompanied by a paragraph-long bio. Apart from that (and some minor differences in their behavior and habits), they are quite one-dimensional, moving and acting much like each other and repeating most of the dialogue. For instance, when the 'depressed' condition pops up under 'hungry' or 'slightly sick' in one character's stats and you have another go to console him or her, their very brief conversation always plays out two or three specific ways and you're left to your own devices to fill in the ellipses. Also, much is touted about decision-making being part of the simulated war experience, that you'll find yourself torn about choosing to steal from others or deny them help in order to ensure your own survival, but I personally didn't flinch in these scenarios because the strangers in them are even less well-drawn than the main characters in your own party. Whether this is a price of the game being a small, independent production or an overlooked element that could've been more developed, it stands out all the more because the rest of the game is so strong.You won't always be in the mood to play This War Of Mine, but when you are, it hits the spot like no other game I've experienced. I applaud 11 Bit Studio's choice to take a bold, unexplored approach to this subject matter in this medium, further demonstrating that videogames are a valid art form capable of evoking feelings, setting atmosphere, and storytelling just as vividly and stylishly as any other.

												This game is an experience, for sure. Whereas most war games focus on tactics and the war as a whole, this game is all about the people: ordinary people trying to survive under the harshest of circumstances. It can be very confrontational to see one of your characters fall into depression or struggle with the moral choices that have to be made during the game.Getting through this game succesfully is not easy. Fortunately there is a great built-in modding community that allows you to customise your game experience, although I do recommend that you try the game ""vanilla"" first to experience its full impact.The Little Ones DLC adds children into the mix, which to me made the game even more interesting. Interactions between the kids and the adults are endearing but also frequently heart-breaking.Overall I would definitely recommend this game. It has given me an experience that is different from any other, and I expect that it will stay in the back of my mind for some time to come.ETA 11/2016: Devs are still adding content for this.

												In war, not everyone is a soldier. This War of Mine shows you the horrors of war through the eyes of a group of civilians. Taking quite an influence from the Siege of Sarajevo during the Bosnian War, you are put into a city under siege and forced to survive. Though the gameplay is nothing special, what truly shines about This War of Mine is the message behind it. Survival is tough in this city, and you must do whatever you can to survive. This leads to you quite often making terrible choices to survive, such as  robbing a hospital or a church just trying to help innocent people like you survive  and  stealing from an elderly couple, and if you come back to where the couple was, you find out that they have starved to death because of you.  Ultimately, This War of Mine is more of a work of art than a game. It excels at showing you the savagery of war through the ones most affected by it, but the raw gameplay is honestly not the most fun or enjoyable, at least during the daytime. At night, however, comes the real fun of the game. You must send one of your playable characters to a location in the world to scavenge for food, medicine, and anything else that your group needs to survive. If you're a roleplayer, you'll be delighted to know about the character creator where you can upload a picture and create a description for your own custom character. But if you want to stick to the base game, it can get a little boring. There isn't much replay value, and once you've seen a location you've seen it all. If you're looking for a  gritty Call of Duty style shooter, look elsewhere. But if you're looking for a fascinating tale of how life under siege affects innocent civilians, this is for you. I don't believe that the current price tag is worth it for such a short experience, but if you can get the game on sale, it's definitely worth it.			"

												When I first play the game when it was totally new. I wasn't playing seriously. just killing everyone and trying to survive. but at some point that way of playing the game is getting boring to quikly because almost everyone will be broken and will run away or commit suicide. So I was trying to play the game how it supposed to be. After I survived the war for the first time while playing seriously, I got like chills all over my neck. Everything you did and saw in the game will be remembered by the characters. You see at the end all the actions you made. You will see common events in the game what may be happening right now in some othert country. You will see a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of cruel stuff and get a lot of feeling of this game. But buying this game is worth it. I had some tears at the end. This game will let you think more or diffrently about war. I have a diffrent view now of war. Not a good thought of what might be happening in war. But it will make you smarter. Like I said and bunch of other players are saying: But this game!! It is totally worth it and you won't find another game like this easily. I recommend this game to you!10/10 didn't see a original game like this for quite some time.			"

												This game is absolutely brutal, and unforgiving.  As a trio of civilians living in shell of a house, you start from scratch and essentially progress through the game by gradually improving your hideout, as you simultaneously stave off disease, depression, looters and hunger.  Balancing all of these competing threats is significantly easier said than done.The game really evokes the grim reality of a modern war, in both its art style and gameplay.  Losing one of your civilians is actually quite emotionally profound; each civilian ha their own backstory and specific skill, but also hopes and dreams, as well as interesting quirk (e.g. smokes, or enjoys reading).  Keeping them alive is tough, but in my first playthrough it was not disease or depression that killed my poor family, but blundering into armed thugs and being shot for their troubles.  As inglorious and abrupt as these ends were, it didn't break the immersion whatsoever; people die in stupid ways in war.  What's more, the civilian deaths deeply affect your fellow characters, severely depressing them.  Let this go unattended for too long, and they may commit suicide.  Brutal.As wonderfully depressing and harsh as this game is (and long; a dev. commentary stated that the war could progress for as long as mere weeks to months!), I did feel that the weapon, and shooting, mechanics could be explained a little better.  I don't really know when the best situations are to use firearms, how to acquire all the necessary parts or even how to use them.  BUT, this is a minor complaint, and reflective of the fact i chose to ignore firearms completely in favour of scavenging as much as I could peacefully, then getting the hell outa there.All in all, a really emotionally profound game thats incredibly depressing, and tough to play for extended periods of time.  I highly recommend it!!			"

												This game is amazingly presented, you can get an emotional connection to the characters, I find it hard not to just start over when I loose a character. As other reviews say you'll prob get smashed the first few run thoughs as you find you feet, but I am facinated by the management system. When it comes down to it, when you've got no food, no meds, you can either die or grab your assult rifle and pillage. It plays on the human aspect of caring and does a wonderful job of illustrating how war impacts not only the soilders but the civilians.Couldnt close this game, addictive as hell.10/10			"

												Big at heart, but shallow on content. TWoM is an artistically ambitious game, with some amazing and stark visual effects, but after a few plays through you'll find yourself at the bottom of the content barrel. The general tone, capturing the enui of living day-to-day life in a war zone, is captured beautifully, while the crafting system and world exploration system are both imaginative. You'll just want more after 20 hours or so. One pickadillo: the English is a little wonky in certain bits of dialog, and even awkward English aside, the dialog could be much better fleshed out. It's like a 3.5/5 stars, but try it anyways if for no other reason that it's an entirely unique concept.			"

												The game seems overhelming at first, but once you know the economy within the game, it's piece of cake :)most of the essential items are craftable (water, raw food, veggies). two other most essential materials (wood and components) are widely available from loot and trade. I've finished most of scenarios easily.The secret of my success? Hoard assault rifles from bandits & soldiers. They are easy to kill with stealth and shotgun shots (in some maps like the Brothel & Army Base  it allows you to hide on the floor above the bad guys and shoot down on them. it only takes 2-3 shots to kill bad guys using shotgun) . Once you got their weapons, you can barter them  with lots & lots of wood & components to make your shelter well-protected from night raids, and build advanced equipments like the veggie garden.once you got water filter, rat trap, veggie garden, and lots of assault rifles, it's all cake walk :) "

												So I sent Roman to the Super Market, because we could really use food.  Just in case though, he took a crowbar to pick locks with, or to defend  himself if needed.  As he entered the market and began to look through a junk pile, voices are heard on the other side of a door.  Upon sneaking over and peeking through the keyhole, we see a soldier talking to someone, a female scavenger that is looking through a junk pile.The soldier appears to be a bit... drunk.  The soldier askes what the scavenger is looking for, and she says food.  The soldier then offers her food... but in exchange for a 'favor', offering her to come with him to dine and have some fun.  Oh dear, that... does not sound right.She declines, but the soldier gets aggressive with her, not taking no for an answer.  The soldier tells her that she will starve if she does not go with him.  She again, tries to decline his offer.  He gets angry and attacks her with the butt of his rifle.Time for action!I quietly opened the door and proceeded to walk up behind the soldier and promptly yelled ""I AM GORDON FREEMAN"" as I knocked him down and proceeded to bash his head in.  The female scavenger got up and fled the store. I proceeded to searched the soldier and earned myself a spiffy assault rifle with ammo.  Also, found some canned food while scavenging the store.We celebrated the next morning with a feast, now having a better way to protect the shelter.11/10.  Would be Gordon Freeman again.			"

												This game does not go to any great lengths to depict the horrors of war through the eyes of a civilian trapped behind the lines as it intended to. Environments and themes lack detail, RNG can entirely ♥♥♥♥ you up in combat even when more properly equipped than your foe, and movement is imprecise and clunky. Slapping stealth and combat mechanics on to what is effectively The Sims: Civil War didn't turn out well.			"

												I really wanted to like this game but for the second time after playing for an extended period of time one of my main characters died from the extremely bad combat system. The first time it happened I tried attacking a stronger enemy, but once you have thrown the first punch the next attack will be randomly generated based on your characters stats at that time. The combat system is extremely unintuitive and I would strongly recommend watching a tutorial before starting your first game.The second time, having learnt my lesson, or so I thought, I attacked an enemy sneaking up on him from behind with a knife. In all other games through the history of gaming this results in an instant kill, but not in this game. I severely injured the enemy who then turns around to fight me. No biggie I thought to myself, I'll kill him with my next swing, WRONG. At this point the awful combat system kicks in and even though I keep pressing the button to attack, my character just stands around and waits for the enemy to take three free swings at him that utlimately kills him.This would not be as bad, if it wasn't for the fact that I had invested a lot of time in the game already, and that the combat mechanics and rules of combat were never explained to me as a player in a good way. Especially as the combat mechanics do not resemble combat mechanics established by hundreds of similar games.Some might say that you are supposed to fail in this game, or that your characters are not experienced soldiers and thus should suck at combat. But in my mind there's no excuse for making the player fail at what they are doing even though they might be doing everything right.Other than that the game gets boring and repetitive rather quickly, it's an interesting concept that does not really deliver any entertaining gameplay.If the random elements were removed from combat I might be able to recommend this game, but in its current state I would not.

												This War of Mine ends up falling into the most common trap that games with permanent death fall into: Random chance screwing you over. When you go scavenging for resources you get an overview of what you can expect to find at each location, but this overview does nothing to inform you whether you will actually be able to take any of those resources or whether they have already been claimed by others and you will have to leave empty-handed.The game lost its impact once I realized that success and failure depended on luck rather than my decisions. A valid statement about war, but not something that makes for compelling gameplay. Might have worked better as a book or a television series.			"

												This War of Mine is like a pendulum that swings from pain to boredom.Day time is boredom: everything you do in daytime is repetitive and monotonous. You literally spend minutes each day passively watching you characters do the same things: cooking, building, cheering each other up. There is nothing positive to say about daytime. You just struggle to keep everyone alive, repair stuff that got broken during the night and various routine. Note that in daytime you can't even go out of the house and the occasional traders or npc interactions are completely useless because your team will be to broke/tired to do anything.Night time is pain: you finally get to play the game, but it's so badly designed and implemented it will just result in failure. First of all, the location descriptions is completely flawed, and in most places you'll only find useless gears or wood, even if it says food and meds. Second, you are supposed to kill people (I guess?) But the combat system is so badly implemented you basically have no control on the outcome of the fight. Not only that, but if you actually end up killing someone your dude will get depressed and just lie in bed. Finally, my favourite part, while you have to deal with all this♥♥♥♥♥♥ the npc's can just shoot you on sight and instakill you no question asked, even if you went bare handed. I also find it ridiculous that the game gives you zero explanation of the basic mechanics so that you can ♥♥♥♥ up a multi-hour long run just because you didn't know a particular interactio  (remember that you cant save...), it just feels like an artificial way to inflate playtime.

												This War of Mine is a dark reflection on the cruelties of war. The characters are relatable, the situations intense, and the content pointed.Gameplay wise, it is good enough to support the content. Combat is awkward (adding risk to engaging) and sometime the game just takes a giant dump on you in the blink of an eye. Better than a mortar shell through your house, I suppose.They have updated the game to allow you to craft characters yourself. I very much enjoyed crafting characters after myself and some close friends. I even called them up during the game in order to ask what they would do in certain situations. That caused them to pick up the game as well.Highly recommend. Not for the feint of heart. 10/10			"

												This War of Mine is an incredibly interesting take on the survival ascept taking place in a war scenario.The gloomy atmosphere really gives you a very dark and sinister sensation, which fits the game nicely.Note (1): I did spend alot more time than what steam says, since this a great game to play when you are going somewhere with no internet access.You will start up with 3 survivors, who all have their own unique ablities and backstories, which after a while develops a small relation between you and the character itself.All the playable survivors have their own personalities and feelings on what should have been done on some scenarios.You will be given numerous choices that may be extremely unpleasant to deal with.An example is when two kids knocked on my door in desperate need of two bottles of pills. You have the option of turning them down, but by doing this you will mentally damage all the survivors who want the good thing to be done.You do also have an option of thinking it through by saying to them ""Maybe Later"". They will then leave and come back in a day or two in search for the medicine for their mother.Then there is also the generous, but costly action that gives them the medicine.As I stated in on the unpleasant event of the two kids. There is a morale system in the game that plays a huge role on the game itself, but it also impacts some of the players playing this game.Personally I was in a small emotional roll when having the option to either help or not to.I wanted to do the right thing to everyone beyond my shelter, but I also had to keep my own survivors in shape, both mentally in physically.If someone got slighty sad, they were still operational, but keep talking to themself on what should have been done or why did it have to be done.When reaching a certain point, your characters will become depressed and even broken at some point.When at their breaking point, they will collapse of stress and sadness that is being forced into them. From either an other survivor dying because you couldn't find them help or that you had to go a murderous spree, just to survive the following day.You will be forced into a situation where you will have to do something awful to survive.There is so much depth in the game that really wants you to keep going.At the time I wrote this review there is two bases that you can end up with, There is also 12 survivors that you can be played. The game also has a random seed that randoms the places that your current game can visit, meaning that next time you start a new game you might have a new place that you didn't have in the previous game. What I wanted to tell you is that it has some replayability.I do have to say that this game has a very bright future for itself and I will look forward for new update from the developers.Note (2): I did forget to tell you about other game mechanics, but I didn't have time to write a really proper review with the current time I had in hand. So feel free to ask me anything, if your heart so desires. I will try to answer them as fast as possible, that is incase I receive any.			"

												This is one of a few games that really touch our feelings blends with our emotions and makes us sad when we choose to kill someone somehow besides the simple sketch pencil they managed to make the game feel alive the characters just really comes to live in this game this is a kind of game which i love i do have some regrets that will haunt me when i sleep at day 9 i was robbing an old mans house and he couldnt fight so i just continue to rob him and the next day i came to the same house and peek through the front door and his wife said ""can you cook me dinner?"" and the old man answers""sorry Darling someone taken all of our stuff yesterday""And i immedietly told pavle to run to exit and quit the game and i just wondered did i really did that why did i rob an old man house and at day 13 i go to the supermarket and there was a soldier and a girl the soldier was talkin to this girl while im scavanging and the soldier suddenly starts beating this girl and saying ""your comin with me or ill shoot you"" and i dont know what to do so i was to late and didnt save the girl and i said to myself ""What Have I Done i let the soldier♥♥♥♥♥♥the girl""""what did i just do""So this game is really a great game i highly recommend you to buy this and feel the game for yourself			"

												Overall good game looks and runs like a properly developed game looks pretty and tbh realitivly fun before you get shot by ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in other places. Nice ideas and cool fetures however i found myself at the bottom of a massive learning curve and the game really didnt seem intresting enough to try and learn the entire game. It just seemed by 5 nights passed my characters had been shot, were depressed or ""broken"". By all means this may be a good game i just think its a little too hard on the new players and maybe there should be an easier option where it is easier to obtain loot and such. if that was added in this game could really be onto something.7/10			"

												This is an amazing game - challenging, unforgiving, and makes you think.  My first playthrough, I lasted for just over two weeks.  One of my people died while trying to save a man from a sniper, another was gravely injured fighting off looters who raided the house in the night.  I sent my third character out every night to find bandages and supplies.  In an act of desperation, I broke into a home to steal supplies, and was caught.  I murdered the man for his supplies, and his wife even though she begged me not to.  They didn't even have any medical supplies, although it didn't matter because the wounded friend died in the night.  The next morning, my last survivor was mentally broken and spent the day sitting on the floor weeping...Hung himself the next morning.You know it's a good game when you have to fix yourself a drink and evaluate your life after getting a game over.  This is one that will stick with you.  Definitely pick it up.			"

												5 hours into the game so far, but I'm enjoying everything I've seen from it. Well, not literally as the game made me feel like a huge♥♥♥♥♥♥on multiple occasions. A short summary of the game itself: you're in the middle of a war and have to survive in a town that is under siege, supplies are scarce and you need to scavenge. It may seem easy, but it isn't as you will have to make decisions that you'll regret, but HAVE to do if you want to survive. I'm loving this game and while it may be repetitive at some times, it doesn't really bother me at all.			"

												This game has a similar feel to other survival simulations you gather and you build, but the major diffrence is the emotional weight of your choices. Often times you will find yourself in dire need of a certain resource be it food or medicine, and It is at this point that the game truely shines. You may be able to get what you need to survive and thrive but can you and your survivor live with the cost of your choices?My only complaint is the classical music on the radio reminds me way too much of the sims all the other music is extremely atmospheric and often quite intense.

												This is a beautifully done game.  For all you people out there who have romantic ideas about war, try this indie game on for size.  There is a reason why people say war is hell.  As the game says, not all those in war are soldiers, and this game is definitely more REAL and relavent to today's world than 99% of the war games out there.  **Mild Spoiler**I felt bad about stealing that food from those old people.  I'm sorry, but my guys were starving.  I HAD to?  They didn't even fight me or yell at me.  They were broken.  When my character got back, she was emotionally broken.  Literally.  She would not eat, sleep, or respond to my commands.  That's realistic!  Even when I thought I would use Roman, the ex soldier who usually doesn't care about others and also beat the crap out of my good cook, to just pick up this bandage in the hospital, he was sad, too.  I thought no one was using it, but you can see their thoughts, and Roman was thinking: ""What if the sick and wounded needed it?""  I left the medicine but Roman almost killed that cook, and I needed bandages.This game could even be educational for all the kids out there that think romantic ideas about war.  And the new DLC is great.  I haven't played it yet, so how can I say it?  Because you can pick how much you want to pay, and 100% goes to charity, to children who are the victims of war.  How beautiful is that?  I'm living on limited income right now, so I opted to pay $.99 cents, and even though it is a tiny amount I needed to make a gesture.  Thanks, devs and company, for helping me feel a little better about myself, on this day of my birthday.10/10			"

												So far the game is amazingly well done, and the consequences of your actions are truly felt in a way most games fail to pull off. When you decide to loot or kill the characters mourn and struggle to comfort each other and the dialogue really makes you feel a tinge of guilt and sadness for the choices you make. Whatever you do...don't kill a pastor unless you want a severly depressed group for quite a few days. Food is scarce and I do advise you put a rush on the garden. 10/10 will keep playing.			"

												A well executed and properly involving survival and managing game.I haven't put that many hours into the game (yet) however I would like to share my enthusiasm about this game with you all. This War of Mine puts the player in control of a small group of civilians in a dire, yet realistic setting in which survival truly is an every day concern.It clearly doesn't need any zombies or post-apocalyptic events to transpire to have you feel you are in an endangered situation. You're in control of a group of survivors with real needs and emotions. The decisions you make, whether for good or ill will decide how they will feel. You're faced with a shortage of supplies and there is only so much you can scavenge and find within your safehouse or that you can craft. The game is solid and you can expect a real challenge from this game, it'll test out your decision making and your management skills. Since, from what I have noticed so far, there are a few random generated matters in the game it offers a proper replayability as well.All in all I really recommend this game for those liking a strategic challenge. However, this game might not be for everyone as it does present itself differently from a lot of other games out there. If you want the full experience out of it I would also recommend you explore it without using any guides or similar as it takes a lot of the fun straight out of the game.			"

												I read someone else say ""This is the game we didn't know we needed"". And that person was absolutely correct. This game is not about being a hero, it's not a war game with guns a blazing. It will make you read the accounts of eastern Ukraine in the news today to get ideas about how to play it better. It will make you think about how we as a people survive in hardship. We overcome. On the game play and mechanics side of things it is also fantastic. Easy controls that only require a mouse, but everything can be accomplished easily enough. This game isn't trying to break ground in game play. However if you are worried about replay value, don't. The scavenging locations are random and so is the loot. Not that platformers are bad, but I would love to see this game made into a single player, first person, open world game. Perhaps similar to The Long Dark (also a fantastic game so far)..The art is fantastic. It's dark, it's grey, it's hell. The lighting is impressive. All in all I give it a 10.			"

												Simple 2D point and click with good soundtrack. A choughing member of your team can get on your nerves though.Then I got to the minimarket at a specific time in the game and I got very disturbed by a conversation I listened in on. Seriously thinking ""hell no, not in my game"" I crept in and stabbed the man to death from behind.Having seen what internet got and some of the dark net for some reason it still managed to make an emotional impact on me. Then you get to love the atmosphere and the soundtrack grows on you combined with trying to maximise it is very re-playable.Add some social conscience from 11 bit studios and it is well worth €18.99!So if you get this game at a discount please buy the DLC, money for the most vulnerable and awesome graphics added to the game.

												So I picked up ""This War of Mine"" last night, it was 50% off, why the hell not? Holy balls... totally worth it. My first guy basically went insane due to being my main scavenger and couldn't handle the lives he took. So all he would do was sleep, and died of starvation. The 2nd to go was my cook who ended up getting killed while looking for supplies. The 3rd guy went insane and hung himself after guy #2 died. Apparently they were friends? My 4th guy ended up vanishing without a trace in the middle of the night one cold, desolate winter night. My last guy was really sick, and ended up getting shot while trying to steal medical supplies from a warehouse. 12/10 will play again.			"

												The game a is a really well woven piece of work, everything in it from top to bottom works to build a very solid and grim experience. The graphics, the music and sound design, the scavenging and events that happen as you manage to survive longer and longer really brings the world to life. More importantly the game also shines a light on a side of war that really isn't covered by games, in fact it even goes in the complete opposite direction of most games and actively shows the negative side of war on a large scale as opposed to acting like military recruitment porn like the Call of Duty franchise, Battlefield, and many many others. I would recommend the game on the altruistic message its trying to convey here alone, but its actually a really solid survival game that should give you an engaging and immersive experience albeit with a ton of stress. Well, good luck, I hope no one sneaks into your shelter at night and rapes one of your group members.

												This game blew me away, from its narrative without a real story, to the tough moral decisions (should I trade with this guy, or just pop a cap in his♥♥♥♥♥and take all of his crap?) that you're forced to make every night. I really enjoyed how REAL it felt. I actually felt like I understood the hardships of living in a war. I would reccomend this to EVERYONE over the age of 13ish, because of its content. If you have enough money for this game, I'd get it ASAP. This is the must-have game of 2014. No matter how much crap this game gets from the haters, there is no reason AT ALL you shouldn't purchase this game. It's entertained me for hours at a time. 11 Bit studios are one of the most insightful developers out there; whenever I thought of war, it was always about the soldiers, not about the hell anyone caught in the crossfire would experience. They are so amazing for giving me this new view of war. But anyways, you MUST buy this game. No doubt about it.			"

												This War of Mine is a fantastic survival sim with rogue-like elements and a moderate difficulty curve.  What makes the game great is the overall atmosphere.  It is very bleak and depressing in a thought provoking way and it really draws you into the setting.  Unlike in most games, the moral choices you will be making here have real consequences to them, and you may find yourself making morally questionable decisions that make you (and your survivors) feel guilty.The rogue-like elements include a significant amount of RNG that keep the experience fresh when playing through a handful of times after your previous attempts end poorly.  You should expect to lose your entire group of survivors a few times while you are getting a hang of the game, but the process of figuring things out is a rewarding one as you manage to keep your survivors in good health longer.  Sometimes the RNG can cause uneven difficulty, however, as starting in the middle of a cold spell or without any characters with large backpacks can make the game significantly harder.The gameplay is split into day and night cycles.  During the day you use what resources you have gathered to feed your survivors and craft things that will keep them alive and in good spirits.  During the night you can send one survivor out to scavenge from a variety of places utilizing side scrolling stealth/combat gameplay that is fairly barebones but is well polished with no bugs or glitches that I encountered.  The entire game is very well done and it would be nice if this level of polish was standard in the industry instead of an unexpected surprise.			"

												What an amazing game. The player conducts a small group of civilians in a war, and the objective is to survive and to remain human. Of course, surviving sometimes is at odds with retaining one's humanity, and that is precisely where this game comes alive. From looking into abandoned places to getting into direct confrontation with other people in the war-torn city we live in, the player is faced not with the adrenaline that is usual in war games, kill baby kill style, but with those emotions which actually can be associated to what war-survivors tell when they write their memoirs: fear, compassion, uncertainty, so much uncertainty, hope, and above all, despite for war and those who pursue it. Everyone who ever played a war videogame from the pov of the soldier should play this game. Hell, this game could very well be the basis for a whole new industry that does not only require students to read die welle (germany) or lord of the flies (USA), but indeed requires them to play games in order to look at things in new ways, and truly without much effort. This is an amazing piece of art. The only way in which the word ""entertaining"" is applicable is if taken in the same sense clockwork orange, or the pianist, are ""entertaining movies"". Most of all, they are captivating experiences.Perhaps the best game of the year, despite (or perhaps precisely because of) coming from such a small studio, and capable of making a lot of people take videogames more seriously.

												In this game the player controls 3 survivors who struggle to survive a war. Inspired in Yugoslavian Wars, this is an emotional journey of survival and moral choises that come with it. This game settles a dark apocaliptic mood right from the start, so well done, with so much beauty, that can only be matched by very few games out there in the market (journey, flower, limbo). You will grow attached to the survivors in a way that they will put smiles on your faces, and will make you feel like♥♥♥♥♥♥when they're depressed. This is not a game about winning or loosing, how good of a player you are, its about the storys you will tell after the war is over.Gameplay wise, it splits into two parts: - day and night. By day, the players will have to manage the house and the resources. By night you have an option to go scavange in the surroundings in a gameplay that feels like a ""prince of persia with guns"" (flashback/another world). Some random encounters will challenge your morale and decision making.Even though i reference other games, this game is original on his own. And one of the few games that go beyond being just a game... Its not about scores, graphics, music, sound effects. This is a master piece, this is art. This is a must for any real gamer.			"

												To survive, you have to make choices, choices you may not want to make, but you have to. The premise of this game is to survive as long during a ongoing war in a city. You start off with some civilians in an abandoned house, in which you can upgrade with more protection and more workbenches. You will need parts and materials to make the tools for your survival. Don't forget food and medicine you need to scavange throughout the city.As you lurk around the city during the night, you'll encounter some people who may want to kill you or others who just want to trade. You also only carry so much back during your scavenge to your safe house, but lets hope also you home did not get raided on your return. One nice touch this game adds is the emotional state of individuals, some can cope better than others, with a cig or a book at least. Lets just hope they don't eventually break down and run away with your supplies.You'll have to manage your survivors well, or else things will crash down fast. The game is of course RNG(random) with each playthrough, you can also eventually select different survivors to start with. Sometimes it can be okay, while other times it can be brutal. If you don't die from hunger, you might end up dying from the cold winter.			"

The gameplay is so good I'm pretty sure my girlfriend will leave me if I continue ignoring her for this story.  10/10 for the difficulty, gameplay and overall thought put into this.			"

												Winter came, I got desperate, bandit hideouts are the only places left to scavenge...I lost my first survivor today, 7 hours into the game and I slipped up once, that's all it takes.My remaining survivors want to take revenge, I think I might oblige them. Whenever I find the heart to return to the game.I am completely immersed, at day 27 I don't know how much longer the war will last but I don't regret the time I spent managing my survivors. That desire to get through just one more day is staying with me, and the developers have done an amazing job creating a world where that mind set infects you after the first few nights.			"

												A fantastic journey that kept me playing, replaying and enjoying the grit of war as it should be portrayed in many, many  more games. I confused (and initially discounted) this game for Valiant Heart, only to finally give it a whirl on the suggestions of our fans. I discovered the depth and uncaniness of its portrayal of human relations, while it forced me to make difficult moral choices in desperate circumstances, playing out the very human consequences of my actions.This is what true independent development stands for. Hats off to the folks at 11bit for stealing so much time out of my busy schedule, and reminding me why we all make games! "

												So after 4 hours of playing this game im in love with it and would recommend it to everyone. The game makes you understand what it was like during the times of war and what everyone went through and how hard it was. It makes you feel sad really because if you were to kill a defenceless old man or something then you feel bad because you have stolen off them and killed them which is kind of depressing but also has an effect on everyone in the game which i found amazing how they did this.The graphics for the game are good and i like them and it fits the game well. I rate this game 9/10 for its outstanding gameplay and the way it makes you feel a must buy.			"

												This game really brings out the feels. The war mentality of civilians, by reading the bios of each character, and the overall mindset of being strapped on supplies during hardships, sending your survivors into a depression spiral, can really impact your decisions in gameplay.Often I found myself avoiding stealing food or killing thugs simply because some of survivors were sad. While some survivors did not mind, others were affected greatly.The bio of a character updates as certain events happen (raids on your shelter, you stealing or killing, helping kids), and it really adds to the personality of not only the character, but the game as a whole.While the game is slow, and punishes you for small mistakes even if you are not aware of that you're doing them (*cough* trading electronics parts *cough*).After a few restarts of different stories, I got the hang of the operation of the game, and some tricks that both help build up your shelter, trade, and survive.Some setbacks in the game that irritated me were:- Only being able to send 1 survivor out to scavange. Come on, I had a party of 6 people. They have to earn their keep!- No expandable storage (even if it's just 1 slot), through use of a backpack or something- Kevlar and Helmet take up an inventory space. I understand why, but these are items that I'd see shouldn't take space in an inventory... though it doesn't make sense to carry 20 2x4's throug the winter by yourself.- Being able to travel in the daytime... Yes, snipers, but there was a note ""I'll meet in <forgotplace> at noon""- Not being able to salvage that tank in your yard.Overall, this is a game that you should really try getting past day 14 in.At the beginning, after being strapped for supplies, you feel like there's no hope, similar to how your survivors feel.When you get operations set up, growing your own herbs, smoking dank memes, boiling that moonshine, is where the game gets quite interesting.This is the only game that I thought it was a terrible idea to solo a military outpost...

												Incredibly good. Bought on sale based only on user likes. So I wasn't expecting much.This is the kind of game that takes you out of your comfort zone. It is a memorable experience.You can't save the game to ""try something out"". You just can't.(Obviously when you leave the game, you can come back to the same day as you left).And it is a hard game. So ... what happens when you have a hard game with no saving? Something near to life. So don't try it out If you just play games to have fun. This game is a life experience. Not exactly funny one.I'm very experienced with management games, but I resorted on saving all the time, to get a 'perfect' management. In this game you HAVE to risk one of your characters, and that's a feeling I didn't have for years. Fear!When you have a ""save game"" option, you don't fear much, or at all.So, in short, this game brings this intense experience. Specially fear of making bad decisions and having to live with it. In other games, if one character died, I loaded the previous save game instantly. I just could not live with that 'mistake'. Here you would begin a new story. And that's a lot of time. So I had to live with some losses. That was quite an xp for me  =)Also the game is very well polished. No bugs, nothing annoying. If I was the QA guy, I would have nothing to suggest. "

												An incredible game which is a challenge everytime you pick it up. There is never an easy route, always juggling the benefits of your actions with their consequences. How many people do you have on guard? Who should scavenge from sniper junction and risk being shot? And who should get your last bandage. This tied in with your characters morality, whether they are okay with stealing, murdering and sending starving children away hungry, make the game challenging mentally and emotionally. A great game that's a long way from the norm of war games 11/10			"

This game also gives so much more replaying experiences as you can start of with different crews carrying people with different skill to be used by you.You will be making some decisions which you will not like it but it may help you survive the team, sometimes it broke my heart too.

(I shot and killed a Husband who was also armed for food, accidentally shot the wife thinking she was also armed)Sitting here feeling bad for a fake family.On the upside I have supplies again.

												I was looking forward to this game for a long time and it didn't disappoint. I wasn't quite sure what I was expecting, but I knew the devs intention was to show war from a civilian point of view.I managed to complete the game on my second playthrough (I quit my first one thinking things were too far gone) and while it was difficult, it wasn't quite as punishing as I thought it would be. The game is essentially a rogue-like resource management game by day mixed with stealth exploration at night. The stealth sections are very tense, so much so that in one of my first encounters with other survivors I panicked and before I knew I was swinging a crowbar and there were two dead bodies on the ground. While I got plenty of salvage this caused a depression within the shelter and the inhabitants began to argue amongst themselves. You will get the chance to do some good though when people visit the shelter and ask for help from your team. Sometimes they ask for items, other times they'll ask you to accompany them for the night (you won't actually see or control your character during these expeditions). When you're successful you'll generally get a morale boost as well as possibly some salvage. The risk / reward factor can be quite important here. A morale boost can be incredibly useful, but can you afford you lose any of your group?I found it a little difficult to connect with some of the characters using their backstory. There didn't seem to be enough of it for me to empathise with them. However the longer they survived and the more valuable they became the more I missed them when they didn't make it back after venturing out of the shelter. It's quite shocking how sudden and violently you can be killed by well armed strangers. On my second playthrough I was taking a pacifist approach and doing my best not to steal or hurt anyone. One of my group was murdered for walking into a room while a soldier attempted to assault a female scavenger. It's fair to say that the next time I went out I shot first and asked questions later.I don't really want to give away any more than I already have, so if you fancy something bleak and at times ""unforgiving"" then give this a go. For me this is what Indie games are all about.  "

												Awesome platform game about reality of war. No killing and satisfaction from that. Just death and sorrow. In that game we personate group of civils, who must survive the war. We need to assure ourselves food, medicines, proper temperature and security in our hideout. During the day we can improve the shelter creating cooker, beds etc. At night one of our civils can go scavenge any places, where we will find essentials. It sometimes happens that we are on the horns of a dilemma. Steal poor family or let die our terminally sick friend. Or someone can die, if we encounter soldiers or thugs. That game tremendously made use of my emotions. It is not hard game. Hard is just finish its according to our feelings. I honestly recommend it everyone, who wanna see how looks war in reality.			"

Can't say it didn't take me alot of tries, but somehow I still managed to get it all perfect. Game has to offer great artwork, as well great dialogues and very nice diary system, it really gives you the feeleing like you are living the experience.What I didn't like about this game is that there are so many smokers, and when you try to make sigarets to trade them, they will just smoke them all before you have chance to trade them. I'm fine with coffee drinkers since they drink 1 coffee per day, but those guys go for 3 sigarets per day so it's kinda hard to keep the number up. Overall it's nice :)*I highly suggest to get guitar and play it, has to offer great music!*			"

												My first ""This War of Mine"" game is over, 13.7 real life hours, 40 in-game days. 4 dead team members, 3 murders, a lot of stealing (I'm not sure if you can win this game without that), even more looting and a working moonshine factory with a steady trade. Helped everyone who asked for it, took in every survivor (good thing too, because I ended up loosing a lot of them), tried fighting against bandits, was a bad idea. But enough with the debrief, now to the actual review:My overall feeling about this game is very positive. The theme is unique and the feeling of despair sustains though out the game. At some point during the game the atmosphere got so intensely sad and desperate I had to take a break from it, I consider this to be an amazing achievement from a game. I suffered 3 bugs during the game that really had an affect on the atmosphere and broke the immersion, but considering that it's an relatively new game from a indie studio it's understandable. Also the bugs didn't break the game and I was able to continue after them, I just hope they get fixed sooner rather than later. :) The game could have more variety to it, definitely, but again: New game and a indie game, the game itself is a remarkable achievement! An true survivor game and perhaps first of its kind in being a ""war-survivor"" game. The music was good and conveyed the feeling of the game very well, a more variance to the music would have been better though. Especially the radio music got boring quick. For me the trailer expressed a bit more event rich and intense game than it was, which is more of an rule than exception, but like I said: overall feeling is very positive. This was perhaps one of the best games I've played, but yes it could have been even better. :-)Played this on apple platform on Christmas holiday, when I get back from the holidays to my PC, I wonder will the save games and achievements be transferable to my PC? We will see.This War of Mine is a true survivor game with intense atmosphere.			"

												I love This War of Mine, even though it bums me the hell out.Its premise revolves around civilians surviving in a fictional war-torn country. You start out with three characters all residing in a shelled out house, which you can switch between with the ""Tab"" key. Each member has their own peculiarities (some smoke, drink coffee, etc) and skills (better at sneaking, scavenging, better at cooking). You give orders to them based on context bubbles that hover over interactive objects in the world (open doors, eat, cook, sleep, take meds, dig through rubble, attack, etc). When you first start out, you need to scavenge what is in the building to survive. Food, water, and parts. Parts can be used for a variety of purposes, from making beds so your guys can get a better sleep, to chairs, to workshops so you can craft crowbars to force yourself past locked doors, to shovels to help move debri faster, to cooking stoves, water purifiers, the ability to board up windows to lessen the chance of looters, etc etc. That's a VERY small list of what's possible, but to give you an idea.This is basically what the game revolves around: resource gathering and crafting. There are two phases to the game: daytime and nighttime. Day's are about 10-15 minutes long, nights about 5. During the day you're at your house, building stuff to help in dealing with hunger (building a stove, a trap to catch rats, a water purifier, etc), shelter (boarding up windows, setting up traps to stop intruders, making beds, chairs, etc), comfort to make your guys content (making guitars, radio, a moonshine distillery, etc), and tools that will help outside during the night segments (knives, lockpicks, crowbars, guns). You let your guys sleep, eat, and do things to keep their spirits in check. You require a diversity of resources to accomplish all of this, and once your place has been ransacked in the first few days it's necessary to venture out at dark to scavenge for supplies to be able to live another day.To get an idea of the gameplay at night, think Mark of the Ninja, though it's much slower paced. You make sound in whatever you do which is indicated as a visible ring that pulsates outwards, which also allows you to hear what's nearby, indicated by a red ring. Venturing out in a warzone is all kinds of unpredictable, and you'll never be sure of what you'll find. You're limited in inventory (some members can carry more). You can take stuff from your place out into the field, such as meds for those in need, crowbars and guns for weapons, lockpicking to reduce the noise of getting through a locked door, but doing so risks using up one of your slots that could bring back much needed loot for the next day. You'll meet people who are in need, who are suffering the hell of war at the mercy of the unmerciful, those who mind their own business, and those who are not all that friendly to say the least. Your job is to get as much resources as you can be any means necessary to sustain your crew.Straight up, overall I have to say this game's pretty depressing.....it's a demonstration of misery. Not to say it's not a great game, I'm very much enjoying it, but it can be a downer. Your guys are always hungry and tired. They have the ability to get sick and wounded, and require antibiotics/bandages to survive if this befalls them. Most importantly, This War of Mine is mostly a psychological battle. Everything your survivors do (killing, stealing, being unable to help someone) holds ramifications on their mental health. It's very easy for your group to fall into utter despair, and this threat becomes just as big as bullets or hunger (they can commit suicide or become ""broken"" and won't follow orders). When you think things are finally starting to get better, you're hit by a raid. It just always seems to get worse and worse. So far I've only survived 15 days, my last guy hanging himself. RIP Bruno.No game really has made me feel grateful for the things I have; this one does. It's a decent survival experience that delves into the psychological torment and endurance ambivilant of morality necessitated by being in a war. Tough moral choices have to be made, and that's what makes this game so fun and impactful. Prepare to die, and die a lot. Highly recommended. "

Well pav is a character in the game and is my favorite but one day i felt like super man cause i had a shotgun so i charged the warehouse with him opened fire and did not even hit one of them before all four of them shot down pav and took all my stuff after that Marin and Katia drank their sorrows away while Bruno was a♥♥♥♥♥♥as always. 10/10 would play again			"

												I bought this game after reading many of the positive reviews on steam and think any developer that makes this kind of war RTS/strategy/survival game deserve to be rewarded by my money. Not only such developer is extremely rare, but also it doesn't lead gamers to be confused between reality and fantansy / virtual reality. Furthermore, it provides gamers an opportunity to reflect about how life would be like in war time (instead of glorifying it like most of the FPS / RTS or strategy war games).Before I played the game, I was wondering how this game can make so many players feel so emotionally attached to the point they cry or have deep reflections about their morality during game play. With 25 hours game play (less than 10 games), I finally realised why they felt the way they did. Without making it a very long post. Here is the my summary scores about the game:Replayability = 10/10 (Of the 10 games I played, each game outcomes were unique)Storyline = 10/10 (very touching & realistic)Graphic = 7/10 (Is only 2D but it isn't bad)Sounds = 6/10 (Could have been better if each character would speak with a voice actor/actress instead of substitle)Value on the cost of the game = 10/10 (definitely worth my USD$19.99)Last but not least, if you haven't played or bougth this game yet, buy it now I am sure you won't be disappointed. This game will grow on you the more you played and when you thought you have this game figured it out, it will keep surprising you in many different ways.			"

												Roughtly 10hours for one playthrough. Cost me just 17€. Scavenging, planning and trading are a major part of the game. The night rights you do in game are best done silently, combat is hard, surviving depression even more so. For a Indie game its a definite 9/10. I hope for a dlc/expansion pack or a second game in this series with improved social system, map and more upgrade options for the shelter as well as getting more than 4 survivors at once. Great game, highly recommended if you like immersive singleplayer experiences.			"

												This game is the kind of war game we need in today's world. War games today are just run and gun shoot 'em ups, or ""realistic"" tactical games. thats not real war, real war is hell. Real war is men murdering one another over the idiologies of others. Real war is men and woman simply trying to avoid the one killing for idiotic governments. Real war effects all, not just those people you see in your video games. This game shows what war is at its core. The message this game has is what war is and what it really brings. Not fun but hell. Hell is war and war is Hell. To quote this game ""In war not everyone is a soldier""			"

												I just watched an injured womans last moments before she killed herself to avoid starvation. I ratted out my neigbors for a pack of ciggarets and coffee. I sent a depressed wounded man into a sniper crossfire for a shovel. This game makes me feel like the worst piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥in the world and I love it for that.If you're going to buy the game then drop some money on the War Child DLC, all of the profit from it goes to The War Child charity and helps people who actually have to make these decisions live better. At minimum its only .99 cents but you can pay more if you're feeling generous.If you're expecting a fun filled survivalist crafting game, this isn't that. While it has its moments it is a fairly simple game and I can see some people getting tired of the gameplay quickly. That doesn't mean you shouldn't buy it.It's different, it's deppressing and it's something im not gonna forget for a while.That's it.			"

												This is a graphic-lite resource management sim where you walk the tightrope of bare subsistence over the pit of starvation. The protagonists (that you control) consume resources, while you task them with building enough of a surplus that one raid won't leave you all dead.Some games suffer from obtuse rules or too much RNG. In This War of Mine, the rules are upfront, the RNG is only as crippling as you are impatient, while the randomly-generated locations allow for replayability and starting over without mindless grinding and memorization. Further, you get to control the actions of the people you send scavenging, giving you a sense of ownership superior to a roll of the dice.Overall the game has great atmosphere, artwork, and gameplay elements. This War of Mine could be improved by voice-acting for all the characters to compliment the speach-bubbles. Further, the game will be a smoother ride if you the player are a fast/comprehensive reader, becuase there are helpful gameplay clues and cues that all come in the form of text. My last gripe is about how slow characters move. It does give a sense of gravity and immersion, but during the day-cycle where you are fortifying and working within your stronghold, it can also be cumbersome if you placed two related items far apart from one another. Despite the caveats above, I am very much enjoying this game for doing an excellent job of everything it means for itself to be: an oppressive resource-management story-telling war-time sim selling itself on visual and audio atmosphere.

They produce something that adds to the atmospheric surroundings and give every penny of your money to War Child.This is a special game written by special people.

'This War of Mine' puts you in moral dilemmas nearly every day. Do you help your neighbor who is scared of being attacked, even when you risk putting the rest of the group in harms way? Would you steal from someone who is begging you for help, because you're in even worse shape?

												This game is an extreme and emotional experience. In a world of war games in which the players are always the mass-murdering heroes and powerful war machines, this game throws the player into the vulnerable skins of civilians trapped in a war zone trying to survive.In a world of videogames plagued with fake moral choices and black & white consequences, This War of Mine pits the player against real moral choices that have a wide spectrum of consequences and effects on the survivors based on their personalities.The mechanics are simple yet engaging enough that it doesn't get overly repetitive or boring. The game forces the player think outside the box and find creative solutions that not always involve violence or obvious ""good"" choices either.I highly recommend this game if you are looking for a different experience and amazing art.If you are too sensitive though, this game can be emotionally draining.

												I went scavenging and found onions. A lot of onions. Then I chopped them all. It's the only reason why my eyes are wet, I swear.Seriously, at this point there are so many thousands of good reviews that you don't even need to read mine. I'm just writing one more positive review because ♥♥♥♥ damn, this game deserves the rating.While gameplay-wise there could be things to improve here or there, the art, the atmosphere, the story-telling, the hell-bent gruelling tension you're gonna spiral yourself in... They are all 10/10.This is not just a game, this is a whole experience.The only real con is not having an auto-save when you quit the game. It saves automatically every morning, which is rather annoying if something comes up and you want to do something else but it's late afternoon in-game. You need to either play the whole game night or lose the day's progress. Having an auto-save when you quit would also further prevent save-whoring.SPOILER ALERTAlso, I found the game a bit too short. 10 hours into it and I've finished it, that's it. I'm not sure about the replayability value either.I was ready for the situation to keep worsening and worsening, forcing me to make hard choices. I didn't even visit 1/2 of the scavenge locations. I was just finally starting to enjoy what I had built. And all the sudden, boom, war is over. What? Quite a bit anti-climatic for me, very disappointing.Edit: After trying to play it again a couple of other times, indeed I've foudn that replayability is limited. Some people are more keen to play it again, I found it to be a bit meh. Ymmv. Still 100% worth it though.			"

In Spec Ops, your actions have consequences because the designers made it that way. In This War of Mine, your actions have consequences because you made a poor choice.9/10 has an annoying habit of crashing when I tab out, wood only stacks to 2, it'd be pretty cool to craft one-time-use backpack slot upgrades that are lost if the caharacter dies. Unless you can and I just die before it gets that far. In which case, yeah, fix crash pls.EDIT: Having actually survived the war since writing this review, I have a few more complaints, most notably in the subject of stealth kills. With the delay between hitting the ""stealth kill from shadows"" button and your character actually finishing the animation to pop out of the shadows, the guy you're trying to kill has started walking up the stairs. And your character will follow him up the stairs, and because you can't stealth kill on stairs you'll get spotted and ♥♥♥♥ing murdered. Considering this is going to be your main form of offense in the entire game I was thinking it would be a bit more... polished.Also, the Following is Spoilers. So if you haven't managed to survive the war, stop reading. All good? Right. The game ends WAY too abruptly. I listen to the radio and it says that peace keeping troops are on the way. I figure I have to survive a few more days, and then suddenly I win. I was a bit... confused. 8/10 Could use a bit of tweaking for the stalth kills, namely let us kill dudes on stairs. Perhaps some kind of modding tools, to create new locations, items, even new survivors, or new game modes like ""How long can you survive."" Just spitballin.EDIT MK 2: Well now, look at what we got, tools to add custom characters and scenarios. that's like half my complaints addressed right there. Yes I know it's not half but it's damn cool. 9/10 Ya know what would make this game feel more realsitic? When you get attacked at night and fend off the attackers, if you get stuff from them, either off their corpses or as a ""I'll give you this just please don't kill me"" kinda thing. Would make surviving a lot easier, especially if there was a mode where the war just kept going and you tried to live as long as possible.			"

												Played it.  Lost first game on Day 33 at hour 7.  Things got desperate. Three nights in a row died while scavenging.  Fourth person died of cold (while depressed, hungry, and tired) in the interim. Picked the wrong places to visit looking for food.  Should have stolen from the old couple before cut off from that option.Loved the game.   Well done.  Few spots of tediousness and boredom, but it fit with the narrative.  Loved the game.			"

												Depressing, Violent, and surprisingly realistic, this War of Mine provides the exact gameplay it advertisises. Survivors can get depressed from stealing/killing civillians, bandits constantly raid your home, and in the winter, freezing to death is a real and devastating possibility. The realism concerning the survivors's mentaility is especially realistic. For example, one of my characters was killed in a hostile raid and when a woman later went up to our shelter to ask for help, the rest of my group yelled out the dead characters name and frantically attempted to open the door for the woman. I cannot recommend this game enough, the 20$ is well worth your money (and its worth even more if it goes on sale). "

												This War of Mine is really great and really worth playing, it has become one of my favourites! The game is about trying to make a team of civilian people to survive a civil war. You must lead them through a harsh cold climate, safeguard them from raiders and keep them healthy and well fed until the ceasefire. You must plan your actions carefully as to what and where you should scavenge each night, what you can afford to trade with, what you need to build and what equipment you need to get. There is also alot of moral decisions to choose, will you help those in need? Will you steal and commit murder to get what you need to survive? Will you let new people stay in your shelter or do you slam the door in their face?All this above creates a dark and depressing enviroment that can be replayed alot of times as you choose your team to start with and unlocks more once you've managed to survive with one team. Each team members has different background stories and feats. The map of scavenging locations also differs for every team and starting conditions.I think I have nothing negative to say about this game really. Maybe as with all games once you've completed all the content you might find it boring, but as it is right now there is alot of replayability that keeps you going for a long time. I think the developers will release new content to this masterpiece.			"

												This game invoked a lot of my feelings from the last few days. I had to spam a review for this else I will go mad from being unable to spread the word about them. Game play is decent (nice hiding-stabbing option instead of going mad with guns), music is suitable for the moments, and artwork (2D-scrolling and overall look) is really nice. *WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS*The breath-taking moments of running through flying bullets to help a father to his crying baby.The satisfaction of a stealth-ninja-with-axe clearing out trash that was proving why war sucks.The number of times I have to restart my game/day cause I thought that they couldn't see my so-called 'ninja'.The guilt of denying kids who were asking medicine for their sick mother because my own friend was sick.The anger of seeing my friend dying despite that I fed him all my medicine and herbal nonsense.The annoyance of seeing a friend going emo and moody because he couldn’t have a smoke. The rush-click to ensure that every frigging person was doing something to ensure the damned base does not come crashing down.Buying and playing this game; definitely one of my best decisions made in 2015.

Rank: 8/10Recommendation(s): Play a flash based survival game.Major Theme: Not your typical survival game.Bought at Price: $10.95It’s a survival game, but it’s not what you think. There are no zombies – for once! This War of Mine is just you and some other survivors who are living in an active war zone, trying to stay warm and survive until you can leave the city.I was able to beat the game on my first time touching the game, which I heard is not a typical experience. The game can prove to be a challenge, and will certainly test your morality. Is it ok to rat out your neighbour in exchange for food? Is it ok to steal from the defenceless? Are all humans really fit for survival?The art style is also unique, but don’t let the 2D platformer style fool you. The game does function very well for being played on platforms. Even some survivors will be able to navigate better than others will.Will you put hundreds of hours into the game? No, but you will certainly get your money’s worth.			"

												NOTE: For review with screenshots, please visit http://microfloppy.net/2016/07/02/this-war-of-mineThis weekend I’ve been playing This War of Mine, which is made by the Polish development company 11 bit studios. (And I here thought CDProject was the only big development studio in Poland!) With the gaming market overflowing with war games whose main objective is to shoot your way to victory, this one focuses on the victims of wars: The civilian who are stuck in the war zone with no way of getting out.This War of Mine is a strategy game with major RPG elements. The gameplay is divided into two major parts. During daytime, you stay with your group of 3-4 survivors. They have taken refuge in a house and you need to make sure they have the beds, heating, food, reinforcements, and other comforts they need. If they aren’t taken care of they will fall sick or depressed. You also need to make sure to pay attention to the radio so that you are updated on what is happening in the war, or if there is any other special precautions you need to take in order to survive…The most important part in this game is managing your resources. They are very limited and you will need to make some difficult decisions on where to spend them. I never had enough resources during my playthrough so there was a constant feeling of “just getting by” which really added to that desperate survival mood. There is quite an interesting crafting system connected to all of this and you will notice quickly that this is where the core of the gameplay is found.During nighttime, when darkness falls, you can send one survivor on an expedition to collect more resources. I loved how this part was made, as I had some very preconceived notions on how the game would work. I am seldom surprised by games and can usually predict what to expect but this was a refreshing exception. Without going into details; I thought my survivors would behave like CoD-players, meeting other CoD-players, fighting senselessly. But this was something different.In short, your gameplay depends on your own morale and level of desperation. This means that you can always find the kind of experience you are looking for. The important thing however is that you return before daylight, when the shooting starts again. This means you need to make quick decisions and be methodic during your expeditions.The people you meet during your trips are interesting, deadly, clever, caring. The AI is well made so if you decide to go out stealing you will find that you need brains to succeed – people are not stupid.In the end, I loved this game. It ticked all my boxes: Strategy resource management, house building sim, RPG, (moderately) scary exploration, scavenging for goods and living on what can be found, appealing design choices… There is a high chance I’ll play it again and it’s made so that you will want to: With each playthrough you can play with new survivors and go to different areas.There is also a newly-released expansion which I haven’t tried. (Titled ""This War of Mine: The Little Ones"". Watch the trailer, it’s gripping!)So in short: Everyone should play this game. It will make an impact.7/10 water filters "

												First off I would like to commend 11Bit studios on creating such a unique slant to the war - game genre, though I don't think this title can be or should be placed into said category, its more of a strategy title.This ‘game’ has thoroughly enthralled me over the better course of two weeks and find myself completing or ‘surviving’ over half of the 12 ‘missions’With that, I think that there are a few things lacking:Longevity - each ‘story’ is very similar, you can essentially do everything, interact with everything, and see everything with in two ‘stories’ on my 6th ‘story’ it turned into more of a grind to reach survival, and mashing end turn or ‘stay inside button' for day 42 through 45.Speed of AI - very slow, too much time is spent waiting for water to be distilled, counseling of characters that get ‘depressed’ characters going up/down ladders, characters completing tasks, ‘loading’ of the nights ‘events’ at the beginning of the next day is also slow, as well as the loading of each scavenging map, the fast forward button was created way back in the day by JVC, yet none available here.Too much repetition - really the only excitement and break in the monotony of scavenging resources is directing a character to shoot or backstab an unwitting NPC. Would be nice to have some add ons, another set of new ‘stories’ with new maps perhaps?Too little interaction with in world - Im starving but cant kill any little protein bags (rats) running around under my feet? (Other than setting traps in my building) I also can't scavenge a working TV for its parts? Or bring it back for morale boost.Glitches - If you make food at the stove, and leave it there ‘overnight’ you can not utilize the following day, it will show that there is ‘cooked’ food, but if you try to feed it to another character or use, it gets ‘stuck’ in a loop, and you will need to complete the day to progress and to ‘break’ the loop, if you build another stove that one will glitch as well, and you will not be able to cook any food.Garage glitch - (actually useful, but I don't think intended) If you manage to steal items from the ‘son’ and make it without getting killed, you can return the following day and the ‘son’ is not guarding the first room, he’s backed up into the fathers room. You are free to scavenge and remove multiple useful items. Booty gets restocked daily as long as son/father stays alive. If son dies, and father remains alive the third scavenging location inside of the basement ‘kitchen’ restocks daily.Church glitch - essentially same as above, remove items from scavenge area that Patrick is guarding, make it out alive, return the next day and Patrick is backed up into the second roomPatrick can also die, as long as the Father upstairs stays alive, the first scavenge point that Patrick was guarding restocks.Again, a very engaging experience, and great ‘darksy artsy’ feel overall, just needs to be expanded, perhaps different struggles as a civilian WW2, WW3? And why just survive getting your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you daily? How about the ability if you play your ‘cards’ right to thrive and build a community. A community with capabilities to expand into other areas of the neighborhood rebuilding the infrastructure as you go and having the ability to play beyond the 45th day, if you so desire			"

												So, I've been delaying this review (I have about 48 hours (not 60)) because honestly, I've been too wrapped up in playing the game itself. It's very heartbreaking at times how we have to refuse people food or medicine because we have to protect our own or we don't have what they need. I would usually try to avoid killing in this game, but lately, I've been taking out the thugs who abuse others in the game because A: it gives a moral boost and B. they have a lot of materials. It's really interesting how they designed the game such that you have no choice but to take a more novice way of doings things since you're dealing with civillians. I would suggest you get it if you're interested in learning about survival and food/time management, but it's not for everyone. If you try to take others out, you have to choose which ones who are actually hurting the other innocents or your people will be depressed. Also, you cannot just go guns blazing (limited bullets). You have to go really stealthy or have a lot of cover because it's not going to work out with just a knife or pistol with one bullet. No heatshots, Call of Duty Fans. So, just enjoy it for what it is. It is hell, essentially, but those who are willing to claw their ways through hell can be given a chance to live.			"

												If you enjoy survival games, this is one of a kind. Some say it is repetitive, and once you know some tricks it become easier to make it, that's true. But still the immersion is great and you'll be realizing a lot of things about what war looks like from a non-soldier point of view.However I got this annoying bug : when going to scavenge, if my backpack isn't empty I have to first open it before attempting to pick up material. If I forget to do that, the game crashes and I have to start again the entire day. Sometimes the game crashes when clicking on ""scavenge"" before the loading screen. And sometimes it crashes when Im first opening the backpack. (I would say these two lasts bugs are happening every 10-15 days).Im on ubuntu 16.04 using prime to run the game, I don't know if that is the cause.Once you now how to avoid this bug, the game is really enjoyable.

Your choices have direct and indirect concequences, the characters are very developed and the amount of story in game is actually unreal. The amount of time put into this game is very easy to see and easily sucks you into the world for hours. I will be playing this game for a very long time. PS: The amount of creative play room the players have in the workshop is amazing. Its lovely to see the designers are so supportive of indie mod creaters.			"

How many people do you have on guard? Who should scavenge from sniper junction and risk being shot? And who should get your last bandage. This tied in with your characters morality, whether they are okay with stealing, murdering and sending starving children away hungry, make the game challenging mentally and emotionally.

												This War of Mine provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. For the very first time you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city.  In the first few approaches the game seems to be difficult, we feel this hopeless war, but with every hour we learn more and more how it all works and what to focus on and then already it is hoped that it can survive. The game requires proper management of resources and good planning.It is the player's responsibility to maintain their characters' health, hunger and mood levels until the declaration of a ceasefire, which occurs after a randomized duration.During the daytime, hostile snipers will prevent the survivors from venturing outside, thereby offering the player time to craft tools from gathered materials, trade, upgrade the shelter, cook food and heal the survivors. At night, you are given the opportunity to venture out and scavenge nearby areas for valuable resources for their everyday survival. During the excursions, the survivors can encounter other NPC survivors of the war, who they can choose to help with gifts, or rob and kill.The scavenging phase plays out as a tense, atmospheric 2D stealth game. While some abandoned locations are looters' playgrounds, the war-torn city features a lot of other unsavory types. Soldiers and militia might be willing to trade with you or simply ignore you, but they can turn on you in a heartbeat. Other survivors might shoot you on sight. Rummaging through a pile of rubble sends sound waves far into the distance, alerting people to your presence. Get spotted in a place where you shouldn't be, and you'll have a choice: run, hide, fight, or die.			"

 This War of Mine makes you feel things. I remember playing on my very first save. My first three members were Katia, Pavle, and Bruno. Bruno was kind of selfish, but he was still an essential member. Katia and Pavle on the other hand, were my main priorities. I tried playing as passively as possible to keep everyone alive. I grew fond of them as days went by. Not much happens for the first two weeks or so. I go scavenging a lot, and I tried to keep everyone happy and well, so we could all survive. After Day 16, Katia becomes sad. I do whatever I can to help her become content. Pavle gets wounded due to a raid from last night. And Bruno's wounds become more severe. I could not afford any bandages.Food runs short.Everyone's very hungry.I trade everything I have for three cans of food.A few days later.Everyone's starving again.I have nothing.I go scavenging.Pavle is pale.Still don't have enough for much.Next day.Bruno helps a neighbor in need.He comes back.More scavenging.I find food.I return home.Pavle's dead.Everyone falls in to a state of depression.Next day.Katia is exhausted, but still scavenges.I go to the hospital.Turns out it works.I go home to tell Bruno.Except I can't.Bruno dies.Day 23.Katia is broken, is unable to move.She cries all day.Day 24.I didn't make it.We didn't make it.But sometimes, I make my own story with them.

The pensil like graphics are realy cool and imersive and the music, emotional and a bit subtile with a toutch of guitar realy got me, this game is a bit like FTL if you are playing the nice guy helping everybody you die, if you are that ruthless and agresive dude who atack everybody well your guys are gona feel bad and maybe even leave your group or suicide but if you find the harmony between theses 2 with a bit of luck you may be able to survive throught this hell.There are many ways to find the resources you need to survive in this game but you  need to mix some of them to survive. Theses ways are 1:scavenging recources in abandoned places2:help people and get rewarded2:Killing the people who did nothing to you or steal them3:Raid Bandit gangs or steal them but they stick in groups and usualy got guns4:atack millitary or rebels (probably a bad idea)5:trade with other groups,soldiers,bad guys or the cool dude that often visit you in daytime6:produce goods for exemple you can get moonshine from sugar and water by using an upgrade you can build in your home.usualy theses recources can help you to survive and do great trading itemsIf you ask me what is the better way i found to survive in this warzone i'll tell you to start off scavenging in safe zones and do your best to get somes good weapons in early game to be able to beat back the bandits that atack your home and to be able to Raid bandit camps. Tricks and advices-be sure to always have some food,meds,water and fuel beacause anything could happen.-closing the holes in your walls and consolidate your Front door is a priority to keep your people and what you need to survive in security.-before all holes are barricaded and your door is reinforced ALWAYS got someone on guard at night.-atacking old and poor to steal them isn't a good idea exept if you realy need recources.-if you find a bunch of suggar and water super early (before the merchand visit you for the 1st time) be sure to build a distillery to make some moonshine you can trade him for tons of usefull stuff (the merchand can wait a long time so you got all reason to get that moonshine.-most people wont wait forever at your door,helping them is sometime risky but can give great reward from some scrap to food and meds or even a gun.-scout your surounding and try to see how many your enemies are before engaging in a fight.- play low dont ram a door or you could meet face to face with a loaded gun.-sometimes beeing more in a group doesn't mean surviving will be easier.

												Emotive, powerful and compelling. Just a handful of the words I would use to describe this master piece of a game. In 'This War of Mine' you take control of a group of survivors in the midst of a civil war in the ficticous city of Pogoren, and the conflict itself is loosely based on the Yugoslavian Wars fought in the 1990's. The gameplay is anything but bland. You can choose to deck out your base with all manner of things, from advanced heating units to Moonshine distilleries. At night, you send out one survivor to scavenge among the ruins of Pogoren for food, medicine and building supplies. Morality features quite heavily in this game, for example; robbing a hospital or weak elderly survivors will result in your survivors having bouts of depression and refusing to do anything, but at the same time, your hand may be forced as your survivors could be very sick or injured. This War of Mine really makes you think about what is right, and how far you will go to save your own.			"

												Let me start out by saying at first I didn't care for this game very much.  I thought it was a neat idea, showing the terrible side of war.  It didn't really click with me until 6 hours in.  Two out of the three characters ended up getting in a fight.  Both were badly wounded.  I went ahead and sent one of them out to try to get medical supplies because I sent the third out to help get some supplies from a drop.  I had the one that was injured during the fight to sleep in bed all night.  I end up getting the one killed scavenging for medical supplies.  The one that was badly injured died during the night.  The third got back with a drop with much needed supplies.  But because the two died she got severly depressed.  When she was depressed she wouldn't get up or do anything.  During this time someone came to the door, it was a woman looking for a place to stay.  I knew that if I could get my third survivor to get up and get the door she would have a fighting chance....... She just sat there on the ground.  I pleaded with her ""Get up, go get the door!"" But she just sat there.  So as the clock kept counting up to 8:00 pm I just watched and pleaded.  Then the woman at the door left.  I was devastated.  The timer finally hit 8:00 pm and then the new day started.  My third member ended up committing suicide during the night.  It brought tears to my eyes.  That is when this game clicked for me and I think it is one of the most engrossing games out there.			"

												I feel like this is somewhat of a sleeper game that flew under the radar for a lot of people and for that reason I am writing a review. This War of Mine is an absolute gem and a game that deserves attention for exploring a part of war that is hardly ever seen. When playing triple A titles like Call of Duty or Battlefield or any other fast paced FPS I always noticed how there were never civilians around and rather than the cities or locales we were fighting through looking lived in, they looked like set piece ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t with conveniently placed cover. This War of Mine puts you in the shoes of a civilian with one simple goal: survive! You and a few survivors (usually between three and five from a roster of about ten or twelve) are put in a house and need to do whatever you can to survive. During the day you can scavenge around your house or build upgardes such as weapons, stove, animal traps, rain catchers, beds and even a guitar. During the night time you must pick one person to venture out into one of the locations where supplies must be scavenged. Early in the game you only need a lockpick or two to search for cigarettes, food, and building supplies. Yet as you start to exhuast supplies you must venture into areas where other people are living, usually armed and dangerous. It becomes a balancing act by ensuring the survival of your group and trying to navigate the tough moral implications of you stealing supplies from other or in extreme situations killing them.It is a tough game and you must be prepared for members of your group to suffer quite a bit as the strain of trying to live in a warzone takes its toll. It is a visceral and somewhat brutal take on a facet of war that is seldom explored. It is definitely worth a try to see if you can last in This War of Mine.			"

												Though this game is fun and creative, the medecine doesn't make any sense. First of all, just because its cold doesn't mean anyone is going to get sick. The game forgets this simple medical fact and its annoying. Also, how the hell are pills gonna cure a fever? They only make you feel better they don't actually help the fever go away. Anti-biotics kill bacteria but because viris's aren't alive you can't kill them with anti-biotics. Btw people get sick during the winter because they stay in more due to the cold. When they stay in the viris's spread more efficiently. Accept for that the game is wonderful. The graphics are nice, the gameplay is fun, and all the other cool stuff.			"

												This game is an extreme and emotional experience. In a world of war games in which the players are always the mass-murdering heroes and powerful war machines, this game throws the player into the vulnerable skins of civilians trapped in a war zone trying to survive.In a world of videogames plagued with fake moral choices and black & white consequences, This War of Mine pits the player against real moral choices that have a wide spectrum of consequences and effects on the survivors based on their personalities.The mechanics are simple yet engaging enough that it doesn't get overly repetitive or boring. The game forces the player think outside the box and find creative solutions that not always involve violence or obvious ""good"" choices either.I highly recommend this game if you are looking for a different experience and amazing art.If you are too sensitive though, this game can be emotionally draining.

												This War Of Mine is a depressing game. Two people got really depressed when Pavle stole food from a family and left none so they would probably all starve to death.Then Pavle died after getting caught stealing.The girl, Katia, who was sad about Pavle stealing food became uber depressed because he died and was going to kill herself.Bruno talked Katia out of suicide and let her sleep for a few days while he went out scavenging.A women named Emilia had shown up at their door asking if she could stay there.They took her into their home.Emilia went out scavenging that night and never returned after getting shot to death.Kalia who was super depressed said ""I'll never forgive her killers!"" and went to fight them the next night and killed everyone asociated with her death.Bruno became scared of her and started drinking what he booze he could find.Bruno slept off his hangover and went out to trade for some more supplies, but was murdered after a misunderstanding.Katia, very injured from the people she had killed was now alone and bed-ridden to heal her wounds.That night the house was robbed, and Katia was murdered.The survivors of that household are now all dead.Game is 10/10 depressing would buy and would recommend			"

												this game is something of its own kind. you may want to try avoiding action and sneakin is hard, nearly impossible. it puts you in the possition where alot of what you do are morally right and wrong.to begin with, you start off with 3 characters who got diffrent set of traint and weakness. one is a looter and can carry more stuff during raids, while 1 is a cook and can make better food. one is a smoker... i honestly never saw the downside of that except from hearing him complaining about being out of cigarets, but as long as i playd, he never had a downside of quiting.you will get more character along the way, but that is after a few days, where they will come knocking on your door, litteraly. random events will take place, either its ""neighboors"" knocking on your door or someone raiding your home while youre out scavenging for materials or food.its no zombie apocalypse, but what makes it dangerous to go out, is the war. snipers on the roof is what keeps your characters in doors during the day. having an overview on the war is always nice, this is where crafting will come in handy. you start with a rundown house that you gotta clear up and make as secure as you can. making a radio to stay known about the war is a good start. be sure to make a bed too, as your character will get tired or less sleep from sleeping on the cold floor.it puts the tone for the game really well and i would give a better review if i only could. but i didnt manage to get that far, so im still trying to learn the full strategy of the game, but i am able to tell, that this game is worth 7/10. its above average. its something i would play on my laptop traveling around or on my job. its not too big, but its more up to you if you are able to put the mood right for it. its worth playing the game, and its worth paying full price. the only downsides i encounter is the lack of sneaking and the difficulty in ecountering in combat. but i think that was intentional, increesing the difficulity.

												„In war… not everyone is a soldier.“ In this brilliant game where you play with randomly chosen characters and the amount can differ. I started with three, once with four people. They all are civilians and no “up to the teeth armed soldiers”. There is an old man, a cook, a European football player, a principle, a music student and so on. At the beginning you start in you shelter, search for parts, medicine and food, build a bed a  place to cook, maybe your first tool and recognize that you need much more and to prepare it against looters.It’s too dangerous to go outside by day in cause of snipers and soldiers  / rebels so you decide to prepare for the night. Who is going to scavenge, who is hurt or ill and should sleep, who shall guard? When you scavenge you have to chose wisely what you will carry with you. Everything will block space in your backpack, otherwise a shovel or a crowbar can become very handy. Sometimes I could be that you met other people, rebels who want to kill you, other harmless people who become aggressive only if you try to steal from them. Everything you do will have consequences. Will you really rob an old couple if they are defenseless? What will the other people of your group think about if you kill someone just for the loot? Will you get food and medicine at all price? Can you trust everyone in your group? Neighbors knocking at your, needing your help or your medicine. Are you willing to spare them?I highly recommend this game, it’s a game about war from a completely different view and full of difficult decisions. The game is not very easy, contains permadeath and only autosaves every new morning, but I survived the war and going to play again, hopefully can make other decisions and not making the same mistakes again to get out of the war still as a human being and not a monster.

												If you are a fan of any variety of survival or even stealth games for that matter, This War of Mine offers an in-depth look into the struggles of regular civilians in a fictional civil-war, with some very realisitic topics and ethical issues encountered throughout your journey, either it be through having to force your way through an old granny's house in order to get a can of food, or by murdering innocent lives in a hospital to get the medicine your dying friend requires.Tough, Gritty, but all round 'fun', if you could put it like that.

												>Desperately need supplies in order to survive>Decide to break into the home of an elderly couple and their son>There is no difference between what's right and what's necessary>Break in, avoid everyone, and steal a few things>See ladder to basement>Get greedy>Head down>In the middle of rummaging their son comes down the ladder>Pull out knife>He pulls a gun>Get killed in the ensuing scuffleAs much as I praise Spec Ops: The Line, This War of Mine does one thing that it doesn't: Presents the player with choice, not the illusion of choice. In Spec Ops, your actions have consequences because the designers made it that way. In This War of Mine, your actions have consequences because you made a poor choice.9/10 has an annoying habit of crashing when I tab out, wood only stacks to 2, it'd be pretty cool to craft one-time-use backpack slot upgrades that are lost if the caharacter dies. Unless you can and I just die before it gets that far. In which case, yeah, fix crash pls.EDIT: Having actually survived the war since writing this review, I have a few more complaints, most notably in the subject of stealth kills. With the delay between hitting the ""stealth kill from shadows"" button and your character actually finishing the animation to pop out of the shadows, the guy you're trying to kill has started walking up the stairs. And your character will follow him up the stairs, and because you can't stealth kill on stairs you'll get spotted and ♥♥♥♥ing murdered. Considering this is going to be your main form of offense in the entire game I was thinking it would be a bit more... polished.Also, the Following is Spoilers. So if you haven't managed to survive the war, stop reading. All good? Right. The game ends WAY too abruptly. I listen to the radio and it says that peace keeping troops are on the way. I figure I have to survive a few more days, and then suddenly I win. I was a bit... confused. 8/10 Could use a bit of tweaking for the stalth kills, namely let us kill dudes on stairs. Perhaps some kind of modding tools, to create new locations, items, even new survivors, or new game modes like ""How long can you survive."" Just spitballin.EDIT MK 2: Well now, look at what we got, tools to add custom characters and scenarios. that's like half my complaints addressed right there. Yes I know it's not half but it's damn cool. 9/10 Ya know what would make this game feel more realsitic? When you get attacked at night and fend off the attackers, if you get stuff from them, either off their corpses or as a ""I'll give you this just please don't kill me"" kinda thing. Would make surviving a lot easier, especially if there was a mode where the war just kept going and you tried to live as long as possible.			"

												Well. Can i recommend this product? Yes and no. Purely seen as a game and judged as a game? No, rather not.But seen as more than that? Yes! Absolutly yes!This game offers an unusual perspective as not beeing about the soldiers, but about the civilians in an conflict. Struggling to stay alive, healthy and sane.This game has hit me in the face, as i was trying to play it like ""any other game"". Showing me the negative fallout and the consequences of things i decided my survivors should do, while equally showing me the sheer helplessness and the fear of uncertain future events in an desperate situation. If you play a game ""just for the lols"" don't get this one, it wont suit you. If you play a game to experience something new, something touching or at least something to remember, then this game is definitly the right thing for you!Oh and one last thing. DON'T use any spoilers, helptools, wikis or whatsoever. Try to wrap your head around everything yourself. And thats especially true for the ingame events to come, the things to unfold. They will suddently give you new challanges and some might be quite harsh....			"

												Another excellent game in my opinion. I love the simplicity behind it. So you have to survive in a war for 40 some odd days.   You can choose to be a raider/killer, or trade for what you need. So many choices. Simple yet effective. Click once to walk, Click twice to run. You want to chop something in half (for wood) it gives the selection and ability to. Need to build something? Crafting table or weapons table.I also like the limited colors.. dont get me wrong graphics are a big deal but in return you have a GREAT storyline that you basically are the one who makes the outcome. Do you survive, do you not survive.What I would like to see : Create a character .. more inventory .. but less speed.. or select their outfits or their positive/negative traits. More detail to the food supply. TRUE you have a refrigerator, but chances are you have no electricity.. so food spoils after a certain amount of time.Create a mission : Basically choose your team, choose your location, choose the difficulty.Overall alot of work has been done since this game has come out. I highly recommend the game and will recommend the game to friends. Keep up the great work. H/N Kinsha rates this game 4.5 out of 5 cookies. (just so there is room for growth)			"

												Bought it on sale and tried it out because I was bored.day 3 - food is low, I go to an old school to scavenge for supplies, I run into a sleeping hobo, in a panic I stab him in his sleep because I dont want him to murder me, I continue on and find another hobo, I panic thinking he saw me kill the first hobo and kill him too. my character is now depressed and the hobos had nothing good on them. day 6 - I've been out of food for a few days now and I'm worried my people will starve. I have one last meal and I'm stuck deciding who to give it too, I give it to the depressed guy to cheer him up. I go out to scavenge a supermarket. a group of scavengers are already there. I stand awkwardly at the entrance as a man with a gun walks out. I am fully prepared to make a break for it when he starts shooting. he tells me there is enough supplies for the both of us. I thank god for human decency and manage to find enough food and supplies to last us a couple days.day 8 - A trader comes to my door. I give him all my booze and tradables and I am now a king among men. I upgrade 1 thing. I am now poor as hell. I send pavle out to a church to get more supplies. pavle gets shot and dies... I cry and turn off the game.10/10 would watch pavle get shot again.			"

												'Do you recommend this game?' YES! This game is great and it may not be your typical 'shoot them up' game and get as much attention as them but it is just great. The way it keeps you anticipated and makes you a nervous wreck is saying something. With other survivors around you and you possibly having to steal or kill them just to get along is alot. You may be thinking I don't care anout other survivors... Thats what I thought but you know, they don't all get angry and pull out machine guns and spray you down. For example I may or may not have battered a woman for no reason other than the fact that my man for some reason randomly ran into the house and got her attention. But she did try to fight me off and when realised she was losing ran to her companion upstairs, (most likely her bf due to she was female and he male) he then came down with her and for a walked around the house together. Then he told her to wait inside and he just went to check outside, I took my chance to finish her off and it made me feel kind off like laughing (hope I'm not a physco) but also sad because before she died she whispered 'please no.' This made it obvious she was just a survivor as she said this in our first encounter, when I broke into the house, so I kind of felt like I was robbing relatives almost or a friend I knew, but in this war ridden town you have to do what you have to do, right? Obviously since I can say so much about one encounter I've had shows it's a emotional game, that does not meen it's some love fantasy game or any of that crap. It's a serious game with a depressing edge to it. I find the best comparison is real life, you always have happy moments in wars but it's also a very unhappy place and most likely dangerous if you're in the centre of it. It's like stalingrad, destroyed and not much supplies to go around (In WWII obviously.) I feel like I bought this game 5 mins ago and I'm looking at how long I've played it for: 4.2 hrs last two weeks / 4.2 hrs on record. I only just bought this game and I've fell in love with it. If you like the sound of this game please check it out on youtube or other reviews don't just take my word for it. But please give this game a chance because it obviously hasn't got the same publicity as other games but I feel it really, really deserves it. Great game. (My grammar, punctuation and spelling may not be the best but it doesn't matter, right?)			"

												Quite Good game, but I have some problem, though. I tried to rob military base with my character, I killed the soldiers quietly one by one. And then last I tried to hide my character in the darkness, I clicked like 300 times. But My character got stuck on the map. Doesn't receive my order, and got shot by the last soldier. I don't know why this happens. I remeber at the last version of the game, I got really good memory and impression.. After the Update, I have a problem with reaction rate at character especially killing people. But still, this is a good game, reminds me of War's harshness. There was a war at Ukraine, and still going on. I feel bad for people who died there. R.I.P.			"

												Incredibly good. Bought on sale based only on user likes. So I wasn't expecting much.This is the kind of game that takes you out of your comfort zone. It is a memorable experience.You can't save the game to ""try something out"". You just can't.(Obviously when you leave the game, you can come back to the same day as you left).And it is a hard game. So ... what happens when you have a hard game with no saving? Something near to life. So don't try it out If you just play games to have fun. This game is a life experience. Not exactly funny one.I'm very experienced with management games, but I resorted on saving all the time, to get a 'perfect' management. In this game you HAVE to risk one of your characters, and that's a feeling I didn't have for years. Fear!When you have a ""save game"" option, you don't fear much, or at all.So, in short, this game brings this intense experience. Specially fear of making bad decisions and having to live with it. In other games, if one character died, I loaded the previous save game instantly. I just could not live with that 'mistake'. Here you would begin a new story. And that's a lot of time. So I had to live with some losses. That was quite an xp for me  =)Also the game is very well polished. No bugs, nothing annoying. If I was the QA guy, I would have nothing to suggest. "

												This War of Mine is one of those games that just grips you tightly in its cold, desperate fingers and refuses to let go.Nevermind food, water or taking a rest - your survivors need you.The emotional pull of the game just kept my attention for the entirety of my play-throughs.You think about the impact of every action, even positive ones like giving medicine to others who need it.Should you have kept it for yourself? Would my survivor perhaps have been saved if we had stockpiled bandages?At this point in time, I've played 20 hours of TWOM in the span of two days.Each and every hour was deathly boring, yet somehow kept me going through it.The interface is as simple as it gets; just point and click whatever you want to do.The experience of playing it...that's where the kick in the gut comes.Every action my survivors take.Every injury. Every illness.Every theft, robbery and murder.Was I right?Was it justified?Did I need those supplies more than them?Really?This is the kind of game that keeps me up at night, lying sleepless in my bed as I think about what I've done and who I've done them to.9/10 would get depressed again.(But will need to take a break...maybe a week before starting a new story.)

												I have watched pavle get killed while scavenging for food, Bruno die from severe wounds and no bandages to treat him, and Katia committing suicide. This game is heartbreaking, difficult and cruel. I absolutely love it. I will criticize the extreme depression one of my characters experienced, not from killing a whole crew of evil deranged criminals, but from 'stealing' or rather taking what was left of their supply in their territory after they were all killed. There was no remorse for killing them but taking their things after they were dead was apparently too cruel for them. I kept hitting my forehead each time I went back to collect some more things. It was ridiculous. Nontheless, it is a very interesting game and I do really enjoy the concept so I will have to recommend it and hope that we see more games like it.			"

												Man, this game is depressing, but in a good way - if that's possible.  In a market flooded with violent shoot-em-ups which glorify war and massacre, it's good to have a game that highlights the awful reality of conflict.  It's like a wake-up call to those of us who think blood and gore is so much fun.  After all, what harm can a violent video game cause, right?  Desensitisation, that's what.Full of life-threatening decisions, despair, and bleak hope, this game really hits the emotions.  I never thought I'd see a game that so unashamedly exposes the true horror of war.  It really hits you hard when you see your people starving, or dying of their wounds.  The most thought-provoking game I've ever known of.A brave move by the game studio as well.  It would have been all too easy to produce another tired cliche of a war game, but they've taken things in another direction.  This truly is survival horror.  There are no zombies, or monsters to worry about here.  Just the most dangerous beast of them all - mankind.If you want a gritty game that's not afraid to really put you in the thick of things, you can do no better than this.  This remarkable game touches you, haunts you, and makes you think.  Now tell me, how many other games can boast that?Despite it's depressive nature, you'll want to play this again and again.  I know I'll be back for another run-through as soon as I've cheered myself up a little.  You find yourself really caring what happens to your group of survivors, finding it gut-wrenching when something bad happens.  It's like losing your best friend,   When my first character died, I really felt down.  When they all died, I felt so sad I could have cried.The game market is full of half-realised titles that simply don't deliver the goods.  This does in a way you'll not easily forget.  It's great to see someone put thoughts like this into the common person's head.  Only when we truly realise the disgrace of war that we'll want it to stop.Can't recommend highly enough.  Just play it!			"

												A brutal view of what it's like to be caught up in a war zone. With well designed mechancis always putting you on the edge starvation, depression and sickness it's challening and dramatic. You must consider both psychological and physical needs and learn that sometimes one is more important then the other.Surrounded by danger it does the opposite of glorifying war a modern handling a senstiive issue exqiuisitly.So yeah, it's okay i guess.

Although, I may had to do some awful things along the way... I guess that is the point of the game. Some of things may have been more of a grey area, but this game forces you to define your boundry between good and evil. Then push it.How far are you willing to go to survive, and to save your friends and families? How much human suffering will you inflict so that you can live?			"

												Playing for the first time makes you really sad on how the survivors have it really bad and because you are the one that needs to take care of them makes it feel even worse considering it's in your hands to make decisions in their lives. Making a mistake or having someone break through depression is just heartbreaking.With lots of game time and research (I've been playing this game ever since I got it - 44 hours now) you can get used to the game and see through everything. Some starts are terrible, others are out of control and can just lead you into victory. Enjoyable game and I do recommend buying the War Child Charity DLC in order to help out the organization the created this amazing game. 9.7/10			"

The thing I love the most about it, is the fact that there are no quests, but you make them yourself, like, I didn't have to bring tons of meds and bandages to the hospital to aid people, but I did it because I felt I should do it. Even though I gain nothing of doing so.Really stellar game, good athmosphere, you get sucked into the world straight away, and you are going to feel sad when you kill somebody, and then read about what they were doing there (I killed many good folks).

												This game oozes in quality and art. It is absolutely beautiful and depressing, which most games now a days can't pull off. This game is a HUGE refreshment from your everday CoD, but instead places you on the other end of the war. The game is gritty, hardcore, and unforgiving. But it is absolutely stunning and breathtaking. For the first time I actually CARED about my people, and was sad when a few died. But that is war, and this game ISN'T forgiving. Sure, there are some miniscule flaws, but in all reality, do you expect ANYTHING to be perfect? This game is the best I have ever played, outranking any genre, any intensity, any sort of content. No tutorial? Guess what, they wouldn't know where to begin either, it's not like your survivors have a book titled, ""How to survive a civil war"", like most games do. This game without a tutorial probably makes it better than if it DID have a tutorial, because it throws you into this scenario. You weren't prepared for it, your survivors weren't prepared for it, but that's life, and that's war.I adore this game and I recommend it to ALL of my friends and EVERYONE out there who wants a change of pace from your boring zombie or CoD games, this game offers survival, and even a little bit of gunplay, but all fresh and unique to satisfy EVERYONE'S interest. Seriously. Get. This. Game.			"

												On my first try my group started starving on day 9 so I decided to steal some food from an elderly couple. Unfortunately that ended up with me killing the grandpa with a crowbar. My group got depressed so I tried to cheer them up with some moonshine. While they were drunk raiders came by and stole the last vegetable piece that I had. In the morning a little kid came for help and I had to decline him because I didn't have any medicine and my group was hangover. I felt quite terrible for the event unfolding before me and then I saw it - really, the most emotional game and ""real"" game in a while. It's not fun - it's realistic, dramatic, hard and keeps my breath while I'm playing. It got me determined not to stop until I beat the game. Not for me, but for the little kids from Pogoren. Currently on day 29, things looking bright, hoping to beat the game...f**k the war			"

												One of the most original survival games I have ever played. Some people doesn't want it because it isn't fps or 3rd person but I think that the game is much more better and original this way. It is based on a true event so it makes it even more creepier. I sincerely liked the characters and the story in this game, it is really detailed yet I hoped to see a bigger wolrd and more varitaions also it kinda felt weird to not be allowed to get out of your house if it isn't night yet that is just a minor problem. I hope the game would have a sequal or have new features like; co-op, bigger map or a more detailed story. Expect that it was really fun playing it. I am in day 42 and I still hope there might be a ceasefire soon...at least I hope...			"

												If you have even the slightest interest in playing a game that veers itself off from the usual ""rambo"" style gameplay and narrative then I will highly recommend that you get this game. Not many games out there that can or are willing to capture the extremely horrifying and depressing nature of wars like This War of Mine does. The game also does a great job of making you care and feel for the characters, especially those in your group. I still remember the sinking feeling when my group suffered  their first casualties due to a scavaging trip gone wrong and that was enough to put me off for a short while before I decided to continue on with the game and completed my play through. This is one of the best indie games that I've played and I can't wait to see what the developers come up with next.			"

												A brutal view of what it's like to be caught up in a war zone. With well designed mechancis always putting you on the edge starvation, depression and sickness it's challening and dramatic. You must consider both psychological and physical needs and learn that sometimes one is more important then the other.Surrounded by danger it does the opposite of glorifying war a modern handling a senstiive issue exqiuisitly.So yeah, it's okay i guess.

												The only three things I can say against it are.1. Bad clicking system. If I want to knife somebody from a hiding place, you have to click on the big knife Icon... I did, and I stepped out of cover only to get shot in the face... multiple times...2. Hard. This is a really hard game if you are looking for causual play, It is fun, just hard to get used to and master.3. Anton.... He just isnt useful at all... Sorry Anton.. You just suck at life.. I would kill you if everyone else wouldnt get depressed about it.Everything else is amazing though. The art style, the emotional connection. Great game overall!!!!			"

												Playing for the first time makes you really sad on how the survivors have it really bad and because you are the one that needs to take care of them makes it feel even worse considering it's in your hands to make decisions in their lives. Making a mistake or having someone break through depression is just heartbreaking.With lots of game time and research (I've been playing this game ever since I got it - 44 hours now) you can get used to the game and see through everything. Some starts are terrible, others are out of control and can just lead you into victory. Enjoyable game and I do recommend buying the War Child Charity DLC in order to help out the organization the created this amazing game. 9.7/10			"

												This is my first-ever review. I normally don’t use my time to talk about games, but I had to do it because this game is great and I think that everybody should play it.Story – Excellent, very well developed, the texts are short (for the people who doesn’t like to read too much). This game really tells a great human Story. Characters – Good characters, it’s easy to get emotionally attached to them, you really don’t want them to die or suffer.Sound – Great environment sounds: dogs barking, screams, people crying, gunshots, car engines and explosions. It really helps with the immersion.Music – Not many, but good. The soundtrack is very atmospheric.Strategy – Well balanced strategy game, not too many options and not too little. It has an addictive (in a good way) gameplay. It’s hard to stop playing. Crafting – Many objects to craft.  It’s a well developed crafting system.Trade system – There is no money in this game; you have to negotiate and trade your items. It’s fun trying to get the best deals. It demands strategy too.Graphics  – Good graphics for an indie game. They use this gray color pallet that fits very well with the sad war theme of the game. The art is excellent.Game time – I finished the game in 15hs. The total time of the game is programmed to be random (you never know when the war will be over). I believe that you can play from some weeks to months (in game days). Replayability – You can start the game in a different house, with other characters, in the summer or winter, with many other places to go and distinct loot. So the replay value of this game is nice.Combat – Is simplified because you play as a survivor, not a soldier. It’s always tense since is really easy to die in this game. The stealth approach works far better than fighting.“This War of Mine” is one of the best survival games I ever played. It can be a little bit tedious sometimes if you are not used to this kind of game but if you like this genre is a must buy.			"

												Ok, I've changed this review to ""recommend"" because I had an issue with the price but seeing the hours I'm getting out of it, I no longer have an issue with it. Though as I stated below my main issue now is that the pace is too fast for the way I prefer to play. A simple ""easy"" setting which would slow the clock down would fix this.What I do like about it:1) It's a survival game.2) The tech is sort of interesting, though odd in places i.e moonshine maker.3) The animations are good.4) Deeper than your average game and makes you think about the choices you make.5) Very original and well thought out.What I don't like about it:1) Forces you to play at the pace the game developers want with a very annoying clock/countdown timer. No relaxing game session, unfortunately. Also makes for unrealistic sprinting everywhere in the ""house"" for your characters. ""I'm tired""..sprint to bed.2) The characters whine and complain a lot. Would this be realistic given the circumstances? Maybe...maybe not.3) No difficulty level. This could be implemented by slowing down the countdown-clock on easy, for example.4) No saving. If you leave, the day starts over. Would be nice if they explained this somewhere.5) Combat is...automatic. No need to even point-and-click.  Except for the gun-fights. It's also hard to just run away while engaged in combat.7) Doesn't give you enough time to build all the tech.8) Can't enjoy the fruits of your labour as you're rushing everything and everywhere because of the annoying countdown-timer on the top left.If it was half the price I paid for it, I'd probably recommend it but at £14.99? No. You can get far better games for that. If you want to try it I would suggest waiting until it's discounted.			"

												When I read other reviews of how you can actually feel the pain of the characters and how hard it actually is I did not believe it. But when I got to play it, makes me wish war would never happen anywhere. It is gruesome and every day a struggle. Had a few days where everyone could relax and had abundunt supply of food but than slowly people left and died.  The old man tried getting bandages to fix up his friend but died by an ak47. The last guy to die was the chef. He got killed by rebels and nobody could have saved the poor soul. Great game really fun!			"

Ended up getting to day 41 which is when I 'Survived the war' and the game came to a hault... It's very disappointing that you can't play a survival mode where you can just see how long you can last as I would like to continue building and upgrading my house/characters. Either way, this game will get your heart racing and will challenge your genuine approach about living in the life and environmen of war.			"

												Fifty hours in, the best way I can describe ""This War of Mine"" is that it is Excruciatingly Beautiful. Without a doubt, this seemingly simple 2D side-scroller has captivated not only my mind, but my heart as well.The player is immediately thrust into a searingly bleak landscape in which choices must be made that effect, not only the characters in the game, but the player herself. The beautifully pencil-swept landscapes foster a sense of abstraction while the character models and interior enviornments lend clarity of purpose and direction, be it towards the dark or the light, as the player struggles to find their way through a war-torn appoccalypse.The combat is (intentionally?) difficult, for in this world, you are not some super soldier; you are only a person. And that is what speaks most directly to the gamer as they experience ""This War of Mine"". The first time I decided I had to kill in order to survive, I was terrified. And, it didn't end well. Marko's sacrifice eventually led to the downfall of my entire group and it was a miserable experience. An experience I shall never forget.The User Interface in this game seems a bit wonky at first, at least it did to me. Once you've mastered the UI, however, you become master of your fate and that is something I like in a game. It becomes a question of not ""can I kill this person"" but, rather: ""should I kill this person?"" And that is the target the developers were going for, as far as I can tell.I cannot remember the last time a video game made me question myself in such a profound way. Things like that are usually reserved for the cinema or found in books, I suppose. But as it stands, ""This War of Mine"" is a deeply moving and enjoyable game that should not be missed by anyone. "

												The only game to ever make me regret or feel sorrowful for the decisions I made. I loved and dreaded every minute of it. I loved the game itself and I spent the whole time planning and wondering what my next move would be. I hate loved how it made me so upset at times and put me through so much stress, but it was a great experience. I survived for 45 days on my first attempt making it through the war. My first four died, three to a combat system I wasn't entirely prepared for and one to a silly misclick. But my last four survived, those final days were the most stressful as I had to balance the food and ended it with 3 being very hungry and 1 starving!! In the end I will always find playability and I won't lie and say I didn't tear up a bit at the end when it reminded me of all my actions and those who had passed. Retelling the story and then giving me what happened to those who lived.TL:DR Buy this ♥♥♥♥ing game if you want an emotional and phsycological trip into one of those most real games I've ever played.

												A good game with a few disappointing limitations (Only being able to scavenge one area at a time during the night phase, just some minor things IMO), but over all a very well made game. Any and every decision you make will make or break your little ragtag team of survivors. From managing your building materials to deciding which area to scavenge from at night if you make even the most minut mistake it could cost you dearly. This game is anything but easy and you should expect multiple restarts. I'm not very good at reviews other than saying Yay or Nay so I'll make it simple and say Yay. 8/10Oh and you can't save....

												I bought This War of Mine just a day ago and I spent 13 hours of gameplay already. Had 3 playthroughs. The first two I had to quit it since I lost hope after stupid descisions and on the third one. I finished it. However, the game made me think about how I survived the war. It would bug your conscience. For instance, at one point, I had no more food. The quiet house with elders was my only option since choosing between it and lootin locations with bandits without any protection or proper equipment and risk my suvs lives, I would choose where I would survive. So I stole from them, they didn't even fight, thy just pleaded me to stop. A few days later, they died on their bed. I really took a hit, but my killing didn't stop there. One time, I was in the small apartment, I accidentaly crowbar-ed a door. I had a shotgun and a hatchet. A guy came running to me with a shotgun so I shot him first. The other companions of his ran to his body, worried. Marko got killed there. Then I went back two more times to finish everyone. It was a desicion I didn't want. They were not hostile to me, they were also a group of survivors who cared each other. In the end, this game would show us the reality of war. Coming here as a player who logged almost 300 hours in Battlefield 3. This game showed what happens behind the fighting. It isn't all about the soldiers, it is about the people being affected by the war because they suffer more.  "

												A supremely atmospheric and emotionally daunting experience. After playing more than once in a single sitting I felt emotionally exhausted, much like the characters in the game. The decision to hurt others for your gain is especially impactful when you see the character deal with the aftermath of their actions. Not to mention the other survivors opinions on what you did, I won't soon forget coming back to the house and reeling as Pavle sat dead still after his actions during the nights scavenge. Do yourself a favour and spend the money to support the studio. They've done an excellent job with this title and I'll be damn sure to reccommend it to my friends.			"

												This game is everything described and more. I will say it's not nearly as emotionally provoking as people keep claiming. At the end of the day, it's just a game. That said, there are certain points that tug a little at the heart. Like the crying baby behind the locked door that you just can't get to no matter how hard you try. If I had to pick something about this game I don't like it's the limited bag space/limited item stacks/massive amounts of materials for simple objects conundrum. I find myself skipping entire days just so I can send my one guy with 12 bag spaces back to the same house over and over to collect all the wood (that only piles in stacks of 2) that was available. It's realistic, I guess, but given that it takes a lot of wood to create each item, you'd think they'd be a bit more generous on the stacks.Overall, I have to say I really enjoy this game. My personal best is 14 days before someone died. My next goal is to last 20 days.			"

												I will play this game again. I just need time to recover.I found myself engrossed in the storyline and in my survivors. Bruno the crazy good chef who fed the entire group throughout the experience. Boris who scavenged every night for supplies until he was gunned down by bandits. Marko before him who crossed the wrong person and was also shot. Pavle, Emelia... it is important to note that I can name them off by name. Not because there are so few of them... but because I felt connected to each of them. The survivors and the neighbors. The times that I had to make very immorale choices in order to survive. Checking (no, more like clinging) to the radio... every day... waiting for news.This game is very compelling, very involved and very interesting. If you let yourself get immersed within the gameplay, you will find yourself in a similar situation. Extremely high regards for this game in both art direction, music direction, gameplay design, etc... I would HIGHLY recommend this to a friend.			"

												This is not a fun game.It's not fun to watch your scavenger get stabbed as he tries to steal some food to feed his group of four. It's not fun to see your group dwindle down to two after your third survivor gets shot trying to get medical supplies for their sick. It's worse when the second commits suicide because they're so depressed from the death of their friend and only one character is left.He's joined by one other about a week later, but they can't celebrate for long; they're just barely scraping by as it is. Stealing and killing, once out of the question, is now routine, and I personally can't tell whether I want the war to be over or my survivors to just die. I'm not having fun; I just want it to be over. And that's exactly why you should get this game. Because the first time you struggle through, you will feel yourself becoming morally numb and your humanity slipping away. You'll justify it in your head and feel heavy in your heart until you don't.Fun is not the point. This game is an experience.			"

												This War of Mine is a fantastic survival sim with rogue-like elements and a moderate difficulty curve.  What makes the game great is the overall atmosphere.  It is very bleak and depressing in a thought provoking way and it really draws you into the setting.  Unlike in most games, the moral choices you will be making here have real consequences to them, and you may find yourself making morally questionable decisions that make you (and your survivors) feel guilty.The rogue-like elements include a significant amount of RNG that keep the experience fresh when playing through a handful of times after your previous attempts end poorly.  You should expect to lose your entire group of survivors a few times while you are getting a hang of the game, but the process of figuring things out is a rewarding one as you manage to keep your survivors in good health longer.  Sometimes the RNG can cause uneven difficulty, however, as starting in the middle of a cold spell or without any characters with large backpacks can make the game significantly harder.The gameplay is split into day and night cycles.  During the day you use what resources you have gathered to feed your survivors and craft things that will keep them alive and in good spirits.  During the night you can send one survivor out to scavenge from a variety of places utilizing side scrolling stealth/combat gameplay that is fairly barebones but is well polished with no bugs or glitches that I encountered.  The entire game is very well done and it would be nice if this level of polish was standard in the industry instead of an unexpected surprise.			"

												What an amazing game. The player conducts a small group of civilians in a war, and the objective is to survive and to remain human. Of course, surviving sometimes is at odds with retaining one's humanity, and that is precisely where this game comes alive. From looking into abandoned places to getting into direct confrontation with other people in the war-torn city we live in, the player is faced not with the adrenaline that is usual in war games, kill baby kill style, but with those emotions which actually can be associated to what war-survivors tell when they write their memoirs: fear, compassion, uncertainty, so much uncertainty, hope, and above all, despite for war and those who pursue it. Everyone who ever played a war videogame from the pov of the soldier should play this game. Hell, this game could very well be the basis for a whole new industry that does not only require students to read die welle (germany) or lord of the flies (USA), but indeed requires them to play games in order to look at things in new ways, and truly without much effort. This is an amazing piece of art. The only way in which the word ""entertaining"" is applicable is if taken in the same sense clockwork orange, or the pianist, are ""entertaining movies"". Most of all, they are captivating experiences.Perhaps the best game of the year, despite (or perhaps precisely because of) coming from such a small studio, and capable of making a lot of people take videogames more seriously.

												Its a good game. I however am not a huge fan. I tend to be a bit more.....Ruthless. The people you work with in my eyes are weak and easily subdued and saddened. I cant really enjoy the game when 8 days in I have people broken because they arent willing to steal or kill, even when our own could die. I cant connect with the characters that are such pansies about every little thing. So I give it a 7/10, good story, decent gameplay, and lame characters. These are the kind of people I would feed to my dog in an apocalypse or war situation. None of them are built for this surrounding, and I see thats the point, but man up Pavel, its a matter of time until those old people die anyway.			"

												When I read other reviews of how you can actually feel the pain of the characters and how hard it actually is I did not believe it. But when I got to play it, makes me wish war would never happen anywhere. It is gruesome and every day a struggle. Had a few days where everyone could relax and had abundunt supply of food but than slowly people left and died.  The old man tried getting bandages to fix up his friend but died by an ak47. The last guy to die was the chef. He got killed by rebels and nobody could have saved the poor soul. Great game really fun!			"

												Ok, I've changed this review to ""recommend"" because I had an issue with the price but seeing the hours I'm getting out of it, I no longer have an issue with it. Though as I stated below my main issue now is that the pace is too fast for the way I prefer to play. A simple ""easy"" setting which would slow the clock down would fix this.What I do like about it:1) It's a survival game.2) The tech is sort of interesting, though odd in places i.e moonshine maker.3) The animations are good.4) Deeper than your average game and makes you think about the choices you make.5) Very original and well thought out.What I don't like about it:1) Forces you to play at the pace the game developers want with a very annoying clock/countdown timer. No relaxing game session, unfortunately. Also makes for unrealistic sprinting everywhere in the ""house"" for your characters. ""I'm tired""..sprint to bed.2) The characters whine and complain a lot. Would this be realistic given the circumstances? Maybe...maybe not.3) No difficulty level. This could be implemented by slowing down the countdown-clock on easy, for example.4) No saving. If you leave, the day starts over. Would be nice if they explained this somewhere.5) Combat is...automatic. No need to even point-and-click.  Except for the gun-fights. It's also hard to just run away while engaged in combat.7) Doesn't give you enough time to build all the tech.8) Can't enjoy the fruits of your labour as you're rushing everything and everywhere because of the annoying countdown-timer on the top left.If it was half the price I paid for it, I'd probably recommend it but at £14.99? No. You can get far better games for that. If you want to try it I would suggest waiting until it's discounted.			"

												Fifty hours in, the best way I can describe ""This War of Mine"" is that it is Excruciatingly Beautiful. Without a doubt, this seemingly simple 2D side-scroller has captivated not only my mind, but my heart as well.The player is immediately thrust into a searingly bleak landscape in which choices must be made that effect, not only the characters in the game, but the player herself. The beautifully pencil-swept landscapes foster a sense of abstraction while the character models and interior enviornments lend clarity of purpose and direction, be it towards the dark or the light, as the player struggles to find their way through a war-torn appoccalypse.The combat is (intentionally?) difficult, for in this world, you are not some super soldier; you are only a person. And that is what speaks most directly to the gamer as they experience ""This War of Mine"". The first time I decided I had to kill in order to survive, I was terrified. And, it didn't end well. Marko's sacrifice eventually led to the downfall of my entire group and it was a miserable experience. An experience I shall never forget.The User Interface in this game seems a bit wonky at first, at least it did to me. Once you've mastered the UI, however, you become master of your fate and that is something I like in a game. It becomes a question of not ""can I kill this person"" but, rather: ""should I kill this person?"" And that is the target the developers were going for, as far as I can tell.I cannot remember the last time a video game made me question myself in such a profound way. Things like that are usually reserved for the cinema or found in books, I suppose. But as it stands, ""This War of Mine"" is a deeply moving and enjoyable game that should not be missed by anyone. "

												TOO SHORT... However,Game is fantastic, too addicctive that I ended up completing it on my first run. I advise you play it like it's your last. Ended up getting to day 41 which is when I 'Survived the war' and the game came to a hault... It's very disappointing that you can't play a survival mode where you can just see how long you can last as I would like to continue building and upgrading my house/characters. Either way, this game will get your heart racing and will challenge your genuine approach about living in the life and environmen of war.			"

												Another excellent game in my opinion. I love the simplicity behind it. So you have to survive in a war for 40 some odd days.   You can choose to be a raider/killer, or trade for what you need. So many choices. Simple yet effective. Click once to walk, Click twice to run. You want to chop something in half (for wood) it gives the selection and ability to. Need to build something? Crafting table or weapons table.I also like the limited colors.. dont get me wrong graphics are a big deal but in return you have a GREAT storyline that you basically are the one who makes the outcome. Do you survive, do you not survive.What I would like to see : Create a character .. more inventory .. but less speed.. or select their outfits or their positive/negative traits. More detail to the food supply. TRUE you have a refrigerator, but chances are you have no electricity.. so food spoils after a certain amount of time.Create a mission : Basically choose your team, choose your location, choose the difficulty.Overall alot of work has been done since this game has come out. I highly recommend the game and will recommend the game to friends. Keep up the great work. H/N Kinsha rates this game 4.5 out of 5 cookies. (just so there is room for growth)			"

												You want to feel good and then bad and then maybe good again? Then this is the game for you. This War of Mine captures perfectly how survivors deal with during harsh times and your decisions matter a lot.During the game you'll have to maintain your survivors and shelter well while also dealing with both good and awful decisions. One thing I definitly regreat was murdering the son that was trying to keep his old parents alive and well...There are good moments too, the best was when I helped a father traped by a sniper, the man rushed to help his baby and nothing touches more than a father's love for his child.The game got a steady gameplay pace, where you start off kind of well usually (you may start during winter, good luck then) and as the game goes♥♥♥♥♥♥hits the fan harder and harder until you are forced to steal and murder. Good luck surviving on This War of Mine!			"

Every little action has real consequences for real people. I am not even going to tell you any details because you already know the scenario. Three people in a house trapped while a civil war takes over the country. My advice is to read nothing more. Explore and think and be very cautious and plan ahead and just try to... survive. You might cry, and you might uninstall. But you will survive. 10/10			"

												To start This War of Mine is one of those games where what you do on the first few days can effect you in huge ways later on in the game. There are some good things and a few gripes that I have with the game. Hopefully this review will be able to sway your opinion/desision on if you are going to get this game or not. Without further ado here is my review of ""This War of Mine"", enjoy.The Good Graphics are rather well doneThe games atmophere is just amazingly doneAs of writing this review I have experienced no bugsChallanging gamplayA new hardly looked at perspective of the impact of warsCharacter writing is well doneIt's not just about combat (in fact I rarely used combat at all)All effects on characters are meaninful from Illnesses down to sadness and fatigeExploration is well done and enjoyableGreat SoundtrackThe radio being used as a source of information is a great ideaNow to the ConsSometimes when I try ot look at my inventory durring the day I'll accidentally click the END DAY button I do wish there were some sort of fast forward option, not just skipping. The gameplay can get stale after playing it regulary (Try hopping on occasionally for more enjoyment I found, in about 1-2 hours every few days)That's it, thats my review for This War of Mine, all in all, I think it's a great game to get, especially on sale with a few issues, but I find the gameplay compelling enough for a purchase.

												This is just beautiful game. It can be hard if you don't focus on 1 or 2 things. If you want everything, well it's not gonna happen. The main objective is to survive. There is no point in raiding military camp because you will, in 99% cases, get killed. Instead, you need to keep balance, figure out from who you can steal and with who you just have to trade.People say replay value is low, but that is not entirely true. There are different playstyles. You can grow plants, make meds and cigarres and then trade them for food, materials etc. Or you can just scavenge some materials, make and level up weapon workshop and raid poor people. There are few more different possibilities, but I will let you find out by yourself.Developers are just great, they even launched a campaign to translate game to several languages, where players can do translating. I am one of the translators for my language and I will just say that what you see in first playthrough is nothing. There are dozens of different stories, characters, not just ones you get in first playthrough. Also every character has different ending story, whether they survive or not, based on decisions you make during game. So just by reading all those, I figured out that this game is all about struggle during war, emotional moments, tough decisions, and it makes you think: ""What would I do if I were there?"" So it's not just about gameplay, build, scavenge, sleep, eat...This is the game with such a deep story and such a deep message. The message that all people in the world should see. And that message is: War is pointless.I will end my review with this quote, I find it suitable for this situation:“What difference does it make to the dead, the orphans and the homeless, whether the mad destruction is wrought under the name of totalitarianism or in the holy name of liberty or democracy?” ― Mahatma Gandhi "

												This War of Mine is a game based around a civil war that you have to brave your way through as you are stuck in the city during the conflict. This game is somewhat based off the Serbian-Bosnian conflict. In TWoM, you will get an connection with your survivors and there is a very looming chance you will lose at least 1 but a lot of the time all of your survivors. The game can last up to 45 in-game days and these 45 days are very intense. You will undergo attacks from bandits, cold weather, starvation, and sickness. There are ways to combat these things but, supplies run out very quickly. Good luck.			"

												This game is very interesting and good.I thought I was getting the hang of it. I was surviving day to day. Running low on food but feeling that would work it self out. Went to the Supermarket to scavage things for my group to eat. A soilder was there. He was focused on another scavanger. He forced him self on her. I had a choice to leave with my food or try to break in and stop him. I only had a knife.Lesson learned. Don't bring a knife to a gun fight.Then this game hit me. After 2 hours of feeling like I was treading water my main character was dead. It made me sad. Then I became more sad because I realized the food I was counting on never came back, so not only did I loose my favorite character, but all the supplies with him. Then I thought ""at least one less mouth to feed"". And then it hit me. This war had made me quickly go from feeling sad for a lost soul, to sad that he did not come back with the resources needed but at least I would not have to ration the food the way I was doing it.This game is fun. It also is a good sim that makes you aware of the perils of being caught up in a war just trying to survive. Made me think a lot about what I have seen on walking dead how you have to become a certain type of person to survive in this environment. Decisions to help strangers, find the balance between collecting food, tools, and weapons.Very happy with this purchase. Enjoy the challange of playing and the messages and opportunities to reflect upon aspects of life.			"

You will be forced to make many though sacrifices, whether be it in terms of your survivors energy, hunger, emotion, even sometimes their lives. The music and atmosphere is great.The negative thing about this game is that once everything in your shelter is prepared and you have stockpiled too much stuff, the game becomes incredibly easy and repetitive. Also it is a teeny bit buggy at times.Overall Rating: 9/10			"

More importantly the game also shines a light on a side of war that really isn't covered by games, in fact it even goes in the complete opposite direction of most games and actively shows the negative side of war on a large scale as opposed to acting like military recruitment porn like the Call of Duty franchise, Battlefield, and many many others. I would recommend the game on the altruistic message its trying to convey here alone, but its actually a really solid survival game that should give you an engaging and immersive experience albeit with a ton of stress. Well, good luck, I hope no one sneaks into your shelter at night and rapes one of your group members. If you want to read about the game in more detail you can find the rest of my review here: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2015/11/this-war-of-mine.html.			"

												This is an amazing game - challenging, unforgiving, and makes you think.  My first playthrough, I lasted for just over two weeks.  One of my people died while trying to save a man from a sniper, another was gravely injured fighting off looters who raided the house in the night.  I sent my third character out every night to find bandages and supplies.  In an act of desperation, I broke into a home to steal supplies, and was caught.  I murdered the man for his supplies, and his wife even though she begged me not to.  They didn't even have any medical supplies, although it didn't matter because the wounded friend died in the night.  The next morning, my last survivor was mentally broken and spent the day sitting on the floor weeping...Hung himself the next morning.You know it's a good game when you have to fix yourself a drink and evaluate your life after getting a game over.  This is one that will stick with you.  Definitely pick it up.			"

												This game blew me away, from its narrative without a real story, to the tough moral decisions (should I trade with this guy, or just pop a cap in his♥♥♥♥♥and take all of his crap?) that you're forced to make every night. I really enjoyed how REAL it felt. I actually felt like I understood the hardships of living in a war. I would reccomend this to EVERYONE over the age of 13ish, because of its content. If you have enough money for this game, I'd get it ASAP. This is the must-have game of 2014. No matter how much crap this game gets from the haters, there is no reason AT ALL you shouldn't purchase this game. It's entertained me for hours at a time. 11 Bit studios are one of the most insightful developers out there; whenever I thought of war, it was always about the soldiers, not about the hell anyone caught in the crossfire would experience. They are so amazing for giving me this new view of war. But anyways, you MUST buy this game. No doubt about it.			"

												A good game with a few disappointing limitations (Only being able to scavenge one area at a time during the night phase, just some minor things IMO), but over all a very well made game. Any and every decision you make will make or break your little ragtag team of survivors. From managing your building materials to deciding which area to scavenge from at night if you make even the most minut mistake it could cost you dearly. This game is anything but easy and you should expect multiple restarts. I'm not very good at reviews other than saying Yay or Nay so I'll make it simple and say Yay. 8/10Oh and you can't save.... Have fun =D			"

												Review Update the last patch fixed all UI issues so now you can actully see the main menu agin, - you can actully exit the game with out having to crash the whole thing with the task manager.you actully able to see your inventory, seems that the patch fixed what ever problem there was with AMD drivers.I have three machines a one with a R7260 cideo card, anther machine with a 5800 AMD and third machine with a HD7970x2 anyways they all where running the 14.9 driver set and they worked menus so forth then a patch came out and all menus and interface disappeared. which created lack of abilty to control anything speaily sense there is no key bindings the whole game is controled by the User interface or menus.well sense last patch last night magicly the game menus came back agin on all three machines.so the issues I had with the game are gone now, other then one minor annoying thing game has no key bindings for anything - which means you can not hook up a xbox 360 control and bind keys to any commands which means you wont be playing this on a media center.other then that so far it seems okay i have had game for three days now or so but only able to play about 40 mins due to well the patching destorying the game menu and interface for last couple days.I this will get updated as things change.do i recommend this game so far depends on price.

												You want to feel good and then bad and then maybe good again? Then this is the game for you. This War of Mine captures perfectly how survivors deal with during harsh times and your decisions matter a lot.During the game you'll have to maintain your survivors and shelter well while also dealing with both good and awful decisions. One thing I definitly regreat was murdering the son that was trying to keep his old parents alive and well...There are good moments too, the best was when I helped a father traped by a sniper, the man rushed to help his baby and nothing touches more than a father's love for his child.The game got a steady gameplay pace, where you start off kind of well usually (you may start during winter, good luck then) and as the game goes♥♥♥♥♥♥hits the fan harder and harder until you are forced to steal and murder. Good luck surviving on This War of Mine!			"

												This is quite possibly one of the best games of the roguelike genre on steam.  It is an amazing and compelling experience,  and for a roguelike, it is not overly punishing and repetetive.  The gameplay is easy to control and get the hang of, and it is just simply an amazing game.  I have no regrets in buying it.  The devs deserve the mere $20, if not deserve more for both this work of art and incredibly fun to play game.TL;DRThis is an amazing game.  Buy it.			"

												Guilt Simulator 2014.Very difficult game. Many interesting choices to be made. Food was very scarce. Everyone was hungry. Everyone had the same look in their eyes. They thought this dilapidated building to be their grave. Nearby, there was a building occupied by what I assumed to be bandits. I saw they had sources of food, and decided it was me or them. I scouted the place out, bringing lockpicks with me to make my own entrance. I made my way in through a balcony on the second floor, making sure to peek through the keyhole at the end of the room. There was someone on the other side of the door. I made some noise and hid in the closet.  When the door opened, I clubbed the poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to death with a crowbar. I listened and waited. There were two or three people left.I made my way to the left, where I knew an armed guard was. He must have been their leader. I snuck up behind him, cracking his skull with the crowbar. He turned around, trying to fend me off with the butt of his rifle. A crushing blow to his ribs, and another to the head and his light was extinguished. The third bandit was running to his aid. I closed the door, arming myself with the fallen bandit's shotgun. A woman burst into the room, running straight for the newly deceased. She knelt on the ground, sobbing and crying for her loved one to come back.I ended her life as well. When I returned, I was broken-hearted. I sat down on a piece of rubble, looking down at my feet.  I sat there for what seemed like hours. Finally, someone broke the silence. ""We're the only two left. Bruno abandoned us during the night, and Katia... Katia is dead."" She had died of starvation. I had ended the lives of innocent people, only to return home to my friends dead and gone. We got drunk that night. So drunk that walking was asking the impossible.That night, two children came to our door. They told us their mother was dying, and they needed medicine. Hoping to atone for my sins, I drunkenly stumbled to our medicine cabinet. It was empty. With a heavy heart, I sent the children home to their dying mother. Was there no good left in this world? Was there even any left in me? Hope is gone.As I write, I hear someone outside. The sound of a crowbar prying away at planks. I am alone. I am unarmed. I am cold and sick. My face is wet with tears, finding their way through the cracks and crevices of dried blood. I cannot live with what I have done. I welcome the raiders and the everlasting peace they bring with them.			"

												Day 8.Survivors: Katia, Pavle, Marin and Bruno.Food situation: Starving.Water: Hydrated.Materials: Getting there.Pavle and Katia, my main two scavengers. After last night Pavle was spent, he needed the rest, but the group needed food.Katia, slightly wounded but bandaged, I had to take the risk and make her scavenge that night. Marin the new one in the group, had boarded up the windows, but that didn't stop the raiders from getting in and taking all our food.I put two people on watch this night, I wasn't taking the chance.I select the Motel, we've been there before, it's occupied by a group of nice people, they're actually willing to trade.But I don't have enough to trade for anything.Katia sneaks around, hoping to get some food for the group. She's running out of options and the hours creep past. 3 hours to go, I make her head to the exit, they hear me running, one yells out""Is someone there?"" he heads down the steps and looks around, gun in his hand, but he hasn't the will to use it.This is it, Day 8, if I don't get food now I won't make it a fortnight into this.I swallow my humanity, This needs to be done, for Pavle, Marin and Bruno, Katia thinks to herself and races in, stabs the man and  his body falls to the floor, a friend of his hears the commotion and comes to take me out, I kill him after a struggle and the third runs.So I dash to the fridge on the second floor, and take everything I can.There's heaps, they're saved.I take it all, but the third is standing over me as I exit the loot screen, he stares in horror and Katia's eyes meet his, his gun trembling in his hand, and I notice it. I make Katia run to the exit, the man watchs me leave but only follows a short while.Day 9Survivors: Katia, Pavle, Marin and Bruno.Food situation: We'll be fine for a while.Water: 7.8/10 too much water -IGNMaterials: Getting worse.Katia returns, tears rolling down her face, and as she arrives through the door she screams, ""I'm done, that's it, no more death.""Marin goes to talk to her, we only hear the first part, the rest, nothing. Pavle, Bruno and Katia go to eat, but Marin can't, he's too disgusted in what has happened, Pavle walks up and gives him a bowl of Bruno's cooking and says ""come on, we have to stay alive.And he eats.Why did I tell a story instead of a review? because this only just happened in my game, and I'm as destroyed watching this as the characters are.This story based roguelike will tear you down and move you each time despite doing this over and over in millions of other survival management games.What will your story be? will you survive your first try? or will This War of Mine take you as another casualty. before this session, This War of Mine was in my All Games list, Now it's in my favourites.10/10			"

												This is the nature of ""This war of mine"": You are always pondering, despairing, doubting.This game does not make you happy, it makes you feel. It makes you think. In my opinion, this game might be THE most needed game in our time. With wars flaming up everywhere on the globe, and people from every country raging for violent conflicts against other peoples, this game might show you the ugly side of war.Everyone who thinks war is an easy and clean solution to problems NEEDS to play this game, it might open his eyes...This War of Mine gives an insight into how war is for 95% of the people in war zones: It's heart breaking, frightening, and it WILL show you the borders of your own morality.Fights are dangerous. You can feel the desperation of your charakter through the desktop, when you try to kill someone with a kitchen knife in hand to hand combat. And after your opponent is dead, you don't feel like a victor. You feel dirty. His sister might come crying, kneeling besides the body and asking you why you did that. His brother might call you ""murderer"" and try to kill you in revenge. You will meet people who need your help, who beg you for supplies or a place to stay. And you will meet rapists, murderers, torturers...Should I rob this nice elderly couple for their medizine and food? They are unarmend, but I would condemn them to die, and they did not harm anybody. Or should I rather go for the militia ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in the next building? They have more supplies, but they might kill me...Should I give the starving children some food, or do I need it more?Should I kill this lookout from behind, smashing his head in with a crowbar? Or is she peacefull and I would murder an innocent woman?I don't know how this game ends, though. I'm on day 43 now, the UN promised to come and end this war, but there are still fights going on, and the supplies are running low. Soon, it will be a murderous carnage for food and medizine out on the streets... "

												You control a group of civilians trapped in a war zone, and have to manage limited resources and risk-taking in order to best survive the challenges thrown at you. Reminiscent of other survival games like FTL and DayZ, where you're often barely scraping by, then several more things go wrong (see this article: http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/10/23/games-are-best-when-things-go-wrong/).Also a reasonably good and original attempt to show war from a civilian perspective, which is not always common in games.If you like these kinds of games that force you to make decisions knowing you can't roll back to a save point, you'll probably enjoy this.

However if you want to get the most out of your purchase then I urge you to not look up guides as to how to play the game ""effectively"". It is easy to get swept up in min-maxing and trying to not waste resources/loot the best places using the experiences of others. You may feel instant gratification as you manage to ""beat"" a notroriously challenging game but this is not a ""game"". This is an experience. If you have no clue what you are doing this game will force you into tough choices, it will make you question the lengths you will go to to survive. Let yourself get swept up in the narrative, watch your survivors battle with hunger, depression and bereavment. If one of your survivors dies, dont just rage quit. See what follows. Try and pull yourself back from the brink. That is what will bring you true satisfaction from this game. Tl;dr : The game is great. Dont look at guides.			"

												I Bought this game barely knowing about it, just watched a 20 minutes stream of it. It realy caught my attention (in the good way). Decisions in this game are very important and can change the games outcome drasticly. Its your story choose how to play it. ex: helping your neighbors out, get your characters all happy. Either control your characters making them play fairly and not steal making them be ""Happy"" and not risk loosing them or go raiding other peoples homes to gather materials/food a lot easier but makes your characters be ""sad"" or even ""depressed"" making them a lot more tempted to turn against you. You should always be conserative on your materials and only make/take what you desperatly need. You wouldlnt want to be stuck on day 23 with it being cold and short on wood to make a fire. There are alot of stuff you can make/improve to try to make your shelter the safer and better as possible, wide variety. This can also be replayed once all your characters die without being scared that the same things will happen in your next ""life"", its   randomly generated making this a great game to play on. Hours and hours of joy.			"

												I played through this game in one sit-through, and I have to say there aren't a lot of games that can keep me so immersed as this one did. Eight hours flew by as I survived day by day with my comerades. You get to see war in a new perspective and you get to see what war does to the ones not fighting in it. This game puts you in horrible situations and you have to make choices for your greater good, so you can live to fight another day. You get to know the characters you're controlling, and you start to care about them. You really want them to survive. You do everything in your power to keep them alive, and you see the consequences. Sure, they might have food and meds for a couple more days. But what they had to do to get it, will stay with them forever. And you really start to feel bad for them. I, at least, felt really guilty after the first murder.I really enjoyed playing this game, and I do recommend it for anyone who's slightly intrigued in this concept. I was sceptical of this game at first, but it really came around. I truly love this game.R.I.P. Pavle.			"

												this game is something of its own kind. you may want to try avoiding action and sneakin is hard, nearly impossible. it puts you in the possition where alot of what you do are morally right and wrong.to begin with, you start off with 3 characters who got diffrent set of traint and weakness. one is a looter and can carry more stuff during raids, while 1 is a cook and can make better food. one is a smoker... i honestly never saw the downside of that except from hearing him complaining about being out of cigarets, but as long as i playd, he never had a downside of quiting.you will get more character along the way, but that is after a few days, where they will come knocking on your door, litteraly. random events will take place, either its ""neighboors"" knocking on your door or someone raiding your home while youre out scavenging for materials or food.its no zombie apocalypse, but what makes it dangerous to go out, is the war. snipers on the roof is what keeps your characters in doors during the day. having an overview on the war is always nice, this is where crafting will come in handy. you start with a rundown house that you gotta clear up and make as secure as you can. making a radio to stay known about the war is a good start. be sure to make a bed too, as your character will get tired or less sleep from sleeping on the cold floor.it puts the tone for the game really well and i would give a better review if i only could. but i didnt manage to get that far, so im still trying to learn the full strategy of the game, but i am able to tell, that this game is worth 7/10. its above average. its something i would play on my laptop traveling around or on my job. its not too big, but its more up to you if you are able to put the mood right for it. its worth playing the game, and its worth paying full price. the only downsides i encounter is the lack of sneaking and the difficulty in ecountering in combat. but i think that was intentional, increesing the difficulity.

For the very first time you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city.  In the first few approaches the game seems to be difficult, we feel this hopeless war, but with every hour we learn more and more how it all works and what to focus on and then already it is hoped that it can survive. The game requires proper management of resources and good planning.It is the player's responsibility to maintain their characters' health, hunger and mood levels until the declaration of a ceasefire, which occurs after a randomized duration.During the daytime, hostile snipers will prevent the survivors from venturing outside, thereby offering the player time to craft tools from gathered materials, trade, upgrade the shelter, cook food and heal the survivors. At night, you are given the opportunity to venture out and scavenge nearby areas for valuable resources for their everyday survival. During the excursions, the survivors can encounter other NPC survivors of the war, who they can choose to help with gifts, or rob and kill.The scavenging phase plays out as a tense, atmospheric 2D stealth game. While some abandoned locations are looters' playgrounds, the war-torn city features a lot of other unsavory types. Soldiers and militia might be willing to trade with you or simply ignore you, but they can turn on you in a heartbeat. Other survivors might shoot you on sight. Rummaging through a pile of rubble sends sound waves far into the distance, alerting people to your presence. Get spotted in a place where you shouldn't be, and you'll have a choice: run, hide, fight, or die.			"

												This War Of Mine is a depressing game. Two people got really depressed when Pavle stole food from a family and left none so they would probably all starve to death.Then Pavle died after getting caught stealing.The girl, Katia, who was sad about Pavle stealing food became uber depressed because he died and was going to kill herself.Bruno talked Katia out of suicide and let her sleep for a few days while he went out scavenging.A women named Emilia had shown up at their door asking if she could stay there.They took her into their home.Emilia went out scavenging that night and never returned after getting shot to death.Kalia who was super depressed said ""I'll never forgive her killers!"" and went to fight them the next night and killed everyone asociated with her death.Bruno became scared of her and started drinking what he booze he could find.Bruno slept off his hangover and went out to trade for some more supplies, but was murdered after a misunderstanding.Katia, very injured from the people she had killed was now alone and bed-ridden to heal her wounds.That night the house was robbed, and Katia was murdered.The survivors of that household are now all dead.Game is 10/10 depressing would buy and would recommend			"

												Most games you run through, not giving a second thought to who you kill or any damage it does. Here each choice you make gives you a feeling that its all hopeless. Balancing supplies, deciding which of your friends bleeds to death and which dies. Watching as your group begins to break down from depression.  That first time you murder someone and watch as their family goes near them and begins crying, all while you feel like a monster as you forage around their house. You really feel like your choices affect people, even if only in this game.			"

												That feeling when your best scavenger gets shot by a sniper then you send out your second best scavenger and he also dies.... Interesting game with a dark subject and atmosphere. The game itself is not 'fun' but it is definitely a compelling experience. The game truly tests your morals and makes you question your decisions. You should definitely try to pick this game up as it is definitely a unique war game not focused on ""Boom...♥♥♥♥♥ you are dead"" *teabags*; It focuses on the survivors POV and takes you through their horrible experience of the war.

 This War of Mine makes you feel things. I remember playing on my very first save. My first three members were Katia, Pavle, and Bruno. Bruno was kind of selfish, but he was still an essential member. Katia and Pavle on the other hand, were my main priorities. I tried playing as passively as possible to keep everyone alive. I grew fond of them as days went by. Not much happens for the first two weeks or so. I go scavenging a lot, and I tried to keep everyone happy and well, so we could all survive. After Day 16, Katia becomes sad. I do whatever I can to help her become content. Pavle gets wounded due to a raid from last night. And Bruno's wounds become more severe. I could not afford any bandages.Food runs short.Everyone's very hungry.I trade everything I have for three cans of food.A few days later.Everyone's starving again.I have nothing.I go scavenging.Pavle is pale.Still don't have enough for much.Next day.Bruno helps a neighbor in need.He comes back.More scavenging.I find food.I return home.Pavle's dead.Everyone falls in to a state of depression.Next day.Katia is exhausted, but still scavenges.I go to the hospital.Turns out it works.I go home to tell Bruno.Except I can't.Bruno dies.Day 23.Katia is broken, is unable to move.She cries all day.Day 24.I didn't make it.We didn't make it.But sometimes, I make my own story with them. Just to see,What would happen if they all lived and made it.			"

												At it's heart, this game is an Adventure point and click where decisions matter, mixed with a heavy emphasis on resource management to be able to win.  It is a very atmospheric game with great visuals and music.  The real life photos add so much to the style and realism of the game.  I genuinely felt dread and fear for my characters through their adventures, and felt real releif when it was all over and they all had happy endings.  It was a great experiance to play.But as with most games there are a few negatives.  The game almost requires one or two restarts before you learn the ins and outs of the game, there is no tutorial and certain things are not intuitive.  You will over build buildings your first playthrough and get caught offgaurd with certain events like winter or raiders.  To learn sneaking and combat you might have to restart as well, as things can go bad very quickly and not knowing the controls or how to properly control your character in combat comes with trial and error.  Upon your second playthorugh you know exactly what to do and what not to build.  I personally enjoy learning curves but can see people turned off if they are not use to losing everything their first few go arounds.  Anyways, I recommend this game, it is fun and has many scenarios to replay!			"

												This game is an excellent blend of stealth, resource management, base building and decision making. You play as a group of civilians trapped in a city beseiged by an ongoing war. Scavenge, trade, craft and even lie and kill your way to survival. The question is, how far would you go to survive? This War of Mine asks this question constantly, and it means it.One highlight is how good the game is in connecting you with your survivors. I have felt despair, anguish, sadness and hope in my playthroughs. It's remarkable how the game accomplishes this although each playthough can be very differerent. The game sets you up with a different set of survivors each time you play, and many events and locations are randomly generated to a certain extent. You may see the same location in a subsequent playthrough but the events and circumstances might be different, prompting you to use a different strategy whist visiting. A market square bustled with survivors eagerly engaging in black market trade might become a dangerous, deserted spot preyed upon by hostile snipers in your next game.I thoroughly enjoyed my time with This War of Mine. Everything feels fresh and new, and I feel I'm a kid again eagerly discovering everything for the first time. This is the sleeper hit of the year.			"

												A truly harrowing experiance that no other game can make you feel. Just the soundtrack alone is enough to make you bond, experiance, and ultimately, mourn with the small but poingent characters in your safe house.When you have to make decisions to not feed the dying homeles man, as you have no food yourself, the characters will constantly go on about that decision,  as well as your other choices; all of which will make you as the 'leader' feel responisible for commiting murder, theft or worse.Whilst you are playing as survivors, the feeling when you kill 'bandits', only to realise that the gun wielding young man was just protecting his two elderly (chair-ridden) parents from you, the 'real' bandit in the scenario.But man, that ending though; when you see a somewhat  sublte reminder of all your successes, trivia... and mistakes, it takes it out of you, even more so considering that there is meant to be an end eventually, which would have elft your characters alive and well.10/10 for a truly emotional journey without rubbing in your face, ""feel for this character you don't know"" of many triple A games out there.Worth a buy, or two...

												Awesome game, I really like it! I can say that it is a little rude, depressive, demotivative and dark but we all love this kind of games.Even epilogue is unhappy.Gameplay is very time-killing, and I wish developers make dialogs sound, because sometimes you just can't see what's happening, for example the soldier is running toward you with the rifle when you searchin some meat in trash.I have a problem in a Mac : when I try to close the game the system reports about crash.Summing up - I will recommend the tablet version to all my friends.i put 8 Antons from 10 for this game.

												This War of Mine is a war-simulation I've been waiting for. Here, you get to experience how the other side of the war feels like. You play as a group of civilians who have occupied a building in a city ravaged by civil war.During the day, you can explore the house for anything left behind and you can build furniture and workbenches to let you craft beds, oven, herb gardens, traps etc. Everything you build and upgrade in the house cost resources. These resources can be looted at night. You choose which character you want to leave the house with and assign others to guard-duty or sleeping.At night you control the character you sent out for scavenging and choose what to bring home. You have to prioritize if you want to bring food for all survivors or materials for crafting/building.When scavenging, you can choose between different locations to visit. Some may hold aggressive looters looking to fend you off. Others, guards that look after civilians and make sure you don't steal anything during your visit. Lastly, some places hold families from whom you can choose to steal everything they own or leave them with some of the loot.All the characters have mental health that is affected by actions you make them do. You always have to look after your characters and try to keep them fed, content/happy and look after their special needs.The only thing missing in this game, is a multiplayer mode.9/10			"

												Emotive, powerful and compelling. Just a handful of the words I would use to describe this master piece of a game. In 'This War of Mine' you take control of a group of survivors in the midst of a civil war in the ficticous city of Pogoren, and the conflict itself is loosely based on the Yugoslavian Wars fought in the 1990's. The gameplay is anything but bland. You can choose to deck out your base with all manner of things, from advanced heating units to Moonshine distilleries. At night, you send out one survivor to scavenge among the ruins of Pogoren for food, medicine and building supplies. Morality features quite heavily in this game, for example; robbing a hospital or weak elderly survivors will result in your survivors having bouts of depression and refusing to do anything, but at the same time, your hand may be forced as your survivors could be very sick or injured. This War of Mine really makes you think about what is right, and how far you will go to save your own.			"

If you play this game and kill somebody when they are desperate you will feel bad that whole  day. Extremeley riveting gameplay, This game has things like Depression, People give up on living and you have to stop them from killing themselves. It is Brutal though and so realistic it will blow your mind. One big feature of this game is making your story. Choose how you want the climate to be. Mantain food supplies, Choose your survivors. Put up borders around yor base to keep looters away during the, and last but not least Choose how rough you want your weather to be. In the end of your Journey you may cry, you may laugh, or you may never play the game again. Either way It is all YOUR CHOICE.			"

												A fantastic journey that kept me playing, replaying and enjoying the grit of war as it should be portrayed in many, many  more games. I confused (and initially discounted) this game for Valiant Heart, only to finally give it a whirl on the suggestions of our fans. I discovered the depth and uncaniness of its portrayal of human relations, while it forced me to make difficult moral choices in desperate circumstances, playing out the very human consequences of my actions.This is what true independent development stands for. Hats off to the folks at 11bit for stealing so much time out of my busy schedule, and reminding me why we all make games! "

												I went scavenging and found onions. A lot of onions. Then I chopped them all. It's the only reason why my eyes are wet, I swear.Seriously, at this point there are so many thousands of good reviews that you don't even need to read mine. I'm just writing one more positive review because ♥♥♥♥ damn, this game deserves the rating.While gameplay-wise there could be things to improve here or there, the art, the atmosphere, the story-telling, the hell-bent gruelling tension you're gonna spiral yourself in... They are all 10/10.This is not just a game, this is a whole experience.The only real con is not having an auto-save when you quit the game. It saves automatically every morning, which is rather annoying if something comes up and you want to do something else but it's late afternoon in-game. You need to either play the whole game night or lose the day's progress. Having an auto-save when you quit would also further prevent save-whoring.SPOILER ALERTAlso, I found the game a bit too short. 10 hours into it and I've finished it, that's it. I'm not sure about the replayability value either.I was ready for the situation to keep worsening and worsening, forcing me to make hard choices. I didn't even visit 1/2 of the scavenge locations. I was just finally starting to enjoy what I had built. And all the sudden, boom, war is over. What? Quite a bit anti-climatic for me, very disappointing.Edit: After trying to play it again a couple of other times, indeed I've foudn that replayability is limited. Some people are more keen to play it again, I found it to be a bit meh. Ymmv. Still 100% worth it though.			"

												I Bought this game barely knowing about it, just watched a 20 minutes stream of it. It realy caught my attention (in the good way). Decisions in this game are very important and can change the games outcome drasticly. Its your story choose how to play it. ex: helping your neighbors out, get your characters all happy. Either control your characters making them play fairly and not steal making them be ""Happy"" and not risk loosing them or go raiding other peoples homes to gather materials/food a lot easier but makes your characters be ""sad"" or even ""depressed"" making them a lot more tempted to turn against you. You should always be conserative on your materials and only make/take what you desperatly need. You wouldlnt want to be stuck on day 23 with it being cold and short on wood to make a fire. There are alot of stuff you can make/improve to try to make your shelter the safer and better as possible, wide variety. This can also be replayed once all your characters die without being scared that the same things will happen in your next ""life"", its   randomly generated making this a great game to play on. Hours and hours of joy.			"

												This is the nature of ""This war of mine"": You are always pondering, despairing, doubting.This game does not make you happy, it makes you feel. It makes you think. In my opinion, this game might be THE most needed game in our time. With wars flaming up everywhere on the globe, and people from every country raging for violent conflicts against other peoples, this game might show you the ugly side of war.Everyone who thinks war is an easy and clean solution to problems NEEDS to play this game, it might open his eyes...This War of Mine gives an insight into how war is for 95% of the people in war zones: It's heart breaking, frightening, and it WILL show you the borders of your own morality.Fights are dangerous. You can feel the desperation of your charakter through the desktop, when you try to kill someone with a kitchen knife in hand to hand combat. And after your opponent is dead, you don't feel like a victor. You feel dirty. His sister might come crying, kneeling besides the body and asking you why you did that. His brother might call you ""murderer"" and try to kill you in revenge. You will meet people who need your help, who beg you for supplies or a place to stay. And you will meet rapists, murderers, torturers...Should I rob this nice elderly couple for their medizine and food? They are unarmend, but I would condemn them to die, and they did not harm anybody. Or should I rather go for the militia ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in the next building? They have more supplies, but they might kill me...Should I give the starving children some food, or do I need it more?Should I kill this lookout from behind, smashing his head in with a crowbar? Or is she peacefull and I would murder an innocent woman?I don't know how this game ends, though. I'm on day 43 now, the UN promised to come and end this war, but there are still fights going on, and the supplies are running low. Soon, it will be a murderous carnage for food and medizine out on the streets... "

												My first ""This War of Mine"" game is over, 13.7 real life hours, 40 in-game days. 4 dead team members, 3 murders, a lot of stealing (I'm not sure if you can win this game without that), even more looting and a working moonshine factory with a steady trade. Helped everyone who asked for it, took in every survivor (good thing too, because I ended up loosing a lot of them), tried fighting against bandits, was a bad idea. But enough with the debrief, now to the actual review:My overall feeling about this game is very positive. The theme is unique and the feeling of despair sustains though out the game. At some point during the game the atmosphere got so intensely sad and desperate I had to take a break from it, I consider this to be an amazing achievement from a game. I suffered 3 bugs during the game that really had an affect on the atmosphere and broke the immersion, but considering that it's an relatively new game from a indie studio it's understandable. Also the bugs didn't break the game and I was able to continue after them, I just hope they get fixed sooner rather than later. :) The game could have more variety to it, definitely, but again: New game and a indie game, the game itself is a remarkable achievement! An true survivor game and perhaps first of its kind in being a ""war-survivor"" game. The music was good and conveyed the feeling of the game very well, a more variance to the music would have been better though. Especially the radio music got boring quick. For me the trailer expressed a bit more event rich and intense game than it was, which is more of an rule than exception, but like I said: overall feeling is very positive. This was perhaps one of the best games I've played, but yes it could have been even better. :-)Played this on apple platform on Christmas holiday, when I get back from the holidays to my PC, I wonder will the save games and achievements be transferable to my PC? We will see.This War of Mine is a true survivor game with intense atmosphere.			"

												Survival war game played through the view of civilians trapped in a war torn city. This fun, deep, and slightly depressing game gives great views and voices of events that happen during war. Great game and concepts that has a moderate replay value. Choose ethical or evil actions to overcome life situations. Recommended for gamers to experience. Would like to see more options available for characters and AI for higher replay value.			"

												Playing for the first time makes you really sad on how the survivors have it really bad and because you are the one that needs to take care of them makes it feel even worse considering it's in your hands to make decisions in their lives. Making a mistake or having someone break through depression is just heartbreaking.With lots of game time and research (I've been playing this game ever since I got it - 44 hours now) you can get used to the game and see through everything. Some starts are terrible, others are out of control and can just lead you into victory. Enjoyable game and I do recommend buying the War Child Charity DLC in order to help out the organization the created this amazing game. 9.7/10			"

												Man, this game is depressing, but in a good way - if that's possible.  In a market flooded with violent shoot-em-ups which glorify war and massacre, it's good to have a game that highlights the awful reality of conflict.  It's like a wake-up call to those of us who think blood and gore is so much fun.  After all, what harm can a violent video game cause, right?  Desensitisation, that's what.Full of life-threatening decisions, despair, and bleak hope, this game really hits the emotions.  I never thought I'd see a game that so unashamedly exposes the true horror of war.  It really hits you hard when you see your people starving, or dying of their wounds.  The most thought-provoking game I've ever known of.A brave move by the game studio as well.  It would have been all too easy to produce another tired cliche of a war game, but they've taken things in another direction.  This truly is survival horror.  There are no zombies, or monsters to worry about here.  Just the most dangerous beast of them all - mankind.If you want a gritty game that's not afraid to really put you in the thick of things, you can do no better than this.  This remarkable game touches you, haunts you, and makes you think.  Now tell me, how many other games can boast that?Despite it's depressive nature, you'll want to play this again and again.  I know I'll be back for another run-through as soon as I've cheered myself up a little.  You find yourself really caring what happens to your group of survivors, finding it gut-wrenching when something bad happens.  It's like losing your best friend,   When my first character died, I really felt down.  When they all died, I felt so sad I could have cried.The game market is full of half-realised titles that simply don't deliver the goods.  This does in a way you'll not easily forget.  It's great to see someone put thoughts like this into the common person's head.  Only when we truly realise the disgrace of war that we'll want it to stop.Can't recommend highly enough.  Just play it!			"

With well designed mechancis always putting you on the edge starvation, depression and sickness it's challening and dramatic. You must consider both psychological and physical needs and learn that sometimes one is more important then the other.Surrounded by danger it does the opposite of glorifying war a modern handling a senstiive issue exqiuisitly.So yeah, it's okay i guess.

												'In war, Not everyone is a soldier.' A chilling message that the game whispers to you. As it states, Your not a soldier, Not some supreme commando who can wipe out a hoard of soldiers on his own. Your a civillian. Someone whose life is affected by the conflict, your friends are gone, your family is probably dead, and hope is fading. Put yourself in that position and 'This war of mine' is an extremely powerful game that shows you the pain and desperation people suffer in warzones.The game is extremely challanging and requires a strong heart to make difficult choices. This game does not have a happy ending, Nor is it a happy game. There is no riding off into the sunset, swept away by a evacuation. No. You brutally have to survive, scrounging for supplies such as food, water, materials, weapons, and more. The game is filled with risk and difficult morality choices. You might not care for the A.I Roaming the game, But your survivors do. And your actions have dire consequences. You stole from that old couple in that house. You don't care. But your survivors do. They feel the guilt, they suffer the choice, they suffer from the depression, thats what makes this a great game. Emotion is put into every detail of the game. From guilt from theft. To pride of your survivors as one risks his life to help a wounded man reach his son, while under fire from a sniper. Your selfless paladin like choices will not benefit you in this game, infact, it will hinder you more than you know. You must balance your selfish desire to survive, and your selfless compassion to thrive.Managing your resources and supplies is extremely difficult, and requires stratergy and luck to master. Batering is also a core essential ability to master. You desperately need that medicine, But its going to cost you a majority of your food. You need to prepare. You need to survive, and hopefully. You will Thrive.I recommend anyone to play this game, not just for the fun, the tense situations of hiding from violent survivors, or the pure emotion of the suffering, depression, or joy the characters feel. But also to understand what is actually happening out there. In war, the soldiers are not the only heroes. Not everyone is a soldier, and not everyone survives.			"

												'This War Of Mine' should be more like 'This War Of Ours'!It's an eye opening experience that is once in a life time for a game, as you feel what it is like for our soldiers out there, fighting. But most of all it's about those civilians who have the worst effects of countless government actions. If you want a game that will leave you breakthless, emotive, and slightly depressed whilst at the same time making you turn to a life of drinking, this is the game for you!Ignore those haters; cause the haters gonna hate!

												This War of Mine is a survival game set in a wartorn city. You are a group of civilians who are struggling to survive. During the day you looking after your characters and crafting supplies. At night you scavenge for food, materials, and medicine, while others characters are sleeping and keeping guard. After each play through you will think of what you should have done differently... Should I have helped that man? Should I have stole that old womans medicine? Should I have let her stay with us? Should I have made a bed or stove first? All of these decisions have their consequenses and affect your characters. They will get sick, hungry, and depressed. You need to look after their needs in order to survive. It is a cruel game that makes you feel guilty for your actions. Its either ""kill or be killed"".This game is great and really make you feel for these people. It makes you appreciate the life that you have.			"

												Some negative reviews are right. There isn't much replay value in this game and even in first playthrough at some point it can get highly repetitive and boring, but until that point you will experience something no other game delivers.When things start to get repetitive, you can simply stop playing, just like I did. But memories of choices you had to make and horrors of war you've seen will stay with you for days if not weeks and they will keep you thinking about people around the world who are experiencing war every day. For that thing alone this game is worth buying.And there's a charity DLC for it. Go and buy it if you have spare 1$/€ in your steam wallet. 100% of developer's proceeds from the DLC go to the charity War Child, who focus on helping children who suffer from conflicts and wars around the world.

												I will never see how people say this game is ""fun""it's not fun. It's a emotional experience meant for anyone.I tried to lead my group through the war, but at what cost? Many people i encountered were killed by my hand. All because they had some raw meat for my friends at home who were starving. As soon as my scavenger found a gun with plenty of ammo, i felt like killing everyone who crossed me and hurt my survivors. After the slaughter of many people, i realized that i was a monster. Near the end i got careless and my scavenger died. I was devastated, and so were the others. I badly wanted to restart, pretend it was a test run, act like it was some scenario i thought of in my head. But I told myself to keep going, or i will never feel satisfied of surviving the war. That event took place one day later. If i would have stayed at home, i could have survived with everyone. I didn't feel great that the war was over. I didn't feel even content with the ending. That is something i have to live with while replaying this game.If you have the money for this game, don't just buy it alone. Pay for the charity DLC. I know i will.The only thing I hate about this game is the metacritic score. This game deserves a far better score than what they gave.			"

												An absolutly incredable game. I dont often get effected by games unless they have a powerful connection to reality. To think the sort of decisions you make in the game were reality for people just a mere 20 years agois heart breaking. The game itself has a beautiful art style that gives you an eerie feel. I find it facinating to read the bio updates of your characters as the game progresses because (Im not sure if this is true or not) it feels like you are reading diary updates from the time it is set. I am really enjoying the rise of education but entertaining game (such as Valient hearts). This game is very difficult, as you send 1 of your characters out to scavenge you have to make decisions that may haunt you characters, You may find lots of great things just to return home to fnd your stuff has been stolen or that one or more of your characters had died. I give this game  8.5/10 for the feels.			"

Can't say it didn't take me alot of tries, but somehow I still managed to get it all perfect. Game has to offer great artwork, as well great dialogues and very nice diary system, it really gives you the feeleing like you are living the experience.What I didn't like about this game is that there are so many smokers, and when you try to make sigarets to trade them, they will just smoke them all before you have chance to trade them. I'm fine with coffee drinkers since they drink 1 coffee per day, but those guys go for 3 sigarets per day so it's kinda hard to keep the number up. Overall it's nice :)*I highly suggest to get guitar and play it, has to offer great music!*			"

												This game is a beautiful reminder of why war is awful and why we try to avoid it. it's deep, emotional, depressing. these atmospheres set up great moments that can be so little. For example, after nights of raider attacks you finally manage to arm your people and keep your home safe. Successfully gathering a great amount of supplies without robbing or killing anyone. The tone of the game is that alot of bad happens, but what little good there is can be amazing. Though there are a few things that can be a bit funny. like robbing someone, and a person at your shelter/home/whatever eats the food you robbed but gets mad at the person who stole the food, and exclaims this point WHILE EATING THE STOLEN FOOD. but in short, definitely a great game.

												I found a elderly couple with a lot of supplies living in seclusion without weapons, decided it would be useful to loot them and kill them as they wont live long anyway, you know, probably doing them a favour anyway, if I dont do it now quickly, someone else will do it later and perhaps less mercilessly, and besides they're alone, who will miss them?To this day I still wake up in the dead of the night in a cold sweat and short of breath because of what I did to Bernard and his wife. Their memory still haunts me. I am a changed man, a man more desensitised from the horrors of war. I did it all for a bit of raw meat and a rusty crowbar in the end.

												This War of Mine is a modern day classic, and with the number of excellent mods, tools, and scenarios preesnt in the game, will keep the hardcore fans happy for years to come. It's an incredible exploration of the moral dilemmas that face survivors in a war zone. The tone and color of the game is as fitting as its subject matter, painting the world as a cold, ill-toned, nightmare world, draped in gray. It is a world where the survivors wake day after day into boredom, mundanity, fear, and hope, hope that the war will end the next day, or the next, or the next. Where the temptation to steal or to kill is a constant, and the possibility of death is an ever present danger. The type of game the developers chose to pursue is really excellent, taking the setting and tone seriously, providing a crafting mechanism borne of scavenging, and with a tremendous focus on just pure survival instead of trying to build some form of of empire in the midst of a combat zone creates a tension that is hard to match. The atmosphere is thick with desperation and your group is just one of many that finds themselves cold, hungry, and willing to go to extremes in order to make it just a few more days. The game is not forgiving in any way, which player's should be aware of. The first few attempts will likely end in terrible failure, likely with your consistent scavenger succumbing to sniper fire, or being killed in a violent knife fight, leaving the other players without food, or medical supplies. There is a constant sense of crawling uphill, making small gains only to lose them and feel yourself slide back down. When you do learn the mechanics, what to build and when, as well as how to handle yourself outside of your shelter you will find yourself being able to carve out a life for these people, allowing them to trap and grow their own food, trade supplies, and manage their daily lives while the army and rebels fight it out. It's incredibly rewarding, when you succeed, but succees does not come without its frustrating moments. Every decision you make will affect the characters moods and psyches. Another interesting aspect of the game is that it tracks the decisions you make, logging how each of the characters responds to what is going on, and the decisions that have been made. It's in these logs that a tremendous amount of depth can be found, and for the methodical player who indulges in the story I imagine this game will provide experiences on par with a good movie or book.With the variety in player characters who vary in their needs, desires, and skills, the changing map and random locations, along with what happens at each will change every playthrough, and the war has no verifiable end point the game provides excellent replayability. It is an engaging survivor experience, and a harrowing story that echoes the lives of people from all over the world in some of humanitie's darkest hours. Highly recommended for those interested in a mature theme handled very well, survivor sim fans, and those who like depth and great characterization.			"

												When playing This War of Mine I notice something. After spending a lot of time trying to figure out the mechanics in the game I started thinking ""I should restart"". Under normal circumstances that way of thinking isn't weird or odd but... This was different.One of my characters; Bruno, died. Soon two more would if I couldn't fix bandages to one and medicine for the other. Its kind of hard to find those things at the same night. But not only that. They have both been struggling for a long time already. Meaning even if I would find the items it might be to late. But...Starting over would help me as I had already played for some time now and understood the mechanics better.""Start over"" - My head said to me. Each night I saw everything going to hell. ""Start over. Then you will have it better chance"".I started wondering ""But how could I?"". This is war.""For some people this is real. Not all, but many."". I have tools that tells me what I will get. Hell! Tell me to do a rainwater collector on a random day without me knowing and see how far I would get. No Internet. No library. No neighbors that might have that knowledge. Its honestly a chilling thought.""Start over"". I can't. In real life these people wouldn't be able to start over. Life doesn't have a restart button. Depressing, isn't it?But I feel like this is actually a great game mechanic that might be looked away from. The unknown of doing something for the first time. Not knowing what is right or wrong. Pretty much just hoping that what you did is the right move at the time.As in life.Thats why I continue on playing with these characters. I need to see them through.One of my characters Emilia comes back home from a night of scavening. She comes in and sits down.Staring.Staring blankly into nothing.Someone raided the house again. This time with brute force. Pavile died during the night from the wounds that Emilia bandaged him with before I sent her out to scavange.I gave Katie meds to survive through the night but after this night she left.Only one person lives in the house now. Emilia. Still staring.With no hope left in her.Even later when someone bangs on the door yelling for help she doesn't move. I press on the button to make her open the door to see if there might be something to help her, some hope left... but... She just sits there.Broken.The day goes by and night falls again. My only options is to let Emilia sleep. She's too depressed to do anything else.Next day comes.A picture of someones feet hovering just above the ground flashes infront of me.Emilia, is dead.Suicide.In the end, not every move you do turns out to be the right one. But you learn. Take it to heart and try again. And again.Life doesn't have a restart button as this game has.			"

An excellent game.Honestly, this is just one of those games that truly leaves an imprint on your mind. It's truly unique, every aspect of this game just makes you question every war that has ever happened, was it really worth it? The game is presented through the eyes of civilians, not heroic soldiers like you'd see in CoD or BF, everything you do, is done by people caught in the crossfire.Now, poetry aside. The game is really well made, the soundtrack has that chilling/depressing backbone to it, really adding some spice to the already depressing game. Everything you do leaves an impact on your little community, every hour wasted, every scavenging day missed, everything counts. There are no impulsive decisions in this game, you have to put a lot of thought into everything you do, is raiding that apartment really worth it? I mean, there's innocent people living there, but your community is starving. Which is it? Which side of morality will you take?10/10, get it.			"

												What an amazing game, incredibly fun, and plain brutal. If you like rougelike's and survival that is unlike any other game I've ever played then this is for you, wether your crawling through ruins looking for materials or choosing which of your group to feed the last can of food to so that they may have the strength to go out to scavenge and fight in the coming night the game keeps you engaged and making the hard choices that keep the experience visceral and impactful. 10/10also looking through the crack in a door in a ruin you thought you were alone in and then deciding wether you want to risk your survivor in a knife fight for what that guy might be carrying is a heady and rewarding choice just for the suspense.

												A good survival game but the replay value wasnt that great for me. I finished one scenario and had a great time doing that. For replay though, the sites you scavange may differ as far as when they get revealved when but the sites are the same each time you play. Some sites may not show at all but there seems to be a bank of sites built up and then the scenario chooses from those. I am not sure if the loot is random but the mobs inside each site seem to be set and you know what youre up against before you get there. Once you get a good gameplan in the first scenario all you have to do is try and repeat that again on subsequent scenarios. I started a 2nd game and ended up getting bored and stopped. It would be nice if they randomized what people were in each site.The game itself runs great and keeps you on your toes. I enjoyed the strategy and how you cant save progress. When someone in your group dies you really feel it and killing somoene out in the field feels just about as bad. For instance, early on I was scared of anyone I bumped into and I ended up killing an elderly man in his home. The characters get depressed and you have to deal with that. "

												This game, as several reviews state, is unlike any other. It's a dark, horrible environment that you play in, with tough decisions to be made.  Some will save your group but make them depressed, others will use precious resources but cheer your group up, and some may get you killed.I will state now that I haven't made it past day 14, I usually get to that stage (with various group lineups) and decide to take a chance at a 'dangerous' scavenge and always find myself dead fairly quick.  I know I should delay the 'dangerouss until I have better gear and resources but I always start to panic at 2 weeks heh.What it does show me is that this isn't a game you can rush.  Everything is slow and careful, some nights (later in the game) with no scavenging but scouting instead (if you have the right group set up).  You need to plan in advance your resources, both food and workshop.The graphics are very atmospheric, adding to the darkness and grittiness of the game.  It's black, white and grey,  No other colours, so don't expect a pretty game.You start off with a few set group choices, and often in the game other characters will appear asking to join you.  There are plenty of guides on Steam that explain each characters pros and cons, and I really recommend reading them.  Some you will want to be cruel and turn away.And that leads to, in my mind, the one bad thing about the game.  The characters and their skills.  Some skills are still unknown, others aren't obvious, some are just generally useless.  All of which leads to a set 4-5 chars you want in your group.  Every guide states the same.  I've tried it my own way and found that yup, the longest I've lasted is with at least 2 of those 4-5.  It's the same chars over and over again, which gets dull and boring.  It would be nice to mix it up, perhaps chars with 2 main skills each, allowing cross-over and use of the other 'useless' chars in the game.  Please note, by useless I mean long-term use.  Each has a skill which could be useful if the game was easier and you could support 6-8 chars easily.  You can't.  The most you can generally support AND survive the 40 days is 4 chars.  So you have to be brutal and choose only the most useful out of all 12 chars.  It just so happens it's the same 4-5 chars every time :-(However, if you ignore that one con, the rest of the game is amazing and addictive.  Hours pass by without you realising it, as you concentrate on your group so much, and what you need next, then it's just one more scavenge so I can make item xxx then I'll log out, but you make xxx then realise you need to make item yyy so it's just another quick scavenge...When you get to approx day 10-11, it opens up new group set-ups on the main menu.This War of Mine is one of the few games that I actually read the 'bunff', in this case the character's and their stories.  I read each and look forward to learning more about them.  Each story seems dark (as with everything in the game) and sad, and gives a terrible perspective about what it is really like to survive in such a situation.  I have yet to finish them, but there are guides on Steam that tell every character's story.  Personally, I want to wait until I've earnt it.However, I do recommend reading some of the guides on how to survive.  Don't just read one, but several, as each gives different advice, some work for some people and some for others.  After trying and testing, I've found I do bits from all of them.  I did try doing it without reading the guides to start with and never made it past day 5.  After reading the guides, I found out where I was going wrong and it made a huge difference.So to end.  This game is definately worth the money.  It seems to be well supported by its developer.  It's a dark, gritty and brutal game, and that works.			"

												   In all honesty this was simply one of the best games I have ever played.    From an ethical perspective of what the game is trying to achieve This War of Mine wins hands down. If you have ever had to deal with real life stressors like poverty, crime, divorce, debt, unemployment, addictions, etc... This War of Mine does a really good job of replicating those frustrations while still being fun and light hearted enough to be teachable. By this I don't mean fun the sense of ""Yay I am in a warzone"". No. I mean that this game is to War what fire drills are to real house fires. When you loose you will feel it in your bones to a degree you would not in any other game with violence. When you win you'll feel hallow, regretful, bitter, but self satisfied all the same. Man is a beast and you beat Mother Nature. Where this game succeeds is that it tries to be a game of real life simulation (Sims with guns perhaps) but instead it turns out to be the most realistic Horror game you will ever play. When combined with very good graphics, very good story telling, strategy problems that actually matter, as well as dilemas that go beyond what anyone would ever experience in the above situations, you will be not just more thankful of what you have in your real life after playing but more concious of what you have to loose if ever a Hurricane Katrina, Greek Style Nation wide Bankruptcy, or San Fransico like Earthquake situation ever occurs and you are not prepared. Between this, the Walking Dead, and the daily news I'm not yet a prepper but definately more concious of life and its risks.    "

												The second I started playing the game I was hooked. Think of DayZ (without zombies) meets the sims. You can make your survivors do whatever you wish, but they will react accordingly. Making the wrong decisions can lead to starvation, illness, hypothermia, and even suicide. You will constantly be forced to choose between your humanity and your survival. Buy this game.			"

												In my humble opinion, this is is another gaming triumph that clearly shows that video games are also a type of art, like movies, books and music.Beautiful visuals, sad music, depressing atmosphere. Game that focus on pure survival of couple of people. Every day you have to make a choice. What to build? Who eats and who will be hungry that day? Who gets daily medicine and who doesn't? To help a neighbour and risk your life or just ignore them? To trade or to steal? To kill to survive or to try to run away? WHom to trust? Where to scavenge for items needed for survival. How many days untill the war is over? Are your survivors mentally strong to overcome painfulf times....or they will reach for some  less ""noble""? Painfull choices every day...The only drawback is that game can become monotone, but that is a really small flaw.Overall, a game that every gamer should try...two thumbs up!!!			"

												Not much can be said for this game that has not already been said. It’s deep and moving, not a run and gun. The mechanics are steady and make you feel very immersed.Pros:+The Line of Sight method on this game is beautiful, and very well implemented.+Graphics are great.+Sounds are wonderful.+Scavenging is realistic and clean, feels satisfying.+Game hits ya hard in the feels.+Forces deep moral choices, steal from a hospital and kill people, or let one of your own die?Meh:‘Depression system, though good and deep, I felt it was a little tricky to actually make anyone stay happy.‘Crafting system, fine, but didn’t get to deep, few building materiels, but it fits the game well.‘Late game can get very hard to juggle roles with many injured hungry and tired. I found this fun, but some might find it tedious. Cons:-Some areas can be exploited and have no negative repercussions when they should. Aside from that the game’s pretty good.Sum it up, the games deep, and not for the light hearted gamer. It will touch you and, might be to hardcore for some. It’s pretty much amazing, in many ways, this game is more then just a game, it’s an experience, and if you have the heart for it, go and try it out.			"

												First things first this is a great game, and if you are even thinking about buying it then please for the love of God buy it, You will not regrett it. It's hard to really explaine it but I will try my best to show you what happend to me.Day 1: I jumped right into the game, fixed up the house, added a bed, etc.Day 1(Night): Picked over abondoned buildingDay 2: nothing newDay 3: running low on foodDay 4: Built a radioDay 4(Night): Went to scavenge the supermarket and found a soldier trying to convince a hungry girl for an exchange of sex and food. I opened the door and stabbed the soldier to death. I then took his machine gun and scavenged the rest of the market.Day 5: I'm injured, hungry and tired.Day 6(Night): Found a hospital.Day 7: Marko dies from severe wounds.Day 8: Hungry, hurt, depressed.Day 9: Woman shows up at our door and askes us if she can stay with us, we say yes.Day 9(Night): As the woman I go to a quiet house, peeked through the keyhole and see a man and woman, couple, sitting by the fire talking. I walk in with my nife drawn, they scream, the man begs for he and his wifes life, they run. I followed them up they stairs, they both begged for mercy. I walked up to the man and stabbed him to death, the woman starts crying, I stab her too. I then looted the house and got only a few cans of food.Day 10: The woman, well call her Jess, who showed up at our door is majorly depressed.Day 11: Everyone is Hungry, Depressed, Sick, and most are wounded.Day 12(Night):  Jess goes to a house, three women were inside, probably sisters, one was armed. I climbed in through the back window, waited for the first sister and and stabbed her to death, at this point the other sister had seen what I did, she called me a murderer and started crying, I stabbed her to death, the armed sister saw and told me I was going to die, I barly won the fight and got a free shotgun plus some badly needed meds.(Fast foward a few days of deppression, killing, hungryness, tiredness and everyone is wounded atleast a little bit)Day 18: Bruno left us, he never came back...-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------At this point I turned off the game and rethought my whole life.

												First off I would like to commend 11Bit studios on creating such a unique slant to the war - game genre, though I don't think this title can be or should be placed into said category, its more of a strategy title.This ‘game’ has thoroughly enthralled me over the better course of two weeks and find myself completing or ‘surviving’ over half of the 12 ‘missions’With that, I think that there are a few things lacking:Longevity - each ‘story’ is very similar, you can essentially do everything, interact with everything, and see everything with in two ‘stories’ on my 6th ‘story’ it turned into more of a grind to reach survival, and mashing end turn or ‘stay inside button' for day 42 through 45.Speed of AI - very slow, too much time is spent waiting for water to be distilled, counseling of characters that get ‘depressed’ characters going up/down ladders, characters completing tasks, ‘loading’ of the nights ‘events’ at the beginning of the next day is also slow, as well as the loading of each scavenging map, the fast forward button was created way back in the day by JVC, yet none available here.Too much repetition - really the only excitement and break in the monotony of scavenging resources is directing a character to shoot or backstab an unwitting NPC. Would be nice to have some add ons, another set of new ‘stories’ with new maps perhaps?Too little interaction with in world - Im starving but cant kill any little protein bags (rats) running around under my feet? (Other than setting traps in my building) I also can't scavenge a working TV for its parts? Or bring it back for morale boost.Glitches - If you make food at the stove, and leave it there ‘overnight’ you can not utilize the following day, it will show that there is ‘cooked’ food, but if you try to feed it to another character or use, it gets ‘stuck’ in a loop, and you will need to complete the day to progress and to ‘break’ the loop, if you build another stove that one will glitch as well, and you will not be able to cook any food.Garage glitch - (actually useful, but I don't think intended) If you manage to steal items from the ‘son’ and make it without getting killed, you can return the following day and the ‘son’ is not guarding the first room, he’s backed up into the fathers room. You are free to scavenge and remove multiple useful items. Booty gets restocked daily as long as son/father stays alive. If son dies, and father remains alive the third scavenging location inside of the basement ‘kitchen’ restocks daily.Church glitch - essentially same as above, remove items from scavenge area that Patrick is guarding, make it out alive, return the next day and Patrick is backed up into the second roomPatrick can also die, as long as the Father upstairs stays alive, the first scavenge point that Patrick was guarding restocks.Again, a very engaging experience, and great ‘darksy artsy’ feel overall, just needs to be expanded, perhaps different struggles as a civilian WW2, WW3? And why just survive getting your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you daily? How about the ability if you play your ‘cards’ right to thrive and build a community. A community with capabilities to expand into other areas of the neighborhood rebuilding the infrastructure as you go and having the ability to play beyond the 45th day, if you so desire			"

Try to avoid spoilers and guides as much as you can with it so you have no idea what will happen next or how to cope with it - I have a feeling that once you know which order to prioritise things and what is too risky it will become a logical order and remove the real essence of the game, which is taking uneducated guesses of what lies around the corner and coping with difficult surprises.

												This game.....is simply great!A new survival game on the market thats not all about kill!,action!,guns!,and rather focuses on the actual side viewers,the civilians in the whole war,what they have to go through every single day of the war,how it makes them change from normal day to day life.....and reveals who they really are...and what they will do just to survive...while the game lacks any sort of real training system to help you start its not all that hard to figure out how to play and soon enough you will ease into it.the atmosphere of the game is amazing! the gunfire and tank shells in the backround while you are in your house in daytime is great and makes you feel like you are actually in a war and you are about to get shelled by a tank or a plane!,you fear for your survivers which are chosen at random at the start of the game and along the way more may join you.each time you send them out to scavenge for much needed supplies in order to survive the coming days puts them in the utmost danger,a simple gun shot from a random hobo may instantly kill them,and once there dead they are lost forever....not just for you...but for the other survivers as well,they can have emotional breakdowns which could make them not want to do anything,or even lead them to suicide....will you be able to survive this game?this war?......check the game out and lets see ;] "

												Do I like this game? No. This game has a deep, dark subject matter that if you ""Like"" this game you are a heartless person. But this game, is one of the best I've played in that regard. I've just started, barely a week in to my first lets play and I can already say with completely certainty this is a must buy game. The soundtrack is dark and depressing. The game has a grey scale filter to it, adding to this sense of eternal darkness. You prepare by day and scavenge by night. There is so much in this game that makes me want to cry. I've just lost my first survivor and it's probably the saddest I have ever felt in a long time. Real world or otherwise. It feels like a genuine human loss. The DLC model is really, really good. Two piece's of DLC. You have the soundtrack which is free. I love the soundtrack, it makes me want to cry. I love it so much. There's also a cheap dlc that goes straight to warchild and adds 8 pieces of grafiti for you to find, drawn by real war survivors. This is one of the best games I have ever played, and I can't recommend it enough.			"

												Excellent Game. I was sceptical at first as to the gameplay and the way it looked but when you start playing its very addicting. I made it to Day 25 before my crew all died...as for a first try, I think that is not too bad :)Gameplay is great, the graphics are good. I like that you get to pick who and where you scavenge and you get to go with them and do it yourself.When they are hurt or hungry the way they move and act reflect that.**SPOILERS**I started out with 3 people. Throught the course of the game they got there shelter fixed and where able to build a few items. Food was hard to come by though.My first guy died while scavenging at the supermarket. He only had a knife to defend himself and there was a soldier who was harassing a women. My guy went to save her. She got away but he was shot and killed.Which left only 2 to scavenge and protect our home.The next one died, also while scavenging, coming across some guys.Which then left on guy left. He was wounded in a raid, the food was gone. He had to stay a recuperate for a few days but then had to go out scavenging because he was starving. He did alright for awhile. But it took a tole on him as he was so hungry he robbed an elderly couple of all thier food and every night we got raided cause there was no one there to protect our home.Finally in a last ditch effort for scavenging he was at the hospital and had a shoot out and was killed.

												When playing This War of Mine I notice something. After spending a lot of time trying to figure out the mechanics in the game I started thinking ""I should restart"". Under normal circumstances that way of thinking isn't weird or odd but... This was different.One of my characters; Bruno, died. Soon two more would if I couldn't fix bandages to one and medicine for the other. Its kind of hard to find those things at the same night. But not only that. They have both been struggling for a long time already. Meaning even if I would find the items it might be to late. But...Starting over would help me as I had already played for some time now and understood the mechanics better.""Start over"" - My head said to me. Each night I saw everything going to hell. ""Start over. Then you will have it better chance"".I started wondering ""But how could I?"". This is war.""For some people this is real. Not all, but many."". I have tools that tells me what I will get. Hell! Tell me to do a rainwater collector on a random day without me knowing and see how far I would get. No Internet. No library. No neighbors that might have that knowledge. Its honestly a chilling thought.""Start over"". I can't. In real life these people wouldn't be able to start over. Life doesn't have a restart button. Depressing, isn't it?But I feel like this is actually a great game mechanic that might be looked away from. The unknown of doing something for the first time. Not knowing what is right or wrong. Pretty much just hoping that what you did is the right move at the time.As in life.Thats why I continue on playing with these characters. I need to see them through.One of my characters Emilia comes back home from a night of scavening. She comes in and sits down.Staring.Staring blankly into nothing.Someone raided the house again. This time with brute force. Pavile died during the night from the wounds that Emilia bandaged him with before I sent her out to scavange.I gave Katie meds to survive through the night but after this night she left.Only one person lives in the house now. Emilia. Still staring.With no hope left in her.Even later when someone bangs on the door yelling for help she doesn't move. I press on the button to make her open the door to see if there might be something to help her, some hope left... but... She just sits there.Broken.The day goes by and night falls again. My only options is to let Emilia sleep. She's too depressed to do anything else.Next day comes.A picture of someones feet hovering just above the ground flashes infront of me.Emilia, is dead.Suicide.In the end, not every move you do turns out to be the right one. But you learn. Take it to heart and try again. And again.Life doesn't have a restart button as this game has.			"

												This War of Mine is a modern day classic, and with the number of excellent mods, tools, and scenarios preesnt in the game, will keep the hardcore fans happy for years to come. It's an incredible exploration of the moral dilemmas that face survivors in a war zone. The tone and color of the game is as fitting as its subject matter, painting the world as a cold, ill-toned, nightmare world, draped in gray. It is a world where the survivors wake day after day into boredom, mundanity, fear, and hope, hope that the war will end the next day, or the next, or the next. Where the temptation to steal or to kill is a constant, and the possibility of death is an ever present danger. The type of game the developers chose to pursue is really excellent, taking the setting and tone seriously, providing a crafting mechanism borne of scavenging, and with a tremendous focus on just pure survival instead of trying to build some form of of empire in the midst of a combat zone creates a tension that is hard to match. The atmosphere is thick with desperation and your group is just one of many that finds themselves cold, hungry, and willing to go to extremes in order to make it just a few more days. The game is not forgiving in any way, which player's should be aware of. The first few attempts will likely end in terrible failure, likely with your consistent scavenger succumbing to sniper fire, or being killed in a violent knife fight, leaving the other players without food, or medical supplies. There is a constant sense of crawling uphill, making small gains only to lose them and feel yourself slide back down. When you do learn the mechanics, what to build and when, as well as how to handle yourself outside of your shelter you will find yourself being able to carve out a life for these people, allowing them to trap and grow their own food, trade supplies, and manage their daily lives while the army and rebels fight it out. It's incredibly rewarding, when you succeed, but succees does not come without its frustrating moments. Every decision you make will affect the characters moods and psyches. Another interesting aspect of the game is that it tracks the decisions you make, logging how each of the characters responds to what is going on, and the decisions that have been made. It's in these logs that a tremendous amount of depth can be found, and for the methodical player who indulges in the story I imagine this game will provide experiences on par with a good movie or book.With the variety in player characters who vary in their needs, desires, and skills, the changing map and random locations, along with what happens at each will change every playthrough, and the war has no verifiable end point the game provides excellent replayability. It is an engaging survivor experience, and a harrowing story that echoes the lives of people from all over the world in some of humanitie's darkest hours. Highly recommended for those interested in a mature theme handled very well, survivor sim fans, and those who like depth and great characterization.			"

												Words do not even begin to describe how mesmerizing this game is. I spent quite a while playing around with it and getting to know the mechanics before finishing my first playthrough, and I couldn't help but notice I frequently found myself with goosebumps, or biting my nails wondering if I was going to have enough to make it through the night, let alone through the whole war. When the end finally rolled around it was so rewarding just to feel like I finally had survived. Will start again tomorrow.10/10			"

												This game is a beautiful reminder of why war is awful and why we try to avoid it. it's deep, emotional, depressing. these atmospheres set up great moments that can be so little. For example, after nights of raider attacks you finally manage to arm your people and keep your home safe. Successfully gathering a great amount of supplies without robbing or killing anyone. The tone of the game is that alot of bad happens, but what little good there is can be amazing. Though there are a few things that can be a bit funny. like robbing someone, and a person at your shelter/home/whatever eats the food you robbed but gets mad at the person who stole the food, and exclaims this point WHILE EATING THE STOLEN FOOD. but in short, definitely a great game.

												I found a elderly couple with a lot of supplies living in seclusion without weapons, decided it would be useful to loot them and kill them as they wont live long anyway, you know, probably doing them a favour anyway, if I dont do it now quickly, someone else will do it later and perhaps less mercilessly, and besides they're alone, who will miss them?To this day I still wake up in the dead of the night in a cold sweat and short of breath because of what I did to Bernard and his wife. Their memory still haunts me. I am a changed man, a man more desensitised from the horrors of war. I did it all for a bit of raw meat and a rusty crowbar in the end. Was it worth it?11/10 would regret slaughtering an elderly couple again.			"

												“This War of Mine” is a very challenging game, putting you in the difficult situation of managing scarce resources and determines you to create minimum living conditions for your group of survivors. What I love about this game is:1.	The unique and unsettling atmosphere well created by 11 BIT Studio of a modern day city terrorised by unfair war.2.	Impressive character mechanics. I am more than satisfied of the fluent (all most realistic) ways the characters are doing chores or any activity to be honest, from fighting to looting and idle stances.3.	The game is difficult and it can be really frustrating at times. Losing a survivor because some small stupid decision or not enough caution; living with the uncertainty that the place you choose to loot or to trade won’t give you the necessary items to deal with a certain crisis back in your shelter; or never having enough food, meds or parts to do the necessary upgrades; these are things that made me restart the game all over again several times, but nonetheless it kept me going for hours until I found an optimum way to manage resources and visit the appropriate places for loot.4.	I love the combat system. You can go guns blazing but the most efficient way is stealth and tactics. You need to lure the enemy by making noise or simply just sneak at their backs and knock them down.Overall it’s an amazing game. I thank 11BIT Studio for being so creative and bringing great value in our gamer’s hearts  "

												Definitely my favorite game from 2014. An eerie, chilling and yet strangely compelling adventure that will hook you for hours on end. Your only hope for survival in this war-torn city is interraction, scavenging and avareness, and as these are no easy tasks, you will face challenges and moral decisions matching those of any triple-A titles. Worth buying? YES!			"

												One of the most original survival games I have ever played. Some people doesn't want it because it isn't fps or 3rd person but I think that the game is much more better and original this way. It is based on a true event so it makes it even more creepier. I sincerely liked the characters and the story in this game, it is really detailed yet I hoped to see a bigger wolrd and more varitaions also it kinda felt weird to not be allowed to get out of your house if it isn't night yet that is just a minor problem. I hope the game would have a sequal or have new features like; co-op, bigger map or a more detailed story. Expect that it was really fun playing it. I am in day 42 and I still hope there might be a ceasefire soon...at least I hope...			"

												If you have even the slightest interest in playing a game that veers itself off from the usual ""rambo"" style gameplay and narrative then I will highly recommend that you get this game. Not many games out there that can or are willing to capture the extremely horrifying and depressing nature of wars like This War of Mine does. The game also does a great job of making you care and feel for the characters, especially those in your group. I still remember the sinking feeling when my group suffered  their first casualties due to a scavaging trip gone wrong and that was enough to put me off for a short while before I decided to continue on with the game and completed my play through. This is one of the best indie games that I've played and I can't wait to see what the developers come up with next.			"

												'This War Of Mine' should be more like 'This War Of Ours'!It's an eye opening experience that is once in a life time for a game, as you feel what it is like for our soldiers out there, fighting. But most of all it's about those civilians who have the worst effects of countless government actions. If you want a game that will leave you breakthless, emotive, and slightly depressed whilst at the same time making you turn to a life of drinking, this is the game for you!Ignore those haters; cause the haters gonna hate!

Some of things may have been more of a grey area, but this game forces you to define your boundry between good and evil.

												So far the game has been an absolute blast! A friend showed the game to me last night and it didn't take long for me to also decide to get it. The world is dark and grim and the characters have a good amount of depth to them. You'll have to make tough decisions that reflect on your characters' mood and mental well-being as well. The game portrays the psychological effects of war and living in such dire environments very well.One of the most unique and interesting games I've come across this year for sure. Then again we've only played it for around 7 hours now with a friend and I'm not too sure about the longevity of the game. So far it's been great but I can potentially see it getting a bit repetitive and boring after dozens of hours. Then again, what game doesn't?			"

												It took me 22 hours to get a play through where any of my survivors actually made it to the end of the war (which feels like a moral imperitive after playing this game). It's not complicated and not easy either - but it doesn't need to be. It really has a very straightforward mechanic where you manage a small group of survivors and juggle actions based on needs influenced by outside forces: robbers, sickeness, weather, and your ability to find and trade resources. It's really a well-designed game and one beautifully rendered. In fact, I would say that ""This War of Mine"" is a game so well designed that it puts to shame the big-budget studios engaged in churning out glossy, over-produced crap like Assassin's Creed or Call of Duty. ""This War of Mine"" is a dark, thought-provoking experience that pushes the boundary of what we think about video games.			"

												I bought this game pretty much as soon as it came out. And so far, I have enjoyed it immensly. The art style is beautiful and the soundtrack is very menacing. The game has forced me to change my style of gameplay in order to conserve materials and food, leading to some hard decisions concerning the game world. I have a few niggles... One, I would prefer there to be a more randomised selection of starting peeps, because I am not a big fan of the three that you can end up starting with. Two, some kind of bar that will let you see how tired/sick/wounded they are so you can see how long they will need to spend resting, it would be really useful. Overall, I thoroughly enjoy this game and I am eagerly looking forward to seeing any expansion or new characters that might emerge from this very hard, but very rewarding game. Keep up the good work guys! I am impressed!			"

												What do we say to Death? Not toda... DAMN IT PAVLOV, STOP DIEING!Jokes and (Krillin-imitator) Pavlov aside, let's review this interesting piece of gaming.This War of Mine is a mix of survival RPG, ressource management game and... well... politique/gamingindustry critical thing? Opposed to many games where war is glorified, usuallywith you as dozen-killing murder machine up front, this time you're on the other side: You control a group (well, sometimes just a single one) of civilians, trying to simply survive.The core aspect of the game are you attempts to satisfy the basic needs: Food, Sleep, Health, Morale.Food is rather straight forward: Gather food cans, gather meat and vegetables, cook latter too or eat them raw.Sleep isn't that much difficult, either: Just build 1 or 2 beds and have the survivors take turns resting.However, that's where the easy part stops; health: You forgot to keep your room temperature high, or maybe RNGesus just hates you? You get sick. You accidentally touch that cabinet (which is locked anyways) or step across a certain invisible line and get shot? Run for your life and pray you survive... and don't get wounded too heavyly. But even if you never leave your house, you will end up wounded by hostile scavengers/bandits trying to loot YOU, too. Medical supplies are expensive and rare... and even if you got some, the patients need to heal over time by resting. Whilst someone still needs to stand guard at night and someone needs to scavenge more ressource under cover of night (since only NPC's seem to be able to ignore the 'snipers shoot you if you go outside on day' rule)... and with 2 patients you end up with no beds, so both of those will crawl around ina  zombie-like state of sleep depreviation.And if people get really tired or hungry, or someone gets killed, or even if you steal from another survivor group... morale drops across multiple levels until your survivors just suicide.Truly, the game is neither shallow, nor forgiving and certainly not easy. I'm still trying to beat it. I was having a good run recently, where I started in a cold snap (bad, because you need to burn stuff to avoid just freezing to death and literally everyone keeps catching colds until you upgrade the heater), built a radio and heard that the NATO is gonna intervene into the war (which means the usually 45-day long game can end instantly). I set out, managed to survive, looking forward to the announcement that on day 15 the ceasefire would go into effect... only to hear on day 13 that the ceasefire treaty was cancelled. Instead of a easy win, I get a follow-up where my scavenger is shot by soldiers and a crime wave with bandits trying to rob me every single night. Let's see how long the bandages/ammo lasts...What I can tell you, so far, is that the game is definitely hard. It's unforgiving and the slightest missstep can spell doom to your entire run. On top of that it's very well randomized, with every location (which pop up at random, too) having multiple level layouts, which again can have multiple scenarios.""Construction Site which may be visited by rebel patrols?""-First run: I carefully explore it, just to see that it's desolate and only contains building materials.-Second run: Knowing it's safe, I run in to grab some wood and promptly get shot by soldiers.""Church, where the father is still trying to keep up a resort of peace and trading""-First run: A overprotective priest who will not let me enter the church's basement to not scare the civilians hidden there and a large empty ruin that yields barely anything, after working my way through a large tunnel and wasting tools.-Second run: I find a group of thugs who celebrate burning down the church after killing the priest and 'having fun' with the people he tried to protect.On top of that your very start can be highly varied. A good dozen different survivors are avaible, some which are really good (Marko, can carry 50% more then most other characters and loots faster), some which just feel like useless mouths (Anton, a retired math professor). And sometimes you just start with a single guy who might commit suicide form loneliness after a few days.... and I love it.Result: 8.5/10It might lack in complexity at some point and the difficulty seems to fall off once you (somehow managed to) stockpiled supplies. Some mechanics seem inbalanced and can be exploited (Steal tons of supplies from hospital, everyone gets sad. Return the next day and 'donate' a single box of pills, everyone goes cheerful over 'supporting the hospital'). And sometimes the interface feels obstrusive (note, it is deliberately designed to simple mouse interaction, as it wil be released on mobile devices next spring).But past that, a really nice survival sim with a new, and certainly refreshing view on war.

												Day 8.Survivors: Katia, Pavle, Marin and Bruno.Food situation: Starving.Water: Hydrated.Materials: Getting there.Pavle and Katia, my main two scavengers. After last night Pavle was spent, he needed the rest, but the group needed food.Katia, slightly wounded but bandaged, I had to take the risk and make her scavenge that night. Marin the new one in the group, had boarded up the windows, but that didn't stop the raiders from getting in and taking all our food.I put two people on watch this night, I wasn't taking the chance.I select the Motel, we've been there before, it's occupied by a group of nice people, they're actually willing to trade.But I don't have enough to trade for anything.Katia sneaks around, hoping to get some food for the group. She's running out of options and the hours creep past. 3 hours to go, I make her head to the exit, they hear me running, one yells out""Is someone there?"" he heads down the steps and looks around, gun in his hand, but he hasn't the will to use it.This is it, Day 8, if I don't get food now I won't make it a fortnight into this.I swallow my humanity, This needs to be done, for Pavle, Marin and Bruno, Katia thinks to herself and races in, stabs the man and  his body falls to the floor, a friend of his hears the commotion and comes to take me out, I kill him after a struggle and the third runs.So I dash to the fridge on the second floor, and take everything I can.There's heaps, they're saved.I take it all, but the third is standing over me as I exit the loot screen, he stares in horror and Katia's eyes meet his, his gun trembling in his hand, and I notice it. I make Katia run to the exit, the man watchs me leave but only follows a short while.Day 9Survivors: Katia, Pavle, Marin and Bruno.Food situation: We'll be fine for a while.Water: 7.8/10 too much water -IGNMaterials: Getting worse.Katia returns, tears rolling down her face, and as she arrives through the door she screams, ""I'm done, that's it, no more death.""Marin goes to talk to her, we only hear the first part, the rest, nothing. Pavle, Bruno and Katia go to eat, but Marin can't, he's too disgusted in what has happened, Pavle walks up and gives him a bowl of Bruno's cooking and says ""come on, we have to stay alive.And he eats.Why did I tell a story instead of a review? because this only just happened in my game, and I'm as destroyed watching this as the characters are.This story based roguelike will tear you down and move you each time despite doing this over and over in millions of other survival management games.What will your story be? will you survive your first try? or will This War of Mine take you as another casualty. before this session, This War of Mine was in my All Games list, Now it's in my favourites.10/10			"

												This War of Mine is a depressing survival game set in a war zone, where civilians must try to survive against hunger, bandits, sickess and depression. After my short playthrough of this game I can say that it is polished thoroughly so far; have not encountered any game-breaking bugs or crashes. Mechanics are fun and engaging. It reminds me a ton of State of Decay and Project Zomboid, but without the zombies! (who needs zombies to make a survival game great anyway)Great little game that has excellent replay value and takes a long time to complete. This is an indie GEM that deserves many awards for its intuitive design, aesthetic and character.			"

												This game, in my opinion, is GREAT. It may not be the ""happiest"" game, or the ""most perky"" but I love it! It can have some difficult moments, though. Moments when, everything was perfectly fine about 2 minutes ago, but now, it's pretty tough. For example, my experience-One of my characters, Bruno, was sick, but he was gaurding the house because everyone else was exhausted or scavaging. We were raided that night, leaving us with no food, barely any medicine, and a wounded Bruno. So, Bruno later became depressed. all of this happened when my scavager, Katia, was out and came back with some bandages for Bruno, but no food. But things were still looking up. Later, Katia went out again to get food and medicine for Bruno's sickness, she got some but had to steal from an old sick couple. They were defenseless, and they could only watch her steal from them which makes me feel awful and Katia depressed. But she did get some banadages and enough food for every one. No medicine. She came back to find two kids needing medicine for there mother, since we didn't have any, we said ""later"". Night comes back around, Katia goes out again. This time, she was caught by two people, who I thought were violent and going to try to kill Katia, so I made her run back home empty handed. I later found out that we were raided, lost all of the food we JUST got, that Bruno attacked the third member of the group, Palve (who is now wounded), and now EVERYONE is depressed. A few seconds later, there was someone at the door. The kids from the other day, and we didn't have any medicine. So Katia had to tell them that we didn't have any and they left. Katia is now broken inside, sitting on the porch rethinking everything. Now I'm pretty sure that Katia is going to leave, and the rest of my survivors are going to die from their injuries or from starvation. This game makes up for the lack of happiness in entertainingly sad stories. So, yeah, 10/10			"

												A different take on war scenarios. As advertised, you don't play as soldiers fighting the opposing side. Instead, you get to play as civilians just looking to survive in a sieged city. Not much joy to be found here, everything from the music to the art style makes the game feel very bleak.Gameplay-wise, it's quite a simple game. The camera offers a 2D cutaway view of your surroundings at all times. All movement and interaction is done in a point-and-click style, and you pretty much never need to use your keyboard for anything. The game has a day-night cycle, and it's perhaps the most important aspect of the game. During the day you have full control of your whole group and you can improve your shelter as well as take care of the needs of all the people in the group. During the night you get to control a single person from your group as you scavenge around the city for supplies. While out in the city, you can meet both friendly and hostile NPC's, and you can also kill and/or rob supplies from others if you want to. The game can be quite hard no matter how you play. and you will need go scavenging pretty much every night, since there will always be a shortage of supplies.I don't think I could say I have fun playing this, as it's not exactly a game with much happiness in it, but I can say I enjoy playing this. It's a good game for what it is, and it's a refreshing change to most other war games out there. "

												Gritty survival game following a handful of people in a war torn city.  The game graphics are sort of dark / shaded but pretty and the music is quite  enjoyable.  It's a difficult survival game because each start is a random group of people with random skills.  Some individuals are good at scavenging supplies, some are good at cooking, some are good at singing (raising morale).  The gameplay consists of two parts, day and night.  During the day you use your characters to fix up your house and eat / move around.  You use materials to reinforice the house from intruders, build facilities or items (example: a stove, a crowbar, a garden, etc...).  During the night you send one person out to scavenge supplies from the local area.  During the night your scavenger can be attacked, killed, meet other people to trade, and so on.  Really worth your time.			"

												This War of Mine is a game based around a civil war that you have to brave your way through as you are stuck in the city during the conflict. This game is somewhat based off the Serbian-Bosnian conflict. In TWoM, you will get an connection with your survivors and there is a very looming chance you will lose at least 1 but a lot of the time all of your survivors. The game can last up to 45 in-game days and these 45 days are very intense. You will undergo attacks from bandits, cold weather, starvation, and sickness. There are ways to combat these things but, supplies run out very quickly. Good luck.			"

'This War of Mine' puts you in moral dilemmas nearly every day. Do you help your neighbor who is scared of being attacked, even when you risk putting the rest of the group in harms way? Would you steal from someone who is begging you for help, because you're in even worse shape?

												TL;DR+ You can't save. Every mistake you do is with you forever. Just like in real life.+ Great story and decision making+ Good soundtrack+ Simple, yet great graphics which provide a nice theme for the game.- You need patience. LOST of patience.- You start playing at 6pm and stop when your alarm clock goes off and you have to go to work. Almost happened to me.- Soundtrack is not so rich, after few hours of playing gets boring.At first i was a little bit sceptical about paying 16€ for such a simple game. Little did I know this game is far beyond simple. Now I know how hell for short-tempered people looks like. First 3 days i ragequited after as little as 10 days and then came January the 3rd. I've decided to really get into it and survive! Today, i had 3 hours of sleep before work and few minutes ago I have done it! Why is my mind blown? Because I am a spoiled child who quits the game if it isn't going as I planned. This game was a torture! And I didn't quit. I'm kind of proud of myself. Also the story is catchy, you really start caring about the people. Very good job and a good idea. 11/10 Ukranians would buy.			"

I didn't really have much coffee this morning, the scones my boss supplies didn't look appetizing, and I'm just in a generally negative mood.  You see, last night as I was playing, This War of Mine, I was extremely desperate to save my four survivors who were wounded, sick, and on the brink of starvation.  I was so desperate that I ended up breaking into a house and began looting it.  I heard footsteps, and hid in a corner.  As the intruder came closer I pulled out my axe and jumped the intruder from behind.  I hacked down a little boy with my axe, his sobbing mother who came to his side, and eventually the father who fell next to his family.  I truly feel like a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥in real life right now, not sure how I'm going to recover.

												Impresive game. Pure survival in times of war. Game concept is great since you are not forced to do anything. You might not need to kill or -maybe- steal. But you'll probably do. The game won't force you to make any unmoral call... but this is war and sometimes you just can't afford humanity. Gameplay is somewhat a full-controlled Sim's. You don't need to master your gamepad skills in order to do anything. Just point&click to go there, point&click to do that ... easy.On the not-so-friendly side is that there's is no tutorial and it might take a little while until you realize how easy the gameplay is and how it works. (Most probably the reason why they didnt do the tutorial.Probably one of the best games I ever met. I'm unsure, however, how much will I last  playing it. In the other hand, it's been 10 hours and I haven't fisnished my very first war (apparently, there are many things randomized so the replayability value should be great and there is Steam Workshop). Therefore, I think it could be enough even if you only play one single campaign (many games last much less than 10 hours.This game is UNIQUE. A must-play. We could even be talking about art-made-videogame.Go buy it.			"

												Probably one of the most interesting games in a long time.It reminded me a lot of ""I Am Alive."" atmouspheric wise and the concept were similar, but this time you had company and an actual shelter to look after, not to mention the health of your own survivors.Stealing or commiting murder may even cause your survivors to become depressed.I've never gotten to the point where any of them were depressed enough to commit suicide, but I'm sure it's possible that they will do so, if they don't deal with it somehow.Only real down side of this game is that most of the areas you visit becomes inaccessible due to war itself and there isn't enough available areas to really counter that. But except for that, I believe the game is great.Do please make an expansion that makes the game even bigger with more options etc etc.7.2/10.

												This game is intense, it reminds me of terraria or starbound, (just not as voxeling) You go out and try to find components and food (mainly food) just to stay alive during times of war, it is highly addicting, and replayability is easily achived, i would have more time played but i've been busy with work.the art style is amazing, its kind of like you are playing a book, theres no voice acting or anything but text but i could care less if there was voice acting.the combat is mouse clicking like crazy unless you have stealth perk and then you can sneak up on people and assassinate them with a knife in your inventory.the game gets progressively harder as you play, the days get colder and raids on your base get more intense (if you don't got guns by day 10 your followers will start getting injured)and damn people having feeling and feelin sorry for killing innocent people or stealing from other people!! makes scavaging hard to do unless you don't give a sh&t about your followers feelings!MUST HAVE SURVIVAL GAME OF 2015!!!P.S also sounds like the devs will be adding more even though they say the game is full release, hopfully see some more follower addons or other goodies!

												 You are not a hero, you are not a villian, you are just a person. In this game you play as just that, a person. When war wages around you, you do as anyone else around you will try and do, survive. If you choose to survive no matter what means, or try and be a morale person is all up to you. Afterall, in this war you report to no one but your needs, and your friends. Survive bandits, soilders, winter, hunger, sickness, and just others looking to survive by whatever means. One of my favorite games, with some replayabilty with new scenarios, locations, characters, and the DLC just adds more. If you want a unique survival game where you survive, rather then always fight your way out. This may be it, definelty recommended.			"

												I appreciate what this game is trying to do. My main complaint, though, is the lack of variety causes the game to feel repetitive and mechanical shortly after you've figured out how the game works. It can be challenging in the beginning when you're learning which supplies you should prioritize and when, the most efficient way to acquire those supplies, the most efficient way to feed your party, etc. But once all that is figured out (which I would say takes a couple hours at most), everything becomes routine and monotonous. As a result, you lose a lot of the empathy previously established for the characters in your party as you send them out to do the same thing over and over again with negligible risk of harm.It's the type of game where the first couple weeks require a bit of experimentation and trial and error, but once that's all sorted out, the remaining weeks are nothing but going through the motions and waiting to win the game.Still, I would recommend the game. It is interesting when everything is new, and the aesthetic and gaemplay are refreshingly different. Just don't expect to get too many hours out of this game, unless you are a completionist and can't help but beat the game with every possible combination of party members.			"

I could not feed her or anything. eventually the caretaker takes the child and runs away. fortunally this has only happened 1 time so far.2 sometimes when a character is depressed and i have them talk to someone (this happens when both charactors are on diffrent floors) they will turn to meet eachother and stop. once this has happened they will stand there until you end the day. not as bad as the first glitch though.summery:very good I highly recomend it.

Rank: 8/10Recommendation(s): Play a flash based survival game.Major Theme: Not your typical survival game.Bought at Price: $10.95It’s a survival game, but it’s not what you think. There are no zombies – for once! This War of Mine is just you and some other survivors who are living in an active war zone, trying to stay warm and survive until you can leave the city.I was able to beat the game on my first time touching the game, which I heard is not a typical experience. The game can prove to be a challenge, and will certainly test your morality. Is it ok to rat out your neighbour in exchange for food? Is it ok to steal from the defenceless? Are all humans really fit for survival?The art style is also unique, but don’t let the 2D platformer style fool you. The game does function very well for being played on platforms. Even some survivors will be able to navigate better than others will.Will you put hundreds of hours into the game? No, but you will certainly get your money’s worth.			"

												I think that this is one of the best games to be released in a long time. It provides original concepts and game mechanics in the over-produced survival genre. Filled with tough moral choices, difficult but fun gameplay and great character development that will leave you satisfied. I highly recommend this game.			"

												First off I would like to commend 11Bit studios on creating such a unique slant to the war - game genre, though I don't think this title can be or should be placed into said category, its more of a strategy title.This ‘game’ has thoroughly enthralled me over the better course of two weeks and find myself completing or ‘surviving’ over half of the 12 ‘missions’With that, I think that there are a few things lacking:Longevity - each ‘story’ is very similar, you can essentially do everything, interact with everything, and see everything with in two ‘stories’ on my 6th ‘story’ it turned into more of a grind to reach survival, and mashing end turn or ‘stay inside button' for day 42 through 45.Speed of AI - very slow, too much time is spent waiting for water to be distilled, counseling of characters that get ‘depressed’ characters going up/down ladders, characters completing tasks, ‘loading’ of the nights ‘events’ at the beginning of the next day is also slow, as well as the loading of each scavenging map, the fast forward button was created way back in the day by JVC, yet none available here.Too much repetition - really the only excitement and break in the monotony of scavenging resources is directing a character to shoot or backstab an unwitting NPC. Would be nice to have some add ons, another set of new ‘stories’ with new maps perhaps?Too little interaction with in world - Im starving but cant kill any little protein bags (rats) running around under my feet? (Other than setting traps in my building) I also can't scavenge a working TV for its parts? Or bring it back for morale boost.Glitches - If you make food at the stove, and leave it there ‘overnight’ you can not utilize the following day, it will show that there is ‘cooked’ food, but if you try to feed it to another character or use, it gets ‘stuck’ in a loop, and you will need to complete the day to progress and to ‘break’ the loop, if you build another stove that one will glitch as well, and you will not be able to cook any food.Garage glitch - (actually useful, but I don't think intended) If you manage to steal items from the ‘son’ and make it without getting killed, you can return the following day and the ‘son’ is not guarding the first room, he’s backed up into the fathers room. You are free to scavenge and remove multiple useful items. Booty gets restocked daily as long as son/father stays alive. If son dies, and father remains alive the third scavenging location inside of the basement ‘kitchen’ restocks daily.Church glitch - essentially same as above, remove items from scavenge area that Patrick is guarding, make it out alive, return the next day and Patrick is backed up into the second roomPatrick can also die, as long as the Father upstairs stays alive, the first scavenge point that Patrick was guarding restocks.Again, a very engaging experience, and great ‘darksy artsy’ feel overall, just needs to be expanded, perhaps different struggles as a civilian WW2, WW3? And why just survive getting your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you daily? How about the ability if you play your ‘cards’ right to thrive and build a community. A community with capabilities to expand into other areas of the neighborhood rebuilding the infrastructure as you go and having the ability to play beyond the 45th day, if you so desire			"

												This little game might seem inconspicuous at first with its limited color palette and even the premise which is far different from the majority of games revolving around the topic of war. In This War of Mine, instead of playing as a soldier, you join a group of civilians (though solo scenarios are also an option) in their struggles to survive in a besieged city of Pogoren. They're no fighters, they have no belongings, and they seek shelter in an abandoned ruin somewhere within the city. It is up to the player to make sure they make the best of what little they have. You need to make sure they don't starve, don't become depressed, don't freeze to death or get sick during colder days. Nightly bandit raids aren't making things any easier because each raid means that your survivors can potentially get hurt and your resources get stolen. And resources is something you will need desperately for everything from building and upgrading different facilities around your hideout to crafting weapons, medicine, and items for barter. The main way to get resources, and the one you will have to resolve to if you want to survive, is to scavenge at night which can actually be pretty difficult at times, depending on the area and the physical/mental state of your characters. If your character is sick or wounded, depressed or simply not cut for scavenging/combat, your nightly resource hunts become more challenging. And it's quite easy for your survivors to fall victim to different ailments that can (and will) hinder your progress. It's also fairly easy in this game, especially in the beginning when you're still learning it, to drive yourself into a corner where the pool of your choices becomes very limited. Scenarios in which you have to send your starving character to find some bandages because your other character is too wounded or sick to move become very possible and it's exactly then when the game becomes a real depression simulator. You start making rash and desperate decisions which result in your characters going on stealing and killing sprees, slaughtering innocents and taking every last bit of other poor souls' food or medicine. Things get dicey, but I think it's exactly this constant sense of danger and unpredictability that makes this game, or at least the first few runs, an unforgettable experience. But then, once the war is over, you start to wonder... You survived, but for what price? And are we really that much different from our oppressors?Pros:+ sorta minimalistic but very pretty, stylized graphics+ good soundtrack+ great replay value+ feels, especially in the beginning+ interesting premise+ lots of different playable characters (and a possibility to create your own!)+ Steam Workshop support+ by buying DLCs you support the War Child CharityCons:- very limited number of random events which results in you seeing the same events in all of your playthroughs- once you spend some time learning the game, it becomes pretty damn easy and instead of depression simulator, you end up with a hoarder simulatorA solid 9/10 and easily one of the best games on Steam in my opinion.
