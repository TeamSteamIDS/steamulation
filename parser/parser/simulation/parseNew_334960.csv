												The game concept is awesome and the graphics plus celluar automata are awesome.The audio is alright, its not grating but it is a little repetitive.The problem that the game boils down to an utter lack of instruction. The first couple of levels are very straightforward, then another concept is added and another and another.Each successive mechanic is covered less and less and the help section is literally just the url for the game creator's forum. I don't expect a game to hold my hands but when the game doesn't give you very good feedback on what effect you are having it makes it nearly impossible to figure out what exactly the game creator had in mind for the player to execute.I'm 3/4 of the way through the game after about 2 hours of play so it also looks to be fairly short.If they went through and gave the player a little more instruction on how I'm affecting the cellular simulation and added a few more levels this would be a solid action title. As it stands its a bit frustrating and short.+Graphics have a nice retro feel+Concept is awesome and well executed-Game can be completed in a few hours-No real replayability -Several mechanics in the game are not explained and the style of the game makes it fairly difficult to figure them out.

												I found the difficulty curve too steep.  I've played twice, died both times on the second level, and am not inspired to try again.  I would definitely recommend trying the demo before buying.			"

												I hate this game so much! The idea is great, I love it, but the controles make me want to kill people. They are confusing and feel like someone is intentionally trying to make me angry. I want a refund.			"

												Complete lack of instruction. Frustrating is an understatement. There have to be better games to play than this.			"

												This game is hard. I am already on the 3rd level and I am struggling. The feeling you get from succeeding is well worth it though. My tip is to study the visuals and help the game gives you and apply it. The music is good, it has a pulse to it which fits the theme. The visuals are nice and also are bright and understandable. I would reccommend it to anyone who likes a good challenge. Also it's relatively inexpensive fun!			"

												As Oscar Wilde once said: ""Only a fool doesn't judge a book by it's cover"". The game's initial presentation is so low budget it doesn't live you much hope for a good experience. We play as a nanobot delivered by kind nordic race doctors with a syringe into a latino girl's arm, who just got infected with smth like Ebola. We gonna shoot red lesions of virus capturing vital organs with yellow serum made of voxels. Controls are clunky like in early 90s, I think the authors tried to show players how hard being a robot is. The instructions are scarce too. The girl cries of pain when you loose. It's horrible.************Как сказал Оскар Уайлд: ""Только дураки не судят книгу по обложке"". С самого начала тут видна такая низкобюджетность, что надежды на хороший опыт остается мало. Мы играем за наноробота (тайная жизнь Д.Медведева), которого добрые белые врачи ввели шприцом в предплечье латиноамериканской девочки, подхватившей какой-то страшный вирус типа Эболы. Всю игру мы будем расстреливать желтой сывороткой красные очаги инфекции, растекающиеся по организму воксельными метастазами. Управление корявое в духе ранних 90х, такое впечатление, что авторы хотели показать игроку, как трудно быть роботом. Девочка плачет от боли, когда проигрываем, это ужасно.Игра насильственно переведена на русский так, что мне не удалось запустить ее в оригинале. А переведена она машинным переводом. Учитывая и без того минималистичные инструкции... ох			"

			Magic in a syringe! This game manages to feel completely familiar, yet wholly unique. I meant every single word of my rant at the end, because this is the kind of game Indie 5000 was started for.		

 Just flat out love it.			"
