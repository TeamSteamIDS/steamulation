												MUST READ BEFORE YOU PLAY:There are a few things i think people should know about before playing this game.I bought kingdom wars before it was a f2p game and have had two maxed out citys with high lvl hero's and have spent money on the game beyond just buying it pre f2p.This is my honest review about what i know of the game.BUGS! Be prepared to lose resorces for winning pvp matches.That's right you lose for winning! If a person trys to fight you and you accept and then he pays you to flee battle you get a win and maybe a little gold from the payout BUT you will lose 5k food 5k wood and 5k stone from your towns resorce stash which varries depending on what your stash has in it but that was my last loss to this bug. Not only do you lose for winning a pvp match in this manner you don't recieve the crowns for the win that you are supposed to get for winning.The only way to avoid this bug is to fight until the game tells you you won or lost.BUGS! That's right more bugs.This one however is in your favor.When creating troops to build an army some times you will dupe extra units.BUGS! Your city is full of small bugs that are annoying at times but minor and not worth more then a mention that thay are there.THE MOTHER OF ALL BUGS! This is a big one in my opinion! Be prepared to lose it all! That's right and not because you can be captured or destroyed by another player but because everytime the dev's change the game some people not all but at random get a full wipe including your account like you never exisited in the first place. The money you spent ""poof gone"" the time you spent ""poof gone"". I know this first hand as both my maxed out city's got wiped and in return i didn't even get a response from the support team. After the first time i said ""ok i haven't played in a wile no big deal i lost my stuff"" and i moved on rebuilt spent money on the starter packs and was back on top in a few weeks and that's when the dev's changed the game again and i lost it all again.Sense the game came out pre f2p i have put about 60$ into the game and 288 hours which i wish at this point i had not but if you don't mind losing it all and spending money and time on a game so that a bug can rob you in the end then this game is for you!There are some cool things about kingdom wars but the amount of bugs makes the amount of cool things not worth the mention as the bugs destroy the enjoyment all together.The dev's don't really care about the game the bugs have been there forever and have never been fixed the team took what was supposed to be an update to kingdom wars and made it a stand alone game ""kingdom wars 2: battles"" which is the same game with a cuple added fetures.The team only did this to pump more money out of people instead of fixing and updating the game they had already created ""Kingdom wars"" leaving KW broken and a waste of time and money.In the end i can't say i recommend any games from this team as they don't put any real care into the games they create beyond publishing bug filled crap they have no intention to fix.

												Some games are born great, others have greatness thrust upon them... This one is neither, through the efforts of the developers and a great part of the community it has worked toward something truly unique. I have played my share of games that had Pay to Win (or elements of it) schemes going on in the background, yet never had I seen one where the developers actually completely changed the game because of critisism from the players themselves... I know of no better community of players then the ones who stalk the digital halls of Kingdom Wars, (it's the only game that I leave the chat window open on) when there was a shortage of Moderators the players themselves would offer advice to the new arrivals. Simply put, my hours should speak for themselves, and I intend to continue for a long time. Many people have claimed that Kingdom Wars is rough around the edges, that it is, but those same people usually don't stick around enough to see the simple truth that we veterans know by heart... (or atleast we should by now) ""If you don't like it, spend some time and wait for the next update."" So in closing, it's fun, it's free, and no other game in the genre can come close to it's majesty!			"

												7/10** Developers removed the buying of premium currency in the last patch. now it is only availble through quests.****AKA NO BUY TO WIN ANYMORE**Game plays similar to total war. Are a few bugs that tend to occur with each patch that take time to get fixed.The multiplayer and persitant aspect of DoF adds a new and more refreshing element into the genre.  Managing your kingdom is just as fun as battling players and NPCs.Take time to compare the negative and positive reviews.  Take game time played into consideration.It took me a good 4 hours before I finally got hooked. That time was spent learning the ins and outs of the game due to me not having played strategy games in eons.Is it the perfect game? no.Is it a fun game? Yes.Should you buy it?  Yes, especially since it is always on sale it seems.			"

												Kingdom Wars is a very interesting game. At first I had a very low opinion of it, but if you can overcome the first hour of the game and look past its shortcomings you'll find a very addictive experience with so much potential.Negative impressions:  Visually it looks as if it made in the early 2000s, and the combat leaves a lot to be desired. Once battle is joined unit formations devolve into disorganized mosh-pit like globs with very poor unit collision detection (if any at all.) The animations are primitive and very basic, not just in combat but for walking, idle, and cutscenes dialog. There are also a host of bugs, many of which are highly destructive and infuriating. The worst I encountered was when I lost an entire army, 28 units, because a quest sent them into a void and left me with an empty army on the map- without even starting the quest. I was left without my hero unit, and an entire day worth of invested resources that I used to build said army.Positive Impressions: The economic system and a load of fun, and by far the best part of the game aside from the general idea. You can make profits by trading, harvesting resources, looting battlefields, and questing. Each option presents its own benefits and challenges. If you decide to harvest resources at home then you will looking at the safest and most reliable way, but it also means you need peasants working the land which drags on your unit cap. Trade is the quickest way, but it also means you’re at risk of losing caravans and thus your cargo. It also requires more management and the natural risk of losing money on a trade if you’re too hasty.The game has a pretty mild pace, which is certainly a positive in my opinion. You won’t become powerful overnight, and all buildings and soldiers take quite a bit of resources and time to make. There is also a healthy variety of units and plenty of defining traits to pick from. Units gain experience from battles which lets you upgrade them, in addition to researching new technologies and equipment. From what I can tell there is no pay-to-win advantage either. The cashhop is purely aesthetics and speeding up the process of questing rewards.If the combat would be overhauled then I think this would be an easy game to recommend, and if animations and visuals where modernized then it would be a jewel. However as it stands it’s a give and take. If you can overlook its issues there is a lot of fun to be had, but not everyone can do that. "

												It's a great concept and the idea of the game is interesting, but don't expect to engange in many PvP battles, more so it's rare when someone tries to attack your castle, which hasn't happened yet. Your Troops fight in a squad and can actually level up and you get to chose from several different strenghs, such as how hard they hit and how much damange they can take. If you loose a sqaud of high level soilders it's not the end of the world but you feel bad.The game is almost too slow to start, but after 5-6 hours you start to see the gold coming in. You might have read it's ""pay to win"". You can spend cash for crowns which buy's you the special units or upgrades, yet after you get established it's easy to build a bank of crowns. Your gold even starts to overflow to the point where a good portion of the time your lugging your troops around from town to town selling goods.Whatever race you chose to play isn't a total lock, you can still buy units from the other races. One of the key factors is collecting your loot off of dead bodies, I strongly recomand  getting Female Wardens from the elf race because you can simply select their duty to collect loot and they do it fast compared to human peasents. The AI isn't great.  They are going to attack is how they are going to attack. Generally they don't engage you till you engage them. If they try to flank it's a pre-determined before the game even starts. The AI doesn't adjust to the battlefield and what is going on. The AI will flank when basically you already broke the line.Archers and Crossbow men are generally a strong staple of castle RTS'. They aren't effective. When you see 60-80 Archers on a castle ridge after a few times it doesn't make you turn your soilders around.The big draw back besides the lack of PvP fights, which when they do happen are very laggy is the overall Missions of the game. Basically it's fighting a small group of soilders, or laying into a castle.  Most of the missions are putting down rebel armies of peasents. The developer has been putting out patches, but the game isn't new, so I'm not sure what the future holds in stock. If they make a second one, I think they will get the game right.I enjoyed my time with the game, but with no real challange and a weak storyline that actually may not have a ending , it's hard to say ""Yes"" or ""No"" to the game.  However, if your looking to play a RTS game and can't find one I would give it a shot, it did provide me several hours of gaming.			"

												What the page doesn't actually tell you, something that I was stung by, is the presence of a real life cash shop in the game (where you can buy one of the strongest units in the game, dragons for instance, as well as various ""pay-to-win"" instances)As such I would recommend some further research into this game before purchasing.Edit: This may no longer be true as per my post on the comments section of this original post.

												I would recommend this game to anyone who loves RTS fantasy games. PROS-Beautiful scenery, interesting units, races, strategies and play styles. The story line is a bit interesting too. This is definitely worth the FREE download and try. The game runs on my outdated subpar computer. Game is NOT pay to win. You can chat, have friends, create an empire and a guild. You can control multiple cities and races, and armies. You can have vassals, do co op with friends, and show off your high leveled up units. All the races are viable to play.CONS-Large battles tend to lag and make clicking important things hard to do and the combat systems leave much to be desired as the units are sometimes oblivious to quite obvious enemies and sometimes stand there and do nothing or chase after an enemy while forgetting the actual enemy you clicked on for it to target. You cannot melee a moving unit, even if you are faster and chasing that unit. Town population cap of only 90. Hero unit level cap of only 60. Towns are only semi customizable as you cannot place whatever you want, wherever you want you have to build on plots, and you cannot really design your defenses or choose where you put the walls, towers and gates. Cannot actually view friends towns and you cannot add a new friend if that friend is currently offline. Can only click/use one referral code. Limited town storage and upgrading your storage buildings does not increase it. Upgrading buildings in general should improve things relating to that building, but in most cases it does nothing other than increase the HP of the building.I know my list of cons is big, but I put it there because I wish the game were a bit better in these areas, however, regardless of the cons this game is still amazing and I cant put it down.

												This is definetly the best Free to play game.Also as an RTS is very balanced and the AI is pretty intelligent.Also,the graphichs are amazing.It's the first MMORTS I've ever played,but I bet if there is any other MMORTS it cannot be as good as this.Those 3 races you can play(elf,orc,human)and the existence of dwarfes(which you can also use in combat) + dragons and other creatures makes you feel like you are playing Lord of the Rings,and the combat makes you feel like you are playing Total War.Even it is Free to play,it is not a Pay to Win game,so you can simly be as good as others that pay.The PVP sistem is very nice too,You can battle army versus army or siege a player's castle.You can also PVP army vs army at other castles(controlled by AI).And the variety of quests(which can be played co-op) makes the game even more interesting.But definetly by far the best thing in Kingdom Wars is siegeing.Take your mate and siege a castle,and I guarantee you won't regret seeing thousands of men fighting.IF you have a wizard,dragon or a hydra with you,the battle will be even more interesting.Of course there are plenty o bugs,but the developers are trying their best to fix them.And there are always moderators online to help you get through those bugs and refund your lost resoruces/units. Also,the comunity is very nice and will surely help you questing,battleling,and maybe even giving you some resources :)If you are an RTS/Medieval/RPG or just a browser games fan,you definetly have to try this game!

												A Fantasy free to play non pay to win fairly slow-paced RTS game with PvE and PvP elements, with an ever growing communityIf that sounds interesting to you then this is the game for youMy first time playing this game I had mixed feelings. Low res graphics, buyable units, premium accounts and Purchasable city plots. All of it was too Pay-to-Winesque for me. But after having spent quite some hours into the Game by talking and bonding with the Community I very rapidly discovered how wrong my assumptions were. Buyable units are easily stomped on by non-buyable units. Premium is merely a small bonus. While it may not be Pay To Win on the gameplay part it does have a few knacks of its own, for example: ''Starting another city'' with another race and settings requires a payment of 4.99$ or by deleting your current City. This feature is very stupid as it limits you to only 1 race which limits the player from sinking more time into the game without sinking money into the game. A very positive change would be if they gave you 2 slots instead of 1, maybe when they release the Undead race they will give everyone a 2nd slot. HINT HINTUpdates are pumped in weekly so expect bugs/glitches that you might encounter to be fixed soonNext to bug and glitches fixes new content is added to. Such as skins, units, buildings maybe even a whole new race.On a side note, this game is still pretty unstable, on a daily basis people come in and complain about how they crashed during big battles or that certain things aren't working. One of the Major malfunctions in this game is the fact that Online gameplay isn't fully server hosted causing bugs with Resource gathering from time to time, but that is simply because they don't have the financial support to make everything more server dependent. Which is where you come in.Gameplay itself is very solid. While the Army management is pretty flonky because of bugs with manual Army mapping and you can only select 18 Units at once, it is still fun and massive, there are some performance issues with big armies moving around and large fights (FPS drops and sometimes Crashes) it is still very fun, competitive and enjoyable. A few issues here and there make the competitive part of this game ALOT less... competitive, such as Battle protection pausing when going offline. But it is still carried forward by the massive rewards PvPing and PvEing give, especially late game.The best part of it, when you start PvP you can't be put up against opponents with a larger or smaller army then yours, making it completely skill reliant.Pros-Solid game-Solid experience-Lots of dialogue-Wide open-world with lots of provided Lore-Updates are sinked in on a weekly basis-Lots of playability-Fun and growing community-Lots of content-Beautiful designCons:-Bad AI-Inconsistent unit collission-Workers not always doing what they are told to until you manually send them-Extremely buggy-Not enough is server hosted-An extreme amount of dialogue (This could be a Pro depends on how you look at it)-Extremely low res (Ruins the design part by quite alot)-Some Pay to Win elements that do need to be removed-Pretty hard learning curve for newcomers-Unit management is not that good (HD patch would help xP)This may look very negative but as a whole the Pros outmatch the Cons by far, since the Developers of this game are working very hard to take charge and improve this game as a whole. While some issues may not be fixed in a few weeks, months or even Years it still is a solid experience and a must play for Hardcore RTS players that want to enjoy both sides of an MMORTS, the Town management and PvP without PvP taking the cake like in most MMORTS games.The best part of this, it's free.

												Hello! Let me start by saying this game is unique and have great potential but its far from perfect!I'll start with the good side of Kingdom Wars:If you are fan of Stronghold, Total War, Warcraft, Age of Empires series you will love this game, has the all elements including some unique features like live economy and constant online world!You'll start with a small village, few peasants, soldiers and a hero (24 hours battle protection) .... build and upgrade your town and armies, siege and ally with other players and NPC , train Hyrdras, Minotaurs, Dragons to become emperor and conquer the world!Enjoy sieging your enemies (player or NPC) but be careful about where you deploy your armies couse anytime you can be attacked by other players (in game system have battle protection but you will need to spend cowns to get it and wont be able to pvp or coop will its active), hunt other players on battlefield if you dont have anyone to siege, trade with other towns, escort your caravans will moving resorces, explore the world with your armies and much more!If you are willing you can spend real money to customize your hero armor,town architecture,army banners,symbols.Buy additional town space (only 1 town is free), build new Empires with different race and share new expiriance with your friends!Ok here is the bad side of Kingdom Wars:Servers ... uff i am feeling sick already .... they are just not good, game have huge number of buggs and will lagg even on amazing configurations will coop - duo to server issus .... if you are in Europe and you coop with someone from Australia! Buying naming rights for your heroes and monsters is throwing money couse names will mix or reset everytime you enter new region, also prices for some staff are not worth the money, they should balance this.You will be frustrated with same buggs and controles because they are still working on improving game engine. Recently all servers crushed and they lost most in game data, however I have to commend the moderator they really made the effort to cut our losses but at the end everyone started over with promise it wont happen again!Generally viewed this is great game and you will enjoy playing it even with all its faults .... i know i did :) 7.5/10 Would give it 9-9.5 if they fix servers and all of the above mentioned!Sorry for my bad English i know its not perfect but hope this review will help ppl!All the best guys and good luck! ;)			"

												Yes, this is worth getting.I've noticed a lot of negativity about this game since it's release and frankly I don't understand where it is all coming from. What you have here is a solid, fun, online RTS game, with some innovative original flourishes.Pros:= Three distinct factions with very different play styles both in terms of city building, unit disposition and battle tactics. They are further differentiated by their own distinct unit, building and UI art, quest lines and voice acting. Each faction can also recruit a variety of mercenary units to further enhance army customization.= The battle pacing is just right. Look I'm an old fart, so I prefer a game where I can actually see the action unfold rather than everything be over in the blink of an eye. The pace of combat is somewhat slower in DoF than in other contemporary RTS games. I think this is a good thing becasue it allows for more tactical options and also negates any ping advantages in multiplayer.= Heaps of single player content. Each faction has a very generous quest line which I estimate to be around 30+ hours worth per side, not counting replayable missions. There are also countless NPC skirmishes to explore in a variety of landscapes against varied NPC elements.= The quests are involved and interesting. They have put a great deal of thought into felshing out details of the fantasy world. It's not a testiment to originality, but it's a top notch effort for a video game setting. I love how half of what the elves say is made up gibberish with no explanation offered, but after an hour or so in the game you find yourself understanding it all.Cons:= There are a few technical issues especially with pathfinding, but nothing that some patience and practice can not overcome.= Multiplayer is a mixed bag. You can grind out a very formidable army against NPCs and newbies can get crushed if they dive in unprepared. That being said, when the balance is just right, they battles are a lot of fun.= Speaking of grind, there is a bit of it. It's an online game so the pace of progression is sedate. You won't max your units out over a weekend. Your rank and file units can also be permanently lost, so you need to be paying attention. I personally like the perma death touch for some units (hero units take an xp penalty instead when they get ""KOed""), but I can understand why some people would consider it a negative.All in all I had a great time with DoF. If you're an RTS fan and looking for something a little different and long term, you should definately pick this up during the sale. It's a steal for seven bucks.			"

												Game servers are not recording progress. It recognises a new kingdom created but forces you to start over every time you want to play that kingdom, making it pointless to play in the first place.If you want in-game support, there is none as the ingame community is dead and the only way to contact GM's /devs is via email.If you exit the game via main menu, it tries logging you back in, in an endless loop, forcing you to crash the game in order to exit.This game is plagued with bugs as a result of the developers abandoning it last year, (read the forums) Hence why it is now on Steam. It's a pitty because it had a lot of potential even with a in-game shop, but now it's just an empty shell of what it could have been.			"

												Hello,Just figured I would write this quick review of my recent experience. Please take it with a grain of salt and your experience may be different.I played Kingdom Wars earlier this way. Around July or so for several weeks at least. Spent actual money for some of the perks. Premium being one of them. As well as a small expansion I believe. I won't go into how the game was then or that experience though.Just wanted to share that it is now December. I hadn't logged into the game since late July so I just wanted to see if my city was still there. To my amazement when I logged in it treated me as a completely new player. My city was totally gone and even the premium days that I had payed for that were left on my account also were gone as well.This review is not meant to be positive or negative or bashing anyone. Only a simple statement of experience. The reader can feel free to take from it what they will.			"

												Yup this game is awsome! For those who like RTS and is must have piece. Luckily its not pay-to-win i have paid nothing yet and i dont feel anyway behind other players. It must be added, that you can feel the 'under contruction' sign, but all in all its a game in a world with rich lore, and the feeling of classic fantasy is only the top of the cake.Thanks to the well planed PvP protection you wont get raided and farmed in that very moment you join the game, also you dont have to sit 24/7 in front of this game, since you are protected while offline.You should definetly give it a try if you liked any total ward games mixed with a bit of Mount&Blade and a bit of Warcraft III :)			"

												Kingdom Wars (Race: Human) 0. Resource gathering  Resources are gathered by peasants (stone, wood, gold, food - though food is a bit different as you can slaughter pigs that are ""fattened"" for a large food income). Each peasant unit takes 1 population space and costs some food. 1. Story about my wizard and about ""wealth"" (crowns)  For quite a while I had battle protection as a starter player. This battle protection gave me enough time to form an army, walls and a wizard. Wizard is an extremely strong unit. Maximum population number of town is 90 I think - you can increase the initial low population limit by building houses - also, you can have initially up to 5 armies outside of your town on map - each army has 60 population cap (Normal units take 1/90), wizard takes 10 and costs 120 crowns. Crowns are gained either by paying 5000 gold (daily limit of bought crowns is 30) or winning a pvp/pve battle (siege or army fight) [You can get 20-40 crowns for winning when attacked by enemy player in your town). A wizard needs further spell upgrades to be able to cast spells (10,20,40,80 and 150 crowns - example for lightning (of the Deep) wizard: shield,drain stamina, buff allies, large aoe attack, teleport) so it's very expensive unit. Once I got the wizard and trained him to get to higher level and bought 2 spells (shield gives him extreme resistance to everything and aoe attack kills everything sooner or later) I was able to siege enemy castle with one man - the wizard. 2. First defence of my town This happened when I finished building my inner stone wall and outer wooden wall (There are 2 types of wall - One made out of wood and the other one is made out of stone, stone is very expensive and there is inner (cheaper) and outer part - outer is much more expensive than the inner one, it's like a second layer of walls) and placed trebuchets on them (you can build trebuchets, rock throwers (close range) or hot oil thingy that pours hot oil on top of the enemy) on top of stone walls. I recalled all of my peasants into my middle part of the town. I chose to fight the enemy. I placed my archers on the wall - on the side from where the enemy was coming. He started attacking my town with trebuchets, he focused on my outer wooden wall and used fiery stones that set the area around my walls on fire. I had plenty of stone in my town and you can buy stone during battle for gold if you have market built so I started aiming all of my trebuchets (the ones on the walls) at those trebuchets. In 4 minutes the enemy trebuchets were destroyed. Then I opened the outer wooden door. As I expected, enemy archers started pouring in, hoping to shoot my people, cattle and soldiers. As soon as they passed my gate I closed it behind them. They were trapped in my outer wall part of town. I started ordering all of my elven rangers (best archers in game, I got them from befriending one elven town and buying them in it) to increase their rate of fire and fire at the enemy archers. Then I opened my inner gate and sent all of my unicorns (also elven unit, they use them for gaining gold and as a cavalry. My wizard kept placing defencive shield on my rangers and they kept firing while unicorns were slaughtering the archers and crossbowmen. They died in 2 minutes. Only thing that remained were enemy melee units behind my wall. I sent my archers to shoot them from safety of my walls and aimed my trebuchets with another 3000 stone remaining (Enough for a long time of constant firing from few trebuchets). The enemy surrendered before I managed to obliterate the rest of his army. I got 28 crowns. The whole siege was like 20 minutes long.I find this game very nice - also, any units you loose during the pvp or pve fights is dead permanently (except wizards, main hero and other heroes like them) UPDATE: I've returned to playing this game, got affected by a roll-back and lost most of my proggress - I was given codes for crowns (ingame currency, something like ""cash"" type of money  in most games, dragon and a free code for Kingdom Wars 2: Battles <- It took them only 43 minutes to reply with these ""refunds"". Best support ever "

												I was thinking of giving up on this game during the first 30minutes of gameplay, but im glad I didn't. Very fun and addictive once you get into it (past the inital quests and learning curve). IMO best MMORTS out there!Additional comment: this game is NOT pay to win AT ALL. I have not spent a single cent (excluding buying the game) in this game and I have an 80% pvp win/lose ratio. I also have the most expensive units ( that requires premium currency to buy) on my account. The premium currency (that you can buy) can very easily be attained through in game questing. So please do not let the fact that others say that it's a Pay to Win game to discourage you from getting this awesome game!			"

												Very well done game. I seen youtube videos and these guys have been around for years updating this game and it's only been getting better and better as I have seen. It's very worth the money and building a kingdom in this one is very fun seeing there's lots of quest that keep ya busy and crowns you have to gain or buy with money you make from cattle or chopping trees and gold and stone mines. I like the experience and upgrading units. I've been on many hours since I started and there's so much more for me to go. Just now got a powerfull dragon and have been burning up lots of enemies.

												Changing my oppinion on the game after having played a good 30 hours.This game has been out for 3 years yet should never have been released in its current format. The devs seem keen on taking suggestions and fixing bugs, but the base of the game is broken. Terrible UI, delayed commands, units not doing what they are supposed to, no interactive pve, broken pvp.You get shown all these amazing battles you can fight with massive armies and awesome castles you can siege. You will not see this ingame.In pvp: You will build a massive army and level them a bit only to see them destroyed in pvp by a single enemy dragon or wizard. A high level 60 dragon or wizard has the same army strenght as a fully deployed army but has many times the defense, attack and hp regeneration stats so your units will be hitting and shooting it in vain. The only way to counter is to recruit your own super monsters and you'll end up using just those.In pve: Sure you can use a massive army to siege a city and lose half of them in the progress. Or... get a dragon and/or wizard as said above and decimate the enemy castle as they cannot kill your dragon. Its easy to see which is the better option.This review will be voted as not helpful just as all the other negative reviews as the core players have been playing this game for years and are good friends with the mods/devs (who btw can and will abuse their power to restore units and ingame currency by just being nice to them) and are raging fan boys thats are just happy with 1v1 units fighting and thus destroying the idea behind this game.

												I would like to recommend this game. I really would. I cant. Like a lot of games it has a lot of potential. That is why I have followed it from the beta on and off. I would love a decent mmorts. The enthusiasm shown for it by the developers kept me checking in and believing everything would eventually turn out ok. Over three years after release and nearly a year on Steam. How is it now?One year anniversary email Oct 2012 ""After a disastrous beta and early release and severing ties with ex publisher 505 Games, our studio have finally gotten a chance to make Dawn of Fantasy the game we always wanted.""(edited for relevance/space) Apr 2013 email ""We have an ambitious plan to get rid of the last remaining issues by May 1st and so that we can switch to adding awesome new features.Here's a brief overview of the top problems we solved in the past couple of weeks    Server stability resolved - no more server downtime    Fixed lost progress, lost unit and army rollback issues    PvP, Siege and Coop does not Out of Sync or Disconnect    Fixed the quest, Co-Op and PvP victory problems    Started the UI redesign and replaced some fontsIf you left the game because you had any of the problems above, now is the time to come back and give Dawn of Fantasy: Kingdom Wars another go.""Looking at what is there right now it feels extremely buggy, poorly designed, implemented and unfinished. Losing units (mods will reimburse, with logs), crashing during battles (lose incurred on profile), lag during coop battles (rubberbanding), Syncing issues during pvp. Unit stances and behaviours not sticking, Unit commands not being followed. Very annoying voice spam messages and popups (deleting a voice file solved one, the mods responded they would look into the other) Resource system not working. I could go on and on.Its a real shame as the Homeland building aspects I really enjoy, enticing me to log back in and check on the little fellas regularly. The rest is, quite frankly, and I hate to say it, crap.The ui is poorly designed. It feels like it is trying to fight me on what I am trying to do at times. Not showing all my units when I select all peasants (I believe there is a cap of 18 units selected which does not help you find that one unit you want to garrison) Hiding units in single man stacks behind a wall with no way to find them in a timely manner as the onscreen indicators are poor, Elements of the ui requesting you to look at them (quest book and invite friend button thing) flashing repeatedly until I click recognition and then flashing again a few minutes later repeatedly. I read my goddam quests the first time! Gaahhhhhh! Its like a facebook game!You have a world map where the ""mmo"" takes place. This consists of a static map which is nice enough. You will never see another player on this map. This map is for you, To meet (fight) other players you move around declaring your looking for pvp and hoping that the area you are in has someone there. The system will tell you when a match is found. So its more like a lobby in the multiplayer sense. With an unnecessary visual element. The map for single player contains npc towns which you can visit(very rudimentary diplomacy), siege(coop or single) and visit for quests/selling/buying/trainging. It all just feels tacked on and has done since the beginning.I feel like I have been harsh in writing this but I feel it has had more than enough time to be in a decent playable state. Right now I feel nervous carrying out actions. I feel increasingly nervous the longer sieges go on in case of crash/loss. I fear sieges, not because of players but because of desyncing. I feel nervous upon logging in to find any units missing.The positives of the game are grossly overshadowed by the problems. Of note is the nice way of earning the currency (crowns) ingame. The initial period, base building in your home instance. The fact they kept my account and it was available to me from steam after a long absence. Friendly dev interaction,Despite all that I will probably still log in to check on my little homeland every now and then. Quickly mind you, before the immunity timer wears out.I will continually update the review as changes occur. I will happily change the recommendation if its deserving. In march apparently big changes are happening. We shall see. Unfortunately I have heard that many times before. "

												Been waiting for this game for a while, so glad to see it hit steam. Dawn of Fantasy combines classic Stronghold style RTS with Facebooks dull version of ""Kingdoms of Camelot"".If you like the Stronghold series or the Total War games you can slide in to this game with ease. Starting your kingdom takes a bit of time but compared to most other MMO's the learning curve is minor and you can get rolling pretty quickly, anything you need to know about the game will be answered in game by the VERY helpful community via the help chat tab. and the quikly responding support!bear in mind this game is new out and with surprisingly few bugs, patches and improvements are being made frequently and is rapidly flourishing in to an amazing game. It's totally free, I would 100% recommend this game,			"

												Now that I have almost 30 hours into the game, I feel like I can give a bottom-line up front review with the most important points of interest.PRO:Fun castle siege / medieval warfare game; has a nice old school feel to itCastle building mini sim? ...shoot... I felt like I had to have a #2CON:- Plagued by a crown system which stunts your rapid growth/gameplay unless you play real $ at an outrageous price- Once you have finished your ""introductory"" crown based protection system, you have to pay more real money or use all the crowns you saved for upgrades, if you don't want to PVP. If you want to Co-Op all of the time, don't buy this game at all. It just isn't for you.- No custom castle/wall/tower building--everything is pre-designated- Requires real $ to customize your city or hero (even if it is a small amount, they quarter and dollar you) and the customization is minimal at best- Peasants are morons- Enemy AI has as much intelligence as my Mr. Coffee- Units have a tendency to just up and disappear- More bugs than a Zerg SwarmBottomline:  The game is getting older and older and not getting any better. Kingdom Wars 2: Battle has come out and I doubt they will put any effort into this game at all. If you buy it, you're feeding the green money monster.			"

												I would definitely recommend you try Kingdom Wars  if you love a great medieval rts game. Build massive alliances and armies to conquer and control the world map by siege and vassal as well as coop and pvp options. You are able to choose from several different races and traits with the option to build cities in many different regions on the world map. The game community is very helpful with questions and resources until you are able to build a strong economy in your home city,  (the best game community I have had the pleasure of playing with). Although Kingdom Wars has a few minor bugs nothing major, the dedicated team of developers are always fast to respond to keep the game running smoothly. Thank you for the great game Reverie World Studios.			"

Am not much of quests person but they do provide some fun and PVP in game altough it was before bugy now plays fluently.

												Highly recommended for Human Race only, but i think it can work in any race if u use it carefully.How to make fast resources.Quick Tip for being a Human Race, in this game sometimes new players have hard time geting resources... a veteran friend teached me how to make gold fast and easy, Humans got the best defence in all the race that makes them good for fighting in balance and some formation to make them useful for certain enemies, a friend teach me that swordsman is the best melee units for human when you are a newbie or a starter, you can use this to your advantage, my friend teached me how swordsman can really be useful, 1st buy the technology in the blacksmith, in the armors and you can find the Mail Armor for swordsman to improve crush armor it will highly improve your swordmen's resistance to impact and crush armor it is important to unlock this upgrade,and you will need to train 16 units, just 16 ok you can only highlight 16 units at once to highlight them click the swordsman units in the top left corner then press Ctrl+1 to put them on Num. 1 , after you trained 16 swordsman, make an army in the world map, you will need at least lvl them to a nearby castle for example dagbor if in southmont, thorndale if in wold, and denwall if in rollingplain, lvl them at least 3-4 i will cost at least 2-3k gold after that you will need at least 600 gold, you need to go in the elven territory and make camp in any of the elven territory make a least a basic camp, then manage camp, and recruit units, then find the male warden, 1 warden is really useful you will just need 1 male warden.After you bought 1 male warden, you need to go to Bal Rattha and press find (the magnifying glass in the right side of your army HUD) in your army. Do not make a camp, thieves will slowly steal your money if u make a camp.WHen u lvl your swordsman you get at least 6-8 time to improve the skills of your swordsmen Improve the heal rate to 2 and improve all your resistance to impact to max.After that Highlight your army and your warden to num. 1 and num. 2, Go kill all the ogres and make your wardens loot the dead bodies of the ogres, (You have a chance to tame an Ogre) Male wardens got special abilities, they can instantly lot dead bodies, AND! Turn the resources to gold.A dead ogre has at least 100-700 meat that means, at least 1 dead ogre can make you get 100-700 gold (beware of the Ogre scouts, when u looted 1 ogre camp make sure, always guard your wardens because ogres camps have dead bodies and ogres can literally smash your wardens and watch out for Ogres scouts, 1 try can get you at least 15-25 k of gold at at least 16-20 ogres, if u try at least 9 times you can get 300k of gold and if u want to turn them to resources you will need market in your base and transfer the money you collected form ogres to your own base and turn them into some resources from the market.I think this will help you alot, but sometimes its boring but it can lvl your swordsmen fast, (At least 16 lvl for your troops in one try ), (Warning. Do not bring archers with your swordmen because almost all the time ogres targets archers and other ranged units). I hope I helped anyone thank you for reading all of that XD :D~peace			"

												Kingdom Wars is the first true MMORTS(that's massively multiplayer online real-time strategy) with a town/base that you build and doesn't disappear or reset after every match. Once you build your base, you build armies that are also PERSISTENT. So everytime you login, your base and armies are there from the last time you played and they're ready to battle.Each faction(humans, elves, orcs, +more to come...) are unique in every way. They gather resources(gold/food/wood/stone) differently. They have different units with different abilities and formations. They even have subfactions(3 subfactions per race) that make them even MORE unique by increasing/decreasing unit stats, economy, build times, etc.  Then you choose two traits from 5 or 6 options that further customize your experience with more stat boosts and whatnot.Once you've built a base, done a few quests, and trained a decent army you can either conquer the AI controlled cities(either solo or Coop with someone) or search for another player's army to fight or siege their town. The Player vs Player fights are matched up according to the strength of your army, which prevents powerful veterans from picking on new players(or vice versa depending on how good you are :D ).The best part is that anything can be earned by playing the game, except for a few items that are purely cosmetic and don't affect actual gameplay or mechanics.PROS:-Game Moderators are easily accessible and available for questions-Wizards, dragons, minotaurs, treants, hydras....that's right, HYDRAS!!-units level up and can be customized to your playstyle by spending skill points to increase health, stamina, attack, resistances, range, reload time, etc.-better than average graphics considering the size and scope of the game-massive battles with unlimited tactical possibilities where terrain, weather, and NPC patrols/camps are all factorsCONS:-some minor bugs/issues, but the developers have released more patches to address bugs in the past two weeks than in the past year, so they're committed to keeping the game running smoothly now that it's free to play.-high system requirements to run the game even on low settings-some parts are difficult to learn to play early on because tooltips and tutorials aren't very helpful, but the community of players and the moderators are great about helping outBasically, you have nothing to lose except maybe a little time and hard drive space. And if ya don't like it, delete it. But if you're like me(as you can see I've logged almost 400 hours in this game), you'll be playing it every chance you get! Also, if and when you see me online, add me as a friend and I'll send you a bunch of resources to help ya get started. My username in the game is ""Quintessential"". I'll even invite you to my alliance if you like.See ya on the battlefield!!			"

												This game may not look like a whole lot. but it offers more then what meets the eye. The overall ""LOOK"" of the game is a bland land scape with somewhat vibrant colors and dull textures. The part that gets me hooked is the gameplay and micro managing of the establishment you are trying to build and expand upon. This game has both a single player and multiplayer to it. It is suggested to start off with the muliplayer first so that way you can learn the game faster. If you like an RTS that is advanced but has a nice learning curve to it. Something that you can pick up and not get scared off. Then I highly suggest you give this one a try and don't let the looks fool you, theres a very thick under side that you should try to get through to.			"

												So i got this game, not exactly sure what it was. An MMO, RPG? Its an RTS, and a pretty well done one. The whole free-to-play is actually that, but they added a twist that i actually thought as something a whole lot better than the other ones out there that ""need energy to complete actions, come back tomorrow"". This has that ideal, but they did it in a way that keeps people entertained. You set some units to gather resources, and they gather small amounts over time, more units, more resources brought in. The best part though, is that you can constantly play, without having to check back up on your kingdom every few hours. You can create an army relatively quickly, and go out and fight (have not reached parts like that, just doing a quest to attack goblins at this point). This is when the RTS main fighting starts, though i should mention the home city is set up the same way, RTS style. This game is pretty fun, and i cant wait to either siege a castle, or get sieged. Im realy looking forward to the co-op battles.Just 5 hours in this game and i already love it, it has an excellent RTS-RPG mix, and i cant wait until i experience multiplayer. Plus this game is free, no need to buy things. Download it and try it, you have nothing to lose and a lot to gain. Being a WoW fan and playing as the orcs is extremely delightful too!			"

												Good game, for a little while. Replayability doesnt seem as good as many other games out there, and i wasnt able to find the quest lines enjoyable at all.The world isnt very interactiveable either, you cant take over other cities and make them part of your kingdom, when you battle a NPC city, and win, they just become your ally, giving you benefits such as recruiting a small number of units, trading and the likes..Game had potential, i wouldnt recommend to buy it for the full 18.99, but if its on sale (which it is often) its worth buying if you like RTS. It has some cool siege play, and basically on the siege front, it is everything that Stronghold 3 wasnt.			"

The units are cool the battles can change in the blink of a second and for a free to play game it is very fair with its crown system. Its a free to play game so all you people that have nothing to do and like strategy its made for you. A quick warning the recources take some time to get so imagine kind of like a world that keeps running with or without you gathering recources. Still a solid 8.5/10 if your reading this download it now. I mean right now get up download the game and come back when you have.

												Review of Dawn of Fantasy: Kingdom WarsDawn Of fantasy, what a game it is, it was originally launched in October 1st, 2011, with so much excitement and a lot going for it, but was plagued by poor programming and bugs and rushed by the publisher, features promised but never delivered. Still we all had high hopes and knew there was something special there. So the Devs still apart of development that cared about the game and wanted to see it grow, ended up ended up taking care of it out of their own pocket over the past year and a half just worked mostly for free, using the what ever means, any current sales to invest into better servers or pay for outsourcing some fixes here and there and now they released a new version on steam with many new features and updates that fixed a ton of the game making it a lot better than its first official launch. In the end, The game is very addicting, I have 4 cities, and massive armies, sure theirs many issues and bugs and sometimes horrible path finding, and pvp doesn’t always work, yes there has been major crashes but only because the game has grown so fast, there was none of these issues before, but the community and gameplay is just so rewarding I can't stop.So glad I’m done with this review, Already 70hrs in and all I want is more! The Review easily could have been pages and pages with everything the game has to offer.Final Verdict A solid 8.0/10			"

												10/1/14I originally really got into this game, and really played it hard, wanted to advance, got really strategic about all of it, and now I threw my hands in the air and am tell it to go blow itself.First off the game is a patient one, some builds take hours to build, there is a lot of slow freaking traveling and sieging an area actually takes time and a lot of effort. You feel accomplished when you get it right and it is awesome. Absolutely awesome. But the game mechanics are atrocious.Pros: Rewarding, new-ish style, feels like you can explore a lot.Cons: -♥♥♥♥♥♥ game mechanics: Units randomly stop firing and run into battle without attacking. This happens with super expensive units and it sets you back literally hours. Spike traps are an instant (and invulnerable) kill for your units so while sieging the enemy you may lose 20% of it regardless of what you do.-Not intuitive building (for the elves)-Everything is slow, inaccurate, frustrating, expensive, unresponsive, and repetitiveAlthough I was expecting an Age of Empires-esk game, it delivered but in a C rated experience. This game has a lot of potential to be good, but it needs more polishing			"

See the details below.If you like doing only PVE you can dedicate your self to it wheter sieging NPC towns, clearing diferent map aereas from NPC, doing missions, you can get resources from PVE as well as from PVP.You are more of a PVP oriented player you can get resources as well from PVP, you can atack other Players Armys, Siege their towns.If you get atacked you can pay a little bribe to your oponent, and you will get under protection, and if you feel brave enougth, you can accept the challenge and fight your oponents army, wheter you win or lose you will get under protection so that no other player atack you again for a goo period of time.Protection system from PVP sieges and army on army battles, if you are under protection and you log off your protection resumes when you get back, the time counts for when you are online, and if you are offline no one can atack you.You can only play a few hours a day, a week?, Doesnt matter no one can atack you when you are offline, and you continue gattering resources while offline.

												Let me first state this for the record. This game, has great potential. It really does. The developers of this game really do care about this game.However with that being said, this game is a bug-glitch ridden mess that is holding hands along side a microtransaction system, That offers cosmetcs, and also ""preminum"" accounts, booster, etc. You name this game has it on the microtransaction side. This is not how you do microtransaction, btw. It's either one or the other, not both. Doing both may or may not work. In this case it doesn't work, in terms of concept and execution.They shove it right in your face the whole nine yards, ""Hey tell your friends about us!"". Yup, i mean all of our friends play videogames, i mean yeah ALL of our friends...... >.> not only that but this game randomly encourages you to do so, and also suggest to sign up, and god knows what else. Anything to get their game more attention and care, and also $$$$Since gathering resources might take awhile, and you might need the few extra crowns (which by the way can be obtained through quests, or *ding, ding* you guess it. BOOSTER PACKS! :D) expect to not be stocked up for a long while. But even then the proccess is really, really, slow. Unless you have upgrades and you communicate with the community.It just isn't the microtransaction system that is also plauging this game, but like what i previously stated before, this game is a bug-glitch ridden mess. The army's AI is chidlish, making illogical decisions that baffles you, plus the ""co-op"" system in this game is a complete joke, no lobby, but through a random selection of players or friends that, and oh by the way they must meet certain requirements in order for you to play with them. So if you are X, 1, 2 & 3 and your friends are, Y, 4,5,6 guess what? can't do it! Must be on the same page. But even then the game's cp-op system is still broken. the PVP has the same system, and runs just like the co-op system. You can tag team against players and what not.Now. How is the rest of the game? Well it's like Stronghold. You rule your own little ""territory"" in various landscapes, races, etc. All of which have their own set of skills, abilites, quest, etc. You can't customize your character, and if you want your character to have a name, must buy, buy, buy a renamer thingy in order to do it. In your terriotry, you see your land grow, however bewarn, upgrades require certain techs, large amount of resources may vary, and guess what? CROWNS! GLORIOUS CROWNS! :DAlso these ""VIP"" status buildings, and upgrades? They require an insane amount of supplies and CROWNS! so don't think getting to the top is going to fast and swift.You can create alliances, but it costs......CROWNS! :D as Buzz Lightyear would say: ""Crowns. Crowns, everywhere!"". You must be invited by the clan leader in order to become part of the alliance, yup kiddes you have to make a ton of friends in this game if you want to be apart of it on a larger scale. The tutorial does it's best, but honestly, if you played Stronghold, and a Total war game, then it shouldn't be a bother.Now, unlike a Bethesda Game Studio game (Oblivion, Skyrim, etc.) there are no radient quests, the quests are given to you, so don't expect it to be quite fun. And unlike a Total War game, there is no real panic with the peasntry and such. Which would've been nice to have in this game, as it gives players an incentive to think about their territory first.The lore is alright, i guess. For a medival game it does the job right.One more thing, if you don't have a good rig. expect big performance issues, and even if you lower down the settings, the game still has weird performance issues, etc.So in the end. Despite the patches, the issues are growing, and with this absurd and constant in your face ""give us promotion"" and also, buy, buy, buy! I recommend, NOT playing this game.			"

												Kingdom Wars is a fun packed game, Very Interresting, And easy to learn. First i would like to say how Kingdoms Wars is free, That just makes it such a better deal, For Everyone. I do like how there are multiple teams, Humans, Elves And Orcs. But that is not all, if you need you can even spend your money to get more and better stuff. Finally i would like to say i personal love this game. I have had this game since you had to pay for it, And now my friends can play and get it for free! That is all i have to say, Thanks For reading.			"

												It's mouse based gameplay; which I like. Feels like it's more 'strategic thinking' rather than 'who can remember which hotkeys to press the fastest.' It's like Age of Empires and Total War had a baby that was breastfed bongs and became the most chilled out, yet totally badass, medieval strategy RPG			"

												Love this game. But after playing it a while, the community even says the devs have left it. An update was announced over a year ago and never came? Supposedly. Idk,,, Anyway This game is beautiful. If you like RTS's and the ability to play with or against others, this is the game for you! Actually the second one is, but i havent been able to try it out yet  :( Feel free to gift it, ill love you long time jk lol. This has a different approach to an RTS that most mmorts games miss. Its not a chess board with people everywhere trying to kill you, take your town, start over, etc. This game has a little bit of an offensive Ai and defensive Ai camps, towns, castles, and armies. All the while you are able to pvp with other players. Repair your towns when your attacked. etc. This game allows you to build. Allows you to have fun at your own pace. BUT make sure you go through the tutorials for orc and elves. They have their own style of play.  Which is also very intreging. (sp?) Though in order to have a town in each faction you will need to unlock slots with real money (as far as i know only way) otherwise its start, erase, and start again to test them all out. Which isnt too bad seeing you dont have to wait 12hours for something to build...This game really makes me want to try the second one and i will once i can! :PFans of:Age of EmpiresEmpire Earth Starcraft You will love this. :)			"

												Kingdom Wars has the same concept and battle physics as Age of Empires which is one of my favorite games. But in this game you get to make a kingdom, though if you want to make another city you have to pay $2, thus it's trully an origional MMO. But there really isn't anything good to buy in the story other than buying city slots, skirmish mode which you don't need, the campaign, and a few custumizations. Other than that it's all up to you which is really nice. LOVE IT!!! 10/10			"

												Set in the fictional-mideival lands of Mythador, Kingdom Wars gives you a chance to play in a 3-D land with your kingdom.  Highly detailed maps offer an excellent gameplay experience, as well as a fantastic look into RTS style strategic gaming that took me in for hours of fun. I give this game a 9/10.  I've had a blast and will continue to in the future. Some things to be improved on are the graphics and animations because they were made a while ago, as well as the variety of bugs and glitches.

												Nowadays, it's quite hard to find a game that is a Massively Multiplayer Online Real-Time Strategy Genre and certainly as good as this game, Kingdom Wars is a saviour to a dying breed of MMORTS.Kingdom Wars certainly has a great Community that many games lack, in my eyes it also has a high chance of reviving this great Genre. I’d like to list all the negative things first:As this is a game still in Development, there would be much work to be done, as i am a Games Developer myself, i understand that creating a game and meeting everyone's expectations is not easy.Bugs are on the loose which can dishearten a fan of the game, however the Developers and Moderators are both working well together to clear them. (I believe the Development team should look more closely to fixing these before adding any new content.)Making sure that all NPCs that you can talk to etc… have a nice smooth crisp looking graphic design, as some do look pixelated rather than looking smooth with the rest of the NPCs. Now for the Positive:Hours of fun to be had when the bugs can be overlooked. Various races to be played (Orcs, Elves and Humans) You do also get the awesome Dwarven Armies you can build. Unique units, Kingdom Wars offers a variety of Unique Units that you can build to boost your armies’ strength and even rename them which gives you a more personal favourite feeling to your units.Quests are quite important within this game, it gets players activated as well as the PvP (Player Vs Player) and PvE (Player versus Environment) these would vary from easy to hard.Theres just so much that i could list that makes this an awesome game.

												This game is fun. Temporarily.First and foremost: It's NOT pay to win per sé. You can achieve all the things you want by just playing the game. Even the crowns (which are used for upgrades) can be bought via ingame gold.My reason for not playing the game anymore is: Walls are bugged. I really wanted to dig in and build a nice stronghold. But when my archers bug through the wall and stand IN it or below it ... that annoys me to some decent degree.Also the combat is kinda wonky and if you upgrade your archers to increase their range the AI wont even bother defending itself.Nonetheless the game is more like a browser-game and CAN kill some time. Serious fun is not a thing for me with this game.			"

												This game is great so far. Been playing for awhile and imagine Age of Empires with a dash of the Total War series and plenty of High Fantasy Setting with a large open world map complete with questing, offline major keep skirmishes, coop, pvp, and tons of utilities and realism like weather, seasons, faction traits, perks and even random events. If you're looking for an RTS that scratches both a persistent world MMO and an RTS to enjoy with friends, this is definitely it. I would say buy it now, its $4.99 and it's already paid for itself with entertainment value. Looking forward to cool new features and updates with this!			"

												Devs, this game really made me have goose bumps when I first heared of a browser like rts/fantasy/medieval game. Start working! Get the game shaped!I would enjoy it the same way as I did the first (monthly progress) time, although the goofy combat, and delayed movement of units fustrates me, I will still play it. If that major annoyance would be fixed/improved/ or get better solutions, I would pay again (but don't get cheesy). But PLEASE. F****** don't leave the game die as many good ones did! It's a waste of art. Obviously I won't even talk about many features it can have, such as more races,more tech, management, more opportunities, etc....Just do this one splat of lazy movement and sluggish and unresponsive combat. Improve it.( You might say: ""you can get used to it, it's not that bad""...but then why does it have to be bad? when it can be improved. <<Lazy mentallity I say!>>)This is where you want to stop? or end your limits?. As many other obstacles may be (which of course I'm not aware of, financially or whatever) just don't give up. Is it just me this game is still feeling unfinished? (And yes, I am aware it's out already, don't tease me)Otherwise, enjoy the game. It's fun. As it is. Untill another one pops out even cooler and better then this. It always has been like this.			"

												Ok....when i first saw the game...it came with a subscription...granted with its graphics...and cash shop, as well as...slow gameplay it didnt really work out. Strangely though, the game does offer a few unique things. Units Lvl Up, indefintely, making the difference between keeping a large army or small elite force obvious.Unit mantainence is harder.Multiplayer Sieges especially on big cities are extremely fun, on a huge scale.On a side note, the subscription is gone.Cons: Pathfinding(not sure since i havent played it since its new update)          Cash shop advantages(there are daily rewards though, you wont get the dragons. A player who can get their city to become an economic superpower can however convert gold to in game CASH at a steady rate i believe)New: Arcana Update : New Units(mages in general) , removal of buying cash(no more pay to win, but im not sure, i havent been on for a long time), Better pathfindingUpdate: Arcana(not tested) : Includes better pathfinding as well as new units with spells as a focusUpdate: Arcana seems to have added guilds, also there is an EMPIRE expansion coming up for free, which enables more COOP or single player empire building, you can now get up to 30 towns			"

												If you like RTS fantasy games then this is a great one to start with! You can play offline single player modes but the online version is so easy for new players. To begin with this game is NOT ""pay to win"" it never really was but in the past about 2% of players shelled out the extra cash for some better units. Now there is NO cash shop. Instead you earn an extra type of currency called crowns by doing PVP. You can literally spend the first 24 hours of in game time just building up your city and levelling up units WITHOUT worryinging about being attacked. Your 12 hour immunity to attack BEGINS when you decide to build walls and you can hold off on the walls for 12 hours so you have a nice army and city ready to give any attackers a run for their money. The game matches you based on army strength so even when you do finally decide to PVP you will not be getting owned by players with much stronger armies, this is not the D-Bag gank festival that other PVP oriented games tend to be. Even when you do lose you still get a few crowns and your heroes do not die permanently nor are your buildings destroyed beyond repair! I am Namaste in game if you have any questions! there is tons of helpful posts in the steam forums to help get you started. It is the sort of game you can take your time with and play at your own pace! Hope you love it as much as I do, it is a steal on sale as of the 22nd for a limited time at 5$			"

												Dawn of Fantasy: Kingdom Wars is an RTS with some ""unique"" features, it wraps up some RPG and MMO elements in an RTS shell, I have got to say Dawn of Fantasy is not a bad game really. it takes patience, lots of it and can be pretty time consuming (from my admittedly little experience). Dawn of Fantasy looks and feels pretty ""rough"" but dont let that completely put you off from the game if you find it interesting. You choose from one of three races, then from one of three starting zones, you choose your heroes gender, and then name your city. Afterwards it should drop you into your tutorial. After the tutorial your loosed upon the world to build your forces and manage your city. Other than that I dont know how else to describe the game. In the end, all I can say is, does it look interesting to you? if so go ahead and give it a try, its free now!			"

												I Wouldn't buy this game, Reason is when i did i had to buy 3 slots for building other towns. Now i have to say i didn't log in to much cause well with everyone i had a job and worked, going out with friend living the so call good life! One day i saw they made an update to the game which i was fine with evething updates or new stuff get added in. I also spent some money on a few other things which was not to much maybe 20- 30 dollors canadian. Anyways i get in and everything is whiped , my account is wiped, i had no citys or anything that i worked for or spent time on. Ok so i was confused i made my account again went in and ask one of there so called devs who was trying to refer me to send in proof i did  any of that and everything would be i guess restored but not my citys i beleive i would have to rebuild them and that but anything i payed for would be given back to me. Long story short i can't find any of these so that makes me other a lier or it ws a money grab and for those that don't log on everday! Right now i would say the game was good but way to low population and other mechenics of the game were annoying but vary still playable!my e-mail is Patrick_Robinson_11@hotmail.com for any devs of this game that want to contact me on this issue cause im confused on how you wiped someone who payed for stuff but you still wiped a player who payed for more slots and a few others stuff! is this a game a money Grab or was it an honest mistake time may never tell!

One of the ways to play is in RTS mode but this mode crashes more times than not. Also pvp is very laggy at times. I like playing the game and have logged well over 100 hours trying to play this game. have spent money on it and overall am disappointed as I really like the idea behind the game.

												I have played this game a decent amount of time and i think you should get it. firstly it is a ftp game yes you may spend a couple of pounds/dollars in game but nearly every ftp does that , clash of clans for example gems KW crowns you should get this game before it goes global and is charging £15 or more because it is unique the graphics could be improved and the lag in big battles sorted out but every game has its pros and cons it truly is a hidden gem			"

												This game is pretty bad. The game has some neat idea's and concepts, but just fails to deliver even basic RTS mechanics that have been the standard for quite a while now. The controls are very poor and the response from units is very sluggish and half the time I tell them to do something they just plain don't do it or it takes the 5 seconds to actually start moving. None of the games mechanics are explained anywhere in the game and in a pvp game like this where you can be raided by other players this is a major fail by the developers.The quest system is also very poor at explaining what you need to do. A lot of the quest I did I had to fumble my way through as the directions aren't very clear and there's again no explanation on how it's done. The quest will say go trade with this settlement for X resource and that's it, but in order to do that you have to go to your world map fumble around for a way to create an army that can move to other cites then deal with poor user interfaces to select things and finally do a trade.The graphics are pretty lackluster as well, but I don't really hold that against a game as I focus more on gameplay.Combat is also a mess as you get large groups of units that are really one unit, but it has multiple small units that encompass it. These individual units can become spread out over a large distance sometimes which cause a lot of problems with organizing an army. Controlling units is some of the worst I've ever seen as there are no hotkeys for abilities or unit stances/formations and there is no quick way to know which units you have selected as again the UI is very poor and doesn't do a good job of clearly showing you what it needs to. You would think with all the units it would be cool in large battles to see them all fighting and stuff, but you would be wrong as they have no collision and will all stack up in small area's and at the same time they have collision with your units which makes them pathfind to where ever they want getting your units killed.Overall the game looks like and plays like it was designed for an iphone and it shows. The game is below average and I would say it's a 3/10 at best.			"

												Yeah, sure, it looks a bit derpy. Sure, the graphics aren't optimal. But this game has lots of things going for it. For one, it has excellent customer service, and it's not pay to win. The game overall is fun to play, if you like real-time tactics, albiet without unit collision it looks a bit like a derpy moshpit. The animation isn't optimal, but it's enough to enjoy the gameplay. The only real downside is that the game has such a dwindling community.			"

												Although the game could use a little polish, it's definetly worth trying out. Building massive armies, freedom to build and share you'r own maps and features. Helpful people always offering to give tips. decisive live strategy battles. laying waste to everything from small bandit camps to entire empires through massive seiges. The game is a bit finnicky and i have found a few bugs myself, but if  you are able of basic thought the game is easy to pick up but difficult to master. Including a lot of micromanaging and sort of planning economic success and quick decision making skills aren't required, but they are recommended. But all things can be learned in time. So on behalf of my word, try the game out, and i mean really try it. you can tell that alot of work was put into this game, and it deserves quite a bit of gratitude for it.			"

												This. Game. Is Amazing.  I always was intrigued by the mmorts, though i have never felt any of them got it right.  DoF on the other hand, feels like what i always wanted an mmorts to feel like:  An RTS where my city persists in a world with oither peoples cities. I bought the game solely because of the dev's participation in the community, and discovered that the game is really good.The content is really well thought out, especially the little things, like the types of units and their skills.  For example: archers have an 'enfillade' skill, which allows them to place spears  at their position.  Awesome.You can have multiple cities, so one could play as Man, Elf, and Orc, without being locked into a decision.Again, the little things, like the dialogue of the Orcs that really seem, well, orcish, and the Dialogue of the humans that have a real feudal feeling. The Devs also have listened to the player based, which is refreshing.  The players didnt want the cash shop: they removed it.  The players didnt like griefing:  they made pvp protection easier to obtain.  Another cool thing:  Your town can't get attacked if your offline.  Very cool.The community is really helpful too; Ive never seen a question in global chat go unanswered.I've always like real time strategies, and mmos, and DoF does a really good job of joining them.

												After playing this game and messing around on it for around an hour, I thought to myself that I wouldn't be playing it fo too much longer. However, I put a bit more time in to it and I intend to invest a lot more time into it now. Once your city develops and you learn more aspects of gameplay the game shines. The graphics aren't top notch, some issues here and there but overall, the gameplay is awesome and the customization of armies is brilliant. For £3.74, this is a steal. Also, the devs are good people! :D			"

												Despite what most are saying, the negative reviews are actually obsolete now, the development team and staff are only 5 people and they have managed to wrestle the graphics issues and such.they've also released their first free expansion with wizards and hydras.Also the P2W thing is kinda  off the beat, I got free units from the daily gift button which would be considered P2W, though the crowns are able to be earned in game by doing quests or even asking your alliance members.right now these guys need a huge help, I love the game...but it needs a more active community.Again most of the negative comments have been already adressed and if anything, this game is worth the price.I would highly recomend it for almost everyone who likes RTS's and MMO's. the graphics are a little bland and they are working on beutifying the game in a future update, but the seasons cycle, and the detail so far is quite good.P.S. I would also like to note that I got all three dragons through the quests, and the daily sales which is clientside, you can get them 50-75% off, so your quests can deal with it, though I will admit they aren't super powerful.

												Its free, And for being free it has a alot of army style options, fairly interkit, similar to age of mythology or empires, its new, needs patches . but its really promising and again the army tactics and possibilities are amazing with Fun co op, really hoping this game keeps working for more co op abilities,As well as the pay to play element isn't really there, you can “buy crowns” or do a never ending quest loop to get crowns , and that isn't very hard to do. And isn't too grindy as you can try new things every attack and the quests rotates missions.If you going into this game accept their will be bugs but its fairly forgiving game but still really fun, with a feeling of long term progress. as well as this game i belive has a chance to be big on steam.

												There is the basis of a good game here, but the interface is just too difficult to fight through and the gameplay not quite deep enough to make it totally immersive.I think the designers have made some bad choices here and there, in that instead of improving on the UI and deepening the game they have gone for breadth and made more races, which, athough it adds replayability, doesn't improve playability.They have some great concepts, the PvP ""shield"" being one of them, but they haven't been able to get over the steep expectations a game player has these days in terms of interface and display.It is a shame, because I get the feeling that with a bit more investment this could have been a really strong game.It is free up to a point, so I recommend you give it a try, your opinion may differ to mine.  It may just be that my tolerance level is too low for this kind of thing.			"

												Dawn of Fantasy: Kingdom WarsHello! Let me start by saying this. I wanted a game that I could command large masses of troops to attack strongholds. After searching EVERYWHERE I found this. This game exactly fit my needs! Now I am going to let aside my desire for games like this for the rest of the review to keep it biased.Ive been playing this game for about 80 hours now and I fell in love! I only have one friend that plays this so we usually attack together. The game is way more fun with friends! Now on to the things I need to explain.First if you don't care for the tutorials provided at the main menu you WILL be lost completely! I rushed straight to the game and couldnt figure out anything. Please Please do them. Next the Global chat and Disscusion page are needed! The in-game help is very minimal and you will have a lot of questions. Next this game has a lot of bugs!Now a lot of people say this game sucks because it crashes all the time and has slow battles. Do not believe them all. I can run this game at lowest graphics 50fps on my 3gb ram 1.2ghz laptop! When fighting large masses of people it is true that the frame rate drops. For me prop to about 3 or 4fps, I dont really care though because it picks back up after a few seconds.  Now on to the pros and cons.Pros:1. Awesome Gameplay and Idea2. Great Potential3. Friendly Community 4. Great graphics as a whole5. Good money system6. Very complex and soooo much to do7. Long Coop and Solo campaign8. Good rewards for fighting especially PvP rewards9. You can do everything in the game for free!10. Devs that are on the forums helping people out all the time!Cons:1. Individual Model graphics (Mostly my fault for turning down quality from High to Very Low)2. Bugs3. Lack of tutorials and guides4. Not very easy for new players to begin (goes with con 3)5. On my bad laptop takes around 10 to get the game loaded to my city (Again my laptop is bad) Finally my over viewThis game has grown a top from ""Dawn of Fantasy"" with new updates and bug fixes. I really enjoy this game and wish it does good in the future. I can spend hours a day on this game seiging new cities and taking territory. You can also do online coop quests with random people is you feel like it. It is Massively multiplayer and PvP! I hope whoever is reading this decides to download it and give it a try! I mean its Free! Cant get much better than that! And that concludes this reiew! "

												Hey addicting game, especially if you are looking for a medival/fantasy twist on the classic strategy / RTS type game play. I love this game because it combined the resource gathering and dependent villagers/peasant workers from Age of Empires with a beautifully done epic medival warfare gameplay that is reminscent of those epic scenes from Lord of the Rings. Despite being a smaller title this game has a lot of potential in being a great play for anyone wanting to play a Co-op / Single player game laying siege and marching troops across the map.			"

												The bugs alone ruin this game, that's without the dated UI and poor AI.The most game breaking bug I found (and posted about) where you can buy a building and sell it for more over and over again. What does this mean? You don't need to accumulate resources, you simply puchase all your solders via trade and upgrade them to max level with gold. It is a simple number fix yet it has not been changed despite there being a few bug related patches. Either the devs don't listen or they just don't care (or both). "

They rely heavily on magic and ranged in combat.			"

												Unstable servers & numerous game breaking bugs. The pathfinding is TERRIBLE, one can completely avoid melee attacks by spaming movement orders, theres a trick to it. If you give an order to a unit to enter a castle when the gates are open it will pass through the gate even if the gate closes before it arrives. For some unknown reason, even on a quad core 4.2 ghz machine, when units need to find a path it will generate a terrible lagspike and eat your machine alive. Also sometimes they wipe all your characters and you have to start over.Sometimes you will simply not be able to log on for prolonged periods with no explanation.Often the game crashes to desktop.If it worked it would be more fun.

												Great game, Its eal hard to find a game that hits all the aspects of what I want in a game. I understand their are still bugs that need to be worked out, but the progress made thus far are impressive and I can't wait to see what the game holds for the future. Recommendations: 1. Incorperate something to the alliance portion to make your own empire seem that more impressive. IE, more costumization pertaining to your clan. visual asspects that other players can see and say ""Yep, that alliance is awesome"", or ""How can we get that?2. Incorperate add on's to own castles. This will make each castle feel more of thier own deisgn and help players create more tatics for deffense. But make small add on's with a variety of dessions to work with. some you can earn and speacial ones only given by ether successfully defending your castle a certian number of times or completing certain missions. The sky is the limit3. I have a few more ideas but I would liketo if anyone responds to this. So I an't just wasting my time writing a bunch of ideas that no one looks at.Again, Awesome game and can't wait to see what u have instore next.			"

												This game is something with great potential.You get to build a town , build walls,collect resources, and other stuff in real time. You get a hero and some random people and use it to create an impregnable fortress, or an unstoppable army, or whatever. You get to choose between the usual fantasy lineup of humans, humans with long flowing hair and pointed ears (elves), and shrek fanboys (orcs). They each have unique structures and play styles and you go on adventure.That's all I got for the good now the badthey sort of lie about this being pay to win. Of course you don't have as much super BS in game currency. One thing you have is crowns but you  can get them from questing and stuff to build structures and research, and the build times are relatively short. But you have to pay SEVEN US dollars in order to have more than 1 town, you also have to pay to customize your hero in anyway. I get that these guys need money, but it would be nice to atleast have 1 more city free in order to test out other races without throwing all your work down the ugly thing they call a drain.Also they have a premium that tells you how many days you can use. I can't really advocate with bugs or glitches because the closest thing I got was this

												Online Empire Simulator, thats what i call the Genre, maybe you call it something else, but its been around for a long long time. Maybe you started in Tribal Wars/Travian, or noticed those Evony ads everywhere. I think my first was Astro Wars in 2002, (its still up) and countless more since then. For many people, the combat might of ruined the game for them, for almost all of these games use automated combat, you send an army and you win or lose.Some games of this genre tried to improve on that, offering tactical deph in way of army formations, eventually some games gave combat a manual mode, in turn based style; Heroes of Gaia and Forge of Empires for example. But we've all probably been waiting for a real RTS combat experience, and Kingdom Wars is the closest thing to getting it, and without walking for hours on an overworld.Naturally, merging these genres brings setbacks. Remember planetside 1? The first MMOFPS? Yeah, the actual gunplay sucked, but you played it because of the scale, you couldnt get that anywhere else, you put up with it. Kingdom Wars is in the same boat, stepping into new ground, the controls suffer for this and take getting used too. I dont view it as a MMORTS though, its an online empire simulator with RTS/RPG mechanics as its broken up into instances with icons to represent your army on the world map, a map shared by all players but in their own instance.Here's what you need to know you're getting into.You pick a race, then customize it by choosing a specific region, then two of five perks.Your town is persistant, you train workers to gather instead of upgrading mines. It CAN be attacked, but not while you're offline.When you make troops, they shouldnt stay in your town, thats when you enter the world map and create an army.The world map is full of NPC cities, these can be traded with, allied with, or dealt with. You cannot see other player cities or armies.There is a long story and quest chain, almost like its a single player campaign in an online game, you'll be doing quests but they can be done in co-op too.Your city is relatively safe compared to other games of this genre, chances of being attacked are low and you cannot be attacked while offline or otherwise unavailable.While your city persistently generates resources all the time, actively playing the game is very rewarding since there is no stamina system holding you back from playing it all day, it does great at blending the Idle and Active aspects of both genres.You cannot build extra cities like other Empire Simulators, you have a main city to grow, and other cities you conquer trickle rewards. You can unlock extra city slots in case you want to try other races or regions but these cities cannot interact.The F2P element is very generous too, starting with Protection peroids that only count down while you're online, having multiple and efficient means of farming premium currency, and restricting PvP to armies of similar Strength, so you wont be fighting an army of powerful premium units without an army of equal strength on your side, and even if you lose, you still get Crowns, so dont shy away from a fight!If you're just a RTS fan, this might not be for you, although there are unlockable Skirmish/Campaigns for solo play. But if you've ever enjoyed growing a persistant online empire then you have to check this out, I cant kill all the elves myself.			"

Although, I've found myself spending most of my time so far watching my hunters hunt while I wait for buildings to build. Still a very fun and in depth game. Pro's:+In depth and micro managable combat if you want to, click and swarm units if you don't want to micro.*+Fleshed out races with personalities. +Great soundtrack.+Fun animations and ai things to keep you entertained while things build.+Customizable city lay outs (for the orcs anyway, not sure about other races).+Good variety of units and upgrades.+Good PvP.+Very in depth lore that gives you a good feel for the world.Con's:-Buildings can take a very long time to build (as in a few hours real time).-Skirmish mode has to be bought. -Can be very dull at times.-Most of the quest dialog is text only, but there are still fun unit battlecries.-Graphics are about on par with Warcraft 3 (but then again, it's just as enjoyable). Overall, I recommend this game as a fun strategy game to play as a relaxing ""watch your city grow"" type of game. Especially now that it's only $4.99 USD. 8/10*EDIT: This has recently come to my attention (I didn't really get into much combat earlier and I'm just now really finding out about this): Unit AI. The unit AI is really buggy and they will randomly stop attacking, run the other way, attack things you didn't want them to, and are hard to control. I still recommend this game, but just be aware of this if you buy it (or downloard it I suppose since it's now free to play).			"

												Grand strategy game which heavily suffered from pathfinding issues, amongst other things. All these issues have now been solved, however. With the free Arcana Expansion released, now is the perfect time to grab the game.A persistent online RTS, or MMORTS even. There's been only few attempts at these over the past decade, and each has had it's own values. But Dawn of Fantasy: Kingdom Wars stands out from the few in the genre. In a good way, that is. This is a game of pure quality, you can experience the love the developers put into the game first hand. Apart from the issues which have haunted this game, the core gameplay is sheer fun. Building up your small settlement into a mighty fortress while managing your armies, sieging massive pre-made strongholds, or just going out on a looting trip, no challenge is ever the same.While I have not played the game in quite awhile, I do remember there to be an in-game shop using premium currency. Nothing essential, but plenty of things which cannot be obtained otherwise, including the mighty Dragons. I am, however, quite sure you were able to gain premium currency ingame, which becomes considerably easier the stronger your economy gets.Edit: The cash shop has been revamped. The currency can no longer be bought but only earned in-game. As such there are no longer microtransactions possible, removing any P2W brand the game could possibly have had. These devs are really responsive to the community and actually willing to change their model to such an extend. Kudos for that.			"

												A compelling store, decent graphics, and even a fairly priced micro transaction store. Playing Elves in a RTS game is something I have always wanted and now we have it. You can also play humans, and orcs but why would you?In addition to the race you also can pick the realm/lands they live in which adds an additional level on to the complexity and variable traits to your race and settlement. I can't recommend this game enough after 15 hours in and many more to come. The only suggestion I would have for the game developer and publisher would be to automatically give the user more ""city slots"" so I can try additional races without needing to delete my original city or purchase the slot that I may not use if the other races aren’t fun to me.Please try this game, for the cost of nothing you really can't go wrong. Also check out the sequel which is wonderful and cleans up some small issues I have in the original. "

												Well, first of all, the game offers nice world and ok story, even as multiplayer. But atleast for me, the best part is castle siegeing. Theres so many ways u can conquer places, and for me, that has been the best part, especially when fighting along with a friend. Would recommend this for anyone who likes rts/rpg games, especially for those who like knight's and fantasy settings. One good part is, that u can play it as a single player game if u want, and theres still alot of things to do.Pvp is a bit odd part, but the way it was implemented when i last played, was pretty nice imo. U dont have to accept battle if someone attacks you, and if u dont, he will get about 90% of the resources ur army/city is carrying, but only that army wich was challenged. And after each fight, even if you ""pay out"", ull get battle protection. Who can attack who, is defined by army strenght, wich was pretty well made last time i played. Strong units (special units like dragons and wizards) will pump up ur army strenght pretty fast, especially if they are high levels. Tho there may be some combinations that allow ppl easy wins with low army strenght, but those are only against some particular army strenght, so if its possible, its very minimal.			"

												previously wrote a bad review early december.Because - I was one of those who lost everything, account wiped clean.. after 200+ hours of gameplay and a few hundred dollars in 2013.Sent an email to support@reverieworld.com 7th december 2015. Turns out that my email ended up in their spam-filter.. x) ... ok, fair enough I guess, small indie company - in a busy time as well.But once the support did find out, namely the moderator Zane, in a matter of a few hours of personal support with the tools he had available I was up to close to where I was after 200+ hours of gameplay and a few hundred dollars.. since I did get a little bit of some of the stuff that wasn't even out back in 2013. (In exchange for some of all of the now kinda obsolete dragons I bought.. I guess you could say, since you can only have one of each now in an army.)So that's honestly some of the best support I've gotten from the game industry.. (if not the best, looking past the fact that the spam filter caught my email :P )  With that said, I think I can honestly say they do care about this game even after so many years and it going free to play... speaking about free to play, it does actually look like you can get everything for free it just takes a bit more time to build your stuff and level up - but only in the beginning when you build your city :)			"

												Kingdom wars is actually a pretty nice RTS, and while the MMO aspect doesnt have all that much yet (its mainly just PvP against other players or working with them to take NPC cities, alliances also dont do much yet) from an RTS standpoint i would say its pretty fun. The game takes a while for you to start up, and its certainly not the kind of game you'll ""finish"" in a week or so. Units actually matter as resources take time to collect and when most units die they are permanently gone (exceptions to that include the starting ""Hero"" unit and special units like wizards and dragons that simply lose levels upon death) Speaking of levels, as your units kill enemies they will gain levels, these can be used from simply increasing max HP to extending an archer units sight/amount of arrows. The units that you level over time actually matter as they will be the most powerful units in your army and form the backbone of your fighting force. Tt feels like battles actually mean somthing in this game, win or lose you will be affected. Currently there are only three races in the game, Humans, orcs, and elves, but talk of adding an undead or dwarvern faction is being discussed. I would say if you are into strategy games you should at the very least give this game a try.			"

												Well I have been keeping my eye on this game and been waiting for the developers to make some changes before I bought it. there is no more in game shop where its a pay to when with cash. I am happy about that. This is the only MMORTS game I could find that is actually 3d with micro managing. I did end up buying it due to the sale of 4.99$. my first thoughts where I wish the graphics were better but when I got a feel how the mechanics of the game works i lost interest ing the graphics and found it has allot of in depth stragety with city managment to build a strong economy. I suggest players to pay attention to the in game quests and everything will come together. I dont have much more to say being I only have been playing for a few hours but so far I am happy. if you go to the community page you will see the developers are very active and doing there best to get this game to last by listening to the players.

												So here I am 128 hours of gameplay in my first week of Kingdom Wars... The time I have spent on this game alone should speak for my overwhelming reccomendation of this game. What I still can't believe is that this game truely is Free To Play, and NOT Pay To Win. Anybody can pick up this game without spending a cent and find themselves ruling the battlefield. All it takes is a little knowledge of the economics of the game, and some good old fashion battle Skillz. This review will hopefully outline some of the awesome features included in this game, all so you, the reader, can finally jump into Kingdom Wars and finally expierence the MMORTS that is Kingdom Wars for yourself!First off, a look at the battles! What can I say except that they are truely an epic experience. The game includes battle matchmaking service that ensures you aren't being attacked, or can attack, other players outside of your own Army size and expierence. This ensures that veteran players can't simply prey on the weak newbies to the game. This is awesome as it ensures players don't often shy away from battles, and continually work on their own strategies and skills through first hand expierence. When you finally dawn that Army backed up with a royal dragon, and march to the front gates of an enemy, I guarentee your heart will skip a beat as they fly in wreaking burning havoc on the field.In addition to the gratification you will get from some PvP battle, there are countless PvE battles awaiting you in this game. The map is filled with other PvE castles and towns that are available to attack. In addition, after winning any of these battles you will have the option to loot them for Crowns, OR make them your own vassal, increasing your resource collection rate, and allowing you to recruit troops outside your own race.For those looking for a solid economic simulation, rest assured, you can find that in Kingdom Wars. A lot of the micromanaging has been eliminated from the simulation mode by adding the ability to select your workers and assign them tasks from their menu bar. This works GREAT in battle especially, as when fires break out during a seige you can simply click on the peasant and assign them to fire fighting, and off they go douse the flame preventing further damage. For those that enjoy the micro managing part of this, you can still individually click on your workers and send them to specific duties still. Workers duties don't just stop at your city. You can also establish work camps throughout your region, filling them with workers assigned to tasks on the map, such as wood cutting, gold mining, ore mining, and farming. Managing these camps is even simpler, all it requires is some simple clicking through an economics screen that lets you add workers or subtract them to tasks. This tool is also used at cities that have become your vassal, but in addition, have the ability to setup trade routes to other cities, further expanding your resource gathering.My favorite part so far with the game has actually been the fact I started playing prior to Halloween and was pleasantly surprised to see that the game gets so much developer attention they released a Halloween package that included an ""Eternal Night"" for the holiday. I could truely go on and on about the many features this game includes, but every minute I spend typing this review I feel my anxiety increasing from being away from my own game. That all being said it should be mentioned that there are some minor issues with the game still. On a couple occassions it has froze while loading a PvP battle, and I have found some resources missing a time or two. However, their is nearly always an Moderator or Developer on whom is ready to issist and remedy these issues. I am stunned by how much the developer team cares to ensure a solid game play expierence. In addition, it doesn't matter if you have purchased premium content or not, the DEV team still give you amazing service in navigating a small hiccup here or there. Plus, with nearly daily updates to the game, these small problems are quickly dissapearing. After playing a dozen or so ""Free To Play"" games and always being dissapointed in how much an advantage players who purchased premium content would have over others, I am simply in bliss finally finding a game where the broke the college student could come on and have an enjoyable escape without forking over their tuition money in order to do so...

												Hi, I am a new player to this game and I love it and would recommend it to anyone. It is a fun online game with a great story. If you like Lord of the Rings you will love this game, it has taken great aspects of the triology and has put a good story to it. I myself am a big fan of Age of Empires so I really like the game as the combat is even better that it.Another great aspect of the game is it PvP ( in a similar to clash of clans) but instead of being raided all the time. You can only be attacked while your online. And it's not just attacking their defenses like Clash of Clans but you have to fight their army like in Age of Empires.Thank you for not making it a pay to win game, those are just annoying.It is an amazing game and I would recommend it to anyone.

												It’s a great RTS game with some good Ideas…..but that is all it got, good ideas.The game suffers from bugs which really ruin the game experience, it's badly optimized, the UI is horribly designed – everything is really small and it's hard to find what you need when using it and the siege…..to say badly implemented is an understatement.The devs released a 2ed game so I guess this one was abandoned so I don’t even expect the game to be fixed at all….I would really like to recommend it but only if it would ever be fixed…..

Everything in this game can be obtained without have to buy anything, Even then special units can still be taken out with regular foot soldiers. The balance of this game is great between the 3 races so no one is at any great disadvantage making this a true game of stratagy. The customer support is very helpful and profesional as well and has helped me out a great deal. Even the online MODs are a great help with a good comunity to boot.			"

												Addictive game, with great economy/base building/castle defending and siegeing features. There are some issues, but they are getting fixed on daily basis and all bugs are addressed as soon as possible.Any RTS lover who's interested in MMO based strategy will love it. For those not interested in MP, there is also single player component.			"

Product received for free
												So I started this game with no real expectations. It looked lke your standard Battle for Middle Earth/Civillization knockoff game, with none of the interesting storytelling, and all of the grind. It plays well enough, with no truly devastating glitches that I know of yet, but there was one thing that made me stop playing. Before I get to that thing, let me explain some of the pros and cons of the game: As I've said before, it's like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mix between LOTR: Battle for Middle Earth and Civilization, with both Real Time Strategy elements and that good old fashioned resource management component to give it a realistic hue. You kind of get tossed into the game with no proper training, and the beginning of the game, as a result, can be a pain in the ♥♥♥. Thankfully, you get an awesome amount of Battle Protection, which keep the PVP hawks off of you until you can set up a decent and defensible foundation. There are four main resources: wood, food, stone, and gold, and a fifth pseudo-resource called Influence, or Crowns. Crowns are not important when you're getting your basics down for your town, but later on, they will become a very valuable resource that will become frustrating for you to acquire, since they mostly are acquired via quests of PVP. Luckily, however, you can convert gold to crowns, and if you're good at resource management, then it shouldn't be too much of a pain in the ♥♥♥ to handle. Getting the controls down isn't exactly a synch, but it isn't impossible to nag down, if you're experienced with RTS games. The game's story are lore are unimaginative and yawn inducing, with the generic, Tolkien esque knockoff vibes stemming from the three main factions: The Humans, the Elves, and the Orcs/Goblins. The dialogue is badly written, with some of the texts even bleeding off the boxes they are cramped into. The way the dialogue is written, it feels like the writers are trying to copy off ye olde engrish ways of writing, where every word and sentence is a headache to put together and understand in your head. Even if you do manage to finish translating the drek, it's all this very generic lore, with the elves and their nature and magic, the orcs with their war and tribal mentality, and the humans with their... Human ♥♥♥♥, I guess... There's obvious betrayals, with obvious setups for war and bloodshed, and the whole campaign is just there for filler, so the antisocial ♥♥♥♥s can feel like they're playing the game while the PVP nuts hash it out with each other. Now I'll admit it: the gameplay is riddled with dozens of little gems that made me keep wanting to play the game. You had a versatile unit structure (at least with the humans), that allowed for different approaches to siege and warfare. You can fight to defend your stronghold, you can fight to siee someone else's stronghold, and you can just get your army out on a field and hash another army's brains out for all you care. It's a nice, versatile game structure that allows for a lot of possibility. The problems crop up when it comes to controls and the AI itself, and this is where the story of why I stopped playing begins:I was set up as the Human faction, with a nice little stronghold on a hill in the mountains. I had set up everything I needed and didn't need, including a few mercenary workers from both the orc and dwarven lands to work in my mines when I needed them to. I had my peasants fully upgraded and able to handle and gather any resource I needed within minutes. I had an army with knights, mounted knights, cavaliers, and archers, all battle hardened and toughened up wth the scars and calluses from the many grind battles I did on account of Sir Lentoth. I had several dozen catapults primed and ready for a siege, with enough stone to last me several hours, if need be, and both my archers and catapults had the flame upgrade to give me a boost when I had to inevitably shoot the enemies down within their own walls. I was ready for my first major siege, and I was admittedly kind of pumped.I scouted the elven regions, looking for the smallest city to start on. I knew I wasn't ready for the big times yet, and that I needed to start small, so I didn't bite off more than I could chew. I picked out some ♥♥♥♥ery named city att eh top hand corncer of the closest elven region with the ""Very Easy"" tag written into the description. I said, ""♥♥♥♥ it, why not?"" and sent my army there. I started the siege, and found myself doing pretty well, going back and forth with my archers to and from the stronghold, taking out as many as they could before they died, bringing them back, and using my knights and hero to heal them up, and prime them for the next wave. The enemy reserve timer hits zero, their reinforcements come, and at the cost of all of my melee units, I take out the calvary they sent after me. I had 20 archers, my hero, and 9 catapults after that wave. I managed to take out the city's archers, and were using my archers to take out as many within the wall before my catapults took down the gateway. I had my hero healing them up as best as he knew how, and the process still worked, until I finally cracked through the walls. I expected to lose quite a few men once the walls came down, my archers could only reach so far, within the city, after all, and there were plenty of melee units left that were capable of taking me down if I wasn't careful. Problem is, I was careful. I knew my strengths and knew my weaknesses, and I used that to my advantage. I brought my archers in and used them to slaughter all but a few of the units in the city. At that point I decided to make a retreat to reheal and regather my strength. But there was a glitch in the game, a minor flaw concerning the AI. I had 20 archer units, mind you, and I had taken out all of the units, save for a few stragglers that were on their own. Nevertheless, I needed to heal, because something was off with the archers' targeting. My hero wasn't doing any killing, and ended up getting himself killed right at the gate. My archers were killing most of the enemy units, save for a lone mounted unit that they just couldn't hit. Let me reiterate, the archers were firing at the horseman, and were hitting him, but he wasn't taking any damage. He was the enemy that followed my units back to camp as they retreated, I tried firing, repositioning, and refiring once again, but this guy simply would not ♥♥♥♥ing die. His comerades died, the rest of his unit apparently died too, but he wouldn't ♥♥♥♥ing die, and wouldn't even get a scratch on him, regardless of the fact that I had 20 archers with flame arrows attacking him. He eneded up following my guys back to camps, killing them one by one, It was then thhat I realized that because of this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I couldn't get into the city for long enough to win the battle, so I withdrew and sent my army home. Maybe there was a technicality here, maybe the unit was a special one, he did have the ""Mounted Grandmaster"" title on him, after all. But that technicality cost me a battle,cost me my resources, and cost me my energy and time. I'm officially done with this ♥♥♥♥ing game, and I can't stand to see it on my desktop anymore. The minor glitches I could handle. the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ storytelling and grindy nature I could tolerate. The painstakingly slow travel speeds of the armies across the continent I could tolerate while reading a book or setting up my town some more. But this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, this glitchy, unpredictable ♥♥♥♥over was the straw that broke the camel's back. It's a free game, it's a 3D game, and it's playable until you start to do something important. So waste your time here if you want, I'm ♥♥♥♥ing done with this ♥♥♥♥.  "

												This game as a Free Play was great up until my Battle Protection ran out. Then no later than one hour out of player protection I was attacked by a very ""STACKED"" player, very POOR POOR Player vs Player balancing. Although I had played 20 hours, had a very decent sized army and defensive town (with stone walls) I was easily defeated by the attacker. My units were Level 10 to Lv 7 on average. All of the attacker units were Lv 20 that I could see. I had just built a Wizards tower and it would take another 120 crowns to build a Wizard, he already had one and it was fully leveled. I was not playing passsively, I played for a longtime building my base, fortifyinh it and building very decent army. Even so; as soon as Battle Protecttion ended I was crushed.I would not suggest anyone play this game unless you look for disapointment. I would relate this game to any other Facebook or CRAP Online game that requires a Pay to WIN requirement to pull ahead. If you wish to be attacked by Sadists who have money to burn on this game help yourself.20 hours in I was hugely dissapointed,had I been able to progress without Player vs Player it would have been just as enjoyable....however I got the EFFIN CRAP beat out of me by a guy ""vastly"" out leveling me and 10 times my strength. It's really not a matter of ""he did it better"" it's a matter of allowing players vastly stronger to attack and crush any other player starting out no matter how strong he is. It took me sometime to get some of my units to level 11 but as I said he had units all at Lv20. I was smart enough to go out the backside of castle with two Level 10 Mounted Knight units and flanked his Wizard and supply trains. I took out all of his supply trains and pounded on the Wizard for 5 minutes of game time and NO DAMAGE to the wizard. Not point of dmage done to the wizard. In the meantime his wizard cast lightning bolts at my castle defenders and basically took out 50% of my troops al by himself.If there is any game balance there you tell me.The game was somewhat fun up until that attack. I stopped playing not because I'm a sore loser but because if any player 10 times your strength can come in and hammer you then there is just no getting ahead.			"

												Well, I must say, when I started to play I thought it was not that good because I believe it lacks a tutorial and so when you start you start to get confused on how to play but just go to the top right and there should be a help menu, that helped me do some things but this game does not allow you to place buildings, which kinda sucks you cant custimize your city layout.     But it does get pretty fun when you start to understand it and get troops to attack. Thats pretty fun. I think it is very stragetic. Its not a bad game,But don't plan on customizing your hero and he wears some pretty basic armor, your town, well good luck it looks like a village for a while and i believe you can buy crowns to speed up building progress.     If you ever played clash of clans on tablet, its like that but with more cons then clash but its pros are pretty strong where you can control what your troops do but lack building placement, (does this mean that all our towns look the same)      Well this is a positive review cause i still find it somewhat fun, but give it a try if you think your into games like these.p.s. never send 3 squadron of troops into a army triple the size. they never come out alive.

												This game is a unique sort among the strat MMO's. Its tough at first starting out (for humans that is, I am not a fan of Orc or Elven playstyle) but once you get a decent setup the game becomes fairly easy if you can invest time into your economy first before rushing off to pvp and siege.Pvp however is fairly unbalanced as all the high levels who use their near unkillable lvl 60 hero's and dragons to terrorize lesser players. Though my sound advice for dealing with small minotaur forces and Hero's is massed Crossbows for the humans. Works like a charm.While there is an ingame micro transaction thing its completely option for customizables, and several booster packs that can only be bought once per city slot, I think this is a fair system compared to other games like battle pirates where its forcing you to constantly spend to stay up to date.The factions play very differently from one another, Humans play like most fuedal and medieval armies with a large portion of their troops (or as my suggestion goes for) A lot of Halbardier and Archer battalions as they are the cheapest to upgrade at the local training yard, Human siege is rather inaccurate and I would suggest for those dedicated siege armies to bring along 5-10 Treb's or 8 Dwarvern cannons if you have the crowns for them.I overall give the game a 6.5/10 for soild gameplay, friendly community, nice enough looking graphics.Though there are quite a few bugs overall besides the occassional resource loss or other minor incident I would recomend this game to my friends.

												I am not some expert in giving a review, but this game is good and very good. I feel so happy about this game, remind's me on Age of Empires and it is similiar with Total War series.Pros:+Good graphic+Base builder. Can build very big city and expand futher.+Three faction's: Human's, Orc's and Elves. Every faction have it's own way in development (I tried only Human's).+Can support/build massive armies.+Battles+Game is based on single player and multiplayer. You can open world map end see that meny stuff is based on      singleplayer, but if you bild an army, go to an empty field, then will apear PvP mode witch allows you to ""forge"" battles with other player's. Also, you can join or create alliance.Cons:-Too many time waiting for resources, building structures and marching amry.-Zoom level is limited.-Some bugs (games crashes some times). "

The market is well done and the special units are not out of reach of the casual player with a reasonable investment of effort.			"

												Real-time strategy is a genre enjoyed by most gamers. there are two distinct ways to play an RTS: online in a single game against opponents or offline against computer generated enemies. Dawn of Fantasy: Kingdom Wars is the first and ,as of writing this review, only 3D massively-multipleyer-online real-time-strategy game. At first glance, it seems as though these two characterizations could in no way combine together to form a fluent game that's fun to play. Dawn of Fantasy does this almost perfectly. The game takes place in a mideival era with elements inspired by fantasy. The game takes a healthy dose of inspiration from titles such as Age of Empires and Strongholds Legends while still remaining origional and unique. DoF is easy to pick up and play if you are experienced in the RTS genre, but can be challenging if this is your first strategy game. What makes the game unique is that it is in a persistent world that keeps on going even after you log off. while this may sound like a bad thing to you, it truly isn't. While you are away, you can't be attacked by other players and production of any units or construction of any building will not be halted. DoF manages itself well so you don't have to worry while you are away. The game's player-versus-player isn't overpowered either: you won't have to worry about being attacked by players with armies that could overthrow a galactic empire. Instead, you will only be faced against armies that match your own army with a slight 10% deviation. You also won't be attacked by anyone until you construct walls around your city, which isn't mandatory to continue playing the game but not having walls means that you can't play co-operatively with your friends.As soon as you do construct walls though, the game really gets into the most fun parts. As well as being attacked by enemies, you can team up with your friends and wage war against players and NPC's alike. With a game this amazing, you'd think that it would use microtransactions so players could pay-to-win. That is not the case in Kingdom Wars. As of January 10th, 2014 buying your way to victory with in-game currency has been disabled: meaning that the only way you can make money in the game is (Plot Twist!) to play it! I picked up this game for five dollars, but i'd gladly pay the full price for this game! "

												This game has become one of my favorites, and strongly suggest you to try it. It is free-to-playy, with a new and different free-to-play model. I wont tell any details, im sure you can find some. This game perfectly mixes fantasy and RTS with leveling of heroes and even the grunts can be upgraded. You have your basic grunts, y'kno, Swordsman, Pikemen, and Archers. Also, there are like 26 villages you can siege that vary in difficulty, and each has a different description and race, depending on the region. This game also allows you to PVP, and Co-Op NPC sieges. The resources are different and each race has a different strength when it comes to econ. I suggest you try it and if you dont like it, leave it a review.			"

												I'm a huge fan of strategy games, I've played aoe, empire earth, total war, bfme, stronghold, anno 2070, imperium, civilization, might and magic, spellforce,kohan,tzar etc. But Kingdom wars has its own unique concept. You have a castle in a campaing map, you can develop it just as you would do in a strategy browser game, all the changes you do remain. But with you armies you can assault npc castles with other players, you can fight against other players armies or you can assault other players castles, and all in rts battles! So you have a mix of a Stronghold castle building(permanent) combined with castle sieges and pvp battles.  The game has its flaws and some bugs but the community is really close to the players and they are still launching updates to improve the game vastly. It is not p2w, you have crowns which you can buy with money but they are really easy to farm with ingame actions.			"

												Not bad for a free game. I feel like the items they do charge for (all of which are cosmetic) are over priced for many of them however it is early on. The game itself has the problem most MMO RTS have of slow resource gathering but unlike a lot of mmos the buildings themselves build fairly quickly. A BIG thing I have to give this game credit for is they did something I've never seen. MMO 'strategy' games frequently give a grace period (usually 24 hours) that you can't be attacked during. However the counter continues to count down even when you're not logged in. In Kingdom Wars the counter only goes down when you're LOGGED IN! Meaning if you need to take a break and let things farm in the background you can sign off and come back later without loosing that starting protection.			"

												The pace is slow, can't deny that. And the learning curve could be bypassed a tad more by providing longer resource-boosts throughout the beginning stages for newbies. God forbid they build 69 houses and wonder why they're broke. A more in-depth tutorial wouldn't hurt, either - but then again a good portion of players skip it with a yolo mindset. Their towns don't last long.Anyhow, The graphics are fair, even on the Maximum setting(s). The mechanics (movement) is somewhat clunky, and it takes a good bit for your soldiers/army to realize they've walked past the enemy. A few key commands take a while to register at times, but it could be server lag(?)Resource accusition isn't unbearably slow, but it's nothing to hold your breath over; it's definitely a long term game.This is more or less what the browser-based-strategy MMO gamers wanted, BUT IN 3D!Overall, this game has DEFINITE potential to become something great. 6/10 for now. Will continue to expand.			"

												Kingdoms war is one of best MMORTS game what i play... game have great graphics, interesting game system and interesting story and what makes this game special is when you are offline, NO more attacks ... which means once you are online you can only attack the active players and they can attack you .. but when you log off from the game no more attack which is greatrecommended to all those who have had enough of spending too many hours on something that you can lose a couple of hours ONE NORMAL MMO game  this game is great you need to have it			"

												Dawn of Fantasy is alright. the start is slow, but once you start to generate income; things get going.one thing should be noted; it is P2WF(Pay to Win Faster). there is a currency called ""Influence"" in game that can be bought with either money or in-game gold. it's used for research and elite units.the PvP aspect can be almost completely bypassed by not building walls, which seems a little off for me.other than these few things; Dawn of Fantasy is a pretty good game to kill a few hours a day.

												If you liked playing ""Game of War"" or any of the Kabam style facebook and tablet games you will get a kick out of what they are attempting to do ""Scale""wise with this game.  Don't worry, they took the ""Pay to Win"" element out of the game that you read other people whinge about in the comments. The ""Crowns"" are a hinderance here and the fact that the monetisation was on this currency that was required for building and upgrading most things was an insane choice. Stick to speed ups and other convenience monetisation if you are to include any at all. Although the game is not ""Fully Cooked""* AI seems to be lazy and disobedient quite often (Pausing in place instead of heading into battle, with no feedback as to why.)* No real progression tree for Peasants/gatherers making this part of the game a dead end grind for resources.* Frame rate drops all over the place as something goes on under the hood that requires some serious optimisation.I do like the game and recommend it to any gaming dabbler that likes playing ""Newish"" games that are attempting something diferent. I've send the game drop in price below 10 usd. You may wish to grab it then.			"

												Hello everyone.I would like to let you guys know what i think about this game.Well its has great graphics.The game is easy to get started in getting resources.The community of the in game people will help you out the best they can.They are very friendly Building stuff in the game is very simple and easy to learn.How the game keeps playing while your off and your people still gather resources is a great thing to.The things this game could use is 1 to be able to send resources to your friends while they are away like an inbox service 2 to where the friends list updates when someone signs on there has been times where i had to log off when my brother would log on cause it wouldn't change to him being online.Being able to make other towns instead of having to stay with the same town would be nice. But this is my review of the game Thank You			"

												Kingdom wars is a decent game if you want to spend a lot of time building up a small village and slowly building it up more and more as time go on, to be honest I like it I havent found any game similar to it and of course there is also ingame store which I guess kinda breaks the pvp but if you want to just play by yourself build an army and take over cities even if you rip out your own hair doing it I would recommend buying it.PVP side I wouldn't recommanded it since it has ingame store which breaks it people can buy a chest and become a pain in the ♥♥♥ more or less right away it boost people up since you need a resource called crowns which you get from quest and other means but also you can get a lot by doing ingame purchases.

												Kingdom Wars, previously known as Dawn of Fantasy, is a controversial game.On the one hand, it offers some unique features well-made and set on a balanced way for the player to enjoy, when you could be expecting grinding. Despite being a FPS (free to play game) and, surprisingly, it offers very few advantages for players who decide to spend their money on it. Namely, you can buy singleplayer, a handful of skins for buildings, banners and heroes, some treasures (basically a 1 push economic boost that will give you a lot of resources) and the premium mode, that gives you better drops of Wealth (an ingame resource that is obtained through fighting), being only the premium mode timed. Excluding the treasures and the premium mode, everything else put together doesn't reach 5€ euros. One of the most non-greedy FPS MMOs I've seen in my gaming life.Gameplay wise, it has its ups and downs. The player freedom is absolute and there are no restrictions to what you may or may not do, at all. There are 2 stances in the game: PvE (Player vs Environment, the AI) and PvP (Player vs Player). Each player has his own game bubble and therefore is own environment, allowing him to fully refuse any player interaction and stick to the questline (which works as a tutorial and introduces you to open field and siege battles to prepare you for multiplayer, as well as offering a grinding option to obtain crowns and loot. Completely skipable but enjoyable). Each player bubble is connected to the rest through the server. In order for 2 players to fight, one of them must select the PvP option always available, and a search engine will find you the nearest fair opponent. The term ""fair"" refers to a strenght value that every army has got attached, avoiding this way imbalanced fights in terms of army size and quality. You may also choose to play cooperative the same way to take over a town, defeat the AI or complete a quest.As every MMO, there's a grinding component: obtaining Wealth. This is the most precious resource in the game that will allow you to upgrade buildings, recruit heroes and some other functions. However, you're free to choose your own way. You may earn as much gold as you can and trade it for Wealth. Raiding the countryside, taking over AI cities, player cities, armies, quests, unlocking achievements. Your own path and style all along.The looting, construction and squad/formation system, as well as the training and siege mechanics are very peculiar and enjoyable, actually making you feel like you're fighting in the harsh mediaval age and adding a very important and heavy strategy factor. There's a wide variet of units and strategies for each one of the 3 races (Humans, orcs and elfs), being the player able to hire troops from other races at any given time. The art style and looking is quite colourful and lively, your town shines with activity from the very beginning.On the other hand, not everything could possibly be good. The game has some unpolished factors and plain issues. Graphical glitches aren't hard to see, minor bugs (units getting stuck, happens very rarely) and a general feel of non polished textures and wierd motion when zooming in the battlefield. The beginning is quite slow and can make new players hesitate about playing the game any longer. The general perfomance FPS wise isn't the best either, making the less powerful PCs sluggish in large sieges and battles.Only time can tell if the game is going to fix these minor issues and become a high quality, popular game.Time has passed. I, as a beta tester who played the game almost 2 years ago now, can tell the development team has only improved in their work. New features are added almost every month, patches are released regularly and in good amount to fix both bigger and minor issues reported by the players. The community as a whole has a generally positive and friendly attitude. Mods and admins attend to every request the players make, include multiple (viable) suggestions and interact with the playerbase. There's almost everytime at least a set of mods in the chat in order to help players who have issues or don't know how to play the game, get started, etc. Refunds for minor losses, glitches or disconnects are instantaneous in-game and take a timelapse of (usually) less than 12 hours to happen. The support team also solves non gameplay related issues single- handed. (This is my own experience: I bought the game 2 years ago, and now that the system has changed, I've been given all the content that my original purchase included and some extras. For free). The playerbase grows in daily basis, the game is always in constant development and there's not such a thing as end-game.All in all, the gameplay after a few hours become very enjoyable. It's by no means a fast paced game: you may take your time to take decisions, reconsiderate the ones you've taken and scratch the ones that didn't pay off. There's a long-term plan. Even if you don't know. You're not going to build your castle overnight: it will take weeks, maybe even a month, as mentioned previously, the beginning is slow. The sieges are highly challenging and PvP is never easy, but the rewards are great. You'll lose entire armies that you'll have to rebuild from scratch, and you'll crush cities, kingdoms and races. The vassal system will allow you to eventually take over every AI center, and be attacked by players who desire such influence. The game is good, it's going to get better, and it's free. It's nothing like you've tried before. You should give it a chance, go ahead and have fun with it. The entire community and support team will be available for you at every point of your Kingdom Wars experience. "

												This game is not what it used to be, it has far improved from its original inherited state. As a moderator for the game, I may be biased, but my knowledge and experience gives me the confidence to say that if you choose to download this game, you will not be sorry. However, there are still some bugs, one of the problems with using an old engine. Despite this, they have completely overhauled a majority of the original game, fixed the broken pathfinding, made the world conquerable with the addition of vassal cities, added alliances, and so many more features. All of these additions were free, and now that the game has gone F2P, there is no reason not to try it.			"

												My Review of Dawn of Fantasy: Kingdom WarsIt should be noted I do not review a game unless it is very good or very bad, in this case it is exceptionally good.Its almost as if the game was made by people who actually play games! This is not really an MMORTS, and those die hard fans of the MMORTS genre will likely be a bit dissapointed but don't let that hold you back. Essentially this game is a single player game with multiplayer matchmaking. You develop your humble little hamlet all the way to a thriving medeviel metropolis, micromanaging each detail along the way. At least until you get familiar with the MANY shortcuts the game has to offer, for those people not interested in examining each element of your lemmings life. For those who do, however the game rewards you! One example of this is in your main city, creating a more efficient system for gold to be mined, will actually help more than just clicking on your lemmings (peasants) and telling them to mine gold.There is no shortage of depth in this game, while you may indeed find it a bit lonely I think you will easily discover (as is typical) the long list of NPC questions will give you a more ""roleplay"" (or if you are a hipster, ""immersion"") value with go for a very long time.True to it's boast this game is not a play to win game, of all the games I have seen with a dollar to virtual economy, this game doesn't punish you for buying ""crowns"" but you won't get any real shortcut for doing so either. Even people who have to buy crowns will need to spend ""days"" building their city.Which brings me to my next point, one of the most attractive elements of this game is setting up your ""peasant factory"" to do stuff for you while you are offline, or even playing in another kingdom, or better yet going on quests or doing many other things so you don't need to manage every detail, truly making you feel more like a leader. Just as well your leader can avoid combat or jump in to the fray at whatever style works for you.The thematic fantasy style brings to light many different stories that could easily fit just about any medievel genre, from Lord of The Rings, to Elder Scrolls, or even Dungeons and Dragons and the storyline and overall build of the world of Dawn of Fantasy is freeform so as not to handicap your imagination.This is the main part of the game, an immensely deep and enjoyable user friendly simple single player RTS with an optional matchmaking, I suppose you can consider it a massive multiplayer RTS, but I feel it is more as I have described. However, this is just the main part of the game, the game comes with a powerful 3d Editor and a single player version of the game that is much more strategy oriented but just as deep and entertaining.Oh yea, it is worth buying! would I suggest buying crowns? Yes, crowns could help late game and speed up getting to the late game, as they are necessary to purchase higher power units and may take a lot of time to get in game (mainly because you will use those crowns for upgrading).

												One of the most atmospheric RTS game's I've played and I've played a lot. The graphics/textures may not be AAA quality but they get the job done. The textures are greatly overcome by the stunning lighting and ambient sounds. The three races are very unique and all fun to play and each come with their own strategic playstyles. The City building is especially fun to show off and makes defending them a whole lot more important. The pathfinding needs some work and there is a ton of lag in PvP as there are no Australian servers. The battles are quite overwhelming with the vast amount of units and micro managing is very tedious as unit selecting is glitched. Overall it is an enjoyable game once you get around the many minor technical problems. 7/10			"

												This is a game that may be similar to other's in some ways (think Warhammer: Battle March), but also contains a new and beautiful element of building your own Multiplayer Empire. The initial few sessions of the game may be a little slow if handled incorrectly, but if you focus on spamming workers and houses as much as possible in your first few logins - the game really picks up pace. Remember that every resource gatherer pays for itself in time and then adds to your empire FOREVER (or until you accidently run it into a pack of Orc Wargs whilst trying to run from a spreading forest fire...).Resources are collected while you are offline so my advice is to dabble with the game and focus on raising the population cap, building a workforce and balancing your economy. Then when you find yourself with an excess of resources, build yourself a decent army ready to play co-op battles against surrounding computer-controlled cities. If you find yourself producing too much of one thing, carry it to an allied city and trade it. From here the game really opens up - your units start to level, your new vassel cities begin to gather more resources and your power snowballs.The beauty of this game is that it ISN'T too easy. If you lose a unit (or an entire army), then, well, tough luck. You have to apply your mind, know when to pull out and heal your units. It is wise to build a ""backup army"" to replace losses and learn what is worth sacrificing for the potential gain. Losing a couple of fully levelled archer units will be worth it if you take a city in return, charging in 16 units of fully levelled knights suicidally is not.Similarly PvP is where it really gets interesting. You may attack or be attacked by a human player with a balanced army, though this does seem like a fairly rare occurance. A few days ago I was attacked by a player whilst carrying looted resources back to my home city, I didn't want to pay out the forfeit for refusing to battle so after challenging his hero to single combat and buying myself some time, I simply led his army on a merry dance around the map. As he chased me, his army became strung out and I picked away at his front units until he simply surrendered, giving me 5500 gold in loot :)The terror of losing his men made him pull back, making it feel like a realistic war experience. So far my experience of this entirely free game has been positive. Whilst it is possible to buy a very limted amount of ""booster packs"" per-nation you create, it is no way game breaking or unfair. They can only be bought once and their contents can be reasonably attained anyway with a few sessions of play. Considering PvP is balanced by army strength - it should never really be a problem for people who don't buy them. Think of it as a small bump to help players get going (for a small fee to help keep the game running).As far as reliabilty is concerned, I've faced a couple of heartbreaking bugs whereby my hard-earned gold disappeared in transit - BUT - within a few minutes of putting my problem on the General Chat channel, rather polite and decent Moderators refunded my resources and left me a happy elf, swimming Scrouge McDuck style in my pile of gold again. I used to play subscription based World of Warcraft, they take 2 DAYS to get back to you, so the fact that a free game can fix your problem in a few minutes is quite astonishing. I'd like to give a shout out to okiya1 and Risette (Riselle? Risille? Sorry it's been a few days!) for providing the fastest and most concise service I've ever recieved on a game. They clearly represent a moderator base of people passionate for the game and the players who play it.So yeah, play it! But be patient. The initial stage of building up population and economy can feel like a very solo experience, but from walking you'll soon be running and making great allies to build your own fantasy empire! Always ask in general or help chat channels if you need advice, there is a very supportive community and many Moderators to help you. I for a start am happy to help any fledgling Empire get off the ground, be it Man or Elf. But not Orcs though.Their Worgs ate my Workers :'(			"

I'd definatly watch a walkthrough though, for the beggining, because my dumb mind couldn't comprehend how to create an army for the first 20 minutes of gameplay XD (which btw, all you do is click on your town below your town name on the map to do :p).

												Kingdom wars is not only an RTS with in-depth leveling system on units, it is an MMO. The ability to co-op seige npc towns to gain bonus resources and crowns (used for upgrading technologies, and advanced units) is remarkable.Combat system - Each group of soldiers has a number of units inside it, and as long as 1 lives the entire group can be healed. The abilities of each group of soldiers also come with abilities which help in the midst of battle, some are more defensive abilities while others can deal heavy damage or movement speed in tough situations. In all the combat is well rounded with units that counter other units, and ways to win if strategically done.Building and Resources - This game is not a win in 1 day game, it takes patients and time to succeed into being a king. The resource gathering is per minute, which draws the building out but is worth it. During the time it takes to raise walls and gather resources for other builds you can spend time doing the Unlimited quests in the game for Crowns (In-game currency). Each building takes time, but you can build it all at once if you have the resources for it, or if you become impatient on a nessecary building you can rush the build with Crowns.Questing - The game has unlimited quests, this gives you a never-ending pve aspect to a largely pvp game. From Quests you recieve Crowns, and/ Resources. Some quests are very challenging but with co-op quests it notifies you that you can get assistance doing the quest (either from a random player, or from a friend off of your friendslist).PVE - I enjoy the pve the most. The battles in each of the zones is different, elvens fought in elven zones, humans in human zones, and orc's in the orc zones. Beyond that there are zones not allocated to a race. These zones have harder creatures to fight like orges (a unit of the orc's but the entire zone is ogre's), Dwarfs (a style of unit bought with crowns), goblins (another unit of the orc's but the entire zone is goblins), and even an extremely hard zone of Dragons!PVP - The pvp is setup as matchmaking, you will never fight someone much bigger then your army/town and you will never be able to pick on the weak. Its balanced so that you can enjoy fighting without the fear of being slaughtered. If you choose not to fight a player who is trying to fight you then you can do a ""payout"" option and sacrifice some resources or a few units to not have to battle them and it allows you to return to what you what to do (Quest, farm, pve, etc).Not pay to win - I want to state that in no way is this a pay to win game. There is options for buying packages, and being a Premium account but it gives only crowns, resources, and a bonus daily reward for premium accounts. These are all things you can aquire very easily in game but by buying a package you are not spending 30+ minutes gathering the resources or farming the crowns. Buying premium not only saves you time gathering crowns, it also helps the game grow and gives incentive to play. As a closing statement to this i will repeat - Its not pay to win, its free to play. Buying only helps you grow faster and helps the game grow faster. In all I must recommend this game to anyone who enjoys RTS games, this breaks the mold of what RTS use to be and brings a new light on the future of RTS. I have enjoyed every aspect of the game and hope to see more content in the future.			"

												It is a really fun game. Creating your mighty city from the small speck of land is a satisfying experience ( It takes time though as does building up an army, but it's worth it). There are always people online and the community is very helpful. A bit of advice stick to the world chat rather than regional chat. Co-op and pvp are fun, you can take npc castles (you can make them your vassles and they will give you tribute) together or challenge each other on the field of battle or in epic sieges. Since the last update I have not had a crash, which was the games only real drawback before,  though it did not stop me from playing 170 hours.Edit ( Becuase I forgot to mention)There are DRAGONS in this game, there are wizards too, but I like dragons more.

If you are in to Real-Time Strategy games that lead to a lot of fun to play and give some epic wars, this is one of those better games. There is still a lot to do for making the game more playable for a larger public, but devs are active or at least seems to be active :P For this money, just enjoy the game and hope that some better changes will follow! Have FUN with it! (personal i prefere the single player, multi seems to be a bit buggy in bigger battles). (my score : 8/10 for the first game - 7/10 for the second like it is now).

The game sometime crash and kick you out, losing all the progres in batlle, time protection etc..This is the point that make me feel more angry, because the strong of the game is that point and can not afford to fail in this.I hope the developers continue implementing it and improving it, adding new additions, and most cooperative and perfecting everything about the connection with other players. One way of statistics would be fine either global or battle. In short, this game hope and desire to grow and implement more because here is gold, but need to resolve BUGS, BUGS, BUGS, that only give you frustation.

But, poorly executed in my opinion.Some issues I ran into:- While the tutorial covers how to play as the humans, I tried playing as the elves. Must have been playing for 2 hours before I figured out how to add additional buildings. Not at all clear.- The text in the game is an odd mix of old-english and modern. Threw me off quite a bit.- The elven language uses a lot of custom words and lexicon. But they don't explain what many of the words mean, and you have to figure it out from the contex of the conversation.- Tooltips for the upgrades referenced other upgrades that I could not locate.- Graphical problems. The game would freeze randomly. Sometimes the game would suddenly flip back and forth between day and night multiple times over a few seconds. Turning down my graphics settings didn't seem to help.These are just a few of the issues I had.			"

												The game may seem slow at 1st, but you'll come to love it when you start owning the npc and after that, pvp.  The game has all kinds of monsters that you can train into your army, dragons for example.  You can explore, man i love exploring the world, destroy anything in your way.  It's not pay to win so anyone has their chances of winnning.  So far it has everything that a medieval age game you would want.  There's mages too, which i barely got 1, they're hard to get.  There's 3 races atm, Human, Elf, and Orcs but i look forward to more races(undead).  Hopefully there will be navy fleets too from the looks of image pop ups.  So far the only bad thing is some bugs, and the archers are mentally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  You would think that they would shoot the enemy but they shoot the buildings(does no damage depending on what structure) or on the ground cause of the level of the ground is too high.  So basically you have to manually control them so they dont waste arrows.  As for the my last words, I'mma about to get a hydra! lol			"

												Been playing the past few days and I feel like I can finally make a decent review. Does not seem to have many pay to win aspects to it which is very good for a free to play game. Can get a $10 and $20 pack which will put you ahead but does not seem to give you anything you cant get already, devs need to eat too. Has a sort of Age of Empires feel to it which i like.Unit pathing currently seems to be a bit derpy but definitely not a game killer as im sure it will be fixed. Some other bigs here and there but no game breakers and im sure theyll be hammered out soon so that wont rly affect my judgement much.Be warned if youre at 90 pop cap in your city do not try to keep buying houses to increase your population, price will increase and youll keep paying wood but no new houses, they should definitely disable the button once you hit the cap, again nothing really major just something that made me a bit sad when i realized what happened.Game has a bit of a learning curve (like any mmo / rts). Could likely use some pop up hints perhaps to help new players along. Few of my friends i brought along to play were getting frustrated and i had to help em along, Which isnt a big deal i could just see players not having someone to help them simply giving up out of frustration. Yes i know there are tutorials in the game but lets be honest. Aint nobody got time for dat.Other than those few things which werent really al lthat bad i cant really think of anything negative so now ill start on the positive!Siege warfare seems so far to be implemented pretty well, I like the different world view and city views. You definitely have an mmo feel to it with the quests and your hero but also functions as a very good RTS, They have balanced it pretty well which makes this game pretty unique. I like the trading you can do in the game as well, different cities seem to have different prices for goods which also seems to fluctuate. Gives you something else to do other than the regular quest / kill grind.Early game they have you start off pretty well. You have an income boost which helps a whole lot and really gives you a good nudge to get growing quick, I like the fact that they did this as it makes it so there is little down time / sitting around waiting for resources to accumilate.Different races seem to have different ways of collecting resources, for example orcs dont have farms like humans and they must hunt. Not too sure on elves as i have not played them but differences like this really make each race feel different and adds new things for you to do and new ways for you to play which can keep this game feeling fresh and new for a long time.Normally when i see a currency in a free to play game (crown in this game) I immediately have a bad feeling about the pay to win aspects. They seem to have made it so that after every battle or quest you get crowns, and you dont really need too many to progress. and the packs you are able to buy are limited to one per city slotso someone cant spend all this money and get 10 million crowns. Kudos to the devs on that one.Well thats pretty much all i could think of off the top of my head. Overall i would rate this game at a 7-9/10 (7-9 only because i feel like i would need to play to the end game in order to really be sure)			"

												Kingdom Wars, a fantasy RPG game based around 3 races, the Elves, Humans and Orcs. This game is an ''Open-World'' RTS with RPG Elements here and there, with a great execution on Mass-Battles it can be kind of unbalanced here and there, in PvP for example if you have a highly trained army of 25 people you will be easily killed by a weak army of 10 units. The game still requires alot of scaling in many different aspects but the developer team which by the way exists out of only four people who are working very hard to provide you the best possible RTS game they can make out of this.Gameplay, the gameplay aspect of this game is still wonky and outbalanced by bugs or mistakes in the ''Scaling'' system but overall it is still a solid part of this game and most ''Hardcore-RTS'' players will be able to look past it. This game is  not very competitive because of a simple mechanic called: Battle protection. It allows you to not get attacked by anyone at all for a long time. In most FTP RTS games the Battle Protection timer continues even when you are Offline, but in KW Battle Protection pauses removing the Competitive aspect of this game by a lot. Luckily though, you can never be matched against an army bigger than your own. After some mishaps here and there and unbalanced features the gameplay is still solid and since it will most likely be improved in future updates it isn't such a big issue. I give the gameplay in this game a 6/10. Which will most likely become an 8/10 or a 9/10 if they fix these issues.The biggest problem in this game so far are the graphics and the countless bugs that keep appearing, while this may sound like a stupid thing to say, in this case it really isn't. The resolution in this game is incredibly low, I have seen games from back in 2001 that look better than Kingdom Wars. And Kingdom Wars was made in 2010. The bugs though are far worse than the Graphics. People are constantly reporting in that they crash during Sieges or that they bought something with real money and didn't get what they bought an even bigger issue is that the resource counter doesn't work. For example, sometimes I make 10 food per minute and 95 wood per minute and then 10 minutes later I make 29.9 food per minute and 63.5 wood per minute, the Resource counter is by far the biggest issue. Small things like this can be quite irritating at times but it is also to be expected from a WIP game and will most likely be fixed eventually.Cons include:-Outdated graphics-Several unbalanced gameplay elements-Lots of bugs-Huge amount of dialogue can be a bit overwhelming at timesHowever this may sound negative, the pros in this case outnumber and outscale the cons by far. Pros like:-Solid gameplay-Lots of detailed lore -Frequent updates usually containing lots of bug fixes-An ever growing, non-toxic and friendly community-Great and active staff members-And most importantly, NOT pay2winThis game has a lot of potential. As long as the developers get rid of bugs and expands upon its pros, this game will have a bright future ahead of it.			"

In this game, so everything has worked perfectly . At the moment, every 30 minutes, I 'm fighting with the NPC. And every fight increasingly draws me to the game . In this game I will play FOREVER.

												I only have 2.5 hours in the game, but I used to play it on my brothers account for him before I used steam for games, I only actually had Steam originally because I needed a Valve Account to play TF2 on the PS3.. So I used the one my brother made for me. But yeah, I put a little of 200 hours on it for my brother, he ended up deleting the game when I got my own PC so, and the PC I got wasn't able to play the game, so I ended up forgetting about it. So about a year or two ago, I found it again and started playing, I had a better computer then, and so I played it every now and again usually only for about 5 minutes just to check up on my village, and rebuild my defenses. So I didn't do much. However from when I used to play, it was still full of Microtransactions so it wasn't like it's not the same as it is now, and I loved it then and still do, you also have to remember, back then there were a decent amount of hackers... not as much as War Rock but they were still there, and they weren't all that blantant, no free gold, just faster troop movements and probably slightly faster build speeds. So it wasn't really that noticable unless people were recording them invading, and their accounts got looked into by the devs, Most of the time they didn't get banned, the devs just patched the game to disallow the hacks being used. Nowadays I rarely see anything about hackers in the forums, so it doesn't seem like an issue anymore.			"

												Okay, I'm going to explain the good and the bad about this game. Keep in mind that this is my first review.The bad: You cannot manuelly place buildings, they are all automatic. If you're hoping to leave your workers to gain resources for you while your offline then you'll be terribly mistaken, while offline you gain 50% less resources than you did before. The game is terribly buggy, Some units walk across the sky in sieges, some walk over mountains and the pathfinding is not that great. The AI are some of the worse I've ever seen; While doing a custom siege I sent my reinforcements to attack the army that was besieging me and after they killed my reinforcements what did they do? they stood there for the next 45 mins doing nothing when my castle was rype for the taking. Some of your troops wont attack certain troops when they're standing right in front of them unless you right click on them to attack. The game also has a terrible learning curve and you will ofen get bored playing this game. You WILL spend most of your time in the world map traveling between cities and to new strongholds to attack. Also when starting off in southmont players can attack your townhall from outside your double layered walls and immediately win the battle since battles are won by destroying the town hall, not the army nor the city. The town hall. Mods are also usually never on, I've never seen one on anyways or one that would actaully do something productive and help players. The good: PVP is fun. Sieges are fun and battles in general are fun. The storylines are decent. Though you cannot manuelly place buildings it is always nice to finish your city and admire its beauty. Theres also a nice little shop that you can spend crowns on to get special units or more resources. Crowns can be rewarded to you through attacking other players or doing quests or by buying them. You also require crowns to build walls. I played 12 hours into this game, so before you haters say I didn't play the game enough then think again. I played 12 hours into this game and i listed all the things i could think of and most of those things are bad. This game may be for some but it's not for everyone. If you can get past all the things listed above then this game might just be for you. 5/10. Im not the best at giving ratings.			"

Dawn of Fantasy features both Online PvP play as well as a few single player modes more geared to the casual player. Single Player mode is broken up into three sub-sections; Lay Siege is a quick jump in and play random scenario that starts the player with a squadron of troops and siege weapons (such as Belfries and Trebuchets) in a basic camp just outside the enemy fortress .The goal is to invade the enemy fortress break open the main gate and kill the king. There is only one wave to play in lay Siege and the outcomes does not affect your save file Homelands.Next we have Castle Defense, a little more involved, where players instead are given a hometown with peasants,soldiers,and walls. Tower upgrades, many archers, and spike traps are key to surviving the long siege as wave upon wave of enemy troops march towards your castle front. One problem with this mode is that the enemy troops swarm up by their target gate but do not move out-of-the-way for the battering rams to do their job. Soldiers don’t break in, siege weapons stand around, in fact everyone stands around slowly getting picked off by a single battalion of archers perched within the final keep. Even when the next wave arrives the only rip apart what they can easily access. Again all spoils go to no one after victory/defeat is declared. Lastly for single player there is the Kingdoms mode. This is like a campaign but more open ended. It uses the World Map but with less instruction than the Online Kingdom provides. And instead of quests and tutorials players are given an expected battle every few minutes regardless of progress made. The goal of this mode is to conquer the entire World Map without your Hometown being captured by the enemy forces. This is in my experience the hardest part of the game,and if you are new to the game and confused on how the world map works, don’t fret, it is explained in the Online Kingdom mode, the main mode of the game,which is next.The Online Kingdom mode is a go-at-your own pace experience that guides players through a story based on the player’s selected Kingdom. This game differs from the single player games because it revolves around taking armies out from your hometown and bringing them to the World Map so that they can travel to other towns and quest locations. Other towns give means of trade, buying mercenaries, training units to do other jobs; and in a pinch acting as a place holder for precious units when the town population cap(s) are full. Swapping between the two perspectives, world map and town, is the vital key to Dawn of Fantasy’s uniqueness.Along with all the mechanics introduced in the other modes, this one has an extra influence resource known as crowns that can be used to buy other resources,speed up building constructions, and most importantly buy special units such as dragons and Dwarven fighters. For $9.99 you can buy 120 crowns which grants one the option to purchasing the Royal Dragon, the most powerful unit in the game. Unlike the Kingdom’s Mode of single player, battles are engaged at the pace of the player. The image below is a swarm of Orc Riders actually waiting to speak with my towns hero before deciding to attack my precious colony.With all these gameplay modes spending an hour or two building armies and raising an effective economy is quite easy. Units are created in squads of multiple members. Instead of training one peasant for 180 food the game actually trains 5 little guys on the screen, same goes for infantry. Despite these 5 little workers being spawned the towns’ population is only increased by 1 for doing this. Building houses also increases the total population cap by 1, making a booming economy a very long-term goal. Paradoxically, gathering times for resources in Dawn of Fantasy  are a slower than some may find comfortable. This is to encourage the World Map exploration and trade, as well as looting the dead corpses with peasants for that extra economic boost. Erecting buildings requires no peasants, but takes on average an hour to complete without the use of any crowns.Presentation of the game has a few minor bugs in it as well. Some background cameras in town menus do not stay on course and can be spastic. Leaving your mouse on a button can provide information, but it does not help when the information box is in front of another button. The ticker above head saying the resources gathered per minuet is also inaccurate, and will not update even when there are peasants collecting a resource .Despite these few hiccups the game itself is a treat to play. The camera controls are well done, same can be said about the speech banks. Unlike Age of Empires, the characters in-game actually say what needs your attention, instead of the sound cues you has to learn about through multiple session will not disappear Dawn of Fantasy is a game filled with hours of gameplay for the strategist waiting to capture castles and rule a world of fantasy. The PvP options now are for the competitive player mostly, because you cannot share resources with other player in-game, however alliances in a multiplayer game .			"

												This game is a lot of fun... at first.It's a fantasy based real time strategy game with a surprisingly good interlacing story for each of the three factions. The free-to-play model is actually very good and isn't as pay-to-win as some people claim, especially since they added a hard-limit to how many crowns (the in-game currency needed to buy the most powerful upgrades/units) you can buy with gold. You can take control of dragons. O.oIf you're clever, you can thrive in this game very quickly. PvP is.. fairly balanced but it feels like an afterthought. What stinks is that the game almost forces you to co-op if you want to take large NPC cities as you only have 30mins to complete a seige. I really, really want to give this game a thumbs up because it IS a lot of fun and has a ton of potential BUT it is absolutely plagued by bugs. You will most likely rage quit the first time you spend 25 mins trying to take a city and the game crashes.. which happens OFTEN. Armies and units will get stuck and you might have to start over entirely. Controls lack finesse. Ehh.. if you're reading this and love fantasy RTS games, feel free to give the game a try but expect a few technical difficulties.			"

												I personally like Kingdom Wars a lot. First of all I have to say this ISN'T pay to win. I think people saying that didn't understood the game at all. Everything is achievable through gameplay for everyone, only payable items are pure estetics, also the premium just gives a speed boost in certain ways, it is for example like buying an exp boost on league of legends, you just go faster, not better. I repeat, this is a free game, so you can't blame people who use the premium, you can get the full gameplay without it. Guys spending money, are just helping the devs and the game getting better and bigger, is that a bad thing? That said, the game is great, I see a lot of potential. Yes, there are some bugs (what game has no bugs?) and the devs are awesome in fixing them as fast as possible. Just try the game and see yourself, it is free.I really hope new players will come, this game truly deserves it.			"

												Kingdom Wars is a amazing title to play if you are into the rts genre. Taking the scale of the total war series and stronghold games it is a game you are sure to play for hours. My inicial recations and thoughts on the game were that it would be a pay to win players dream, but this was not the case. Like many F2P games out there paying only gets you cosmetics that have no greater purpose. The ingame economy system is also well balanced with limatations to just how much you can acheive. Based around four main resource types and crowns, the harder to earn currency, you'll have a fun time trying to arrange your workers into such a way to balacnce it out. Another strong point in this game is the graphics and model textures. For being made by a realtively small company the game is very well looking with some much going on at once with minmal to no lag what-so-ever. Going off of graphics they have a very sound sound engine (pun intended) that has very realistic effects and ambience.Now no game is perfect, this game does have a few bugs now and then, but nothing gamebreaking. The devs and mods are on all the time with their fanbase and players supporting and helping when they can. It can also be a little on the hard to run side if your computer is a little on the lower side. With the amount and time the devs put in this game can only get better in the future.			"

												Kingdom wars is a well thought out Real Time strategy game, the ""pay to win Option"" is almost not there which makes this game unlike the others out there by a long shot.the pvp is good and one of the best things i have seen so far is skill,skill can win you any battle weather it is were you place your archers or what units you put in the front and the fact that every unit has a unique place in the army.my feeling aside prosthe mass attack is never a good ideayou never have to pay to win and the option isn't there for the guy with the bigger walletnothing is Opeverything is easy to find and figure outquests are never ending (some are repetative but so are the goodies)there are a lot of pros so etc etc etcnow for the consthe game glitchs a lot some times (it is a new game)you can loose all your armies in a single fight (not that bad)Resources can just fly away and ruin your day if you log off with lagunits can double some times (i know sounds great if that was you and not your enemys)i have been playing for a few days now and i have not been able to stop playing the people are friendly even when they are trying to take your castle. i cannot give a higher recommendation for an Rts i think it is not for everybody but i bet if you read this and others and get the right mind set you can have a great time. i look forward to seeing you in game o7			"

												Español: Tengo que admitir que no me esperaba mucho de este juego, que sería algo tan simple como construir y matar. Pero estaba equivocado ... llevo pocos días de juego y me está encantando. Simplificándolo mucho, podría decirse que es una mezcla de un juego de navegador, tipo Ikariam/ogame, y un total war, para las batallas. Es un juego donde tienes que esperar X tiempo para conseguir recursos, unidades, etc ... combinado con batallas en tiempo real a gran escala. Además de una buena diplomacia incluida, buen transfondo y multijugador. Entre otras cosas. Haciendo que la gestión de cada raza sean completamente diferentes entre sí, además del estilo de juego.Es un tipo de juego que jamás había visto y que no me esperaba que me gustase tanto. Es algo nuevo, una corriente de aire fresco. English:I have to admit I was not expecting much from this game, it would be something as simple as building and kill.

												Kingdom Wars is a real time strategy game with a twist. think stronghold kingdom meet age of empire. i really enjoy the game so far,, when you first start , it give you a 20 hours safe from pvp buff.  im up to 13 h into the game, got my army wipe a couple times,, it could use better tutorial  to prepare you for tough battle, but its not so hard to give up,, you feel proud when you succeed a siege of a stronghold, after adjusting your tactic because your full army got wipe the first time you tryed.   overall, its a very fun game, keeps you login you back after a few hours to spend your ressource , big plus is it doesnt look like its pay to win, altho i have to say, it can be a while to gather crown to spend on upgrade. maybe im doing something wrong.  so ya,, if you like this sort of game, where it takes days/ months to build your empire,, its a great try at least,, hey its f2p  you cant go wrong with that.  try it.  cant wait to see what the pvp looks like,, 7/10			"

												I bought the game about 2 years ago.  Back when they had the cash shop.  Although some poeple felt that it was pay to win, it was not in the least bit since I never spent a dime on it and still was able to pve and pvp without problems.  Still to this day now that it's F2P, you still don't have to pay for anything since your armies are always matched with people of similar armies.  It's a really good way of handeling a cash shop.  If you don't want to pay any money, you will have to learn how to play is all, which isn't a bad thing.It was a buggy game when I first got a hold of it, as most newish games, and that did deter me for about 4 months.  After a while they had a few patches that made it less laggy for me and that's when I started racking up the hours, Building more cities, destroying more foes, and gathering those crowns for more armies.  I grew up playing RTS games, Age of Empires was my first multiplayer game, and I played that for a couple of years along with Empire earth when it came out.  This has strong elements of your typical RTS, but it has so much more.  Long term cities, taking over NPC towns, exploring the map, questing, and co-op sieging just to name a few great things that seperate it from your standard RTS.I had so much fun that I invited a few friends to play with me and after teaching them how to play we were pillaging empires left and right.  When you play with friends, it usually makes a game that much more fun.  You invite friends, your friends invite friends, etc..  Soon you can start an alliance with people you know that you will get along with.  Although you can only 2v1 vs AI, and 1v1 in pvp, hopefully later in the games life they can expand that.   Good times were spent on sieging cities with a friend. I wasn't too interested in the MMO part of this game at first, I had played world of warcraft for about 2 years back in 2008, and grew out of it, but this game fits right in and youre not overpowerd by MMO nerds sitting on a ♥♥♥♥ bucket and trying to hit on a night elf.   I grew up playing age of empires, empire earth, and starcraft.  Although this game isnt on the same level, it's still tons of fun.  More of a long term RTS.Since I bought the game, fast forward to today, Reverie has had many great patches that improved the game immensely, and with the launch of their FtP model, it's better than ever.  New units, new buildings, better performance, vassels, and unit balencing (and that's just the tip of the iceberg)Also, I have a guide on my profile for new players to get some all arounds tips for the game.9/10  Unique, fun, cheap, and helpful devs/mods.  Would buy again.			"

Personnaly this is my favorite game and touches everything I like and want from a game and it does not require you to spend money to have a nice time, yes it might have a few bugs/glitches but, in the overall, after you`ve spent a little time and gave the effort while playing you`ll realise that it`s a truely amazing game.Not only is the game itself simply fantastic but, the Veteran players themselfs are awesome, while not only just providing help and guidance to new players but they also help out the developers on fixing and adding new content to the game. I strongly recommend you to try out this wonderful game.			"

												Stronghold meets AoE fused with Mount n Blade with dash of awesome. Dispite what the critics say this game has kept me engrosed and engaged.  It has a learning curve but once you get the hang of it you better hang on tight. PVP yes, it has that. Guilds, Yup! Solo play, they got that covered too. Base building for sure. Oh, you just want to sit back and quest. You got it!Graphically speeking its not the prettiest but it's loads better than any Stronhold game. It's RT based so plan your time wisely or you might just get hooked enough to make your friends think you moved and were enrolled in some witness protection program.Try it now!  "

												This game is OK, it could be a great game, but it has some flaws... actually it has three flaws.1st : You have a huge army and attack a enemy, but you can not launch a huge assault, because you can only control a limited amount of units, but this is a minor flaw.2nd : This is a big one and really annoys me. Some times the game just freezes... just like that, mostly it starts running again after a minute, but some times you have to close it via task manager and when you restart it then, your progress of over half a hour of gameplay is lost... and that happened to me two times.3rd : This one is a even bigger one and seriously ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. The trebuchets are broken.I was doing the quest ""Dangerous Neighbours"" and attacked the second of the three strongholds.It had 2 stonewalls, towers, mounted trebuchets a.s.o. I had a full army of swordsmen, maceman, and archers, with 10 trebuchets and 1000 stones. I ordered my trebuchets to throw the stones on one wall segment of the outer wall and set them on ""hold fire"" so they kept shooting and shooting. I know that catapults are no accurate weapon, but with the trebuchets in this game you can be happy if they hit anything. After several minutes some buildings were damaged, but those were mostly buildings inside the walls and a few soldiers were killed, but nothing happened to the wall segment which i told my trebuchets to attack.Many frustrating minutes later there were no stones left to throw at the enemy. In the end my trebuchets destroyed two towers and dozens of houses, but the targetet wall segment still had about 50% of its HPs left so i had to cancel the attack, because there was no way i could get into the Stronghold anymore.BUT I still recommend this game because those things can be fixed by patches and because this game is free to play.

												Funny Total War like game with RPG elements and Browser games elements.It's no more P2W but it has marginal Pay2Progress elements.Devs keep upgrading the game nearly every week and try to improve the game further and further.One Problem that this game has is that creating formations with your units is a bit messy because the unitcontrol system is not a powerful tool.It is very hard to march forward in a specific formation or place your units in the right order on the battlefield. And the ""Hold the Ground"" order is really buggy and not working perfect.That is something that should be improved.A other Problem is that single units can be too strong. Something that defentily should be fixed. The last problem is, is that the AI is extremly passive. You can lure enemy AI units one by one out and kill them.It is possible to conquer a whole fortress with very few units.But this game is still great and has alot potential.There is no other game like this out there.

												Stunning variety amongst the three races with their unique Units and Research. Your given so much Freedom to acheive what you want with this game. Rather beautifull lands and buildings   ( unless your orc, lol ). Combat in Quest battles is of the type where if you don't think on the run, you'll lose your troops en-mass, a terrific challange alone, without the PVP added. It's not that combat is alligned against you but the choice pre-battle of your units is critical. Fortunitly you are given a very wide range of units, if you choose to research them from amongst each race and choice of mercenary forces also wide are available to be hired from cities. Very good help within game and support.			"

												I have been playing this game for the last few weeks.  I was so excited about this game in my first day, that I draged 5 of my friends to play this game.  With any game you find what you like and don't like.  What sets this game off for me is, its what I expect an MMORTS to be!  When friends of mine ask me, whats the game like or how to compare it.  I tell them that this is a unique game, then I tell them I can help them learn.  I personly found the game easy to learn and so did my friends.  The game is complex to get you very excited, but not difficult by any means.  The game runs smooth on the graphics and is very appealing to the eyes.  Yet of course my favorite thing of all about this game however is the building of my own castle and how I want to build my army, hoping for more styles of castle and land layouts down the road!  So would I recommend this game to anyone, yes deffenitely!  Even if you don't care for  the multiplayer aspect or your not a true rts fan, give this game a whirl, I bet you'll find something you highly enjoy about Kingdom Wars.			"

												This game is a very unike and good game.im going to be listing the good factore about these games and the rating of each sectionCombat- 7/10 the combat in this game is very good, but is still sort of buggy. sometimes during the combat you dont even see the soliders swinging their swords or anything, but the descriptions of each troop stating their weaknesses and stregths actually take place in the conbat. overall i think the combat has a lot of potential, but lacks a bit. it is definitly the only weakness of this game graphics-7/10 as we know this game was released in 2013 but the graphics arent bad for a free game. im not too sure how this game company profits off this amazing game becuase you can really see that a lot of time and money went into this game, but it is still free. the graphics in this game are bummy in some areas, but are pretty good overallStrategy-9/10 this game requires a lot of brains and time to be successful. it is a very slow game to progress through (i got 10 hours and i still dont have walls) but it makes it very realistic, this isnt like a game where everything happens and its very quick. however when you do spend money it speeds up this process, which is obviously intended so the company can make profit,Multiplayer-10/10 this game has an amazing multiplayer layout. you can send your friends resorces, do campaign with them, and fight with them. To me the multiplayer is pretty straight foreward, and i wouldnt change a thing about it.Difficult- 9/10 Im going to admit, this game is VERY difficult. your troops die pretty easily and its not easy to get precious resorces like wood stone gold or food. by building a wide variety of building, it eats up all of them. this is where the money spenders come in and get a free run to successionoverall i would STRONGLY recommed this game due to the fact that it is free and is AMAZING, and i would pay for this game any day. this game is a mix of banished,mount and blade, and stronghold crusader. if i were you i would get my hands on this before the developers put a price on this. i hope this helped you make you decision:)			"

												This game is excellent for all of those people who are dying for a patient, Non-Pay2win game. Kingdom Wars is like the Total War Series + the Age of Empires Series. What I love about this game is that there are 3 Factions that are playable, the Humans, the Orcs, and the Elves, each with its own unique strengths. There is also a conquerable map that has little settlements that have their very own, very detailed lore. This game is also not a frustrating Pay2win game, although, there is a special currency called influence that you may buy with real money, and the currency is needed to grow your Empire, it is not that hard to get though. There are many ways to get this special currency, one way is to log in everyday and debate whether to claim Influence or the Random item, another way to get Influence would be to battle with other players. The Community so far seems very nice and so far I've not met many people who want to make you have a bad time while playing. The game offers very fun challenges that really are challenging! So far, I am having a blast playing, I've been very addicted to this game and ever want to pull my eyes off the screen, I'd highly reccomend this game to your friends!			"

												So far this game is awesome. It is everything I have ever dreamed of for a strategy game. It is a little difficult especially when it comes to resources and conquest becuase it take a very long time and much effort to build your economy, your city, and your army to stand out in the world.

												First off, I do recommend this game. Other titles of this genre tend to be slow moving and often play at a stand still pace.  Kingdom Wars has much more to do and livens up the game play and that is a nice chance of what you get used to playing these types.   Lots of options for varied town and playing styles. My only critique is that for mission completion there is no help guide.  Certain functions are no explained, so just use the chat to ask another player, so far the community has been pretty helpful.			"

You can go get mercanaries to join your army, you can be Elves, Orcs, or HumansEach race comes with its own enviremont. The Siege combat on another players land, is truly immersing and has such an epic feel when your troops are marching up the hill and his troops are raining arrows down upon, your sending fireballs in there base it's just so epic. So I sayGET IT 10/10+The Storyline is good too!			"

												So heres a quick and honest brake down of the game. This game offers a ton of replay value, rick lore, cool faction units and epic pve and pvp battles rangeing from seiges or open feild. The world feels active and alive and as a pvper on a good day i can fund my cites easy from pvp loot. And a huge more, but this game has a ton of game breaking bugs the devs have promised to patch since I played in beta. A huge lack of a support team the updates have stoped to a hault no cummuncation to the players. Pvp system is buggey most of the time ui is very out dated the match making for the game is lacking big time as a pvper my self I haft to spam click the auto search sometimes it feels 100 times before I even get any thing and then that person just pays out. Most days I cant find any thing and the fact that there is no auto search function that I can pop and go do somthing else it bothers me alot having this account and 2 others I've pvped on. I should ot haft to click over and over again. But putting that aside if you are lookinf for a ftp mmo rts that you can pass the time with and not haft to pay to get any thing back this is one of them. Tbh this is the first mmo rts I've played on steam that was not 100 % pay to win. I think kingdomwars would be defined as pay for time you can get crowns very easy in the game. The only benifte i see it giving is faster build times. So that said I've played this game through 5 so called mistake server wipess and I can say I never regreted playing. But with a bunch of new rts mmos going into alpha next mnoths peeps I would say leave this on the back burnner for a bit. It might explode on its self ride safe and long live the orcs!			"

												Kingdom Wars is an amazing game, putting good combat with a good economy, as well as building your own base, almost EXACTLY the way the want it, Archeage and Stronghold Kingdoms had a baby. The graphics of this game are amazing (Although my computer can't run it) for anyone who can run them. I totally recommend ths game to almost anyone except people ages 60+ (Sorry Grandma.) The game mechanics take some getting used to, and the music is alright, not terrific, however. You can siege castles with siege equipment, choose your race, where you live, (Desert, Forest etc.) and overall what you do in that world. You may set up camps in a random area on this game's amazing map, and kill the people/beasts living there for food and gold. The camps you set up have different prices, if you want to make your camp hard to destroy, sent a bunch of supplies with that party, and make a big azz camp, if you are there for supplies, spend less. The quests in the game are, however, sometimes glitchy and unexciting. But, you know, whatevs when you could be slaughtering thousands of humans with your ogres (Go orcs!) Anyway this game is amazing, I KNOW GRANDMA GO PLAY SOME COD, and I totally recommend it to anybody lookin for a time spender. :D			"

												Overall this game is pretty enjoyable imo. There are some things I feel could be better - notably the lack of customization with regards to walling in your settlements - but it's a solid RTS I feel, with solid combat and enjoyable-enough game mechanics that it's worth your time. Definitely a good F2P game. Solid 6.5/10 in its current state and the devs are working on major overhauling improvements, so I can only hope to see that score increase over the next few months.			"

												The f2p model is fair - you get enough to get started and there are no paywalls. There are starter-packs that give a minor boost, but you can't call that pay-to-win at all: the matchmaking is very restrictive.The AI has bugs that can be cumbersome, but the devs/mods work fast and resolve problems reliably. The UI is borderline terrible and the build options could really use hotkeys. As you get dragons, that can be disabled by the enemy but not permanently killed, the good outweighs the bad and I can recommend the game.			"

												This is NOT a pay to win game.  Yes, you can buy crowns, but I make so much gold that if I had the storage for it I would not need to spend mony on crowns.  Most of the micro purchases are cosmetic and give access to units that you can get in game anyway.I have been playing this game for about 3 months now and I like it alot.  If you liked the total war series you should like this one.  It reminds me a lot of that series of games with the added benefit of Orcs and Elves.  That being said there are a few things I don't like about it, takes for ever to walk to the battles in my opinion.  I know there are technologies you can unlock to march faster, but they are quite expensive as far as crowns go and the one that I have didn't really increase it much.  THe trading system in the cities seems a bit odd, like I lose money everytime, but then I am not too powerful as of yet and don't do a lot of trading so maybe I am wrong.Anyway, I really like the game and contine to play it and will continue to.

												Update: 11/11/2014: The game has gone through a major change  including unit stat rebalance. I will play again and  amend the review accordingly.This is my first review and its very basic please bear this in mind.I have been following this game for a long time... Including the beta period and prior to steam release. The game has a very intresting storyline and RTS mechanics, however it lacks in social connectivity and player engagement with one another.After you have reached a certain stage of the game, there is no endgame content to try and you feel like there is nothing further challange. The difficuclty and balance is scewed for some units and PVP/Co-OP is completely broken as there is no logical reason why two armies of the same size cannot co-op.It seems to be a dice roll issue or some back end server configuration issue.However if they can fix the PVP and CO-OP issues and add some meaningful endgame conten such as Guild versus Guild and more player interaction with one another. this game could get  alot of its community back.At the moment the most number of users online at one time is in 10s. Hopefully when the above issues are resolved the community will grow and bring back some flare to the end game content.			"

												This game has so much potential. As I continue to play and get used to the controls (which currently need significant work) I am enjoying it more.There is much the game can do to improve, currently, the controls are my biggest complaint.  The units often time seems to be confused, and most recently the game suffered a pretty horrible bug during an update.   I know this company is not a huge company, so I can forgive them.I have been waiting for a game like this for SOOOOOO long, and I am glad someone has finally made it.  It the future, I would like to see more races, better controls, and better unit AI.  3 stars out of 5-edit-The recent bug that caused deletion of my city was fixed at a speed I do not expect from most companies.  Also they had fantastic customer service and resloved the problem way above satisfaction.			"

												 I would give this game a far more favorable revew, however when my town was struck with a bug that deleted ALL of my buildings, units, aswell as resources i was distraught to say the least, The game in itself is pretty good and worth spending a bit of time on. It has solid mechanics and works just as good as any other RTS, but that part is not the best one. It is the mix of both RPG and RTS that changes my perception on the game. It is the type of game that i have always wanted to play, it is a very rough diamond however. It suffers from atleast a few gamebreaking bugs, bad pathing and questionable AI. The customization options are severely lacking unless you cough up some real money for it, which to me might have been fine, if not for the fact that you cannot customize anything in the game without real money. I would write more, but this will have to suffice until the Devs give me my kingdom back. I will give people a very sceptical recommendation.			"

												I've very much enjoyed this game.  I chose to go Elves, and much like another review I read some time ago they have a very Protoss-esque feel to them.  Their units are individually stronger than all the others, however they train slower and cost more.  Their buildings also give great benefits, yet generally seem to be on the fairly costly side.Yet the cost usually isn't an issue as their economy is entirely trickle based, well actually it's mostly trickle based, the single glaring and strange exception to this is stone.  The lack of any way other than through alchemy or manual mining to get stone is honestly a pretty big issue, especially since I've been getting a resource boost already and was only making about 4 stone per minute if I didn't use alchemy - contrast that to the ten food per minute and the 25+ wood per minute.The balance of resource gathering, at least for Elves, is off.  You have a resource cap, however most of your resources are going to be wood considering it takes zero effort to get lumber as an Elf.  As a matter of fact you start off the game getting 10+ wood per minute, compared to the paltry sums of about 1 to 3 per minute of everything else.Despite that issue the game was absolutely still worth trying and playing and, for those looking for a slower-paced gameplay or an RTS that didn't take up all your time, the Elves would have been right up your alley.The main benefit of the Elves, I feel, is the ability to log off of the game and come back some hours later to build your buildings and military up.  As resources continue to trickle in whether or not you're logged on it feels like a game that doesn't force you to pay attention to it every waking second of every day in order to progress, which, honestly, was a breath of fresh air.Furthermore it's really nice not to have to worry about being attacked while logged off, unlike some games.  While it's a little clunky and has a few issues every once in a while the dev team is very active and clearly working hard to bring the best experience they can.  In such I really do suggest trying this game out if you're in the market for a fantasy RTSMMO.			"

												This is one of the best RTS games that I have ever played.There are major differences in playstyle between each race, and each race has three different areas that will have a large impact on what your playstyle will be like. which makes the game have an incredible good replay value. The combat is very solid and fulfilling, sieges are amazingly fun, and when your village grows it is definately noticeable.Also you can spam and repress peasants  10/10			"

												This game is amazing. You run an entire kingom that you build from the ground up. While there are still bugs that you will encounter, i give this game 5/5 stars for what it is.  If you want to tactically command an army, just as a king would lead his men in to battle back in the mideval ages, this game is for you. It's a game that doesn't go too easy on you either. There is always a new challenge due to the PVP system. The trading system in this game works just as you would think too. Send trade carts, and send troops to protect them from other hostiles, risk your resources, and be rewarded for being smart.			"

												This Game is one of a kind. You get to build your own medieval town or city whilst doing quests either in pvp, co op, or solo. You get to play as humans, orks or elf's, each have there own unique way of building cities and armies. You can recruit armies of darwfs and summon dragons to you aid.If your into big fights on a large scale with pvp or pve with 1000+ armies on each side battling for gold, crowns,  power and land, this is the game for you. Its a fun medieval game just waiting to be conquered.  It's not all about the war though, you have to use your mind and skill to build your empire. You need to upgrade the armor on your troops for better defense in battle. You can also upgrade your sheep or cows for more milk and wool to trade for any resources you may need.  You can upgrade the tools the workers use and the clothes that they wear so they work faster and it improves the quality of materials they produce.With every great army theres a great leader chose your hero, build your empire and destroy your rivals.

												Finnaly, a game that is good and not pay to win. It's about time. The game is amazing and easy to start of. The game gives you daily rewards each day which makes it easy to get more stuff if your stuck. I haven't played for very long but it is very fun. One suggestion though, can you make it so that bandits spawn in your village more frequently. it is very slow for me to get stuff and i like being able to send out the worker people and get gold from it. So this is why i advise this game for people who do not like p2w and, also like Rts games.

												So at first i didn't know what to think about this game. And i have to say i was suprised of how fun and addicting the game was.  The beginning was a little slow but whe you are starting to get quests and your building massive armies it's awesome. For example i had an army of 60/60 all swordsmen, archers, catapults, and battering rams. I was super confident with this army lest to say because they had seen some fights all of the swordsmen were like lvl 10. But i got a little to confident and tried to seige a orc city and man i had no chance. I like the fact that i cant just jump in and seige the hardest city and expect to win. Right now im doing my best to improve my population and expand my power. It is definently a game with plenty of replay value because you can play as three different factions the Humans, Orcs, and Elfs. Right now having a blast with this game look foward to playing everday and completing more quests and becoming the strongest. Totally recommend this game for all strategy game fans! "

												The game Kingdom war is a some what a slow pace game. The game is a very easy RTS game and it is fun when you play with your friends. Trying to get troops some what easy. I do the like idea for having battle protection to kept the other online players from attacking you. Also that having other races like man, orc, and elves is great because it reminds me that the game is almost like Lord of Rings. The resoures in the game are great because its like what the medieval time will have. In conclusion the game is a easy RTS game and has 3 cool races and it is a really fun game to play.			"

												Interesting game... I will explain.First off I highly recommend you do the tutorial and actually take the time to read the texts. There is never to much written but there is no voice acting. But the tutorial gives you a lot of needed knowledge to get the hang of the game. Also you might want to start as humans first, the other races, elfs and orcs. have confusing build structures.Now when it comes to explaining this game I would have to say, it is stronghold kingdoms map combined with a sort of Total war style combat / with age of empires sort of peasantry. Read bellow this for a further explanation.Stronghold Kingdoms - When in the main world map you will see separate borders. Your settlement will be one of several in a sort of county, with several other faction areas in a province type area. A border separates these which makes it easy to know whose who.Total War - When it comes to units in this game, you do have large formations of units instead of single soldier running about. When you construct a unit 20 come out inside of one. So when you enter war or move your units to investigate a camp, you will have the different archers in their group, soldiers, knights, so on.Age of Empires - When it comes to building structures in this game it feels like Age of Empires. Granted you wont find yourself having the peasants build the buildings, but instead you select an available spot on the ground to construct a building. Now the peasants are used to gather materials around the town area, Gold, Wood, Stone, and food are all the average resources you need to have them gathering.--------------------------------------------------------------------Things to know when you start!- You have a 24 hr peace period, meaning other players cannot attack you until after 24 hours.- Your selection of traits and plains where you build will decide a lot of stuff. Such as if wood is plentiful (plains area) , if stone is easily accessible (In mountains) , Also lastly is wooded areas (In Forests).- Doing the quests at the beginning will advance your story line, get you free resources, and decent experience towards the game as well. They are easy and actually very fun to complete.- This is a Stronghold Kingdoms style rts. Which means buildings will start building slower and slower the more you construct. If you don't want to put much time in a breathing game you may want to steer clear.- I have done little castle work, besides in the tutorial. My reflection on it though is like a Total War style castle. You build the wall then garrison the unit squads along the walls. You also build single siege weapons to attack the walls, making it easier to maneuver or attack different sections of the walls.- I did not access the market as of yet, though I clicked on it once to view it. It did seem a bit pay to win, as you purchase crowns like on stronghold kingdoms. Then you use the crowns to get resources , fast building , though it does not seem to allow unit purchase. You can purchase dragons though... not sure how OP they are.--------------------------------------------------------------------My Impressions- Early stages of the game I am enjoying. It feels like Age of Empires as my units charge around to wreck the wicked soldiers and goblins about. Making gold and other resources depends completely on how many peasants you send to that specific resource.- The late game makes me nervous, I really cannot tell if the game has the system like Stronghold Kingdoms that sort of punishes higher lvl players for attacking lower , newer players. But I guess that will be something we see in a few days if I just get rolled by some troll.- So far I do like this game, its worth continuing to play and I hope to see the population on the game grow.

												This is a really entertainment game i literally spend the whole weekend playing it. i one of the ones who bought it before it went free to play and the truth is that i quit it for a while due the lack of content and lag on the co-ops and pvp. then last week i decide to come back and see what was new and i find my self spending 12+ hours playing it :/ .the new contents are amazing, game play still need some work,  specially the co-ops. i have seen my self helping PPL on a sage and then from no where i see they stop attacking or that im the only one doing it,  and when i ask them in the battle chat they say that they are actually already inside or waiting on me. so i guess that's a bug on the co-op that they need to work on. co-op should be helping each other trough strats to get the difficult objectives,  like those long sages.the other thing is that they should consider the fact that not everyone is willing to PvP all the time, maybe its a way for them to force ppl buy shields to have some peace while playing,  but overall its really annoying and i consider that there should be better ways like other F2P game does to get cash like skins, and customization for your armies and stuff instead of forcing ppl buying shields, that will push some players away.another thing that maybe they should work on is the AI of the armies when on battle some time i just don't know wth they doing out there lol. i need to cancel and re assign objectives all the time before they get killed.ill still give this game a 4/5 maybe when they work a little bit more on it ill give them 5 :)			"

												Kingdom Wars was just another free game that i would browse past when i was searching for a new game to play, but when i saw that it had recently come out on steam i decided to take a look. As i saw the trailer for the game it had only peaked my interest more, so i downloaded the game.(best decision ever~) Once the game had finished, i booted it up with no problem and was brought to one of many dream games that i had been searching for! It had conquest in a way that other strategy games could only hope for, but the games that could achieve that level were no where near as Kingdom Wars. This game was well thought out and the graphics are perfect for this kind of game(due to huge ♥♥♥ armies and monsters filling your screen) runs pretty damn well on a laptop. all in all, im hooked, im in love, and i got to stick a sword in another lord's face.  Reverie World Studios i salute. (now if you excuse me there are couple of traitors that need to be decapitated and armies to repel, come Fred, we must hasten back to Black Rock.			"

												Kingdom Wars is a massive mltiplayer Real Time Strategy game without the concept of pay to play, and in my opinion, it's a really neat game.First, the visuals are very nice and quite smooth and give more flavour to the medieval atmosphere of the game.Second, the game is very user-friendly: When you first choose the race and location and all of the details of the city you want to manage, the game makes sure to explain every single option and give the benefits of each side chosen. Also, the game makes sure to help the player as much as it can by having an option to contact directly to the creator, and giving a well-planned tutorial line of quests and a 24 hour protection (that counts ONLY when you're online) which I personally love.Third, It's just fun! You can customize the looks of your town, build a powerful army and siege all of your opponents' citis, striking fear into their eyes! Also, the NPCs are very entertaining and the game in general gives you a great expirience while playing.My final point: The game is great, and it's free so if you have the time and will you should DEFINATLY give it a shot. You won't regreat it. (and if you will, don't worry. The community is very helpful and the developers are open for suggestions at any time, so you can help them to make the game better! :D)			"

												This game is amazing. You run an entire kingom that you build from the ground up. While there are still bugs that you will encounter, i give this game 5/5 stars for what it is.  If you want to tactically command an army, just as a king would lead his men in to battle back in the mideval ages, this game is for you. It's a game that doesn't go too easy on you either. There is always a new challenge due to the PVP system. The trading system in this game works just as you would think too. Send trade carts, and send troops to protect them from other hostiles, risk your resources, and be rewarded for being smart.			"

												This game is great, in my opinion. There are pros and cons to it though, so I will list them below.THE PROS:A. NOT pay to winB. Each in-game race (Orcs, Humans, or Elves,) offers a different playstyleC. The Developers of the game seem to have put a decent amount of effort into this game, even though it is free to playD. IT IS FREE! seriously, this is important - even really poorly done games (This one isn't poorly done though) are nice if they are free - all you need is hard drive space to play - Why not at least try it if it is free?E. It offers many hours of play time.F. Updates to the game are released periodically, and they are also completely free.G. Doesn't require a super powerful PC to playOK, there are cons too thoughTHE CONSA. Not enough people play this game - I have only ever seen 200 people online at one time - not exactly MMORTS (Massive, Massive Online Real Time Strategy) more like just ORTSB. It has some bugs - they aren't game-breaking, but they are there.C. It is very difficult to actually gather enough army strength to sucessfully lay siege to an AI town - you need expensive and exotic units like dragons, Minotaurs, etc,  to do it reliably.D. Most of the playerbase seems to be either Old, experienced veteran players, who have all of the best units, all the upgrades, and essentially unlimited resources. They are all but unbeatable unless they fight themselves. Most of the rest of the players are new to the game, and don't know the most basic things about playing yet. In essence, there are very few players who fall in between these two extremes.E. If you choose to play elves, it is more difficult than Orcs and Humans to gather resources.All in all, though, this is a great game, even more so because of the fact that is it free. I would recommend it to anyone that likes Real Time Strategy games.			"

												I was reluctant to play the game because of the bad reviews, but I had to try it myself, when I first started I admit I was confused. Although when I got into the game, I thought it was a really really great game! Its a mix of building your castle in Stronghold to fighting battles as you see in Total war! The PVP is also fun, I have lost most of my battles, but I always love to compete against other people. There are some glitches, but they aren't terrible people who have made reviews on the game that are negative haven't had a chance to explore much of the game! I recommend 9/10!			"

You can buy crowns or like currency that gives you the elite itemsLet me state this game keeps on improving. They are coming out with a add-on in 2015. With this awesome game there is a second one called kingdom wars 2 and they are both improving both of these games all the time. They care for what you say when your on fourms theres no hackers, which means its more fun to most of us.I will reccomend this game because its great to me and hopefully the 3 expansions will make the game better than it is. Also i was looking at the comments i heard that there is lag, but theres not unless you have a bad connection, bad internet, or your computer needs some upgrades.The only bad part about the game is the crown system, i have heard rumers that there going to remove them for units but not the buildings them selfs. Because if they took it away people would have a army of max ranked dragons, minotaurs, hydras, and dwarf tools, which all makes you (over powered)=>OP <=(over powered) like 3,000 army power, which is way to OP. This is the reason the game is getting more populated over the years.I hope this review was helpful to you			"

												It is a great game that need to be a little bit polished, I all ways liked and wanted a medieval game like those you play on internet but no one catch me like this one, since I started to play I didn't stop hahhah. There is the traditional bugs and issues of all new games on the market but doesn't is enough to make you stop playing this one, the battles requires a lot of attention and tactics and is even better when you are in battle listening The Lord of the Rings soundtrack, the only thing that makes me angry is the lag but is not the servers errors, is my fault hahaha I don't have a good connection, but how i said isnt enough to make me stop.I would like so much if it have the run button like you chose a unit and press ""R"" instead you have to click twice to make units run and the forbidden trees because I hate to see those fallen trees near my town XDOk thats my opinion about this game, I hope you all enjoy like I enjoyed this game o/btw I'm Brazilian and not a huehue br ok?(my nick in game is JesusAndrey)			"

												I would like to start off by saying that I am a big RTS\RPG fan.  I am also a big fan of MMO games.  I have played this game with an open mind, as I suggest anyone else who tries this game, do without having any pre-conceived ideas or expectations.  The game mechanics are very user-friendly and easy to become accostumed to.  I have read many comments regarding the graphics.  Being an older gamer (over 40) I found myself getting a little nostalgic, which I really liked.  The game is excellent.  The concept is great.  The experience is one of the best I have had.  The most appealing aspect of this game, in my opinion, is that it is Free-To-Play.  Keep in mind that it is a RTS game and it will take time to do all the great stuff there is to do in this game.  So without further ado, good luck building your Kingdom and forging your Empire!			"

 Everything I want, Nothing I don't  Kingdom Wars is a melting pot of different styles of games and game elements/mechanics. I personally view it as a Stronghold Crusaders + a dash of Total War + World of Warcraft (the RTS, not the MMO) + A strong influence of the game elements/mechanics of those web browser based games where you build a base and army and attack other people, get attacked etc. etc. I'm sure someone will correct me on the abreviation for that kind of game but I cant remember right now. Now here are some  VERY IMPORTANT  distinctions from the rest of those games that I and many people have been asking and looking for but have never found with other games similar to this one. The developers built into the game features that actually prevent a P2W environment!  For example there is absolutely no 'Low Energy! Come back tomorrow... OR pay us $5-$10-$20-$50(best BS deal!) to keep playing!' because  there is no energy.  You cannot be attacked or attack players of higher or lower level (premium units? stronger opponents!) and  you cannot be attacked while offline!   Finally, thank you!  Waiting for resources to gather and/or something to finish building and feel like there's nothing more to do in town? Make an army and go fight NPC/AI on the world map for gold and then use your spoils of war to buy those resources or even new units! Oh did i mention this is a great way to level up your units at the same time? Or just log off and go live your life and come back to find the resources collected while you were offline! Yes there is 'premium' currency  but  it is  reasonably and realisticly  obtainable in-game for your time + effort for free! Quest's and NPC/AI battle's being the best way I've found persoanlly. An actually entertaining story line. A suprisingly indepth and well made system for selecting your race, skills, and city location(s).  Single player  modes including campaign, seige, and seige defence.  You do have to pay $2 to unlock each of these modes however.  Personally this is not an issue for me as I don't plan on using single player mode, however it could be very useful to try out different seige strategies and really $2-$6 for this game is a ridiculously good deal considering some of the alpha games on here that cost $15 in the  hope  that they turn out good. Predetermined building locations make your city(s) astheticly pleasing, strategically challenging and easy to build! None of that layers and layers of wall's shinanigans like every one of those crappy web-based Base Building RTSMMO's Wow those first five elements are  exactly what people have been asking for in games similar to this for years.  That is a  huge  reason I like this game. Now I can feel satisfied that I finally found a good game out there where the developers/owner(s)/publisher actually give a **** about what me, the player, wants in a game rather than how much money is on the paycheck. From the bottom of my heart,  thank you  and I hope you cotinue building the game like this while keeping the same ideals! You know what's even better? If you actually do spend money on the game, lets say you buy a dragon for your army,  they protect your investment.  While your normal units disappear forever when they die, your premium units, like the dragon you bought, only get knocked out and lose a few levels. Oh and you can't make an army of just dragons because that would be P2W plus they can still be countered and defeated by a prepared player, there's a dragon slayer i got for  free  after all. Right off the bat they are giving me a unit that counters one of the stronger units in the game! To make it even more balanced there's a unit cap, each unit takes up a certain amount of space, so you have to choose what you bring to battle wisely, a small but individually strong group of heavy hitters? Perhaps a massive amount of inexpensive foot soldiers with archers? It's all about the strategy, not who had the larger wallet. Also you wanna know something awesome the premium days you can buy in this game? You choose which days you want to use them for. How many games can you think of that actually do that for their players? Personally i don't know a single one, because money. Now for the other side of the coin, this game has flaws as all games natuarlly do. Animations are decent, but not great. Yes things still take time to build but it's not ridiculous amounts (i.e. 5-7 days). You have to pay for extra cities (gotta make money somehow so this is perfectly reasonable and fine with me). The controls can't be customized and are a bit clunky, biggest issue for me personally is the right mouse button. It controls your units  but  it also moves the camera if you have a single unit selected, very annoying esspecially when your trying to moe just your hero. plus there's is a very noticeable delay between the click and the effect (at least for me on my laptop). Then sometimes nothing happens at all. Trying to organize and manage your units is awkward and needs to be streamed lined. Especially when you have to do it quickly (Very Frustrating). Not to mention you have to indiviually select units to activate their abilites/magic/skills/powers which is very hard when they are in combat. Theres also some minor graphical errors, especially when the weather changes and in a couple of cut scene's where the character(s) slowly turns invisible and OHMYGODTHEIREYESANDMOUTH! Personally I find that last type of glitch hilarious as it's actually pretty common in a lot of games. Upgrades and improvements of any and all kind require 'premium' currency, walls for example require an especially large ammount and you have 4 different one's to build, but like i said about premium currency, it is obtainable in-game for a reasonable amout of time and effort so a somewhat moot point. Still I love this game and plan on continuing to play it for quite some time at a casual level, kill some time here and there, build this and that, do a quest here and there. This is a game that easily works with how you play games, hard-core, casual, it dosen't matter because it caters to any type of play style. I have only been playing for 9.3 hrs at the time of this writing but i can already feel that within 30-45 days, I will have an impressive city and army to boot and will be knocking down a few peoples walls! I absolutely, highly recommend this game for people looking for a RTSMMO with RPG elements that lets you play at your own pace, your own schedule, your own style, your own budget and actually rewards you if you dont want to play all-day-everyday and throw money at it. Even if you do throw money at it it still goes  far beyond  what any other game I have played or known will do for you for your investment. See you on the battle field and if you attack me, you shall feel the power and dismay of my elven arrows and Magical superiority!This review helpful in anyway?

												Now color me surprised when i find out there is a FTP MMO RTS that does not take after facebooks track history of special in-game currency that only money provides, color me when more suprised when it turns out to be a game remarkably simular to my childhood favorite Age of Empires.Kingdom Wars is a MMO base builder Real time stratagy game that takes after Age of empires. It takes you into a wonderfully colorfull and well groomed fantasy land that is gorgouse to look at the more you adventure. Aside from Peasents and their endless offers of potato's you'll find a colorfull collection of unit types and specials that all races can use.Thats right. you can be a human race, and have elven archers with orc brutes as your spearhead force. Whats more cool then that?Oh right DRAGONS!!! You Can Have Dragons at your beck and call!!Kingdom Wars brings to life THE entire fantasy adventure, dwarfs, elves, giant treeents, rampaging warg packs, ogres minotaurs and more await you in this well packed game. And its all Free to play. Additionally you can enjoy the entire game without having to spend money into it. Not that the fancy customization options wont tempt you.As this is still a growing game, there are to be expected issues here and there, but with a lively staff, and friendly active in-game moderators anything that does happen can be worked out and solved so you can return to rasing your kingdom and adventuring across the world.

												This is an online game with the opportunity to build a castle with several armies and destroying your enemies or being destroyed.Resources in game are food, wood, stone, gold and crowns. Crowns you only get with quests or sieging AI cities or other players cities. Crowns are needed for wizards, dragons and also for building your castle and buildings. You also need crowns to upgrade buildings.You can do quests on strongholds co-op and you can do siege on a AI city in co-op. You can also attack a player in the field and find out who is better. Loosing is cruel as winner can choose units from your left over army.Building your own castle is great. Size of the castles in this game is the way it should be. This is your home and you want to protect it at all cost. Building all kinds of buildings in castle or outside it like archery and upgrading it is like your normal  command and conquer style as your armies get stronger with levelling up. Next to that you can build extra armies with wizards, dragons, humans, elves or orcs. You can choose a few types of wizards and dragons to make a good mix with elves, humans and orcs. This with limitations to dragons and wizards to an army. Sieging an other player is a tactical mind game you want to win. Defending your castle against another player is not for the faint-hearted. Next to that you have several computer AI cities on the world map. These are rated from easy to epic. The AI is not easy to beat you need all your skills and a well balanced army to defeat it. One of the things I found a bit stopping the fun is that you need to buy an alliance for 500 crowns. This to create an alliance. It should be free as it would help new players to help each other quicker now you have to hope you get let in when alliance recruiters are online if not no chance.Another thing I think is wasting to much time is the skill points. This should be automatic but maybe reason is that manual doing it gives more variety. Anyway it is a time consuming thing when you are in the middle of a battle when units level up. If something goes wrong with an army or something else you can send them an email or contact moderators in the chat channel and they will give you your lost army or other things back. This also helps them to work further on these bugs. Yes there are still some there. More information will make it easier for them to solve it.			"

												Having grown up with the Stronghold series, this is a must try for anyone following in similar footsteps.There are several features that I love from Kingdom Wars that gives it that little boost:Firstly Resources are gathered when you are both on and offline which help greatly, especially when you are trying to raise funds to buy crowns.Decent F2P Model. While there are always the Cape-Crusaders who will nitpick at every F2P and say how P2W it is, even though they aren’t, KWs is a Play to Win as opposed to Pay to Win. While there are of course boosts and the ‘premium’ currency, all of this is earned in game and is rather pay for convenience.And one of the best things I have seen on here is the fantastic moderator team they have in game. There never seems to be a question too trivial for them and they are willing to go to the ends of the earth to help you or give you direct link with someone who can.			"

												Kingdom Wars is a great game if you like city building and rts games. I have spent over 100 hours playing and love it.  The game does have bugs and crashes once in a while though.  You can use ingame money to buy pvp protection if you do not like pvp.  You may notice that the game has a cash shop and think that the things the packages gives are overpowered like 100k gold and 5 minotaurs and so on.  That amount of gold is easy to get after a day of playing and minotaurs are only good if you know how to use them.  The game is not pay to win in any way since the amount of bundles you can purchase is limited and everything you get from the bundles can be killed or looted.  I have personally destroyed people with bundle troops with some of the weakest troops in the game because they did not know how to use them.Overall a great game that I recommend.			"

												Not a free to play - This is not a free to play game, and it is easy to see that it is not. Most games that are MMO city builders like this rely heavily on users buying boosters. This games does not. First of all, there are only three boosters in the game, and you can not use more than 1 of them per in-game account/city. The boosters that are there give you resources that are helpful to a beginner, but if you build your city up a bit, they can easily be aquired.PvP - When I first started, I was afraid of going into the PvP part of the game. I was afraid that people who have already made giant cities and huge armies could walk in and take all of my things; this is definitely not the case. They have balanced the game enough so that you can only fight people within 10% of your army strength. 10% is so little, that it makes you rely only on good tactics. It makes EVERY siege/co-op/defence really fun and actually a really good match. Also, most of the online playing is co-op, which is honestly one of the most fun parts of the game. You can raid AI cities or do quests with your friends, and it makes the gameplay really fun, without getting completely screwed over. Also, if you REALLY do not like PvP, you can buy the single player campaign for only $1.99, which is honestly a good deal for how fun this game is.Building your city - It is hard to build your city at the start, since resources are scarce. This is the point where the co-op takes place and is a big help. You can do quests with your friends and fight armies, and take all of the resources off of their cold dead bodies. This part beats every other city builder into dust. You can actually command your armies, instead of it being auto resolved for you. The game features 3 different races: humans, elves, and orcs. Each race is very balanced, and it would be a very hard decision on if you were to ask which race was the best. This lets you face other online players (or play WITH them) without worrying that their units are SOO much better than yours.Raiding cities - Later on, once you have a big and tough army, you can start raiding AI cities. There are 30 (from my knowledge) cities that you can siege and either loot or make your vassel. Looting can be helpful, and gives you a lot of resources; while vassels give you resources over time.Do not be turned away because it is an online city builder. Most of this game is co-op, instead of facing other players. You can join a clan and help each other out by sending each other resources. My in-game name is Enki, for anyone who has any more questions or wants to raid some AI with me! :)			"

												This game has been a roller coaster. I first bought it on GameStop because of the promise of a single player mode which did eventually happen. I noticed MAJOR performance hits on Steam and Reverie's developers suggested using their OWN client which users reported provided a MUCH better experience in terms of performance. THEN Reverie discontinued their own client, and even on this I7 rig I have, this game lags and stutters while games like Supreme Commander and Supreme Commander 2 - develpped around the same time and with MUCH larger worlds and literally thousands of units runs beautifully. This game has has a troubled history and a visit to the HeavenGames forum for this game will reveal that history.The single player risk like portion of the game has been removed. This is strictly a PvP type game. If that's your thing, then you will like this game. I prefer single player and coop PvE. All of that said, I really hate writing this somewhat negative review as Reverie seem to be a stidio that really wants to make this game something special. The problem however - and you'll note other users have expressed the same concern in the Hub for this game - is that Reverie keeps releasing mega-patches but fails to address core game issues. When, as a company, ypou get rid of something that improves performance while simiultaneously releasing more and ""bigger"" stuff is really taking one step forward and two steps back. If you'll pardon the trope, this COULD have been the RTS fantasy strategy game to rule them all. It isn't unfortunately so it's back to playing Medieval Total War from the physical discs for me. I am sorry Reverie, you tried but you lack focus.			"

I really loved this game when it got 're-'released. I'd love to be able to play it again now. I'd love the jump on and see what my kingdom has become and rebolster it to what it was. But I can't even get past about 10-15% loading time in the start-up. This isn't just game breaking, there may as well be no game at all if the loading screen is the only thing I see.

The movement is clunky, the interface doesn't work well and you have to level up/upgrade almost everything. It is way more similar to a click-farm like maybe Clash of Clans / Utopia. This is a city-builder, not an MMORTS.PROS1. UnsureCONS1. PvP Protection?You can build it later in the game to buy PvP Protection. You can build a building to buy PvP Protection.2.

Be prepared to lose armies to crashes and weird void bugs or a common one is where the walls will be going but you dont have them. If you try to build there you lose all the resource and the building isn't built.There is no pay to win and most of the stuff being sold is cosmetic or one time buy for resource per city (Can only have one city unless you pay for more) It is rediculously fun and it would be a game I would pay subscription for if they fixed the bugs and tweaked a few things.All in all it is an awesome game and well worth your time.

												Feels a lil glued up in the unit tasking, but other than that looks good in my mind and instantly had a lil bit of a Black and White feel to it. I like that units are in platoons, but a more Total war approach with unit orders in battle would be nice. I give it a personal 8/10Edit 1:So now that Ive gotten some more time in the game, I must say Ive been gladly surprised with Kingdom Wars. However, as with any game, there are problems, and Ill try my best to be the most helpful I can to new players and to the devs in ideas I have. 1. units orders: The manner in which units are ordered around the battlefield is good to a point, but seriously sucks in combat. Basically, if you arn't used to normal RTS games and using those command groups, then be prepared to be annoyed. The forming of solid lines of defense/attack are simple to the point of insanity. You either just run everything up at once, save for cavalry and archers, and hope you win or you take too long to form proper lines and risk taking huge damaged from enemy archer or crossbowmen in the process. The way to fix this in my mind would be to rip the current system and add in a more Total war type of battle system, making for a more fluid experience (Or just add in the ability to lock different formations to a hotkey, Idk)2. The economy: This games economy surprised me for the better in some areas, but I found lack luster in others. The dominate reliance on wood is good, but the ability to build houses out of stone instead of wood would make for the bigger projects and upgrades coming faster, and make the city look better if they had the textures to match. The crown system is amazing, being a resource that you gain from gold instead of a bought currency for real money, and making it essential to manage your crown total very carefully so not to leave you without that one vital upgrade. The food resource in this game also makes for fun play in that there are not just farms but also animals to use to produce and it just adds a much greater sense of life to your city.3. The combat: The full on combat of this game is the biggest complaint I have. It seems that the battles try to simulate tactics, but in the end it seems all that is needed is to have a direct line to enemy units and just be a Russian as possible (Quantity wins) I would recommend changing it up to make it so certain units like the crossbowmen would do so much damage that it basicallly one hits units. Another this is the special units. Through the quests I recieved a Dragonslayer, which in my mind, would be fairly good agaisnt Dragons. But when I sent him agianst the Dragon that spawned as part of the quest, well, lets just say the rest of my army was quickly heading that way. I believe that some of the special units should be very, very good against what they are meant to go against.This is my current review, as I discover more of the game and figure it out for myself, Ill let every one know what I think, still a 8/10.A video review will be uploaded within the next day or two, will post link with this written one.

												Without Question the best game ive ever played full of great quests and the races are amazing i play as an elf as i love the way the can transmute resources. The race of men is good as it brings a traditianol style to warfare. Orcs are savage as you would expect and can build many small towns the combat is good and requires planning and reckless thinking can get your army killed. I like the daily rewards as they help me save up for that wall upgrade or unit one. I have played this game for 42 hours and are still learning and need a boost of crowns to help me and are stuck on the elven quest of defending the princess.			"

												Don't be turned down by the fact that it's a town and resource management game, as there are no pay-to-win elements anywhere. In fact, people complain on a daily basis that real money isn't worth anything.This game has many realistic elements but it is not a low-fantasy. There are three playable races: Humans, Elves, and Orcs. Later on, dwarves will become available for hire and dragons will be tamable.At the start of the game, you are a minor nobleman granted an estate by your liege. You will then work your way up to true knighthood, and eventually have vassals of your own. Your town will grow larger and larger, eventually with hundreds of peasants at your command (not hundreds of peasant units, simply that there are 10 in each unit, to prevent confusion). They will till and work the land for you. Eventually, you will go beyond your estate and vassalize your neighbors through complicated and realistic siege warfare.Now to the gameplay: The game functions like a town/resource management thrown in with some Warcraft III elements. You order workers to cut wood, mine, and then use the resources to build walls and buildings, and eventually muster an army to attack your neighbors. There are still several bugs, but all of them minor and they benefit the player more than they do any harm. The developers are also always online and very active so there aren't any things that go unnoticed.Overall: 8/10. The best town/resource management game I have played thus far, despite not really liking the genre previously. I recommend this game to anyone looking for a casual game.			"

It gives you a story along with your own to tell, And allows you to make a big army and burn ♥♥♥♥ up and stuff. So if you are thinking about getting it go ahead its not a waste of money, I still enjoy it today and never gets old.			"

												I have played this game for a few hours now.  It does need some work, its sluggish in areas, and it can be unforgiving.  The game has tons of potential!  I have enjoyed the time I have played.  If I knew that the game plays the way it does then I would have got it when it was Dawn of Fantasy and you had to pay for it.  Thats how much I like it right now.  If this opinion changes I will update.Ok.  I still really like this game.  I am noticing some bugs.  I have an issue when I try to start a quest on the world map it will not load correctly and I have to restart the game.  Also there seems to be some sorta disconnect between what happens on the quests and what my army is like when I get back to the world map.This game has awesome potential.  The devs. are working to make it more polished.  After a few fixes and maybe a graphical overhaul (not horrible but could really be better) this could be one of the best fantasy empire building games I have played.			"

												The best I can say about it: a pretty gameOtherwise Other games beat it from almost every point of view (possibly less from the claimed unique siege point of view)EXTREMELY aggressive on pushing the player on spending cash. Contrary to the developers statement this is a VERY pay 2 win game. Unless you are prepared to spend a constant amount of cash be prepared to not be able to upgrade your units or buildings, nor will you be able to get tat group of units which can actually put up a fight and you will be stuck with VERY basic units.

												This game so full of bugs that i'm surprised bugs aren't flying out of my computer smacking me in the face. There nothing that isn't bugged in this game it has bugged quest that get so bad that it just breaks your whole town forcing you to delete it, and start a new. Like the first quet for the orc race which wants you to lore a orger into a spike trap after completeing it the spike trap suppose to disppaer, but it doesn't an everytime one of your workers or warriors walks over it it completely kills them everytime, and the orger respawn in your town killing you workers, and warriors everytime you reload your town. Then there pathfind bugs siege units get stuck on walls units get stuck climbing siege ladder or just stop moving for the reset of an instance if they some how survie a spike trap. Then Fire really annoying your troops will run into, and try to attack it for some reason, and even when it gone your unit still take damage when there in the area that was on fire. There some werid gather bug that just start in the most recent patch it took me 3 hours to collect 2 pieaces of wood when i had 10 workers try to cut wood. It should be 3-15 wood every sec depend on research or amount of workers. There also a bug with the ingame currency were you'll just randomly lose all of it for no reason so don't pay really cash on crowns cause you will lose them for no reason. Also you can gain crowns from PVP/PVE, but that also bugged 60% of the time your not reward with them after a match. An this is only about 1/5 of the bugs in the game there many more like treants bugged movement speed sometime they have a movement speed of 9999 they'll be so fast they just teleport across the battle field other time they have a movement speed of 2 they move so slow it takes them 3 hours to get across a map. There also a bug with the single player were it will say your cheating, and are unable to play the single player. The best bug so far is this extremely annoying bug that will just roll back your whole town to what it was when you started it when you get attack by another player, and the devs say this is a very rare which is Bull-**** cause it happen to about 15 people everyday which compared to the fact that 1000-1500 people login every day it about 1% of the population. So after 20 days 20% of the population town has been completely rolled back to the begining.  An the Devs are useless they don't fix bugs they take forever to post on the forums, hell there was one time were the devs didn't post anything on there website for 6 months striaght. People just started saying the game shutting down on there forums, and they didn't reply to any of thos post what they did do was delete thos post when they started posting on there site again. An for some reason the Devs are ban happy as it stands banning people for no reason at all. So overall don't waste your money on this game if you want to play it to see how buggy it is your self then just wait for it to go F2P/P2W.			"

At frist it may seem boring but if you keep playing you will end up liking it. There 3 race elves, orc and human. You cant really choose a banne ryou like unless yo upay $1 which suck, but rest part is pretty good. This game also make yo uthink how to seige a castle and make you find a opening thourhg a enemy castle. Also you cant see player on the map unless you go find them thourgh the search thing and you can fight them there, for this part is the reason i dont like it. I recommend the game change that.At the end it a fun pvp game. i Hope you all enjoy it. It will take some time to become powerful in the game good luck.			"

												In my opinion any game that gives you 1 hour of fun per dollar spent on it is worth. That said, I spent 20$ on this game a year ago and I have never regretted it. Now that it's free, there is zero reason why you shouldn't at least try this game :D It took me 75 hours and about 4 months of playing to get one built up city and I haven't even touched the other two races yet, so needless to say this game will occupy you for a while. Also zero pay to win advantages, everything is aesthetic. You can buy in-game currency with gold you acquire in the game, and now that's the only way you can get it so everyone's on the same level.

												Kingdom wars is a great game that I would totally recommend. The gameplay is fun, and slightly addicting, yet its also enjoyable to log off and next time you log in you have the resources, gathered by your peasants while away, to get right back to work at building your kingdom. The graphics aren't the best but their plenty good in my opinion. The combat is enjoyable, sieges are fun, and sometimes costly to your army, and overall, its got loads of enjoyable content. Also, I sent an email to support and recieved a super quick and super kind response plus was generously compensated once the issue was fixed, and they fixed it in no time at all, quite impressive.

												Well i may not have played for a long period of time in this game and it seems like i cannot login into the game now due to some bugs. I still think this is a good game overall, which is why even after i encounter a rare bug which still have had yet to be solved and the developers are working on it. The pros and cons are much like what other players have posted out in the reviews. I personally think the most attractive thing about kingdom wars are the pvp system and city protection shield. Unlike other games, this city protection shield only tickles when you are online on your kingdom and playing. When you go offline, your shield will be the same as when you login again. That is extremely attractive for players like me who are busy at work with little time to play games everyday. In other games, you will normally get sieged and lose resources or even the whole kingdom and you have to restart again which is very frustrating. Here, you can take things slowly as you want, explore the maps, conquer some npc cities or co-op siege with the community. If you have the time and army, you can just remove your shield and get onto some pvp for more fun.There are no worries on how you play and whether if there are overpowered players that pays to win as everyone is more or less the same depending on what strategy you use and time spent to experience the game. I hope everyone finds it fun to play too.			"

The quests that you are given are easy and self explanitory, so you can navigate the game preaty well. Resource collection has aslo been done very well.

												I really liked this game (I really hated it in the  beginning) after the first day or two. Before, I didn't go through the tutorials (which I recommend you do) so I just asked around in the global chat. Luckily, there are about one million people that can help. I love how this game can simulate thousands of people at war without crashing your computer (like some games do) even if the graphics aren't spectacular. Then again, I would really like if there was a way to make an official alliance vs alliance war.			"

												I started playing this game last night and though I have only just begun it seems like I will enjoy it quite a bit. I like the strategic aspects of the game as well as the ease at which it can be picked up. There does not seem to be a pay wall as much of the items listed in the shop are things that do not seem overly difficult to attain in the game itself. The trade system could maybe use some work. I have tried doing the quest to trade cows and I cannot seem to get it to finish. Maybe i am doing something wrong but I feel it could be something to work on either way. That however would really be my only complaint so far. The game is fun and I love that I can build a castle for myself. I have not tried playing with a friend yet but I will have to do that very soon. I plan on telling some of my friends to join because it seems like it will be really fun to play this with them. Overall I rate this game as an 8/10 so far. A good fun strategy game that is not overly difficult to get a grasp on the concepts. Definitely a solid game.			"

												The game is great. I love basically every single aspect of it so far. The races are well different to make them unique (unlike just changing the units a little bit, each race has different mechanics, which is a must for any great RTS). The Microtransaction shop seems to sell some pretty nice customization for your town, + I love the way the whole game works by having a main town to work around, instead of building a settlement in one match than a new one in a later match. The map seems to be well done and different from area to area (seems like there are some unpopulated areas that may be used for future races, but I can't tell). The graphcis are nice. Many people complain about them, but I absolutely love em'. They look like what a nice RTS should look like. This is a game I surely look forward to playing further and maybe even spending some money on microtransactions. Keep up the good work!			"

												Somehow the Game Stronghold Online could have been. The troops are well balanced, allthough you need to get to know them to use them right. The three races are all provided with weakness and strength so the choice of race is rather a choice of taste. Bugs are not too seldom but support reacts relatively quick. only real downside for me is that castle building is not individual but for the sake of game balancing this is a necessity. If you like real time Strategy games then i recomend to at least give it a shot.			"

												I rarely write reviews but as a game tester for alpha, beta, and online mmos, i do gotta say this has been a very pleasent supprise. This is one of the few games that don't build hype to let players down. Theres not much pay to win, theres a great ballance with the units of the game, and all in all its a strong well crafted idea which I can very much put in 50 - 80 hours into this game. I do gotta say alot of the times rts are more like a gamble then strategy and this game is more of a gamble situation. Basically during battle the enemies have a range of aggro and thats really about it. I don't mind that as any war is a gamble of strength, luck, and some strategy and manuvering involved and this does put this very well. There is one otherthing that might be a bug is that the selection rectangle stays on the screen sometimes when you select a unit. Not a game breaker but it is a glitch they should look into. So far they have troop training as you enter cities, looting corpses with civs, and buying mercs and selling loot you get from enemies. The map is quite big and you can coop or even vs enemy players in segies and other pvp battles. I haven't got to test that part out yet, but you basically get your own map to your self to train your army anyway. Mount and blade strategy meet rts for the first time! It is defeently one of the more interesting games that i've seen and as a avid gamer, I am quite picky about what I play. I hope this helps!			"

												This is a great game, it has many casual gameplay elements taken from Rome total war, and some building elements from The Settlers (7?). Controlling your army, and leveling them up on the over world is great fun, building your city and aquiring upgrades also plays out well. The timers on building buildings don't hit as hard as I initially thought they would, with twenty minute build timers on some of the larger buildings passing by quickly as I focus on other portions of the gameI have to say, that by far, BY FAR, i enjoyed the first part of the game the most, the psuedo tutorial. Running around with my hero and a few units, clearing my lands from bandits, coming back to find a messenger had arrived, or a lord wanted me to do something was thrilling and immersive.The game looks fantastic for how many units are on the screen at once, and every battle I find myself Roleplaying as my hero, and ordering my units to take the field and feeling the loss of every man in all of my squads.  The only thing I really dislike are the crown earning systems, I find the process too slow, where PvP may net you the most crowns the fastest, that can come at the total loss of your army (save for maybe one or two units if you are lucky), which means it's back to the drawing board to re level up your units. (You can also buy your units levels at nearby towns with in game gold)You could also take your leveled army, and farm the overworld maps for crowns, but after the third run through of a map, I find myself getting tired of the same placement of units, the same patrol paths, the same spawn point. Vary up the maps a bit more, is all I ask, make the single player overworld a bit more varied for map selection, instead of relying on the same one or two exactly the same maps per section.It's a great free to play game if you are into city builders with PvP elements. Enjoy it while it lasts.			"

												As a kingdom builder this opens up a new level of game play. The RPG aspect alone is worth looking into along with the control of troops and armys. Building is smooth and easy to follow,with trade and city growth working hand in hand with the games quest. For the hard core the massive PVP will be right in line with there game play. Enjoy this game and look to be around for the long haul.			"

												Hi guys, Hellbound Commander here.  I think i've possibly found the best medieval strategy game that is Free to play, maybe even in general.  I was searching in the f2p tab on team and i came across this game.  I got interested and I downloaded it.  It was worth it.  Kingdom Wars is the best game i've played in a long time!  The level of depth to the game is almost unparalleled in anything I have seen.  There are so many features that I really can't fit into this review, so I want to ask you guys to download this game and start playing it so that you csn get a feel of what i mean.  The graphics are amazing, the battles and wars going on all around you add so much content to your experience that there is really no way to get bored of it.  You have the campaigns and the quests and everything that are sitting right there to become available to you as you build up your castle and venture out into the world of Mythador.  There are so many features, one of which is what the devs cleverly labeled the ""Home Warfare"" law which was passed by King Erian IV (I play as a human lord).  It offers you the chance to attack your neighbors and also other players to gain more resources, get some battle experience under your belt, or just simply entertain yourself.  To protect new players however, as on many other games your castle/town is not attackable by other players until you've spent 24 hours of real time on the game.  I've still got almost 18 hours left on mine.  It closely resembles the Stronghold crusader series because of its real-time combat and detail to the units, structures and features.  As you progress in the game you eventually become more attuned to your surroundings.  It is important to start with a strong workforce and a small army, as well as a desire to do the quests you are assigned.   That usually opens up doors to more quests, campaigns, and other features of the game.  There is a special currency in the game, called Crowns, which are used to buy some elite units, make castle siege defenses, upgrade buildings, etc.  You can buy these crowns with the in-game money called Coins, which are obtainable through Gold Mines, battles and quests.  You can also get coins by bringing a group or two of peasants along with you and tasking them for 'Corpse Looting'.  This enables them to loot corpses, whether they be your's or your enemy's, for materials and Coins.  Other ways to get Crowns are to do quests and win battles, for each you receive a specified number of crowns.  Crowns are essential in your ability to progress through the game as a successful player.This game, unlike most 'F2P' games out there is not a pay-to-win game.  The success of players isn't determined by how large their wallet is, but rather how much patience and perseverance they have.  If you Persevere you can eventually rise to the top and become one of the strongest players throughout Mythador.  I bid you all farewell future lords and ladies, and I wish you good fortune should you choose to join me and many others on Kingdom Wars.   "

												Hi.   Ok, I'm a newb, just a few hours played.   Look at it this way, I have over 50 games in steam, haven't played more than a day in most of them, this one, I'm on my 3rd day.  I like the art.  I like having quests mainly because I'm retired and old and don't want to think too much.  I seem to have a little trouble with losing workers somewhere and haven't figured how to find them yet.  I'd like more tooltips with more info, I'd like to pause without logging out if no one's attacking me.... just because going pee (I'm old, it takes a while and often) and you come back and whatever you killed quest-wise has resurrected (it took me a while to figure out you gotta finish any quests you start before logging out, I was thinking I was having a senior moment and never really did what I thought I did -- which is scary)  I do feel like I need LOTS more direction and explaination.  Any way to move that chat box?  I like to listen in but it's in the way.The music is nice but I find myself nodding off.  This little box is filling up.  Oh, soon I'll be vulnerable... does a guy joining this late have a chance of survival if attacked?  lbattros@hotmail.com.			"

												Kingdom Wars is a very unique and addictive MMORTS. You attack, defend, and manage a kindom with the option of three playable races each differning in their own unique ways. You start off with a simple kingdom, but in time it can easily grow and prosper into a epic empire. It is not a pay to win type of game either. With both time and skill you can easily succed in this game. I definatly recommend to strategic players.			"

												Having played several ""free to play"" games, this one actually delivers on not needing to pay to win. The in-game currency called ""crowns"" is obtained through multiple ways from questing to pvp. With premium, gains are doubled but even without a player can amass wealth from sieges and quests in a matter of two or three hours. City management is simple and straightforward as resources are close at hand and placement of buildings is set by building plots scattered around the landscape. Time and crowns are all that is really needed to construct a powerful castle and the time goes by quickly as you fight to gain crowns. There are a diverse number of troops to choose from. Recruitment can include the troops of your own race as well as mercenaries when camping in foreign lands and dwarves and beasts from special buildings. Only three playable races are available: elves, orcs, and humans. Hopefully dwarves will be added in the future and possibly dragons (please). Battles and troop management are split between the world map and specific battlegrounds and are fairly easy to grasp. The only complaint towards troops in battle is their refusal to listen to certain orders. When you send cavalry in to feint an enemy into charging and the cavalry doesn't retreat when you tell them to, your strategy gets ruined and you are forced to en masse charge or risk losing part of your army. Aside from the troop command issue, the game is both fun and addicting as one could spend hours trying to earn crowns, conquer cities, and improve his/her own. Coupled with the game actually being fair and not requiring real money to be good, I would recommend it to any seeking a fun, free-to-play strategy game.			"

												I have been playing Kingdom Wars on and off for a while now.  With the recent launch of their Free to Play experience I've spent the last few days catching up on all the changes.Game Details:This is a long term City Building Game with a RTS Campaign Map / Battlefield Map with PvE and PvP aspects. City Building:- This plays like any resource cap / population cap / building plot game.- You establish an economy of food / wood / stone and gold.- You use these resources (along with renown) to build better buildings / defenses and units.- You also upgrade your technology and other improvements. Campaign Map:- The map has the 3 racial zones along with NPC and Endgame Zones.- Here you move your armies around which open up the various gameplay elements.- You can trade by actually loading up an army with transports and resources/currency and moving them to an NPC town you would like to trade with.  Each town opens up to you as you advance your influence.- You can also battle the NPC towns and make them 'vassals' of your main town.- You can enter open world combat (instanced random map based on your location) along with building various camps to provide a defensive start to these combat areas.- The map does not show the thousands of other player cities, however you can engage in PvP matches or sieges. Battle Map:- Here is where you (in real time) engage in troop movements and combat.- This plays like a simplified Total War game with basic unit based formations.- The actual units themselves have a bit more complexity and individuality due to ranks and the way you can upgrade them.Review:Overall this is a fun, laid back type of game that you can log in for a few minutes or hours and feel accomplished. City Building:- I like the graphics, turned all the way up there are some nice lighting and textures.  This is not 'the best looking' game, however they have done well enough to keep immersion.  My only complaint is with how they implemented lightning during storms.- The plots are pre planed (so you build walls, and they show up where the walls should go).  You do get some choice in where to build specific buildings, but you still must choose predefined locations.  This took some getting used to and I'm not sure that I like it. Orcs can build anywhere if this is your thing.- The three races give distinct city building and resource gathering flavors.  With that said there are more than 1 way to acquire any of the required resources.  I like this.- City building is a long term game.  Things continue when you are logged off; and once you've spent your resources for the day there is little left to do here.  This is great for the quick maintenance fix it seems I have with games.- This quick logon goes well with daily booster rewards. World Map:- I like the style of the world map.  The art flavor for the different zones makes it easy to tell what area you are looking at.  With that said, the map is smaller than I would like.- I also think they got the army movement speed right, where it is not instant; giving you a sense of distance; while not taking forever and a day to cross the map.- Beyond that, not much to say about the world map.  It provides access to the game functions. Battle Map:- I really enjoy that you can take an army out, go to a zone that has whatever you like to fight, and then engage in whatever type of combat that you like.  This gives the 30+ minute gameplay angle.- You can decide to farm if that is your thing (resources, experience, even units).- The rock / paper / scissors unit types work well.  There is enough variety that you can get the gameplay you enjoy.- I wish that grouped units had more formation control.- Since you can upgrade specific aspects (such as resistance) of the units you have, you can create shock troops or a tanky army.  I like the variety.No pvp comments as I've not gotten there yet.			"

												I have been playing this game for a few days, and im still groing my army and building my stronghold. this game is great, its not asking you the buy anything to be able to level up, all u have to do is play. There are so many options, carathors, great strategy game that make you think about how to best beat your oponents, I would love to see in the future more costomization and more upgradable options. been able to take part of the battle as your own heror in a first person action, controling your army while being part of it. been able to slash down your opponents, would be a great add on.I would also love to see the building improving as the building are being upgraded.More choice to upgrade armors and weapons.With all that said, this games is unique, i have played so many socalled free to play game, and after a while u have to pay to get upgrades, but not this game. when they said free to play this really is a for the people game.Keep up the good work, and never stop inproving, and i will keep playing. Also recomend this game to all those that love strategy game with a medieval team with men, orc, elfs, dragons, and so much more it would take me all night to describes, just download this game and see for yourself why this game is not like any others.ThanksYann			"

												As a kingdom builder this opens up a new level of game play. The RPG aspect alone is worth looking into along with the control of troops and armys. Building is smooth and easy to follow,with trade and city growth working hand in hand with the games quest. For the hard core the massive PVP will be right in line with there game play. Enjoy this game and look to be around for the long haul.			"

												Hi guys, Hellbound Commander here.  I think i've possibly found the best medieval strategy game that is Free to play, maybe even in general.  I was searching in the f2p tab on team and i came across this game.  I got interested and I downloaded it.  It was worth it.  Kingdom Wars is the best game i've played in a long time!  The level of depth to the game is almost unparalleled in anything I have seen.  There are so many features that I really can't fit into this review, so I want to ask you guys to download this game and start playing it so that you csn get a feel of what i mean.  The graphics are amazing, the battles and wars going on all around you add so much content to your experience that there is really no way to get bored of it.  You have the campaigns and the quests and everything that are sitting right there to become available to you as you build up your castle and venture out into the world of Mythador.  There are so many features, one of which is what the devs cleverly labeled the ""Home Warfare"" law which was passed by King Erian IV (I play as a human lord).  It offers you the chance to attack your neighbors and also other players to gain more resources, get some battle experience under your belt, or just simply entertain yourself.  To protect new players however, as on many other games your castle/town is not attackable by other players until you've spent 24 hours of real time on the game.  I've still got almost 18 hours left on mine.  It closely resembles the Stronghold crusader series because of its real-time combat and detail to the units, structures and features.  As you progress in the game you eventually become more attuned to your surroundings.  It is important to start with a strong workforce and a small army, as well as a desire to do the quests you are assigned.   That usually opens up doors to more quests, campaigns, and other features of the game.  There is a special currency in the game, called Crowns, which are used to buy some elite units, make castle siege defenses, upgrade buildings, etc.  You can buy these crowns with the in-game money called Coins, which are obtainable through Gold Mines, battles and quests.  You can also get coins by bringing a group or two of peasants along with you and tasking them for 'Corpse Looting'.  This enables them to loot corpses, whether they be your's or your enemy's, for materials and Coins.  Other ways to get Crowns are to do quests and win battles, for each you receive a specified number of crowns.  Crowns are essential in your ability to progress through the game as a successful player.This game, unlike most 'F2P' games out there is not a pay-to-win game.  The success of players isn't determined by how large their wallet is, but rather how much patience and perseverance they have.  If you Persevere you can eventually rise to the top and become one of the strongest players throughout Mythador.  I bid you all farewell future lords and ladies, and I wish you good fortune should you choose to join me and many others on Kingdom Wars.   "

												Great Game! good way to spend your time growing an empire and meeting new people. Mechanics are simple build and destroy but with lots of quests and different options to spend your time so your not always waiting on resources theres always something you can do. :)) And who doesnt love to build your own castles and slap peasants and tell them what to do. ^.^ highly recommend this game			"

												Hi.   Ok, I'm a newb, just a few hours played.   Look at it this way, I have over 50 games in steam, haven't played more than a day in most of them, this one, I'm on my 3rd day.  I like the art.  I like having quests mainly because I'm retired and old and don't want to think too much.  I seem to have a little trouble with losing workers somewhere and haven't figured how to find them yet.  I'd like more tooltips with more info, I'd like to pause without logging out if no one's attacking me.... just because going pee (I'm old, it takes a while and often) and you come back and whatever you killed quest-wise has resurrected (it took me a while to figure out you gotta finish any quests you start before logging out, I was thinking I was having a senior moment and never really did what I thought I did -- which is scary)  I do feel like I need LOTS more direction and explaination.  Any way to move that chat box?  I like to listen in but it's in the way.The music is nice but I find myself nodding off.  This little box is filling up.  Oh, soon I'll be vulnerable... does a guy joining this late have a chance of survival if attacked?  lbattros@hotmail.com.			"

												Kingdom Wars is a very unique and addictive MMORTS. You attack, defend, and manage a kindom with the option of three playable races each differning in their own unique ways. You start off with a simple kingdom, but in time it can easily grow and prosper into a epic empire. It is not a pay to win type of game either. With both time and skill you can easily succed in this game. I definatly recommend to strategic players.			"

It brings a wonderful way you can build your forces and strageties to defeat enemys at the same time adding fun quest you can do and provide a challenge to your way of game play. And the best part about this game is that it's FREE to PLAY which is AWSOME in my oppinion. So all in all I reccoment this game to any one looking for some fun.			"

												Hello my name is rotanahte well my gamer tag that is, today im going to talk about Kingdom Wars. Kingdom Wars is a fantasy MMO that incorporates Orcs, Elves, and Humans. The game mainly consists of YOU and YOUR mouse. What i want to ask you is, how many of you out there like to command people or in this case be in ""charge""? I do and when i saw this game i freaked out! I love this game my friends even tell me im playing too much of it. I've only been playing for about 1 week. I honestly thought i spent 3 hours ingame, turns out i spent 23.2 hours in one week in one game. I highly recommend this game to anyone out there.			"

												So I bought this game in 2012 after it was fairly new. Keep in mind, this game was new at the time and was still getting sorted out. I played for 100+ hours in the first week, It brought me in and it kept me wanting to come back and play more. I had to get the walls built, I needed to build that army, I needed to siege  that city. This game has improved more than I could have imagined since then. I literally bought it a second time because I couldnt resist, Now after a year and a half break I am back. I was able to import all of my old cities and pick up right where I left off. This game is great in the RTS aspect. Lots of units, versatile factions, even the ability to conquer other cities. It also has great strategy becaus every unit has a weakness, but it also a strong point which could help to change the tide of a battle. I recommend this game to anyone who is looking for an enjoyable, laid back, RTS. The mods are great and the community is a lot of fun. This is a game thatcould get you hooked.			"

												kingdom wars is a great game in opinion, it has all the aspects that a game on the dark ages or at least this kind of game on the dark ages should have. it has some up sides and down sides too. i realy like how you can choose a race between orcs, humans, and elv's it just add's in that lord of the ring touch. the down side is that the recorsess take a wile to collect and it take's a long time to get crowns to builed defences. and one of the best fetures are that you can ricrute different races into your armi. one of the bad things is how long it takes fore your soldures to cross the map. and the graffics are dicent not great but there ok for what it is. over all its a great game and the developers need to ceep on going and doing their best to improve the game.

												This game was AWESOME !!! At 1st on how I found this game is, I am just finding for a Free-2-Play games and when I saw the Cover of the game and its Trailer, and its AWESOME THRILLING MUSIC in the Trailer !!! It reminded me of Lord of the Rings, so i downloaded it, the game was GREAT !!! The Graphics on ""Low"" is kinda bad but the game was AWESOME ! It's like Total War, but Total War never shows its awesome growing base on LIVE not like on KW !! And the Changing weather effects in the Game ? Like Snow, Raining, Storm, etc... KINDA AWESOME !! And watching your town growing, your peasants working, your laborers making stuffs and something like that, It's a mixed Strategy Game ! And  the best part they've done in the game is, they made it F2P (Free2Play), I've been playing for 16+ Hours because it's kinda Addictive, if You're a Strategic game fan i don't know if you're gonna like this game or not, but to me, It's Awesome... Anyways my vote to this game is 10/10 :D It's just so Fantastic...			"

It's a nice game, and I loved my old times playing The Lord of The Rings Battle From Middle Earth and for those who likes The Lord of The Rings Battle From Middle Earth, I would recommend this game!

												Kingdom wars is an Innovative kingdom builder.  I like the economic system, the more peasants you have working the fields, the more resources you get.  There are also upgrades for said peasants to make them more efficient, as well as upgrades for your military.  I like the fact that you don't need real cash to make crowns, which you get by completing missions, reaching accomplishment milestones or trading for gold in the game.  Trading is probably the fastest way to make gold in game, as you can create an army with a few horse carts and peasants to carry goods to market, plus add farm animals to the army to sell those in different cities.       Creating an army is easy enough, just need to go to the world map.  You pick the units you want in it, military, peasants, animals and send it on it's way.  The combat leaves a bit to be desired, I think the AI needs a bit of work, as I leave my force sttationary, send a unit of archers up to snipe at the enemy.  As soon as the enemy starts moving toward my army, I run them back and wait for the slaughter, as the enemy only sends in a few units without archer support.  After their melee units are dispatched, rinse and repeat on their archer units, who blindly follow into oblivion.  Send in the peasants to clean up the corpses and you get a nice bit of loot.  I also like the wide variety of units allowed in the game, the fact that you don't need to worry about using real money to buy the better units, as they cost resources and crowns and are available to everyone.     I haven't gotten to build up my castle yet, as I have been concentration on my economic upgrades, but from what I've seen, it really looks worth building a castle as soon as you can afford the crowns, stone and/or wood for it.  I haven't tried siege warfare yet either, so I really have no knowledge of it other than the turtorial I played.       Overall, I find the game a lot of fun, it's a kingdom builder that really allows you to build a kingdom.  You have diplomacy to ally yourself with npc's or other players, forming guilds/clans.  It is an awesome experience. "

												When you seige a city in the game and win, you are given the option of making the city yours or looting it. Considering how long it takes to win one of these seiges, this one in particular took 2 hours, I was unbelievably annoyed when an announcement popped up in place of the message giving you the option of either making the city yours or looting it.

												I have follwed this title since beta, I pre ordered the game and played it on off for years. It was the first true mmorts in my eyes, the dream of a persistant age of empires game or similar really came true here.During the transition to Steam I lost my account so I decided to start again on here as a free to play.I can honestly say from having a paid account I have managed to reach exactly where I was before for free. there are no pay walls or timers to get around. Most of the paid stuff is cosmentic however given the poor visuals it doesn't look great.Pro's: Gameplay, the feeling of laying siege to a town and carefully planning your strategy is great. This game is for the slow methodical players, rush competitive gamers will find it lacking.Con's: Graphically dated and the interface is really clumsy!			"

												I've been looking for a game that melds a lot of features from some of my favourite strategy games into an online environment, a game that is set aside from others within the same genre, and this really is it. The game is not pay to win and is paced really well, it's not slow nor is it fast, you really feel rewarded from what you receive through the steady rate of progression. The quests help to push you in the right direction while you're starting out, and after just a few hours you'll be making some really steady progress toward the more end-game options. Positives: As mentioned previously, the game is not pay to win, finding a game like this that is both enjoyable, f2p, and not pay to win seems to be the gaming equivalent of finding gold in your back garden, for this I am very grateful. You have several different options in terms of how you would like to play the game, do you want to be economically focused, do you want to focus on military, etc; this kind of choice makes the game strategically diverse and allows you to shape how you want to play the game, and I felt that this made the game far more enjoyable, especially if you play with friends and work together by taking up different roles.Negatives: The game is a little buggy right now, and performance can vary. While trying to use the windowed mode feature I found my game crashing very frequently, and I ultimately had to disable that option. I also got stuck in one of the tutorials while trying to access the menu. So the game is definitely in need of some polish. Combat could also do with some work; the current system gets the job done but is quite clunky and very messy. You send your units in and then sit back and hope for the best. Of course the graphics are quite basic but they are bearable, a slight overhaul would be a nice quality of life improvement. A little more direction for players completely new to the genre would also be very useful. Overall, from my gameplay experience and from the masses of reading I've done about the game, I think it's great and absolutely worth a try. The developers are keen on improving the game and are asking for feedback whenever possible, which really tells me they have their head in the right place.			"

												Rating: 9/10Pros:-Works like a Facebook game, you can log out with peace of mind knowing that players cannot attack you unless you are online. And you get rewarded for daily log-ins!-If you are a rich and prosperping player, you might be able to pay them off with gold or stone, etc.-Feels like Stronghold - but without the pesky tasks of ""cleaning up gong"" or ""peseants stealing from our granery sire"" -Mobile armies: You can build a force and level them through campsites and taking on enemies in the wilderness around you, making you stronger and your units stronger for battles to come.-Well designed lore of castles and beautiful landscapes.-No ""PayToWin"": As they say in the news on the game ""this game is designed to avoid the pitfalls of FreeToPlay games....focusing more on skill and persistance than bigger wallets""Cons:-Very wonky (slow) combat. You have to make sure you units don`t get stuck and cluttered as they will get moved over by the smallest force if you`re not careful.-Co-op is not as smooth as I had hoped, while you can send supplies to your friend, getting them to play with you to aid in a quest or seige is a bit frustraing if you dont pay close attention to what you are selecting.-Npc workers [peasants, etc] tend to get stuck up in hills or behiind fences when chopping down trees. -The initial title screen has very LOUD audio - first tiime players make sure your audio is turned down some or your ears will get blasted away. While this is epic sounding, if any player has their volume up they might get quite a surpize once the tittle screen loads.-Slow loading screens between transitions. [ While this really isn`t a *con* it can be annoying waiting for that bar to load up when there is little to nothing in your home city to load ] Another transition issue is between begining to seige and actually entering the seige. These problems are on and off, and while I havea solid internet this *may* vary between players. Overall this game as great potential to kick out Stronghold and its gong-infested cities and brings forth a potential for a shining sheild in castle-sim-like games. "

												I really love the gameplay of this game and the combat,siege and defense mechanisms. The grapgics are really good and detailed for a strategy RTS game. However, while yes it technically is not pay to win, its more pay to play. I was very surprised to find that i couldnt even play a skirmish without paying, while i can understand the developers need to make money, i wouldn't call it free to play if 3/4 of the features require actual money. A good example of an ACTUAL free to play is Neverwinter; every single ounce of content is free, even the things you can only get with special items is still achievable using multiple methods in the game, on top of that it's solid, fun, addictive and satisfying gameplay and story. So while im very into Kingdom Wars i think making it fully free to play or even just unlocking the skirmish modes would bolster the popularity and reception of the game.			"

Kingdom WarsBefore you read my ratings understand that i consider a score of 20 and below to be a bad game a score between 20 and 30 a decent gamea score between 30 to 40  to be a good gameand a score of 40+ to be a awesome game Priceworthy - 10/10 Consider the fact that you don't pay anything for the game. Graphics - 7/10 looks decently good. Sound - 6/10 somewhat decent music in the game. Gameplay - 7/10 i really like the game but getting tormented in pvp sucks. Worth playing - 7/10 The game is worth experiencing.Kingdom wars gets a total score of 36 out of 50This is a truly great game but as all games that don't have the backing of a multi million dollar company it has its big flaws like some latency to other players and somewhat odd pathfinding for units at times, but as we gamers know they are trying to patch whatever the problem is it won't be instant but they are working on it. The 2 somewhat bad things in this game is the really unbalanced ""HERO"" units,and the really really unbalanced pvp system.I Would really recommend this game if you are a RTS Fanor really just want to play a rts game with a friend.

												This game is built in such a way to make it take easily a month to be able to have a structured castle and armys and in my oppinion this game has alot of talent and will become even better the more they add to it iv played just about 95% of all RTS games and this would be probly number 1 from design and structure of the game's build and just the way been put together makes me very happy to be a member of this game. I recomend this game to anyone who likes a RTS game that lasts more then 3 hours, also i wont lie it has a few bugs but the Dev team/Mod team have been working so hard to fix this game so it runs at 100% without any bugs which im glad they are. which i give this game a 15/10 lol its excellant in my honest full oppinion out of all the hundreds of games i have this is definitly top of list.Graphics: updated graphics like Battle for middle earth 2.Design: love it xDvoice/sound: brilliantly done made it very much like the medievil age which is a bonusWild fires: love the fact you can create bush fires and catch people and anything except rocks on fire.resources: love the way they set it up to calculate resources per minite.Units: they have literaly put all medievl units in this game plus dwarven/elves/orcs so its got lots of variaty which gives the game more choices.All up love the game recommended to anyoneAlso sorry for any miss spelled words.

												I am only 3 days in but find the game expansive enough to keep it fun.  Have to say though I do still struggle with getting my crown ratings up vs amount of other resources I gather.  I hope to understand that better soon.			"

												I noticed that a lot of people are not recommending this game because of the feature, ""Pay to win"", is in the game but that is entirely optional. You don't have to pay. You only pay for the game with everything in it. Nothing forces you to pay. Not sure if that feature is still in the game though.Also I saw one review saying that you have to join the game by signing up on their website. That is not true although You have to register ingame and then receive an confirmation email for you to complete the registeration. This process do not take more than two minutes. You are required to do this in order to play the game online with friends and others. That's it.Anyway my review...Overall and ongoing, it is a fun game. I enjoy playing against AIs enemies as well as players whilst doing the storyline. I use the term, storyline, very loosely because it is almost very direct but you can do the quests whenever and in your own time. Yes, the game can and should have been better than what it is at the moment but I don't complain because it is a decent game.However it can be ugly due to cutscenes when you have conversations with some certain characters in the ""storyline."" The characters, by looking very closely, they look like they came from 90s games like Castle Strike or the old Warcraft series unless I forget to improve the graphics in the settings lol but that is manageable anyway because you don't look that closely often.Overall, I would say this is 7/10. Better than some games but could have been better.			"

												To be honest here the game has quite a lot of problems, mostly with the units pathfinding and overall grind to get enough resources or crowns to build important buildings or even stone walls which kinda killed it for me a little but the combat can be very interesting. When it comes to the combat it can be a real challange at first, not so much because of the pathfinding for me though, but because the AI's are able to move more units then you can to specific spots. But thats the fun about it, you can easily out take out the AI if you do things right but sometimes you can easily screw up and lose a bunch of units, which to me is fine again, forcing the player to think about how to go about it without losing every soldier they gained. Not to mention that the game dev's are constintly at work to fix many of the problems that are poping up, they are very aware of the situation that the game is in but are having trouble fixing them due to a recent failure going to NW2 which caused a few problems as mentioned in the recent updates section. Many people say that it isent working but to be honest once more I have a feeling that they just are trying to be trolls cause I have one of thee 2nd worst gaming laptops in my house and it runs very smoothly after I adjust the graphics. Lastly overall the graphics bring me back to my childhood days of gaming, like I said above this resembles Battle for Middle Earth quite alot in the way of graphics but I am by far fine with that, I never was a stickler when it came to things like that, just so long as the models arent sticks flouting around. Overall to me this has so far been a great experience and might even put a bit of money into it just to possibly get the starter pack or something mostly to support the dev's and because I feel like throwing money in their faces, lol. I may add more to this review wether bad or good over the coarse of the next few months and I am planing to deffinitly play this over thanksgiving, so things may change but my opinion of the game will never change, epecially since this is a newly made game, were anything could happen....and yes 3-4 years old is still considered new to me considering ages for other games.

												i love this game with a passion. the free to play game that is kingdom wars is bringing back what it means to strategize. this old style game has been done like this many times before but they are not around anymore, the whole mid evil scene died out, but this game is bringing it back old school with knights, castles and seige units. this game is so much different than other games because of one thing, Siege. Nothing is more fun than attacking a castle with a friend. Anyways this is a very fun game, play it hours on end, and very well made :)			"

												I love the game. its like all those king and queen games you want all in one. the army battles are huge, the ai does what its told....sometimes atleast. what problems the game has, which to be rather happy with is very little. is fixed within hours or within days. if you let them know whats wrong they will more than likely fix it. its fun to have a huge castle, ive been playing the good part of a few weeks/a month or two and ive barely scratched the surface. the range of units is great. each has strengths/weaknesses nothing is too overpowerd. there really is no spam this unit you win. seige weapons are innacurate but funny but do a lot of damage and whats cool is they use resources to fire. you get raided and the enemy doesnt bring enough resources then good luck him seiging. ive not been attacked yet and you get free premuim on start aswell as not being attacked for 24 ingame hours. not a day if you play or not. your villagers gather resources even when you are not there. the world map is lovingly huge. there is so much to do. you can play as much as you want. there is always something to do. its not like a game you can just leave running and visit an hour or day. you can just keep playing if you want to. it works both ways. the game is great. i hope to keep playing it as much as possible and as long as i can. the graphics are not top end but everything is shown. everything has good animations and the combat is fun. i hope they make graphics a little better but thats my opinion. its a great great game. those who like stratagy games will love this. there is three races too with there own sub factions. humans can get dwarves and mages to help which is cool and as far as i know each race has there own storyline but is on the global map. its great!! keep up the great work!a few things that could be fixed/improved upon. in my opinion and just general fixes that may or may not be noticed that could be done1: The formations and stances can be set but if you log out and rejoin some auto revert without being told otherwise.2: graphics. but thats just me3: a little bit more info on what formations do but not layed out in a basic format. e.g loose formation makes it harder to hit with arrows but does it decrease things in stats, if so by how much, not simply ""It reduces this. but not say how much"" 4: i would like to see a unit range decal so i know where archers/crossbow men and seige equipment can fire from and where best to place in defence.5. Cycle icons or timers on research and production. there is already a black loading icon but with some research i press the button and its either instant or is researching slowly, either way i cannot tell if its been researched or is researching. maybe grey out the button or say ""researched already"" e.g the mill, irrigation i researched but it still remains there showing the purchase amount but its no longer clickable, ok i know it means its worked but to others they might click it and go...well what now?6: the mouse feels like it lags when clicking things, sometimes it wont select a unit liturally right behind another unit or when you attack they will walk, maybe a toggle run button too but mainly the way the mouse feels. it seems to feel like its lagging when clicking. or you have to multiple click somethings a few times.7:the female hero after leaving the capital then returning will spawn, when it auto walks to the return way point it walks with a broken graphics, looking like its legs are were its arms are and its arms right outwards with the sword pointing outwards.keep up the good work!

												I want to first start out by saying, I have owned this game since beta, So I have been through all the Bugs and junk like most games when they first come out.....Game Review goes down like thisYou can Custom each unit as well as your Castle, different textures armours and how they fight for example you want Knights with tons of Arrow defense and huge hitting power or low hitting power but can heal up super fast. I guess once you lvl up your units it will somewhat blend in as there are caps...Main types of people you can play ORCS, Elfs and Human. I play Human as my main and Orcs... I hate elves!!! It is not a Pay to win game as it has a system to match people up to somewhat equal balance. The graphics are great, now I have a power house machines so I can't really speak if there is lag or Frame rate issues as I get max all the time. The map and fights are pretty dynamic and if you are a Total War fan this might be your game!! It is also a full RTS game no turn base crap which is nice. I have a O.K army with 1 Red Dragon and a few Minotaurs LOVE Minotaurs. Most people have a lot of playing methods. lots of people like Archers and some like things that can run fast and destroy Archers like Minotaurs hehe. Your Kingdom is setup in such a way that if you get a attacked you have a chance to win if you play smart. You will always retain your Castle if you lose and it is pretty easy to fix it back up.  I would suggest playing solo a few matches to see what your base can do and find the weaknesses. There are plenty of people so lvling up makes it easy. You can lvl up really fast so don't think you will be left behind, this games some what take care of that weakness really good. They have units that you can buy with crowns find out what type of fighter you want to be then unless your power...Crowns that word can be scary but like I said this is not a Pay to win game.... So you can earn crowns pretty easy by fighting and doing all the quest... Now I hope the devs still do this, but they are know to give out 100 crowns for just being nice in chat.... or helping others, I have received close to 300 crowns in total over the years. Devs,, they listen for the most part and seem to have a great connection to the chat channels, patches come out pretty quick and all the extra content is free. PS there is a way to have to have a full Dwarf Army very bad ♥♥♥. I have 50% full army now that I am lvling up. Thank for reading my wall of text..... See you out there			"

												Kingdom Wars is not for everyone. It is a slow, complex game, though that's not to say it's any more complex than your average RTS. Starting the game the first time has a steep learning curve of about 7 hours. You have to learn all your normal RTS things like what buildings can go where to make what, what upgrades are available to each unit, basic economy & tactics, etc. But then there is an overworld map, quests, army management, sieges, and a tight constraint on crowns/influence, which is the reward for beating quests and winning combat and absolutely necessary not only for research but for special units, too. And consider this: there is a PvP element, which you either can bypass by paying off the attacker or engage and risk your units, and either way you can only rest safe for one hour of in-game time before you can attack/be attacked again. So you start off with 24 hours of in-game PvP protection. Just 24 game hours to prepare for PvP.PvE is all about quests and getting crowns/influence through quests and battling on the overworld (think random battles from older Final Fantasy games but you choose when & where.) One big flaw is the cumbersome quest system which makes you inch your way over the worldmap to the quest giver's city and then load the city map and then wait while your hero runs across the city to the quest giver. And turning in a quest often results in another one being available, but you have to exit the city and enter it again, walk your hero back to the quest giver and get the next quest in the chain. Most quests are repetitive, and don't directly scale in difficulty. You will often have to fight two armies, seige two cities, etc. and both often occur on the same map, but you have to, again, inch your way over the overworld map to get from point to point. Now the idea behind this is while one army is moving up to four additional armies can be deployed as well. This makes it possible to split your forces and multi-task on the world map, building an ever bigger collective army.Battles can be quick, though. I got to a point in the quests where I decided I would have my hero kill eveything solo, and that takes forever. But if you don't go Hero vs. World, seiging a castle can be quick, routing an army can be quick, it all depends on your playstyle and how much you risk your units, if you worry about looting every penny, spending every skill point asap, etc. This is the kind of game like OgreBattle where you can easily drop 80 hours and not even see a fraction of what there is to achieve in the game. This game is a place to escape reality and become absorbed in the fantasy RTS game, with the added pluses and minuses of PvP. There are so many details, potential strategies, and an ever unlocking complexity that keeps you learning well past the 30 hours I've put into this game so far. Despite the flaws, it is easy to get absorbed. Come and stay. We don't bite - much. :)			"

												So Dawn of Fantasy: Kingdom Wars now just known as Kingdom Wars is a rather unique MMORTS with a persistent world and economy.So let's go over this with the good the bad and the improving.The Good:This game has one of the most ACTIVE dev/moderator communities I've ever seen. There are almost always devs or moderators with community supporting abilities online and they respond very quickly to player queries/problems/bug reports.City Management: It's really fun getting your city up and running, your economy working and it really helps build up a feeling of ""This is mine!"" when you log in to your city.Army building: The roster of units per race is not overly large or cumbersome but there is room for a lot of diversity and tactics. The way they go about this is fairly fun and unique. Each and every battalion levels up  not just the heroes. And as each battalion levels you can allocate points to that battalion so that it better supports your tactics which means you can have two players with say a swordsman battalion and each sword battalion can be the exact same level but be specced out in two totally different ways.This leads to a lot of fun with building YOUR ideal army rather than some all encompassing army of win that so many RTS games have.Battles: Battles in terms of PVP are done via matchmaking which means you won't generally have to worry about armies many times your strength coming down to slaughter you while the veteran player at their helm laughs at the newbie. DON'T be mistaken though because it is fully possible to have two armies of identical strength rating but with totally different power ratios.This can lead to some unforgiving learning cures where you need to figure out ideal combinations to match your strategy. Do you want quantity or quality do you want an ideal mix of both? Are you a player that can micro manage good enough to have a small crack corps of heroes over an army of regular soldiers? ALL of these options and combinations thereof are waiting for you to figure out.PVE: The PVE options to take and conquer AI cities is fun especially when you get co-op up and running and can work together with other players to take particularly difficult targets.Quest system: The quest system while nothing special allows you to earn some extra money and resources while not having to do the more challenging PVE or potentially unforgiving PvP battles.Opt Out: You can ""pay off"" a player that wants to attack one of your armies or your town so as not to potentially risk losing units you otherwise do not want to lose. This is a good thing as the above mentioned potentially unforgiving early PvP learning curve may cost you questing time/ability.So let's move on to the Bad:Right now you have a few severe bugs that while not game breaking for MOST can become so for the less patient or mature players amongst us. If you get easily frustrated with bugs and don't like having to report them or talk to moderators to get your lost resources/gold/whatever back then at the moment I'd recommend holding off on this game.Can be unforgiving: As stated with the battles section of ""the good"" this game can be VERY unforgiving when you lose a battle since this is a persistent world those losses are for good and some players might take days to rebuild from the loss of their core army. While most of the community is currently rather friendly and often willing to help new players with tips and tricks on how to get your economy up and running the early losses that players WILL suffer can sometimes be a little spirit breaking until you figure out how to create newer better armies and get a solid economy running.So lets move on to the ""Needs improvement"":So far the idea that the game is ""pay to win"" can kind of seem like a thing for new players because of the way crowns work and how slowly they come in for a new player.In truth I think the crown price of some units could afford to be lowered but this is personal preference.There are bugs that definitely need to be sorted out before this game can be a 10/10 and some of the promised features need to be implemented such as the naval options and the like before I can say this game is truly what the developers advertise.So for now at it's current stage I have to give this a 8/10 because it is not really ""feature complete"". There are bugs some of which can ruin an impatient/less mature player's experience. On the flip side the devs/moderators are extremely active and very willing to help people with any losses they've suffered and for such a small team (6 developers) they are fairly active in attempting to patch and bring this game up to a full 10/10.

												Kingom Wars is, now, one of my favorite games. It let's you mix your long-time strategy such as (building, recruiting and reaserching) with your real time strategy (battles, questing and teaming up with others in co-op or PvP).I have for an long time searched for a game with this concept where you control the whole picture and not only the tiny battlefield OR an entire nations economy and army-positionings, but both!I have played the game for over an month, and for each update it's becoming better and better. The last updates have been really good improvments and I'm sure that is just the start. You might thinkt that the game has become an ""pay-2-win"" game since it's free now, but as far as I can see, that is not the case. Sure you can speed up things for money or buy some ""dragon pack"" where you get a dragon or something. BUT! It doesn't ruin the game, at least not for the other players (I haven't bought anything and I feel that I'm on the same terms as anyone I've met). If you're a strategy fan, as me, then I deeply reccomend that you'll at least test the game. The more people playing it, the more action-packed it gets!// Mr.Page			"

												I find the game quite enjoyable. You manage a small village which, slowly, grows to metropolis. You have to decide on whats best for your village, paying off bandits, or deciding where to build the new blacksmith. The town is tailored to your design, be ye human, filthy orc, or hippy elf. The games graphics are pretty good considering the amount of individual units  each moving. You can see it at its best in the environmental changes, the winter was nice thing to in the game, although not for my peasants who were unable to plow the fields. Although the game does have its fair share of bugs mostly in the ai. The most notable were my peasants choosing to drop resources at my keep instead of a cart which was right next to them, and a dragon swarmed by footmen trying to attack my dragon slayer in the back stuck and not attempting to attack anything else. My least favorite thing about the game is the fact that you have pay money in order to have additional towns with a different race. It saddens me that i can't even try out another race without paying 5 $ or deleting my first town, im fine that you can buy boosters (Its not pay to win, you are matched against players with equal army strength) but atleast let me try the other races.Overall a fun free game 8.5/10			"

												kingdom wars has changed so much from when it started, but it was a good change . Though there are minor issues that i have with the game such as you have to pay so many crowns for special units and storage for your hometown is limited to the number of slots(human),trees(elves) and space(orcs)you have available to you. the up side however is that u have to use your brain when playing its not about biulding a giant army and destroying everything in site its about the future of the race you belong and every choice you make effects the outcome of wether you are going to win or lose the war against the other races.Another upside to the game is that you can help other players out i have friends who play this game that always get stuck on missions but because we always play online together we can help each other out when things get hard . Overall kingdom wars is brilliant game for people who like challenge but it easy enough that everybody can enjoy it.			"

												The game is very easy to get into. It's almost like you're typical RTS game. The visuals aren't the best, but the game makes it up in gameplay itself. I wish it would have been more expanded however, on races perhaps, a bigger world, and not so many bugs. While the game is (from what i've heard) a work in progress, I would hope they will fix these issues in the future. Otherwise, a very good game to play everyday. I highly recommend it to people who like strategizing and working with other players to conquer cities and gain loot.			"

												Sat through the tutorial and thought it'd be a lot of fun. The UI was so bad that I spent two more minutes in game and then quit. It literally pained me to play. Sorry, I wanted to give it a go, but this game's legitimately awful to play because of its UI.			"

												To be clear, the game is free; payment only gives you access to two one-use-only-ever chests of resources which you don't need one bit. There are also a couple DLCs, but if you look at development/patch notes you realise the vanilla game is rich and you won't want to pay for the stupid DLCs even into late game (e.g. there's a SP-only dlc - for the incompetent only). Please read on.3 races to choose from. Build your city, your army, your garrison, whatever labour forces you may want. Two very important factors that I find separate this game from those you may think this is similar to (involving MMO strategy games with building a settlement):1) You can't be attacked when offline. If you're not logged in and playing, you can't be attacked - meaning you don't need to worry or dedicate ANY time to this game. (You also have a cancellable 24hr-game-time-only battle protection for noobs, after which you'll have a great base. Additionally, battles are always between similar-strength forces).2) Your buildings can't be destroyed beyond 1% health. No conflict you will ever have will reset your city. Your buildings will be repaired over time and you'll just lose a token amount of resources, from what I understand you'll even get a few crowns (useful for upgrades or renaming units etc).I recommend, if you have any interest in a forgiving MMO RTS game with visual battles and really quite rich content, you should download and try a couple of the races. Read the descriptions to see what you'd be interested in and have a go. Just be wise on how you spend your crowns in the beginning as they're earned through quests (story line), battles, daily-gift of 1 crown if you login and trading in gold. P.S. you will want to make gold one of your primary mining operations, because if you shop around at some NPC towns/cities, you can usually buy more than 100 of any resource with 100 gold.I first tried the orcs (about 8 hrs), which I liked but I didn't do very well with.. Then I went to try the elves (now 14 hrs) and I love them. I don't get to design my city layout because we build in trees... but it's fun enough. Check out some of my woodelf screenshots.			"

												I love this game. Within two days I have managed to clock in about 9 hours. I like how you are able to build your city while, doing trade and going to war. I am still in Protection mode which lasts for a day. It helps teach you as you go if you don't want to do the training. You don't have to worry about leveling up. When you stop playing your time stops aswel, instead of you leaving and coming back two days later to your town totally destoryed. The graphics aren't bad at all and you even get to pick your race and which area you wish to start in.			"

												To be honest here the game has quite a lot of problems, mostly with the units pathfinding and overall grind to get enough resources or crowns to build important buildings or even stone walls which kinda killed it for me a little but the combat can be very interesting. When it comes to the combat it can be a real challange at first, not so much because of the pathfinding for me though, but because the AI's are able to move more units then you can to specific spots. But thats the fun about it, you can easily out take out the AI if you do things right but sometimes you can easily screw up and lose a bunch of units, which to me is fine again, forcing the player to think about how to go about it without losing every soldier they gained. Not to mention that the game dev's are constintly at work to fix many of the problems that are poping up, they are very aware of the situation that the game is in but are having trouble fixing them due to a recent failure going to NW2 which caused a few problems as mentioned in the recent updates section. Many people say that it isent working but to be honest once more I have a feeling that they just are trying to be trolls cause I have one of thee 2nd worst gaming laptops in my house and it runs very smoothly after I adjust the graphics. Lastly overall the graphics bring me back to my childhood days of gaming, like I said above this resembles Battle for Middle Earth quite alot in the way of graphics but I am by far fine with that, I never was a stickler when it came to things like that, just so long as the models arent sticks flouting around. Overall to me this has so far been a great experience and might even put a bit of money into it just to possibly get the starter pack or something mostly to support the dev's and because I feel like throwing money in their faces, lol. I may add more to this review wether bad or good over the coarse of the next few months and I am planing to deffinitly play this over thanksgiving, so things may change but my opinion of the game will never change, epecially since this is a newly made game, were anything could happen....and yes 3-4 years old is still considered new to me considering ages for other games.

												This is not worth your time, at first glance a ""MMORTS"" sounds fun. But there are huge problems with pathfinding, ever see a army you spent hours building up walk into siege fire and die? this game will do it. most of your battles will be farming the same area of the map repeatedly for ""crowns"" a currency you can farm or buy from the shop. I spent two days building an army and had no way to get any more crowns, the minimap in your battles is horrendous and isnt even working in real time, it ♥♥♥♥ing updates off of refreshes every couple of seconds. the graphics are so poor you sometimes cant pick out smaller units from the terrain. I dont even know how to structure all of the problems. If it was one or two big things fine, its an indie dev. But there are so many small things wrong with the game that the act of playing the game forces you into a battle with the game itself, you have to fight the bad game design to play this. and thats a real shame, i want to love it.

												Greetings steam comunity,5cents on why this game is recommendet by me and why you should waste a part of youre precious livetime playing it.First of all - why should one play it?- its fun- its free- its got castels- its got dragons (some of them slightly three headed)- its got mad magics- its not a pay2winTo give this a more serious aproach - the pro stuff:+ The game is a fine mixed castle building, army training and stuff wrecking experience(, a little of what i wanted as a stronghold fan :) ).+ Three playable races - elves, man and orcs.+ The gameplay of the battles is well done. Whyle the overal controling mechanism is rather simple one may invest some energy into the micromanagement of unit stances and rotations to gain the best from the troops efforts.+/- The castle is limited to a few number of designs and placement spots - which are nicely done to alow the player a rather wide range of tactical options.+ The Armys consist of up to 60 units, including sige engines and workers to get all those shiny coins from the corpses. As the units gain experience they may be upgradet to fit the players needs.+ The KI citys are chalanging and differ greatly in theyr designs+ The pvp system seems promising, presenting some late game challange, interesting battles and army compositions and the rather easy and fair mechanics of avoiding it by paying a part of ones ressources to the attacker.+ The overal unit ballancing seems to be sound and while its not perfect the developers are working to improve it.+ The comunity is alive and quite friendly.To play it is a little like....One may upgrade his camp to a formidable stronghold. While the walls rise high the troops may march to complete the first quests and plunder some stuff on the way. By doing so one aquires the in game currency of crowns - and even if there is a rather great heap of those in the in game store, the number one may get there is limited.In time the army will get experienced and gain enough power to take on the great citys of the world. The choice between looting a vanquished city or taking it on as a vassal is rather rewarding - more so if you just managed to gain a victory inside the walls of the capital :).On the dark side ther are a few things to be said:- The KI is just not up to the task. While the unit KI is ok with only some minor *whydoyoustupidhealersengagetheogersinmeeleagain >.<* kind of problems the KI troops on the battlefield remain stationary until engaged, most of the time. Most of the movements an enemy will do are rushing his remaining troops into the keep, if you break don its gate, and some counter charges if this gate did not belong to the keep. The odd exeption is a charge of the reinforcement troop. Those apear after half an hoer into a KI sige and are pathetically easy to block, by disengaging your troops from the city and mincing the reinforcements. - The ballancing of the fractions is not finished yet. The orc race seems to be a little on the downside, in the overal army performance.- There are few end game challanges out of pvp matches. If one has put some thought into the army composition and the upgrading of ones troops there will be next to nothing left to stop this army.-/+ The game is still in the making. While not essentialy bad, one may get slightly annoied by a few bugs and gliitches. Also ive experienced two mayor bugs up until now, of the *dude where is my castle?* kind. On the other hand: those where solved in a matter of one or two days and the mods did theyr best to recompensate the losses. Also one may hope to see some further improvements to the gameplay and some more content to come.oh, and cookies, because.... you know....In summa summarum i recommend this game.Hope to see you (try) torching my city some time :),best regards, Cyraion.

												An excellent game overall, that will immerse most RTS players for at least a good few hours.Its fairly simple, with a very traditional setup of the three factions with strenghts and weaknesses. such as the Humans being the most durable overall, the Elves essentially having the strongest units but with greater weaknesses, and the Orcs being oddly enough the most frail but boasting the ability to quickly amass an army of considerable size at reduced cost.(Please note: This is more of a quick run-down of some of the features in the game, than an review. The idea is that you can more effectively decide if its features appeals to you, rather than read someone trash n praise it)Leveling up your units!:This game relies quite heavily on the concept of your troops not simply being something you purchase enough of, in the right combination but actually take into skirmishes to level up or train at friendly strongholds, to then tailor suit what stats you want to improve, such as more health, damage mitigation, health regeneration, stamina, and so on. Eventually you will pretty much max out all the stats but at that point you have spend quite a lot of gold on that unit, and considering its still very likely to get inconveniently killed while you look the other way you learn to pay special heed to keeping your investments alive and well protected. Special Units:Every faction has an array of faction specific units available to them, but theres also a common pool of special units available to all the factions. These units have roots in all three main factions, but theres also units from unplayable races, such as Dragons and Dwarves. These units almost always costs you Crowns, which is a measure of wealth and influence that you can spend on recruiting considerably attractive units to attack your enemies or defend your homeland.Quest line:Theres an rather involved lore in the game, and its often very nicely attached to the characters you interact with while playing the main quest line. As you go through the main quest of your faction your tasked with defending your homeland, your kingdom, and waging war against the two other factions in the game, and often also your own. Due to the somewhat sandbox-like nature of the game, the senarios you find yourself in is often rather interesting and gradually gives you useful rewards that greatly benefit the construction of your homeland, giving a smooth progression of your homeland, the story of the game, and your involvement in the game overall.Traits and RegionsIn the MMO portion of the game, after choosing a faction you will be asked to choose a region and two traits.These are important and should be chosen to match how you prefer to play the game. If your a ""turtle"" and enjoys defensive gameplay then naturally you may want to choose the most defensive region and traits, but if your more into siege and conquest than naturally you would do well to take a region that reflects that better.Either way, your choice of region and traits will play an immense factor in the performance of your strategies.Choose wisely. :)Non-Mandatory PvPIn the online MMO portion of the game you may be attacked by enemies at any time, but you need to actually accept the battle. Should you choose not to, or let the timer run out you will forfeit a small portion of your resources as a tribute to be left alone. Even if no resources are available fighting PvP is never mandatory. As you start out with a new homeland you will have 24 hours of real time protection against PvP attacks to get you started. Notice that this time is only ticking while your in-game. Additionally, every time you pay a tribute or conclude a PvP match you will be given a small PvP Protection time.It is also possible to purchase PvP protection for Crowns.The graphics, performance, and the gameplay itself have gradually improved over time, with updates coming out frequently enough for a game you only pay for once. (Not including the micro transaction-like boosts available in the market, and additional features) The gameplay in singleplayer, whether in the online MMO world or not, is very stable but once you have an actual fight not against the AI, but another player it soon becomes a bit of a mess.(This includes co-op aswell) Reasonably playable, yes, but still very annoying at times. However, they have worked hard to improve this game and the future update expected to come out this month, which will apperantly overhaul the entire thing onto a more stable engine will hopefully bring back much of the player base and thus hopefully bring some more life back into this, in all honesty, very awesome game.(If you wish to know more details about the game, i have found a wiki with more details for you)http://strategywiki.org/wiki/Dawn_of_FantasyYes, it does have some problems now and then but this game does deserve a chance if it calls out to you in general.Regards,Brandt.

												I've played for almost 7 hours and still don't have an army big enough to lay siege to another town, making for a boring experience. (The ""Very Easy"" opponent is still twice as strong as my army.) Starting out, resource-gathering is agonizingly slow. The UI is a mess; there are actually elements that overlap, and some elements aren't explained, so I don't even know what clicking on them does. Certain resources, like deers for elves, you can't count, or delete, but there is apparently a limit on how many you should create. The graphics are low quality, even on max settings. At times, it is difficult to actually see what I'm looking at.I've been an RTS gamer since the original AOE and SC. I've played Total War, Stronghold, C&C, Empire Earth, etc. I love the genre, and I love the concept that the developers are trying to implement with this game, but it's just very unenjoyable to play, even though I really wanted to like this game.

												Kingwom Wars I still remember my thrill when I heard about this game being released. If I had to explain this game in one sentence it would be: The game is like Travian, Tribal Wars, ... but in real time 3D RTS mode.I have little play time on steam, that is because steam release was buggy at start, it payed off more to play using official launcher, meaning not using steam. The gameplay is simple, you start with a town which you upgrade. It has no deep depth of techology, it is rather simple and straight forward. You do not even need super strong economy to get decent army. I mostly play Elfs since I find their economy and troops most suitable to me (Archers :) ). Game has single player and multiplayer side which do no differ too much. You can play singleplayer offline with no problems, multiplayer gets you closer to other players. Multiplyer is same as singleplayer but you can go into CO-OP battles with other players, either with or against them. Maximum players inbattle are 2v2, which is kinda limiting. Guild/Clan/Alliance has meaning in terms helping each other during attacks. Game itself looks like Total wars series where troops and cities are managed on global map, while battle itself is in spirit of total war series where 2 armies clash. Combat system is same as with total war series archers(mounted, foot, crossbows), infantry(heavy knights, pikemen, swordsmen), cavalry (one type mounted knight, elfs have mounted archers), monsters with orcs etc. Each unit formation could lvl till 20 and had stat points for you to manually upgrade which provides decent ammount of depth. Each unit type has its special skills, where some have to be researched using crows, which are acquired with battles and quests. At start it was that simple, during time game developers kept close contact with comunity and invested great time to fixing bugs and providing new content. At release time game was once time purchase, now it is free to play model with premium. New content added mages, dragons, dwarfs, new heroes/special units, sieges but for all of it you need massive ammount of crowns which arent easy to get. There are also some bugs where you spend 250 crowns, but s*it happens, server reverses your upgrade and town state and u lose 250 crowns which finally made me quit game. Game itself is fun and worth playing, developers are moving forward and wont forsake the game, but KW2 is comming and you can feel that they are more focused on that release. Have fun it is nice game.			"

												Hi.   Ok, I'm a newb, just a few hours played.   Look at it this way, I have over 50 games in steam, haven't played more than a day in most of them, this one, I'm on my 3rd day.  I like the art.  I like having quests mainly because I'm retired and old and don't want to think too much.  I seem to have a little trouble with losing workers somewhere and haven't figured how to find them yet.  I'd like more tooltips with more info, I'd like to pause without logging out if no one's attacking me.... just because going pee (I'm old, it takes a while and often) and you come back and whatever you killed quest-wise has resurrected (it took me a while to figure out you gotta finish any quests you start before logging out, I was thinking I was having a senior moment and never really did what I thought I did -- which is scary)  I do feel like I need LOTS more direction and explaination.  Any way to move that chat box?  I like to listen in but it's in the way.The music is nice but I find myself nodding off.  This little box is filling up.  Oh, soon I'll be vulnerable... does a guy joining this late have a chance of survival if attacked?  lbattros@hotmail.com.			"

												I have been playing this game for a few days, and im still groing my army and building my stronghold. this game is great, its not asking you the buy anything to be able to level up, all u have to do is play. There are so many options, carathors, great strategy game that make you think about how to best beat your oponents, I would love to see in the future more costomization and more upgradable options. been able to take part of the battle as your own heror in a first person action, controling your army while being part of it. been able to slash down your opponents, would be a great add on.I would also love to see the building improving as the building are being upgraded.More choice to upgrade armors and weapons.With all that said, this games is unique, i have played so many socalled free to play game, and after a while u have to pay to get upgrades, but not this game. when they said free to play this really is a for the people game.Keep up the good work, and never stop inproving, and i will keep playing. Also recomend this game to all those that love strategy game with a medieval team with men, orc, elfs, dragons, and so much more it would take me all night to describes, just download this game and see for yourself why this game is not like any others.ThanksYann			"

												Kingdom Wars is a very unique and addictive MMORTS. You attack, defend, and manage a kindom with the option of three playable races each differning in their own unique ways. You start off with a simple kingdom, but in time it can easily grow and prosper into a epic empire. It is not a pay to win type of game either. With both time and skill you can easily succed in this game. I definatly recommend to strategic players.			"

												Having played several ""free to play"" games, this one actually delivers on not needing to pay to win. The in-game currency called ""crowns"" is obtained through multiple ways from questing to pvp. With premium, gains are doubled but even without a player can amass wealth from sieges and quests in a matter of two or three hours. City management is simple and straightforward as resources are close at hand and placement of buildings is set by building plots scattered around the landscape. Time and crowns are all that is really needed to construct a powerful castle and the time goes by quickly as you fight to gain crowns. There are a diverse number of troops to choose from. Recruitment can include the troops of your own race as well as mercenaries when camping in foreign lands and dwarves and beasts from special buildings. Only three playable races are available: elves, orcs, and humans. Hopefully dwarves will be added in the future and possibly dragons (please). Battles and troop management are split between the world map and specific battlegrounds and are fairly easy to grasp. The only complaint towards troops in battle is their refusal to listen to certain orders. When you send cavalry in to feint an enemy into charging and the cavalry doesn't retreat when you tell them to, your strategy gets ruined and you are forced to en masse charge or risk losing part of your army. Aside from the troop command issue, the game is both fun and addicting as one could spend hours trying to earn crowns, conquer cities, and improve his/her own. Coupled with the game actually being fair and not requiring real money to be good, I would recommend it to any seeking a fun, free-to-play strategy game.			"

												I have been playing Kingdom Wars on and off for a while now.  With the recent launch of their Free to Play experience I've spent the last few days catching up on all the changes.Game Details:This is a long term City Building Game with a RTS Campaign Map / Battlefield Map with PvE and PvP aspects. City Building:- This plays like any resource cap / population cap / building plot game.- You establish an economy of food / wood / stone and gold.- You use these resources (along with renown) to build better buildings / defenses and units.- You also upgrade your technology and other improvements. Campaign Map:- The map has the 3 racial zones along with NPC and Endgame Zones.- Here you move your armies around which open up the various gameplay elements.- You can trade by actually loading up an army with transports and resources/currency and moving them to an NPC town you would like to trade with.  Each town opens up to you as you advance your influence.- You can also battle the NPC towns and make them 'vassals' of your main town.- You can enter open world combat (instanced random map based on your location) along with building various camps to provide a defensive start to these combat areas.- The map does not show the thousands of other player cities, however you can engage in PvP matches or sieges. Battle Map:- Here is where you (in real time) engage in troop movements and combat.- This plays like a simplified Total War game with basic unit based formations.- The actual units themselves have a bit more complexity and individuality due to ranks and the way you can upgrade them.Review:Overall this is a fun, laid back type of game that you can log in for a few minutes or hours and feel accomplished. City Building:- I like the graphics, turned all the way up there are some nice lighting and textures.  This is not 'the best looking' game, however they have done well enough to keep immersion.  My only complaint is with how they implemented lightning during storms.- The plots are pre planed (so you build walls, and they show up where the walls should go).  You do get some choice in where to build specific buildings, but you still must choose predefined locations.  This took some getting used to and I'm not sure that I like it. Orcs can build anywhere if this is your thing.- The three races give distinct city building and resource gathering flavors.  With that said there are more than 1 way to acquire any of the required resources.  I like this.- City building is a long term game.  Things continue when you are logged off; and once you've spent your resources for the day there is little left to do here.  This is great for the quick maintenance fix it seems I have with games.- This quick logon goes well with daily booster rewards. World Map:- I like the style of the world map.  The art flavor for the different zones makes it easy to tell what area you are looking at.  With that said, the map is smaller than I would like.- I also think they got the army movement speed right, where it is not instant; giving you a sense of distance; while not taking forever and a day to cross the map.- Beyond that, not much to say about the world map.  It provides access to the game functions. Battle Map:- I really enjoy that you can take an army out, go to a zone that has whatever you like to fight, and then engage in whatever type of combat that you like.  This gives the 30+ minute gameplay angle.- You can decide to farm if that is your thing (resources, experience, even units).- The rock / paper / scissors unit types work well.  There is enough variety that you can get the gameplay you enjoy.- I wish that grouped units had more formation control.- Since you can upgrade specific aspects (such as resistance) of the units you have, you can create shock troops or a tanky army.  I like the variety.No pvp comments as I've not gotten there yet.			"

												I highly recommend this game to anyone who is into medieval things or just all out war. There are still a few glitches though. Sometimes when I do sieges on quests, or on pvp battles the gate is obviously down but my units just walk straight on in.... Also, there should be a rotate camera angle option because sometimes you're in a  siege and the gate is in just the wrong place and you can't click on it to send your battering rams to crush it. The walls and technologies are WAYYYYYYYYYYYY to expensive. I have like 10 crowns and it says Castle Upgrade 222000000000099999123344556 crowns and it's like WHATTT? But, yeah great game and super addictive PLAY IT NOW.			"

												This is by far one of the games that you're looking for, if you're on real time strategy games, immersive gameplay also really fun to play, the first hours might be rough for some people, but you can enjoy everything about it, there are 3 races with plenty of strength and weakness (humans, elves and orcs, pretty nice people that always help you and they are fun to chat with, it's an awesome community, it's not a pay to win game... it's more like a learn to play and win game, you can't be bullied by people more powerful than you, they have a pretty balance pvp system, there's something here that you can't find in any other game and makes it great and kinda addictive, also pretty good moderators, i recommend this game, for new players and for veterans, because of the always challenging gameplay, build your village, establish an economy, build your army, rise an stronghold, siege cities, upgrade your armies, get dragons, tame/kill ogres, kill demn unicorns, burn orc villages, burn trents and their sacred elf woods, burn human cities, actually burn and kill everything that moves or not, and loot their bodies, because why not?, you won't regret it			"

												An excellent game worth your time. Most of these types of games will seduce you into playing for a while with good graphics and cooling looking stuff that you want to get, only to find out that you need to pay to get pretty much anything. Not this game. They've specifically built it so you can't pay to win like most of these types of games (*cough *cough clash of clans *cough *cough). If you hate starting to play a game and then finding out that you need to pay to get anything good like me, I highly recommend this game.			"

												I noticed that a lot of people are not recommending this game because of the feature, ""Pay to win"", is in the game but that is entirely optional. You don't have to pay. You only pay for the game with everything in it. Nothing forces you to pay. Not sure if that feature is still in the game though.Also I saw one review saying that you have to join the game by signing up on their website. That is not true although You have to register ingame and then receive an confirmation email for you to complete the registeration. This process do not take more than two minutes. You are required to do this in order to play the game online with friends and others. That's it.Anyway my review...Overall and ongoing, it is a fun game. I enjoy playing against AIs enemies as well as players whilst doing the storyline. I use the term, storyline, very loosely because it is almost very direct but you can do the quests whenever and in your own time. Yes, the game can and should have been better than what it is at the moment but I don't complain because it is a decent game.However it can be ugly due to cutscenes when you have conversations with some certain characters in the ""storyline."" The characters, by looking very closely, they look like they came from 90s games like Castle Strike or the old Warcraft series unless I forget to improve the graphics in the settings lol but that is manageable anyway because you don't look that closely often.Overall, I would say this is 7/10. Better than some games but could have been better.			"

												When you seige a city in the game and win, you are given the option of making the city yours or looting it. Considering how long it takes to win one of these seiges, this one in particular took 2 hours, I was unbelievably annoyed when an announcement popped up in place of the message giving you the option of either making the city yours or looting it. This is not the first time either. Do not download this game. It will make you pull your hair out			"

												I have follwed this title since beta, I pre ordered the game and played it on off for years. It was the first true mmorts in my eyes, the dream of a persistant age of empires game or similar really came true here.During the transition to Steam I lost my account so I decided to start again on here as a free to play.I can honestly say from having a paid account I have managed to reach exactly where I was before for free. there are no pay walls or timers to get around. Most of the paid stuff is cosmentic however given the poor visuals it doesn't look great.Pro's: Gameplay, the feeling of laying siege to a town and carefully planning your strategy is great. This game is for the slow methodical players, rush competitive gamers will find it lacking.Con's: Graphically dated and the interface is really clumsy!			"

												I've been looking for a game that melds a lot of features from some of my favourite strategy games into an online environment, a game that is set aside from others within the same genre, and this really is it. The game is not pay to win and is paced really well, it's not slow nor is it fast, you really feel rewarded from what you receive through the steady rate of progression. The quests help to push you in the right direction while you're starting out, and after just a few hours you'll be making some really steady progress toward the more end-game options. Positives: As mentioned previously, the game is not pay to win, finding a game like this that is both enjoyable, f2p, and not pay to win seems to be the gaming equivalent of finding gold in your back garden, for this I am very grateful. You have several different options in terms of how you would like to play the game, do you want to be economically focused, do you want to focus on military, etc; this kind of choice makes the game strategically diverse and allows you to shape how you want to play the game, and I felt that this made the game far more enjoyable, especially if you play with friends and work together by taking up different roles.Negatives: The game is a little buggy right now, and performance can vary. While trying to use the windowed mode feature I found my game crashing very frequently, and I ultimately had to disable that option. I also got stuck in one of the tutorials while trying to access the menu. So the game is definitely in need of some polish. Combat could also do with some work; the current system gets the job done but is quite clunky and very messy. You send your units in and then sit back and hope for the best. Of course the graphics are quite basic but they are bearable, a slight overhaul would be a nice quality of life improvement. A little more direction for players completely new to the genre would also be very useful. Overall, from my gameplay experience and from the masses of reading I've done about the game, I think it's great and absolutely worth a try. The developers are keen on improving the game and are asking for feedback whenever possible, which really tells me they have their head in the right place.			"

												Rating: 9/10Pros:-Works like a Facebook game, you can log out with peace of mind knowing that players cannot attack you unless you are online. And you get rewarded for daily log-ins!-If you are a rich and prosperping player, you might be able to pay them off with gold or stone, etc.-Feels like Stronghold - but without the pesky tasks of ""cleaning up gong"" or ""peseants stealing from our granery sire"" -Mobile armies: You can build a force and level them through campsites and taking on enemies in the wilderness around you, making you stronger and your units stronger for battles to come.-Well designed lore of castles and beautiful landscapes.-No ""PayToWin"": As they say in the news on the game ""this game is designed to avoid the pitfalls of FreeToPlay games....focusing more on skill and persistance than bigger wallets""Cons:-Very wonky (slow) combat. You have to make sure you units don`t get stuck and cluttered as they will get moved over by the smallest force if you`re not careful.-Co-op is not as smooth as I had hoped, while you can send supplies to your friend, getting them to play with you to aid in a quest or seige is a bit frustraing if you dont pay close attention to what you are selecting.-Npc workers [peasants, etc] tend to get stuck up in hills or behiind fences when chopping down trees. -The initial title screen has very LOUD audio - first tiime players make sure your audio is turned down some or your ears will get blasted away. While this is epic sounding, if any player has their volume up they might get quite a surpize once the tittle screen loads.-Slow loading screens between transitions. [ While this really isn`t a *con* it can be annoying waiting for that bar to load up when there is little to nothing in your home city to load ] Another transition issue is between begining to seige and actually entering the seige. These problems are on and off, and while I havea solid internet this *may* vary between players. Overall this game as great potential to kick out Stronghold and its gong-infested cities and brings forth a potential for a shining sheild in castle-sim-like games. "

												This game was AWESOME !!! At 1st on how I found this game is, I am just finding for a Free-2-Play games and when I saw the Cover of the game and its Trailer, and its AWESOME THRILLING MUSIC in the Trailer !!! It reminded me of Lord of the Rings, so i downloaded it, the game was GREAT !!! The Graphics on ""Low"" is kinda bad but the game was AWESOME ! It's like Total War, but Total War never shows its awesome growing base on LIVE not like on KW !! And the Changing weather effects in the Game ? Like Snow, Raining, Storm, etc... KINDA AWESOME !! And watching your town growing, your peasants working, your laborers making stuffs and something like that, It's a mixed Strategy Game ! And  the best part they've done in the game is, they made it F2P (Free2Play), I've been playing for 16+ Hours because it's kinda Addictive, if You're a Strategic game fan i don't know if you're gonna like this game or not, but to me, It's Awesome... Anyways my vote to this game is 10/10 :D It's just so Fantastic...			"

												Kingdom wars is an Innovative kingdom builder.  I like the economic system, the more peasants you have working the fields, the more resources you get.  There are also upgrades for said peasants to make them more efficient, as well as upgrades for your military.  I like the fact that you don't need real cash to make crowns, which you get by completing missions, reaching accomplishment milestones or trading for gold in the game.  Trading is probably the fastest way to make gold in game, as you can create an army with a few horse carts and peasants to carry goods to market, plus add farm animals to the army to sell those in different cities.       Creating an army is easy enough, just need to go to the world map.  You pick the units you want in it, military, peasants, animals and send it on it's way.  The combat leaves a bit to be desired, I think the AI needs a bit of work, as I leave my force sttationary, send a unit of archers up to snipe at the enemy.  As soon as the enemy starts moving toward my army, I run them back and wait for the slaughter, as the enemy only sends in a few units without archer support.  After their melee units are dispatched, rinse and repeat on their archer units, who blindly follow into oblivion.  Send in the peasants to clean up the corpses and you get a nice bit of loot.  I also like the wide variety of units allowed in the game, the fact that you don't need to worry about using real money to buy the better units, as they cost resources and crowns and are available to everyone.     I haven't gotten to build up my castle yet, as I have been concentration on my economic upgrades, but from what I've seen, it really looks worth building a castle as soon as you can afford the crowns, stone and/or wood for it.  I haven't tried siege warfare yet either, so I really have no knowledge of it other than the turtorial I played.       Overall, I find the game a lot of fun, it's a kingdom builder that really allows you to build a kingdom.  You have diplomacy to ally yourself with npc's or other players, forming guilds/clans.  It is an awesome experience. "

												The game starts off with you and your hero in a humble little town that you have just aquired. You are given quests that you can follow for rewards, and get you familiarized with the game. In the beginning you are placed in a status with a timer that counts down, and after the amount of ingame hours expire you can now be attacked by armies of relatively the same strength as your own        Or       You can avoid the quests, try and build your army and city your own way, go on the march, start pvp by turning off the protective status mode, going on a coop raid of a city. Whatever you decide to do, the beginning may feel a little harsh because the gathering process feels really slow until you get everything rolling. Your units keep gathering resources while you are offline and there are daily rewards mailed to your in-game bank.The game has a sort of ""Knights of Honor"" and ""Warcraft 3"" feel to it. KOH because: There are some diplomacy aspects that can be done with the NPC cities like giving gifts and trading with them to improve relations. NPC cities that you defeat can either be looted for additional resources or placed into vassalage under your command and there are alliances that can be made with other players. When fighting you go into  a zoomed in view where you command you units in the field, give them direct orders of where to attack, what types of formations to use, as well as special abilities that each unit may have. Units can be hot keyed 1-9 on the battlefield to make it easier to bounce between your units. What I like, is that you can mix and match your army for some variety, like taming ogres, or hiring other races as mercenaries to fight for you. There is alot of building that needs to be done to improve your cities defense, offensive capabilites, resource gathering and storage. The buildings also have upgrades on them that can give your units bonuses. There is a population cap in your city depending on the number of houses you build, and different units require different amounts of population requirements, like a dragon requires 10 open slots while knights or archers require 1 slot. You gain veterancy on your units, the more they fight and survive the more levels they will earn. Every level awards 3 points to spend on attack, defense, health cap, stamina cap, or health regen.Warcraft 3 because: As a Realtime strategy that is going on, you have peasant type gatherers, melee units that focus on slashing, crushing and piercing damage. Ranged piercing damage that can be done by archers, there are elite units that you can make like the: tribal shaman, high knight, wizards, multiple types of dragons, while all expensive units to buy, if they fall in battle they will not disappear like a regular unit would. they will just be unavailable till the end of the fight, and then be back in your army again with low health and acouple of veterancy levels lost as a death penalty.The three races you can play as are:Orcs (can build goblin units), Elves (wood elf and high elf) and Humans (can build dwarven units).They all have differences about them, like the range of archers, the defense and offense of melee units, special abilities like heals, hiding and beserk. It all puts a little spin on which race you decide to use.This game is free to play, with a sort of booster shop available in game. You can get the boosters if you want, it will help you get to a more advanced city status quicker, but has a 1 time purchase ability for your city. Its not necessary in order to be competitive or anything like that, it just gives you some gold, and some exta crowns that are required to upgrade some buildings and build advanced strucures and units. You earn the crowns from fights and quests, but the booster and the ""premium"" status you can pay for will give you some bonus rewards, again not necessary, just available if your the type that has no patience and wants to try and speed things along.Pros:The game as it stands right now is a tremendous amount of fun for me. There is a pretty active community and I like how the story and questing is going, the random coop sieges, the quest battle requests, and the occasional invading enemy army that I either buy off to leave me alone for a while or engage. Different playstyles for different people can be tried out in the skirmish mode. Its like fighting with your army and trying out different tactics without the consequences of losing them in a fight by trying something different. Like I have fought with someone that had an army the same strength as mine but he used only ogres, another used all cavalry sprinkled with some archers. Infantry with cannons. Minotaurs with trebuchets, you name it, alot of variety in what you can use. I like how it only faces you against people that have around the same strength, so your not getting beat down on by the people that have been playing longer than you have. The moderators, like the game masters are always in the chat channel, and can be asked questions anytime in the help channel. They'll offer advice on questions you may have about using units, and suggestions if something with the game is working properly.Cons:The game can seem slow in the beginning. It is meticulous with alot of micromanaging that needs to be done, both in battle and in your town. Building up the wealth required to buy some of the units can be difficult in the beginning of the game if you dont follow the quest line. There have been afew issues that I have seen in chat channel about some people losing some units from their army after the last update, but the Mods have been helping people out. The zoomed in quest giver view, like when you see you character up close and personal when he/she in talking to a quest giver, you can see that they dont look so good, I guess there wasn't alot of emphasis on the polish of the quest givers but not a really big deal. There is also some lag when you are doing a coop battle with someone or logging in, you'll see it get choppy for afew seconds before it smooths out.Well I hope this has helped out with Your decision to play this game. If you are a fan of RTS games I would highly recommend this to you. It's free to download and free to play, I go by the name Ish in game so maybe I'll see you there.			"

												This game is a grand exsample on how FB games can work with Rts the building over time and the recruitment time needs along with other parts of the game that other town builder games lack make it entertaining at the lest for when building a massive army. the Rts in the game is also in depth for such a grand F2P game. I recomend others in desire for long term rts or for town builder games as it mixes the two in a mystical and addictive game.			"

												i love this game with a passion. the free to play game that is kingdom wars is bringing back what it means to strategize. this old style game has been done like this many times before but they are not around anymore, the whole mid evil scene died out, but this game is bringing it back old school with knights, castles and seige units. this game is so much different than other games because of one thing, Siege. Nothing is more fun than attacking a castle with a friend. Anyways this is a very fun game, play it hours on end, and very well made :)			"

												I love the game. its like all those king and queen games you want all in one. the army battles are huge, the ai does what its told....sometimes atleast. what problems the game has, which to be rather happy with is very little. is fixed within hours or within days. if you let them know whats wrong they will more than likely fix it. its fun to have a huge castle, ive been playing the good part of a few weeks/a month or two and ive barely scratched the surface. the range of units is great. each has strengths/weaknesses nothing is too overpowerd. there really is no spam this unit you win. seige weapons are innacurate but funny but do a lot of damage and whats cool is they use resources to fire. you get raided and the enemy doesnt bring enough resources then good luck him seiging. ive not been attacked yet and you get free premuim on start aswell as not being attacked for 24 ingame hours. not a day if you play or not. your villagers gather resources even when you are not there. the world map is lovingly huge. there is so much to do. you can play as much as you want. there is always something to do. its not like a game you can just leave running and visit an hour or day. you can just keep playing if you want to. it works both ways. the game is great. i hope to keep playing it as much as possible and as long as i can. the graphics are not top end but everything is shown. everything has good animations and the combat is fun. i hope they make graphics a little better but thats my opinion. its a great great game. those who like stratagy games will love this. there is three races too with there own sub factions. humans can get dwarves and mages to help which is cool and as far as i know each race has there own storyline but is on the global map. its great!! keep up the great work!a few things that could be fixed/improved upon. in my opinion and just general fixes that may or may not be noticed that could be done1: The formations and stances can be set but if you log out and rejoin some auto revert without being told otherwise.2: graphics. but thats just me3: a little bit more info on what formations do but not layed out in a basic format. e.g loose formation makes it harder to hit with arrows but does it decrease things in stats, if so by how much, not simply ""It reduces this. but not say how much"" 4: i would like to see a unit range decal so i know where archers/crossbow men and seige equipment can fire from and where best to place in defence.5. Cycle icons or timers on research and production. there is already a black loading icon but with some research i press the button and its either instant or is researching slowly, either way i cannot tell if its been researched or is researching. maybe grey out the button or say ""researched already"" e.g the mill, irrigation i researched but it still remains there showing the purchase amount but its no longer clickable, ok i know it means its worked but to others they might click it and go...well what now?6: the mouse feels like it lags when clicking things, sometimes it wont select a unit liturally right behind another unit or when you attack they will walk, maybe a toggle run button too but mainly the way the mouse feels. it seems to feel like its lagging when clicking. or you have to multiple click somethings a few times.7:the female hero after leaving the capital then returning will spawn, when it auto walks to the return way point it walks with a broken graphics, looking like its legs are were its arms are and its arms right outwards with the sword pointing outwards.keep up the good work!

												I want to first start out by saying, I have owned this game since beta, So I have been through all the Bugs and junk like most games when they first come out.....Game Review goes down like thisYou can Custom each unit as well as your Castle, different textures armours and how they fight for example you want Knights with tons of Arrow defense and huge hitting power or low hitting power but can heal up super fast. I guess once you lvl up your units it will somewhat blend in as there are caps...Main types of people you can play ORCS, Elfs and Human. I play Human as my main and Orcs... I hate elves!!! It is not a Pay to win game as it has a system to match people up to somewhat equal balance. The graphics are great, now I have a power house machines so I can't really speak if there is lag or Frame rate issues as I get max all the time. The map and fights are pretty dynamic and if you are a Total War fan this might be your game!! It is also a full RTS game no turn base crap which is nice. I have a O.K army with 1 Red Dragon and a few Minotaurs LOVE Minotaurs. Most people have a lot of playing methods. lots of people like Archers and some like things that can run fast and destroy Archers like Minotaurs hehe. Your Kingdom is setup in such a way that if you get a attacked you have a chance to win if you play smart. You will always retain your Castle if you lose and it is pretty easy to fix it back up.  I would suggest playing solo a few matches to see what your base can do and find the weaknesses. There are plenty of people so lvling up makes it easy. You can lvl up really fast so don't think you will be left behind, this games some what take care of that weakness really good. They have units that you can buy with crowns find out what type of fighter you want to be then unless your power...Crowns that word can be scary but like I said this is not a Pay to win game.... So you can earn crowns pretty easy by fighting and doing all the quest... Now I hope the devs still do this, but they are know to give out 100 crowns for just being nice in chat.... or helping others, I have received close to 300 crowns in total over the years. Devs,, they listen for the most part and seem to have a great connection to the chat channels, patches come out pretty quick and all the extra content is free. PS there is a way to have to have a full Dwarf Army very bad ♥♥♥. I have 50% full army now that I am lvling up. Thank for reading my wall of text..... See you out there			"

												The best way to describe this game is by this short sentence: ""Real time strategy meets MMO"".We all know that will be your response.Well yeah .... the question is ... is it good?Short answer: Yes.Long answer: It's complicated.The good:   - it's free   - the tech tree is quite well defined and the progession is not to difficult    - the units have nice upgrades at level up (and yes the units level up), and it makes sense to have a main army that you carefully level up to a good level and have that as the main force in PVP later on   - the map is quite large and you have the possbility to set small strongholds around the home city to further protect yourself   - the game continues when you are not online (this feature is exaclty what I was searching for)   - large armyes   - ok graphicsThe bad:   - it has quite a few bugs(units sometimes walk thru walls, arrws stuck in mid air, garison units that don't fit the wall are shown at ground level outside the walls ... and so on)   - while map exploring the enemy units are always spawned in the same spot and have the same pathway ... some variation would be great   - sometime the game laggs when in battles (I have an ok PC: octacore AMD and r9-290x, and sometimes I do get these laggs)The bonus ( :D ):   - the administrators here respond real quick to any complanints or bugs you findSoooo here comes the grade:     Considering that I have yet to experience all of it and that it's still a young game, I am able to give it a grade of 7.3 out of 10.PS: If at any point I change my oppinion I'll make sure to change this.

												- Is this game fun?- Yes.  Its one of those games were you throw it on for abit, do some stuff then switch it off to come back tomorrow to           more troops, resources, etc. Constant quests will be given so you'll be busy unless you have to siege, which later on you will be doing a lot.  Battles can scale from a small skrimish to full on siege with a wide selection of troops, monsters, war machines, heros, dragons , etc.  Though choosing your battles is the most important because you can be quickly overwhelmed and overrunned.  - Is this bad?- In some areas, yes. Combat is very clunky and fights are one big bloody orgy at most.(Blood for the Blood god!!) That and most units if left unchecked will run around chasing god knows what and probably die. Mostly peasants which you'll be lossing left and right when exploring or fighting. No real tatics in open battles or quests. Just send your army in one direction and loot the dead  as they go.(This isn't Total War guys). It comes down to who has more numbers though the more veterans you have the better for you or it can worst because a high level unit of knights can 3 v 1 and win. Seiges you have to plan or you will loss your army fast and retreating is, at times more costly. So once you start theres no going back. Units only rout during quest's so don't expect units to ♥♥♥♥ themselves when 3 dragons burn down a whole castle.- Factions?- Puny 'umans- Dem pointy ear'd elve boyz.- And da best of all, da Orkz! WAAAAAAAAAAGH!- Is this game pay to win like most MMO's?- No. Its there but IT CAN be avoided completely. Daily rewards can help in some areas depending on what you get. Plus quests often give you tons of loot, crowns, food, troops, etc. The store is there but name one MMO out there that doesn't have a store. Plus if you do want to sink some money into this game it's really cheap. The most expensive thing is about $30 bucks.  Which isn't bad for what you get out of it. - Should I try this?- If you like Fantesy games and city management games, try this. And for ♥♥♥♥ sake this game is free so you're not spending a cent on it. If you liked Stronghold(The orginal, not the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ones) and would like more city management then this a game for you. "

												I saw the video and read up on the game a bit and liked to co-op assist feature online for attack and defense.  Also, I was hoping the game was not as dark as the video, but it's just as dark if not darker for some areas on maps.  The movement of the troops was clunky at best and not based on lag or GPU/CPU/RAM, but just clunky as created.  The UI is very outdated and plain (some games had this 15 years ago).  So for a rerelease = not too good.  Nothing really else stood out as amazing or stand-outish in a way that really grabbed continuing insterest.  The castle building is expected at best.  The one thing in movement that stood out most was the inability to click to move around some objects and not much transparent environment when a unit is behind it; not that units get lost, but in the heat of battle it could make some difference.  The last killer is that there is no Multiplayer really, unless you play with friends.  I saw mainly 1 or 2 online games, but that is about it.  Also, in PvE the A.I. is mediocre at best.I would suggest some other RTS like Stronghold; which is very similar, if not what this game is trying to clone.So unless some changes are made I can't recommend this game.  I was hoping to, but like I said there is nothing really too unique or anything that stands out as great, just expected remakes of this & thats in other games of the Genre.			"

When I was on 32 bit, I watched how much ram the game took before it crashed, it took 1.7 gb ram, and atm as I said I have played for an hour it stayed around 1.5-1.6 without crashing an extra GB of ram makes wonders lol.

												Well personaly i found that the bugs runed it for me, yes there is decent gameplay, but there is more.How anoying can these bugs be? let me give you example. i was raiding a NPC castle. a few units were sent to deal with the artchers on the wall. NORMALY they dont stand a chance, untill a stone tripper (a wall defence ment to drop stones of foes) turns around and beats the S### out of my units, understand, it should only hit you onece, and not on the walls, it has one ammo which means one attack, but no with its high health and its massive 500 DMG it just slaugter. and the exploits well there there. one time i had a invasion in my castle. his troops simply went through the gap between the tower and the wall. perfectly intact building, he just had to wiggle makeing it that mutch harder.PVP? well the cooldown\grace timer you get is great, but the matchmakeing can be terrable. i was just walking around and in normal settings only battles may take place between armies 20% weaker or stronger. ond the other option is be be risky and take a risk of fighting a army 50% biger (but not smaller). i got attacked (not wanting to fight) with a massive and overpowerd army. RIP everything. and then the game crashes occatonly in any instance of units fighting, particurly in missions. trust me almost beating a 1 hour map and haveing it crash, its infuriateig. and one day you may log on and your kingdome is erased, poof gone. that has heppent to me once.in the end if your gonna play this prepare to deal with a buggy mess.

It have been killed by BUGS.Do you like, when you log in the next day, your made buldings/upgrades are not there, and you're not even given the resources back?Do you like when your whole armies disappear, or their levels go way back without any reason?Do you like your resources disappear without any reason?I guess nobody does.

												This game is a great game. But it needs more. Like being able to trade crowns with other people, leagues like bronze, silver, and gold should be added for the PvP ranks. You should also be able to place your building anywhere like the orcs can while still being able to rotate it. There are many more suggestions I shall make but it will be just a long list of things that I personally want in this game. I still recommend it although.			"

												built lots of soldiers, next time I logged in, they disappeared.Even worse, knowing that my cool-down was coming to an end, I slowly and tirelessly gained gold to exchange for crowns (the p2w currency) and eventually started building the cage, which would allow me to get a dragon/hydra to defend myself.To put things into perspective: to get one crown, you have to spend 5 thousand gold, I started in the region with the most minerals, and even then I got only 10k per day, amounting to 2 crowns, even if I sold all the remaining resources for as much gold as I could, I still managed to do 4 crowns a day, that's 10 days of not doing anything but gathering gold that you spend only on the p2w currency.When I came back today, having patiently waited the 12 hours that would take to build it, I was greeted by a surprise:Not only did my cage simply vanish into nothing, but all the resources I spent on building it disappeared with it! That's days upon days of tireless un-fun work gone to hell, 40 crowns vanished into thin air.Unless you want this to happen to you, don't play it, it's practically stronghold:kingdoms with better graphics and a (bad) skirmish mode anyways.

												As we've seen countless times with these non-sub games, is the ""pay-to-win"" franchise taking control. Dawn of Fantasy is no stranger to it either, with a couple of euros/dollars, you'll be able to purchase the strongest units in-game that you can't normaly attain, but if you disregard the ""pay-to-win"" methods, I think the game offers good times for a wide range of players, be it a old school RTS player or if you've just started playing, this game is for you. Battles can be huge, also tactic is needed to beat even the NPCs, no more facerolling down the battlefield to collect the town.Because of the ""pay-to-win"" idealism that this game hosts, I don't recommend the game. But overall I'd give this game a 5/10.			"

												After playing this game for 12 hours it's clear this is a free to play, or pay to win game (just about pay to play).  The developers say they aren't going for that pay to win game however the time it takes to build anything is staggering without paying.  Everything in the game costs crowns which you earn by completing quests, killing a players army, playing co-op, or defending your keep.  By no means a small amount of crowns either so basic upgrades cost 10~120 crowns each.  Note that defending your keep doesn't happen often enough to make gathering crowns in that manor a viable option.  You can purchase crowns which makes the game go quicker as you also get gold when you do this to boot.  Thus making the game actually playable if you pay.The delevopers give out a starting bonus deal to help new players get into the game.  Compared to how slow the game moves, the bonus didn't make that much difference.  The issues is simple resource generation bonus for 10 minuts at the x10, x8, x6, and x4 level, and a 5 hour x2 resource generation.  I stopped playing before that ran out as I couldn't imagine playing the game at normal resource generation without pulling my hair out.  You also won't get attacked by anything for the first 24 hours.  To be honest I cancelled the protection as soon as I started to see if I would even get attacked at all.  I didn't at 12 hours of play get attacked once.  Which kind of makes having a walled village pointless.The game itself has a good concept.  The graphics are okay but not great, the sounds, and music is garbage, the game play is kind of interesting.  The bugs are many.  The biggest issue is that it's a 100% server sided game.  I can log out and get more resources than I can while playing due to the lag between the server and my game.  I have an above average rig that can handle any game out on ultra settings so no it's not my computer.  If your army dies there is a glitch that doesn't reset your population count at your home base cuasing some issues trying to rebuild an army.The main reason I don't recommend this game is becuase there is so much work involved with building an army after you get defeated, or even just play and win a battle.  Compaired to the loot you receive from a battle the cost of building an army is crazy.  An army can cost around 1,000 resources per unit with an army cap of 90 units it can get expensive.  The first major battle in the game requires around 25 units to beat.  However the losses are about 20 units.  The treasure gained is around 2,000 gold and about 400 wood and a crown or 2.  The 20 units cost around 30,000 food, and about 15,000 gold.  You don't gain land, units, or anything else in the first major battle.  It was cool to watch just not cool enough to waste 5 hours rebuilding another army to go on the next mission.The peasant AI is horrible as well, and the gathering of resources is limited at best.  Some of the peasant resource gathering upgrades are bugged and actually don't improve what they say they will.  Which is similar to placing buildings, some locations are even bugged and you can't place anything there.  You have to choose wisely what you will place as you are limited to so many slots unless you get an upgrade to the slots of buildings you can place.  Which also requires crowns, and a lot of them.  The population cap in town might be to blame for everything wrong with the game.  With a glitch that doesn't calculate the population correctly, to not showing you all of your peasants when you click on the view all button it would seem the developers haven't finished this game yet.  The population cap is sitting at 90.  While I was able to max mine out at 50 in town after having to use population for animals to get extra food resources I found that I couldn't generate enough to build an army of 30 in a day.  It took about 5 hours to get a army of 25 going.  After that main battle which lasted about 5 minutes.  Having to rebuild all but 4 of those units there simply wasn't enough motivation to continue playing the game.If the developer reads this I would recommend focusing on fixing any bugs the game has.  I would also lower the cost to upgrade anything with crowns in the game.  I would also rewrite the treasure you get after a battle to match the size of the battle, and the losses you will take on at an even matched battle.  If you lose you get nothing, if you win you get enough to at least repair, or rebuild most of your army.  The resource generation is so slow that it would take weeks to get anthing interesting going not to mention all the crowns I'd need just to upgrade my town hall to a castle might take months.  I would recommend changing the population cap to 100 for peasants, or fix the resource generation to make the game pace faster.  Playing 1 battle every few hours is dull and boring after all.  As the name of the game isn't kingdom building it's kingdom war. Compared to other games out there I can play that in this genra this game comes in as boring, and slow at best.  It has a ton of potential to be great, it just simply isn't at this time.			"

												Everything was going sweet until a server glitch caused most players to lose all of their progress, the dev's response was to give everyone maxed out buildings and resources, essentially destroying the whole point of the game beyond repair.Oh yeah, did I also say they were essentially bribing players for them to make good reviews?Game of the year, Den oudda den.

The game brings a great sense of having to know where your troops are how and when. Its reminds me of my favorite game series Total War. The game is seriously alike but Total war Suppases this game 1000000 to 10. Neither the less this game for being free it is doing an amazing job.

												A game targeted at all Stronghold, LOTR:BFME, and Age of Empire fans.Task villagers to harvest resources, build up your castle/stronghold, raise armies to go questing/clearing areas/sieging/pvp, all while the units in said armies gain ranks and can become quite powerful.Battles take place Total War style, the only setback is the fact that unit collision has little to no effect, battalions don't stick together, so tactics have a somewhat reduced effect here. Bringing villagers to battle is actually mandatory, because looting the fallen yields amazing amounts of resources, especially from PVP.After any PVP (field battle or siege) you get some PVP protection time, so you're not overwhelmed from annoyingly nonstop PVP. Although, keepi in mind that the rewards from participating in PVP are quite bountiful. If you don't want to participate, a small bribe is possible, which is proportional to the army size. Smaller armies = smaller payouts. You do get PVP protection after a payout so it is possible to skip the whole PVP deal alltogether.There is a special resource (crowns) which is necessary for all upgrades and high level units. It comes quite slowly at the beginning, but are most certainly attainable without paying real money. Ammasing gold is the way here, because crowns can be bought for gold at a rate of 1:5000. A solid economy is key, which is a must for any player of this type of game.Solid game, If you loved Stronghold, BFME, or Age of Empires you should definitely try this one.			"

												If you've ever played an economy focused RTS like Age of Empires, built up a flourishing and efficient town over the course of a match, and then felt a twinge of sadness on the statistics screen at the loss of said town, then Kingdom Wars is a good bet. (Especially for the low low price of completely free.)Early game you'll spend most of your time optimizing your economy. Training more peasants, setting them to mine gold or stone, gather lumber or farm the fields, meanwhile using your small starting militia to complete the basic quests.After a day or two however that part of the game virtually disappears, with you making only a few adjustments now and then. The economy does everything it needs to, but not a lot more. The main meat of the game is BATTLE. :DPVP works like so:1: Put together an army that you built in your town, and bring it onto the world map.2: Click the ""Search pvp"" button and choose between attacking a city or fighting an army head on.3: If you're fighting an army you'll find yourself on a small open map with some mountains and a few camps of neutral forces.4: If you're in a siege the layout of the land can differ greatly depending on the homeland of the player. Siege weapons are required of course.5: Rewards for winning is gold that you loot of the bodies and Crowns just for winning.The actual combat is squad based, similar to Total War.You can switch between different formations to optimize various types of defence, movement speed and damage. Troops will level up as they participate in battle, allowing you to spend ability points to increase their stats.It's very worth bringing up the F2P platform, as many people shy away from games like this based on the fear of a Pay to Win barrier popping up in their way every time they were just starting to enjoy the game.Cutting to the chase, you don't ever need to spend money in this game. There is a currency called Crowns which you can gain through the following means:1: Winning any ingame fight - either against the AI or players2: Finishing quests3: Paying for it through microtransactionsThing is though, in the case of this game you don't really pay to gain an advantage as much as you do to skip large sections of the game. Sure, you can buy a ton of Crowns in the store and get loads of endgame units and be matched with the best players, but then you lose out on all of the Battles and Sieges that, assumedly, are the reason you are there in the first place.It is currently not possible to actually take control of AI castles, but this will be changed in an upcoming free expansion.PS: Don't pick the human female hero. The voice acting will drill it's way into your skull.			"

												This is a giant timewaster of a game. If you ever played a facebook cow clicker game, this is basically the steam version of those. It's free, sure, but I still think I paid too much for it.It feels like I spent 95% of my time spent playing this doing nothing but waiting for enough resources to get the basic economy of my settlement going. I literally just sit and wait or play other games so that I can have enough resources to build a single building, and even that takes hours.  Then I logged out and when I came back later, the new building was just gone again, along with the resources. This game is a buggy mess, like so many reviewers have mentioned before. I had quests bug out, forcing me to restart the entire quest line because the dialogue happened in the main game screen, then the dialog scene began and there was no way to exit it again. I was even able to get the rewards for everything twice. Units fall through bridges before clipping back on to them correctly, sometimes the resource over time display just changes wildly for no real reason I can discern. I could forgive that, since the strategy genre is in a bit of a decline lately and options are scarce, if the rest of the game was fun.Well, do you enjoy watching a miniature model slowly walk across a huge map? Then you're in luck because that's what most of the game is like. The entire game is slow, slow, slow. Wait forever to get enough resources to build a handful of troops (which are pretty weak unless you upgrade the training facilities for currency, which also takes ages to gather enough of). Then spend even longer watching these units slowly trot across the map to a city or a quest location, where they will just get slaughtered.The worst offender however is combat. There is no control to it. You can't give orders to units because for some reason, while all units are trained in squads, you cannot issue attack commands to target specific squads. You just issue an attack move in the general direction of the enemy and hope your units don't die first. If there is a trick to it, the game doesn't tell you in the tutorial or in the time I spent playing it.And if your units aren't levelled to the maximum level, you might as well just zerg rush with all races because good luck keeping anyone alive. Units will ignore direct commands to disengage, frantically trying to rush back into the enemy army despite the squad being at 1|15 units with barely any health left. Your direct commands as player are just ignored by a batshit crazy AI that makes tactics or planning impossible. And to top it off, the animations of the units are ugly and repetative and the graphics look a good deal worse than Spellforce 1.			"

Quests.2. City inside of the Castle.3. Army vs Army.4. RTS battles5. NO P2W6. Partial Victories/Defeats with retreating and paying off ransoms. 7. Real terrain which the castles are built around.The Devs are very active and there has been small patches every day.  Find a bug?  Report it and it gets fixed THAT DAY.  Are there things about Kingdom Wars which I hope get attention from the Dev team?  Absolutely - but so far, I'm liking what I'm seeing.  A lot.			"

The main meat of the game is BATTLE. :DPVP works like so:1: Put together an army that you built in your town, and bring it onto the world map.2: Click the ""Search pvp"" button and choose between attacking a city or fighting an army head on.3: If you're fighting an army you'll find yourself on a small open map with some mountains and a few camps of neutral forces.4: If you're in a siege the layout of the land can differ greatly depending on the homeland of the player. Siege weapons are required of course.5: Rewards for winning is gold that you loot of the bodies and Crowns just for winning.The actual combat is squad based, similar to Total War.You can switch between different formations to optimize various types of defence, movement speed and damage. Troops will level up as they participate in battle, allowing you to spend ability points to increase their stats.It's very worth bringing up the F2P platform, as many people shy away from games like this based on the fear of a Pay to Win barrier popping up in their way every time they were just starting to enjoy the game.Cutting to the chase, you don't ever need to spend money in this game. There is a currency called Crowns which you can gain through the following means:1: Winning any ingame fight - either against the AI or players2: Finishing quests3: Paying for it through microtransactionsThing is though, in the case of this game you don't really pay to gain an advantage as much as you do to skip large sections of the game. Sure, you can buy a ton of Crowns in the store and get loads of endgame units and be matched with the best players, but then you lose out on all of the Battles and Sieges that, assumedly, are the reason you are there in the first place.It is currently not possible to actually take control of AI castles, but this will be changed in an upcoming free expansion.PS: Don't pick the human female hero. The voice acting will drill it's way into your skull.			"

												This game certainly aint for everyone, il say that right of the bat.its a slow paced strategy game, very similar to those browser-based P2W games you find everywhere.This however, is NOT Pay 2 Win.I paid for customizable banners, and a few extra gold, and while that helped, it hardly gave me an edge against anyone else.One of the downsides is that you generate recoursess over time, the more recoursess the more workers you get, and by that the opportunity to get a higher income rate for your recoursess.that makes the game incredibly slow paced, but its still pretty for what it is, and it all builds up to the day you will put those troops to work in an attempt to conquer other settlements for your own.not at all a very exciting game, but it has its key strategy elements locked solid, so if you have the patience, its worth a go.A Short side note about Bugs:I see some been complaining about a number of bugs.in the time i played this i have not encountered any such things, with the exception of one of my units doing a fancy frog walk for about 30 seconds.

												This game is great.  I got this game thinking it was going to be another clash of clans re-make but no it was like Total war mixed with Settlers online.  The one cool part about this game is the fighting and trading the fighting is just amazing when you have like 200 people against another 200, and the trading is great because you need to protect your carts from other armys and orcs.  I havent played this game for a while but i can just tell that game will continue to impress me.			"

												Every aspect of this game is extremely frustrating. If you play this, you will constantly deal with missing resources, missing building, dumb AI, terrible path finding, awful controls... Battles are so hard to play, because controlling your units is simply a nightmare. Sometimes it looks like the developers have NEVER played a RTS on their lives. Don't waste your time.			"

												This game is being given my rating of a current 4/5 due to good performability. I will explain the reasons why I like and feel a recommendation to the game as well as the defects and failures in this game, let start with the failures first as most people like to read the Good n Bad in order, yeah...I don't do that.----BAD!!!#1: The Current Cash Shop Model allows you to literally buy your way to victory for only 10-20$ USD and is practicly forcing players to do this if they want to get their walls' up before the peace-timer ends. Not only that, the daily transaction limit on crowns should be removed, 30 Crowns a day is about 2 Upgrades of the lowest pool, not even remotely worth it.#2: Sieging requires a very large force or a very small for of units you could simply buy from the Cash Shop, Simply buying 5 Minotaurs grants you 280 Power for your army and is in no way fun to deal with as a single minotaur can kill 5 ogres by itself, let alone an entire 8 battalions of cavalry. My gripe on this is, you can also buy army power by making nothing but archers and catapults, buying fire arrows and siege munitions then stacking stone and sitting back and not doing anything as your archers have 700 range and infinite ammo.#3: Respawns are an issue when fighting other players and in missions, I play as Orcs personally because I like their resource system, it reminds me heavily of LoTRBFME, But as I could clearly see, if you buy a ton of goblins, get them all to level 20 and then max out their health regen and HP, they can literally die in combat and be instantly replenished, this obviously needs to be fixed, Goblins are in no way weak, Why buy a bunch of slayers when I could just mass so many goblins it causes the opposite player to lag out?#4: Marketplace, Oh god...This eats my RTS time soo much, Unlike ""Age Of Empires"" where you can setup an auto-transaction pool, you have to click the icons manually, I wish this game gave you the ability to say: ""If a resource hits this  much, sell it into gold"" or add a ""Always keep this much on hand""; I hate having to manually click the sell resource button multiple times only to be rewarded with a deselection of the marketplace or barely any outcome.#5: The Pathing Engine, Oh lord, I broke this on the first day, apparently you can only have 3-4 Orcs harvesting a single deer, and I have about 40 Marauder Squads gathering food, problem is, there is only like 20 Marauders of the 200 collecting anything, the rest are rumbling and grumbling around like idiots, Its like watching turkey vultures trying to take turns pulling a carcass off a busy intersection, Everyone wants a stab at the corpse. This dissapoints me heavily and I believe the Pathing AI needs to be adjusted for better efficiency, because of this, I cannot bring my food income above 90.0.#6: The Resource System, Yay! not so bad now, but still underperforming. The amount of resources players are given per map, at an interval of every 3 days of respawn is stupid, If I build in a Desert, I expect far more stone than gold. And the worst part about this is the fact that the resources can only be optimally harvested by 2 harvesters each turning this into a ""Starcraft 2 SCVs per Mineral Field Moment"" Overrall, I either think the amount of resources per minute gathered from these needs to be increased, or increase the movement quality and gather rate of all harvesters, even with upgrades, they are still snails at this time.#7: The Upgrade System, Okay this is my final gripe, as it stands, you can literally train units to get certain skills and passives that make them sometimes, in wording of Goblin Hordes; Unkillable and other times just plain ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. How would you feel if someone's hero walked into your army and started 1-shotting all of your men and you couldn't even do more than 1 dmg to him while he regens 80/sec? Or if someone bought a set a Archers and got their movement speed, health regen, range, damage, and resistances maxed out? and just solo'd all your cavalry with arrows? Say...aren't archers supposed to be weak vs melee? It sure doesn't look like it to me. Another issue with this system, is not every unit can be upgraded, which bothers me, I cant increase the replenish rate of my Wargs, Yes I use wargs as outrunners to kill runners, and I can upgrade my laborers, even though they spawn at level 5. I would love to improve their movement speed. I realize this game is not done yet, but seriously?------GOOD STUFF!!!------#1: Performance = The game performs very well on my crappy computer, I have everything that is below the minimal requirements listed for downloading the game, my Graphics card is even out of date by 8 years. I'm suprised I can run the game at 60-113fps in terrain that would normally eat my computer, however there is one terrain that drops me below 30fps, and that is the swamps, that terrain is either high on particles or overrun with reflections. The graphics options are lack luster and need to be evaluated, but if this game turns into another 64x system required game, I swear I'm going to break a kneecap.#2: Animation Quality = I love the chopping down of trees and the maiming of overly maimed corpses, the arrow firing and ring-rung animations of swordsman swinging their swords in 4 different ways at least gives heart to this addition, I hate games like ""Rome Total War"" where there is literally 1-2 Animations for everything except pre-scripted cinema gestures. The only thing I noticed is the level attack animation, it looks like there is no attack speed pool between attacks as soon as the target engages within melee range. This might need a look into.#3: Map Movement Speed = I like this system, however I have seen it in many other F2P and B2P titles and some of which are much faster, this system prevents sieges from occuring too-often which is nice as players have to constantly run back and forth from their major city to replenish supplies and then run back, the only problem I see is when you are doing campaign or single player effects like quests, I think your movement speed should be increased for these and only these, especially if all your going to have to do is talk to some old fart.#4: Unit Composition = I love that you have brought back the obvious, Archer vs Swordsman vs Cavalry vs Pikeman vs Siege effect, but there is alot of balance to be had and as it is clearly obvious, Archers are the best. I also want my Trolls, what Orc army doesn't have a giant Cave Troll? Ogres are not as good as Trolls. I think if you were to add a Troll which you should, it should replace the useless Meat-Grinder and cost crowns to make.#5: Heros = Many games don't have a natural hero system, as it is very hard to balance, ""IT IS"" but either way, kudos to the Devs for adding it, however I would rather be given a choice on what type of hero I am interested in, it gripes me that  every Hero I've gotten so far has been melee, I would atleast like a ""Switch Weapon"" effect or be able to choose if my hero was a Mage, Archer, or Warrior, this would give the game more variation and would make buying Vanity for the individuals more effective as you would have more to choose from instead of 3 pathetic pieces of army that look the same.----FINISHED----Why I write reviews?-I write reviews to give developers and players a heads up and truthful perspective of what effects are taking place in the game in order to prevent the wrong crowd from joining a game they don't expect. I am a Balancer and Play-Tester of other games and have a huge tendancy to find bugs, or bugs find me and break the game entirely, or find things that are uncanny and imbalanced. I don't do these reviews for money or excerpts, I only post them as notifications, I have no interest is retaining any order within said game. Things need to be fixed, I post what and how in the review of the current stage. Simple constructive criticism.			"

												The strum of a lute serenades my ears as my peasants dutiful mine on my homeland, carrying sacks of stone and gold, tending my fields, butchering livestock, and working hard in the forests surrounding my large keep with it's mighty stone walls. A babbling brook works through my stronghold as my men patrol the walls with crossbows, blunderbusses, and bows at the ready. Bubbling oil gurgles away at the top of my gatehouses waiting to pour onto those who'd dare breach the sancitity of my realm. Trebutchets sit atop round towers waiting for the drums of war. My quiet management of my fief is piereced by the panoply of trumpets hearlding a welp who dares to raze my homeland. So I herd my peasants in and lock the gatehouses. I assemble my personal guard to the outer courtyard and lock the inner gatehouse. The enemy arrives at the edge of my walls and my trebutchets begin to sing with the whistle of flying boulders and the ""swipp"" of arrows leaving their strings. My men bubble out from a far gatehouse and make battle with the enemy on the fields and ruins of my homeland's outfields. They are bloodied but are victorious, the enemy driven before them.  The gates open and the peasants return to their tasks. The lutes play again and the once again peace falls over my land. It feels good to be lord.Kingdom Wars is a PVE/PVP oriented MMORTS where you are lord of a tiny homestead on a vast and deeply detailed world of Mythador. Populated with Orcs, Elves, and Humans it reminds me deeply of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings but with a distinct Reverie Worlds spin. You can choose a race, two traits, and three different homelands that help give your kingdom a unique feel as well as mechanical benefits. You can engage in PVE quests or PVP content with additional Co-OP offerings. By far my favorite MMORTS to date and has hours upon hours of enjoyment.			"

												Honestly i have been serching for a game like this for a very very long time.  This game gives everyone thee own estate and lordship in a fantasy mideval society.  In this estate you manage your troops your people and recorce income.  As you progress in the game you go from small town to massive fortress with many various maps to start your town on.  The combat is were the game truly shines however.  When you go to attack a enemy stronghold it takes alot fo preperation examineing eney fortifications trying to find the best point of attack.  And there is always the option to battle against players and npc settlements either solo or co op.  At the end of the battle there is nothing quite as satisfying as seeing your enemys walls fall to your armies.  The pvp element in this game encompases the majority of the game but if you are like me you can choose not to participate.  When you start you get a little featuer called battle protection this keeps other players from attacking your settlement.  This initial protection last 24 hours now at first you think 24 hours real time but no its 24 hours of game play in your current game and there is a in game option to extend that time.  So if you are like me and enjoy just playing the many quests you recive and building your settlement up you can do that without fear of getting attacked.  Another great thing is that if your protection is off and you are attacked you ca only be attacked wile you are logged in and then only if the attacking army is eaqually as powerful as yours so it is always a fair fight.  And should you choose to not fight you can pay the other player a tribute to keep from fighting.All in all this is probably the best mideval strategy game I have ever played.			"

 A strategic and tactical middleage war game i find difficult to compare with other ones i played. Strategic, a bit of RPG, tactical, Business, Timeintensive, older graphic typeMostly i would make a compare with age of empires genre to build units and get them to action, but in difference it remembered me to such browsergames, because of the time you have to wait on your constructions till they are ready.Bulding a fortress with all things a middleage settlergame u imagine and take units out of three races and some special units like mighty dragons. Every Unit of every Race is for every player getable without paying money. As one of the old users (i bought the game times ago) i know there is such a massive progress in debugging and improving this game - nearly unbelieveable. This process isn´t still at its end and there are still some big points of loosing enthusiasm. But i have to admit, that there is a strange element in this game, that forces me to play again and again everytime for a while and to explore the hole game. Good for me: - Business system with some tricky elements to provide my progress, like peasant armys, Vassals producing ressources, - new progress poossibilities with all the buildings .. now it´s not still all researched after 3 days .. Thats very important for me. I want to have aims in game and there are still a few, that i didn´t reached all the time. Aims of Quests or Aims of my desire- mixing and combining armys in any comination.. Great, not one skilled army for all tasks- enough possibilies to get this crones, with which you can buy anything in addition to ressources (not pay to win)- great pve battles - army vs army or amry vs castle ..- great support by nice players all around- good quest system- the possibility to go many way to win.. every unit works fine on its wise. --> Not only one way to make a strong and functioning army Disadvantages of the game - Still since my starting its very slow in every discipline. Commands and orders have a standard delay of ca 1 sec--> this delay raises in pvp battles up to 4 sec. and graphic settings don´t change that. Because of that pvp isn´t still playable in my eyes- not answering gamesupport- not comprehensible effects of life reg on the different units.. a dragon with 50 life reg / s will not have over 10 life reg / real second. Knights instead can regenerate massive life - surely with their greater number of part-units- sometimes its dificult to find out the reason for missing the friend for an coop game. Since it is free to play i can recommend this game and minimum 10 hours that u will see a bit of the content This game is for you, if you like to get part by part stronger by saving up for mighty units and leveling all units and finding your own tactical way  "

												Free to play game.Also as an RTS is very balanced and the AI is pretty intelligent.Those 3 races you can play(elf,orc,human)and the existence of dwarfes(which you can also use in combat) + dragons and other creatures makes you feel like you are playing Lord of the Rings,and the combat makes you feel like you are playing Total War.Even it is Free to play,it is not a Pay to Win game,so you can simly be as good as others that pay.The PVP sistem is very nice too,You can battle army versus army or siege a player's castle.You can also PVP army vs army at other castles(controlled by AI).And the variety of quests(which can be played co-op) makes the game even more interesting.But definetly by far the best thing in Kingdom Wars is siegeing.Take your mate and siege a castle,and I guarantee you won't regret seeing thousands of men fighting.IF you have a wizard,dragon or a hydra with you,the battle will be even more interesting.

												Excellent game, I was looking for a castle building, medieval style game for some time now and here it is. The developers seem to be open to the community and exact change when applicable. The game is still growing so there are a lot of possibilities for greater community improvement. If you wanted to play a game that contains castles, knights, formations, strategy, economy, unit progression then this is the game for you.			"

It has part of RPG (heroes in your army) and all units can level up too. The construction of the city is progressive and allows you to build several buildings daily. The battles are in real time and allow full control of the units. It is a game you can spend only time you want and it's free sojust download it and try it !!!!			"

												This is a giant timewaster of a game. If you ever played a facebook cow clicker game, this is basically the steam version of those. It's free, sure, but I still think I paid too much for it.It feels like I spent 95% of my time spent playing this doing nothing but waiting for enough resources to get the basic economy of my settlement going. I literally just sit and wait or play other games so that I can have enough resources to build a single building, and even that takes hours.  Then I logged out and when I came back later, the new building was just gone again, along with the resources. This game is a buggy mess, like so many reviewers have mentioned before. I had quests bug out, forcing me to restart the entire quest line because the dialogue happened in the main game screen, then the dialog scene began and there was no way to exit it again. I was even able to get the rewards for everything twice. Units fall through bridges before clipping back on to them correctly, sometimes the resource over time display just changes wildly for no real reason I can discern. I could forgive that, since the strategy genre is in a bit of a decline lately and options are scarce, if the rest of the game was fun.Well, do you enjoy watching a miniature model slowly walk across a huge map? Then you're in luck because that's what most of the game is like. The entire game is slow, slow, slow. Wait forever to get enough resources to build a handful of troops (which are pretty weak unless you upgrade the training facilities for currency, which also takes ages to gather enough of). Then spend even longer watching these units slowly trot across the map to a city or a quest location, where they will just get slaughtered.The worst offender however is combat. There is no control to it. You can't give orders to units because for some reason, while all units are trained in squads, you cannot issue attack commands to target specific squads. You just issue an attack move in the general direction of the enemy and hope your units don't die first. If there is a trick to it, the game doesn't tell you in the tutorial or in the time I spent playing it.And if your units aren't levelled to the maximum level, you might as well just zerg rush with all races because good luck keeping anyone alive. Units will ignore direct commands to disengage, frantically trying to rush back into the enemy army despite the squad being at 1|15 units with barely any health left. Your direct commands as player are just ignored by a batshit crazy AI that makes tactics or planning impossible. And to top it off, the animations of the units are ugly and repetative and the graphics look a good deal worse than Spellforce 1.			"

												    Played about 10 hours.  This game has familiar things most rts games have.  When you start you choose between the 3 main races and and then choose between 3 start locations.  You then get an estate to start building up.  Its similar to stronghold series.  You  start to get some quest that introduce you to the game and let you start collecting some resources. Eventually it leads to you making an army and you go on from there.  I ended up getting to a part where i had to destroy 3 unrulely lords.  I wasn't very pleased with how the siege went.  It was buggy i needed to click many times and units sometime just do the oppostie of what you want.       For me it ended my time with the game.  I spent about 10 bucks on some cosmetic stuff.  Yes you only get 1 default option for everything.  You can then spend some money and buy limited choices.  For example you can pay a dollar to get one of the 5 choices of armor skins.  Or you can pay to decorate your heraldry.  Im ok with paying for some stuff, but don't break it all down into tiny micro transactions.  The game is free, and if you have little knowledge of these types of games i bet it can be a lot of fun.  For an rts vet some of the bugs are unforgivable for me.  I can still recommend it due to its freeness, and the fact that some real work was obviously put into it.  Just not enough for me.			"

												fun little game dont get me wrong, and decent for being free. but theres a lot of little quirks such as if your hero dies in the quest you have to restart(not to mention all damage to your units stays and the ones that died dont come back :)), which makes sense, but one of these heroes in particular is superrrr easy to kill, even easier than regular units, and on this game its a pain to micro manage one unit. Its a pretty game but there are a few funny looking things mainly the walls and faces of people. But i will give it that it has a very unique system for seiging and trading, but for me this game just isnt on par with the others on the genre but even so ill probably log in more hours			"

												I didn't know what to expect when I first loaded this game, but a deep and intricate RTS / Base Building game was not it. I was kinda expecting a dull resource extracting game with high grind and no depth. I was very pleasantly surprised. This could very well be my new jam.It's definitely worth taking a good look at it if you like the idea of a slow burn but actually deep RTS to keep you entertained over a long period of time.			"

												I was playing nicely during a week with a prosperous elven city.Then started coop with some random players. And during a major battle, a 3-hour long siege in an epic Orc Village. When almost all my soldiers got leveled max and the town is on the last and got +230k gold collected by my wardens, guess what happens?IT CRASHES! NO WAY TO GO BACK OR TO RESTORE YOUR BATTLE SIR!You wasted a lot of effort of your time building a town, gathering resouces, amassing an army, face long hours siege for a big CRASH and you lose everything!The developers should seriously work in the reliability of this game. Don't play it and waste your time on it now. It does not only bug an crashes during sieges, it can crash anytime.			"

If u Zoom in you cant actually see the warriors face just the Head.It is playable even if you encounter a Bug or something Glitchy it still is fun to play and free to play. Yes this game really is no OP Donations :).Sound feels ok too.About Balance between Races i dont want and cant write.The Map and Siege Battles are wonderfull intense and make Fun!Even if it got alot negatives Bugs not the newest Graphics , theres much positivethe Team (Developers and Moderators) are in Chat and friendly.I enjoy the game so far.

Quest rewards are really nice, And leveling up your heroes doing so is even better. Giant armies and being able to fight when ever you want, while your home town builds it self. Graphics Are great, no much to run them high.Sounds and music is really good too, my pandora stop playing and i forgot because i got distracted by the ingame music.Is just everything it says it is, and it's free. I paid for it and it was worth, how is getting it free not just the best.8/10 Amazingly fun.			"

												Hello, Rhoken7 here.   I wanted to try and explore the game a little more before i tried to write a review for this game. I feel that it is a very well thought out game, I enjoy it. The battles are pretty epic in most points. The original sounding names of the places, the lore, the size of the game itself, and how you get to build your city the way you want, for the most part. I did the tutorial but i felt it lacking. I dont know if i missed a advanced stage or what, but some things you find out later in the game that you wish you knew at first. For instance, i wish i knew that my population cap didnt go over 90. I wouldn't have wasted my time trying to get it even higher and spend my earned recourses that i got in game on expanding building plots. the only positive out of doing so gives oyu the ability to increase your storage capacity. But i was a little let off when it told me that i could build more houses but when i got back to the game my population cap did not increase. Also i have knoticed that the PvP notifier is a little lacking as well. I dont spend all my time playing the game, once I finish what i can at that very moment. I may send an army out to a mission and i will go check something like youtube or Facebook. Which brings me to another point. Sometimes it can be very slow going. Which has caused some friends of mine to not give it a chance after one day. The times it takes to build, travel, or even gather enough recourses can take you days. (days of real time, not in game time). But back to PvP. There has been times I alt tab out of the game. or even while in game, im told there is someone at the gates for a fight, and nothing happens after that, the game will automatically ""pay off"" the person coming to my little town. I would much rather take my chances at fighting the person instead of the game automatically paying them off. Last thing i would like to point out is the graphics of the little characters running around. It can be horrid at times to see a horse that has no eyes. Just saying. The landscape graphics and buildings graphics are good for this game, I jus tthink the NPC's and other Characters in the game need a little bit of sprucing up. Other than those points i find this game to be very fun. I plan on playing it for a long time and would recommend it to anyone who likes something like Clash of Clans, C&C, or even Star Craft. It takes elements from a game like Clash of Clans where you build buildings and train units, upgrade those buildings, and go fight people. It takes a RTS point of view during battles and out of battle as well through out the game like Starcraft and C&C. If you like being a Commander of some sort of army and like to make a pretty cool little kingdom as well. this game is for you. Because of the bad character graphics, long wait times, and un-locatable PvP indicator at times, i give it a 7 out of 10. its a good game, just needs a little work. "

												I want to start with the good things about Kingdom Wars first. If youre interested you can read this guide or just try out the game, but if you have a bad internet connection, you should probably read first to know more about the game itself.The game itself is awesome. Its like freaking stronghold, but online. Did you ever play Age of Empires? Well, if you did you probably know the economy system is awesome. Did you ever play American Conquest or Cossacks? Well, if you did you probably know the combat system is awesome. This game is a mix of those games, but massive mutliplayer. Its a so called MMORTS (Massive Multiplayer Online Real Time Strategy).The best thing about this game is the fact that there's no pay2win.You can pretty much archive everything ingame and there's no advantage for players paying money for things like premium or customisation.Did you ever get bored because you would have to pay with real money to boost up building sth or training troops? Well, you wont get bored in this game, because building stuff doesnt take very long and the devs gave us nice quests to do. If you want to get ressources to get a bigger army you can make quests, loot enemies or siege a town. Trust me, I never got bored in this game and I think you wont too.A very interesting idea is the quest system. There's some sort of story depending on the world region you are living in. For example you have fight, protect, destroy or survive during such quests. Its important to know as much as possible about the enemy to have an advantage. Every unit has a few different formations which are effective against a special type of enemy. If you siege a castle, you want to put your archers to skirmish formation so you gain a speed boost and protection against enemy ranged units. The formations vary from unit to unit and are special for each kingdoms.There are a bunch of upgrades you can get for ressources to get better formations like the skirmish formation I mentioned above. Since the units vary from race to race (Orc, Elves, Human), its important to know your strenghts. You have to act different each time depending the enemy you conquer. That makes the game pretty exciting if you ask me.Ive mentioned the races above and want to explain them to you. Basically there are 3 races with different units and strenghts. The orcs are very strong melee fighters. Their units are dealing heavy damage, but they have weak ranged units. Their strongholds are wood based and they use catapults as siege weapons. Its a pretty brutal race, you should try it if you dont know which race you should choose! The humans are pretty much balanced. They have medium melee fighters, medium ranged units and good cavalry. Their stronghold are wood (Palisades) and stone based (After further upgrades). They have very strong formations if you ask me. Theyve knights and mounted knights which are pretty much the strongest allrounders ingame. The elves are a race with a ""fantasy"" lore. Their ranged units are very powerful and able to kill even heavy units easily on distance. The strongholds look cool, but I dont like the ""fantasy"" style, but its pretty much the only thing I dont like about them. Their units are interesting and the lore is great, but many players dont like elves for some reason.Some units can use special abilities, for example the human knight. He can heal nearby troops.If you got too many crowns (from battles, quests etc.) you can spend 'em on dwarves. Dwarves have a bunch of nice units you can buy! For example you can buy a troop of miners, which are mining way faster than the normal peasents. Their siege engine is great too. They got a highrange cannon which can destroy walls like a catapult. Its pretty expensive though.If youre more a fan of ranged units you will probably love the riflemen! They are not so expensive and are useful if you want to defend you village. The only disadvantages of dwarven troops are that they are expensive and slow.There's also a pretty nice chat system! Its split into a few channels, but the most interesting channel is probably the channel called ""Help"". Its pretty much a support channel, so if you got any problems or want to report a player, you can easily write in the support channel.But sadly, there are also bad things about this game.The game has many bugs, that means you will probably experience some problems.Since the devs are fixing many bugs and working on it thats not a very heavy problem.The biggest problem is probably the awful AI. Trust me.. Ranged units run and chase the enemy, siege engines shot themselves if they get charged and some troops just dont want to attack the enemy - no matter what. I think the devs should probably improve the AI. Its no gameplay ruining, but its bad, making you angry and unprofessional.To conclude you can say the game is a pretty interesting one with almost no problems. You can play it without having to pay, you can have much fun, but you will sometimes experience some bugs.If you wrote so far youre probably mad since my grammar is terrible, but thanks for reading.

I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good Rts. The community is helpful, the gameplay is fun. The only thing it needs is more player base, and people to stop giving it a thumbs down because they give up to do thinking it is either too complex to understand or don't have the patience for it. Great concept, love the mmo-rts style. A great new step in the genre, love to see things evolve in a different light.			"

												Alright, time to get a review on. I am here today to give a review to a game I don't think gets enough credit for what it does. Are you ready? Good! The game that we are going to dive into today is none other then Dawn of Fantasy Kingdom Wars. If you are not excited and you love strategy games you need to get excited because this game brings so much to the table. First off we have three different races to choose from humans, orcs, and elves, the later of which I am currently enjoying. These races are different in just enough ways to make you want to keep coming back for more. The humans may be versatile, where the orcs are tough and brutal and the elves are elegant. Don't fret there is no need to be careful on what race you pick you can have multiple armies and city's that you have built. I believe that having multiple armies is good for the game it keeps it fresh, I also like the looks on each races cities. Be careful here you can easily sink hours into the game just creating your city. This game is solid in all aspects of strategy, story, and mind numbing sieging for those of you who just want to get straight to the action. You also get heroic units that allow for fun, Mages, Minotaur, Dragons, and many other goodies. You can also customize your cities the more you put in the better your people will be protected! Now the game does have some bugs that can be frustrating. The game doesn't give you an option on whether or not you wish to participate in pvp all though it offers a buy out for the siege it does get frustrating when you are in the middle of building and you get attacked. I have listed the Pros and the Cons of this game but in all honestly you need to pick the game up its free on steam and decide for you self whether this is a go or a dump. This game does allow you to bring friends along on a siege so dust off your armor and lets get ready to go to war!  If I was to rate this game I would give it a solid 7.5 out of 10 the game has to much replay value and is definitely a trend setter in the strategy game department.			"

												Alright, time to get a review on. I am here today to give a review to a game I don't think gets enough credit for what it does. Are you ready? Good! The game that we are going to dive into today is none other then Dawn of Fantasy Kingdom Wars. If you are not excited and you love strategy games you need to get excited because this game brings so much to the table. First off we have three different races to choose from humans, orcs, and elves, the later of which I am currently enjoying. These races are different in just enough ways to make you want to keep coming back for more. The humans may be versatile, where the orcs are tough and brutal and the elves are elegant. Don't fret there is no need to be careful on what race you pick you can have multiple armies and city's that you have built. I believe that having multiple armies is good for the game it keeps it fresh, I also like the looks on each races cities. Be careful here you can easily sink hours into the game just creating your city. This game is solid in all aspects of strategy, story, and mind numbing sieging for those of you who just want to get straight to the action. You also get heroic units that allow for fun, Mages, Minotaur, Dragons, and many other goodies. You can also customize your cities the more you put in the better your people will be protected! Now the game does have some bugs that can be frustrating. The game doesn't give you an option on whether or not you wish to participate in pvp all though it offers a buy out for the siege it does get frustrating when you are in the middle of building and you get attacked. I have listed the Pros and the Cons of this game but in all honestly you need to pick the game up its free on steam and decide for you self whether this is a go or a dump. This game does allow you to bring friends along on a siege so dust off your armor and lets get ready to go to war!  If I was to rate this game I would give it a solid 7.5 out of 10 the game has to much replay value and is definitely a trend setter in the strategy game department.			"

												Kingdom Wars ReviewPros: Money System + (u can get everything easily just think, u can even get tons of crowns and don't cry about ur army if u want to keep damaged units fall back and attack with full hp units just think it's strategy game)Sieges +Siege Battles +Trading System + Normal Graphics + Cons:No online Players -This is Great game and highly recommended. it's true that there are better games but this one is free and deserves more positive status.

												So first , i want you to start playing this game because it worth it . It is a very cool game where you can command large armies and build a castle and train dragons and train wizards ... you got the idee . If you like RTS games like me , you will play this game like forever . But there is a thing that doesn't allow me to rate this game 10/10 . I don't know if im the only but it randomly crashes saying lost connection to server and i need to start again the city . Please fix this .			"

												Kingdom wars is a MMORTS that boasts incredible F2P a great progression system and a massive variety of units. The game plays like a massive single player campaign through your own private instance of the world map. PvP and Co-op act like random encouters for your armies and villages. PvP can be easily avoided but rewards even the loser well. Co-op sieges with randoms or friends are good fun and expose you to more strategies.Currently the game features 3 playable races: Humans, Orcs and Elves. You choose 3 traits at the start to customise your races performance. Dwarves and Dragons are availiable as special units to all races. All races seem unique and quite balanced with the humans probably being the easiest to learn with.Your villages and armies cannot be attacked while you are offline and attacks can be avoided very easily with small amounts of gold or  battle protection when you are.If you ever liked any RTS game ever you should download and play this today. A really clever use of an online communitty for this genre. Hours and hours of fun for solo and social gamers alike.9/10			"

Then, one day, I was attacked by someone, when the battle screen came up all I had was the starter area, no troops, nothing.  I lost half my forces, and my money.  The developers were awfully smug about it and said it was my issue and offered a half-^@A#(A way to fix it.  Nothing worked, nothing has worked.  The community was great, they tried to offer help...but, in the end, the developers did not care about the fact I did spend money on their game and had a lot of hours into it...			"

												The game is a true scam, the graphics are terrible, the game is original but in fact this game is all but playable, i've played it only because it had a good storyline and because i had to spend my time through the days. The game generally needs loads of improvement and fixing, as the many crashes, bugs and lag prevent me from actually having fun playing it. Also i cannot believe that all those companies liked this game 10/10 (watch the trailer and you will see the many recommendations which in my opinion cannot be true). The money they receive from the people buying their games, is not spent into the game itself but surely into other things.I do not recommend this game and i would certainly not mind if gaben banned this game from steam if he could. Thanks for reading this review, enjoy the crashes			"

												I bought this game in Alpha to support it. It has paid off. With the updated to Kingdom Wars that hopefully will reduce the lag considerably should improve the online gameplay. As far as playing on your own, questing, it has it advantages of learning the game. It is still a lot of fun. No lag when questing and upgrading your armies. Though when it comes to sieging some cities, having an ally is very useful.			"

												I bought this game in Alpha to support it. It has paid off. With the updated to Kingdom Wars that hopefully will reduce the lag considerably should improve the online gameplay. As far as playing on your own, questing, it has it advantages of learning the game. It is still a lot of fun. No lag when questing and upgrading your armies. Though when it comes to sieging some cities, having an ally is very useful.			"

												Hell YES! First MMORPGRTS game ever! It is truly amazing. Orcs, Humans, and Elves are the 3 starting races but more like Dwarfs, undead and more are to come. Build walls, defend sieges with 10k+ players. COOP sieges and PvE and PvP whenever you want. Well worth 15 bucks. It is in alpha with bugs but it is normal :)			"

												it's one of the few RTS which i really enjoy playing, at the start it goes pretty fast, buildings and soldiers are done in a few minutes but after sometime you need to upgrade your units by battles or quests and building takes longer and more resources. the war is a bit like total war but older graphics and animations, which they are gonna update (confirmed)			"

												I could sit here and tell you it's a great game, and it's worth the money, and you are missing out if any one says otherwise...As a veteran of this game I can truly say out of many RTS games that go from online to single player. That Kingdom Wars has been the only game to catch my interest in years.There is much to do, and yet so much to acomplish. The land is full of ripe adventure you just need to discover it.                                                     This can be some what of a spoiler, but proves my point.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I favor the orcish hordes. With being a Warleader of Orcs who will call you Grr Mada meaning great warrior in orcish. I can tell you that every race has a great and mostly unique way of making you feel like a powerful ruler, if not peaceful savior. The orcs take what they can get rather it be meat from an animal, ogre, or human alike. The elves protect their lands from taint, and brutality. They respect their land and give back. The humans prove their worth with noble tasks. Either by protecting the weak, or just simply fighting with inspiration courage.  "

But there is nothing more annoying than being an inch away from victory and losing control of your men and having to watch them be massacred by enemies the equivalent to an orphan with polio who takes all the steroids in the world as soon as they touch you.

												Sorry I just can't write a good review for this game. Kingdom Wars could be a great game, BUT, The devs refuse to part with wizards that can wipe out whope amies with one spell. Until the devs get rid of the wizards OR make the wizards only able to cover a very small area instead of 1/4 of the screen with their spells. this is NOT a fun game to play.  Wizards were always more of a healer than a battle unit, and even as a battle unit they are only able to attack one unit at a time, NOT half a battle field. No Wizard, even Morgana or Merlin ever had that much accumulated manna stored up to cast that kind of magic and had to reserve their mana and use it in small amounts as if you deplete your mana, you have a good chance of dying, unable to defend yourself from other on the battle field or even from disease. The wizards in this game do not even have to use their mana to keep a field around themselve to stop or deflect damage, but instead are just higher in kill points and life points as you level them up. I founf NO limit to how high you can level a wizard up. UNTIL they get rid of or change wizards to conform within reality like the other troops in this game I will recommend that no one purchase this game.			"

												While the gameplay is good overall, the comunity is great and the story is engaging, I do not recomend this game. The main reason for this is the number of game-recking bugs i have experienced myself and are well known to the people i have spoken with in chat. Bugs such as: losing control of units (cannot issue move or attack commands), path finder mishaps resulting in units becoming stuck (I have even had armies on the world map become stranded and have had to delete them) as well as the utter b*ll-sh*t of moving the camera away for literally 3 seconds and returning to find half my men dead of no apparent cause and finally, on occasion, your max leveled, max perked units (lets say, cavalry) will somehow be killed by enemy units half their number and half their level, which are weak to your units (e.g. archers).If you have the patience of a saint, then get this game as it is enjoyable when it works. But there is nothing more annoying than being an inch away from victory and losing control of your men and having to watch them be massacred by enemies the equivalent to an orphan with polio who takes all the steroids in the world as soon as they touch you.

												Not much playtime because of one reason: im stuck at 5 to 10 fps. Even though everything looked pretty good i will not play a game at this fps. I can run the Witcher 3 or skyrim with loads of mods on ultra so this shouldn't be a problem.It looked good, but it just doesn't run well at all.			"

												Not sure how my last review was deleted but I'll post again. :o) This is a pretty good game but you have to be aware of a couple things. First and foremost, the developer has shifted focus to their next game, ""Kingdom Wars 2: Battles"" so you jumping on a ship everyone is getting off of. Secondly, this developer has in the past done complete wipes IN RELEASE state! That was when I quit.As for the game itself, it is definitely worth a play but realize you can't really play with friends like you would think for a multi-player game. The process is very convoluted, and buggy from my experience. The part that stands out is your ability to have a persistent home city you can come back to to get resources and defend from invaders. Which brings me to my next point, you can be attacked any time including while you are away. If the AI didn't suck that might be fine lol.If you are looking for something free and entertaining by all means give it a go but go into it with the above expectations and understanding. All in all, I can't recommend this game when there are better ones out there.  "

												This game can only be described in two words...................... Fuc-kin' Awesome! I myself are not into RTS games. This one is very different from any other one. It's a lot like the old Civilization games. You choose your race and then you choose where you start. Plain and simple. It is not Pay to Win what so ever. The only people that say it is are to lazy and do not want to wait for the sometimes long build times. Everything in this game is reachable without adding a credit card.

												The issue is that Dawn of Fantasy is not a good MMORTS. For most computers you are going to be playing on low and still experience mind numbing lag from the tiniest seige battles at the beggining of the game. Resource gathering has nothing to it, nor do things like skill. Tech tree is tiny, you will have built everything by hour three and thus has every unit for your faction. Then lets go to the combat. Every unit you create at home has a level up system, which much be activated manually for each of the 30-40 units you feild. Thats right, before every battle you have to individually level up every single unit. I was playing orcs, and this got boring by the time I had a screen full of goblins. Kingdom wars is not a good game, and Reverie is under the impression if they keep adding tiny packs of content to the game it's suddenly going to fix every problem in their games code; or better yet suddenly turn their game into a strategy title. You won't experience multiplayer, nobody plays.			"

												Buy this game!If you are a fan of RTS games, as well as a fan of games that allow you to continue an online progression over a long period of time, this is the game for you!  Build up a city:  3 different ways of doing this based on your raceUpgrade that city:  No cosmetic upgrades but the buildings will perform better as you put more resources in to themBuild an Army:  3 distinct ways of doing this, with the ability to hire units from other racesSIEGE a city:  Like never before in a game, tear down a cities defenses brick by brick and funnel your forces in to storm their castle, fly powerful dragons over the walls while your siege weapons lay waste and make your opponent tremble in PVP or PVE battlesDefend YOUR city:  PvP from within the safetey of your city, watch as armies smash like water dropplets off your mighty walls as your archers rain fiery arrows down own their undefended heads, setting the ground around them ablaze forcing them to scatter!)Send Trade Caravans:  Build a city that generates more resources than you ever need?  Send caravans to every corner of the world and make allies to trade with so that you can recruit and train units, or just to earn extra gold for your goods to spend on upgrading your units or for crowns to buy powerful dragons/elite units/ Dwarven helpers and more!Everything you could possibly want in an RTS has been crammed into this title.  It IS being done by an indy company so game updates come a bit slow compared to some other games, but it does not ask you to keep paying around every corner to be able to enjoy your purchase as so many games with cash shops do. ***CASH SHOP CLARIFICATION*** You should really read this.This game has 'Crowns'.  Crowns are earned through questing, completing achievements, through pvp, you can buy them with gold, they can be given to you by your guild treasurer, for refering a friend or yes, you CAN purchase them.   I have owned this game for 1 month and I have 700 crowns and NO need to spend them on anything ever again and I've only spent the initial purchase price for this game.  THIS GAME IS NOT PAY TO WIN.  I have never paid a dime past the purchase price and I currently own 8 level 40 dragons and 6 elite units ALL earned from questing/pvpThis is the definition of pay-to-save-time.  Everyone is on an even playingfield here.  The cash shop is ONLY there as an option to provide extra support to the project while allowing yourself to get these units/walls/upgrades without putting in the minimal effort needed to otherwise do so.Some of the Cons:  (Sorry indie game, all games got em and nobody is paying me to say otherwise :p)Graphics:  Dated, to say the least.  While the assets on the map and the cities look great, the up close graphics of the units are OLD.  They look like Dungeon siege 2 units.   That said, just look at the screenshots, what are you doing so zoomed in to be staring at one unit for ANYWAY?   Well, cause a good portion of the game is talking and you are forced to see this.  Otherwise you'd never really notice it.Pathfinding:  This is currently not great.  You tell units to go to a place and most of them will fairly quickly after, but it definitely leaves a lot to be desired.  That said, the free expansion coming out this month is called the 'Arcana and Pathfinding' update.  So yeah.Glitches:  Every game has it's issues... this one has troubles with finding coop groups if you have attack protection on, units will get stuck in places they shouldn't be allowed to even go, you might have an instance where a resource vanishes after pvping.   That said, the staff is very quick and courteous to get back to you.  It might take a couple days to line everything up, but they are great at communication as long as you use the proper channels.No you?! Currently the games biggest flaw... Where are you?   We need more players to join in the fun!			"

												You have to pay money to unlock core aspects of the game, including the actual Campaign and Skirmish modes. Now, I have no problem with DLC, or even microtransactions, as long as you're getting something ADDITIONAL to an otherwise well-featured game. But this is just penny-pinching here. They've clearly stripped several aspects of the game away, and then forced you to pay to unlock core features.This is basically the PC equivalent of ""on-disc DLC.""			"

												Such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ free game to be honest, I've played other free games on here and Ive never been so disgusted by this game. Poor unit support, poor unit placement support, poor unit feedback support the game is just so shtty overall. I dont mind paying a buck or two or even $10 for a game that actually works MOST of the time rather than half the time. This game isn't really ""free"" and they say it isn't pay to win but that isn't really the case. This game in fact is CLEARLY A PAY 2 WIN because you can buy the ingame currency(crowns) for cash and enhance your army/city way faster than a freebie player would. Honestly don't play this game, this is coming from an avid RTS gamer and sadly there aren't many great free RTS games here on steam. Full of bugs too, it's really annoying. KW 2 is coming out so the devs won't have time to fix this sht. So if you actually waste time and money on this game I feel sorry for you. Do yourself a favour and save some valuable time and money. Don't play this horse sht.			"

												Well....i like town building - war mongering games. From basic ones like Travian, to complex ones like Dawn of Fantasy , Clash of Clans and else.Dawn of Fantasy is a good game, but i am skeptical to say its worthwhile.three points kill this game : First : Combat is stupid and bad...its frustrating to play, units are dumb, combat is slow, you need no strategy most of times...its plain, dull and boring.2- Pay2Win, crowns when i first saw them and got them from missions made me happy, then i realized that most things need crowns and even if you keep repeating boring missions or pvp you will never have enough.3-Low building diversity, your castle is pretty, you have like 20 slots to build in each area..and  like 8 buildings...its odd, seems like its a broken system, i cant explain.So...if you compare the gameplay of travian or clash of clans, this game is horrible....its just has some cool graphics, pretty town and world map....overall i would give a ...well, sorry a 4 of 10.

												DONT BUY THIS GAME!!!Almost everything but the most basic things cost you crowns, you get crowns by spending real money to buy them. Upgrading your basic buildings, cost crowns, make a wall around city, costs crowns, upgrade resorce storage, cost crowns. And the building upgrades don't unlock more uints it just makes things cost less or take less time.			"

												Sadly this game is just not my cup of tea. Graphics are very old, it takes too long to do anything interesting, and the ui is confusing and slow to the point of near uselessness. It looks about as good as Dark Reign 2 and slighty better than Stronghold 1			"

												This game was great when it was first released from greenlight (Dawn of Fantasy), i even voted for it to be released from greenlight, then the devs changed everything and made it only multiplayer.... i was in the middle of the single play campain when the single player was taken away from the game. Now its a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ multiplayer , slightly better graphics version of clash of clans for pc.... and i paid $30 for this ♥♥♥♥,at least give me the 2nd one for free since i paid for the first one.			"

												I loved the game all the buildings and game mechanics and aspects the open world for you to explore. this game is a great RTS game except the unit counts and pvp players with over payed for units. ok it comes down to for pvp who has the most elite units doesnt matter how many units you have at a city when a player attacks the computer decides out of your 150 unit type army which 50 are going to defend while the other 100 different unit types can do nothing as a group of 50 elite units destroy your 40 hours of game play you have put into building your magnificent town and you get to watch it pillaged and burnt to the ground this game is completely unrealistic and ♥♥♥♥ unit mechanics as to who can fight in a battle their should be a max global unit count for all your units and all should be able to attend a battle if they are present for battle. for this I never played the game again and rate it 0/10 if they just fixed that mechanic i would still be playing today and rate the game a 8-9/10			"

												Edit: Changing this review to negative. They updated there game and it wiped my city, admins said theres nothing they can do about it and i should be happy i got a free fully upgraded city when the whole game revolves around you BUILDING the city.PvP and Co-op is horribly laggy and litterally is 2 steps forward and one back, and soldiers dont listen to any order you give them and just wander off on there own.I can forgive strange bugs, resource glitches, men literally walking in the air, units being hit through walls, bad hit detection but wiping my city i spent over 70 hours on, and telling me theres nothing they can do is unforgivable.

												Dont bother with this game, the JACKED it the ♥♥♥♥ up. You cant gather resources while offline... Atleast that is what i am now experiencing after weeks worth of play... Due to my job I can play every day so i require resource gathering while i am not online.  What a waste of money...... Ontop of that, the army rating mechanism is very unbalnced... Using my medium lvl army (large, yet medium lvl) against a small high lvl army (lvl 60 royal dragon which is a very vertran unit) got entirely annilated by just the dragon..... and it happens time and again in any for of pvp.  What a waste of money.			"

												The previews boast of this game being more than it actually is to begin with; which isn't uncommon on Steam, so I'll forgive the developers for that. There's a wicked learning curve which always drives me away from games quickly, but I may give this some more time to get into what is shown on the Store page.I was expecting a more ""Total War"" genre of game which I see it is, but takes a long while to get there.Additionally: Anyone interested in security will be horrified to know that they store your game password as Plain text!!!

												I really want to like this game.Great pvp setupCo-op Sieges are the bees kneesdoes NOT feel like a 'pay-to-win'I found the base-building enjoyableBalanced tech tree / costsI have just ran into too many issues that leave me more frustrated than satisfied. Formations don't saveStandground doesn't always make units stand ground.I can't assign troops to Ctrl+[7-9]units stack infinitelyunbalanced unitsSo I end up loving the game until battles start getting intense and it becomes an uphill fight just to manage the army from running off after one unbalanced unit as it just casually walks past all my frontline to archers/siege-equipment. Feels pointless to worry about actual tactics the way the units can stack (just put tanks on top of pikes on top of healers on top of dps etc). Also found that reinforcements on a 'very-easy' level to be equal in challenge to a 'hard' level so that was also very off-putting. I can't expect this game's mechanics to play fair and thus cannot reccomend this to the public.			"

												Original: if you liked midieval/fantasy, and or love RTS games, this is for you. the work and difficulty of just putting up a wooden wall is tremendous, making it all the more glorious. 9/10 would reccomendEdit: I have to say i can no longer reccommend this game. it was fun, but then a tragedy occured... a tragedy i like to call... ""The Great Nerfing"". It started out like any other day, i hopped on and logged into my kingdom ""Hitlers work camps"", to notice work camps had been nerfed... later i found out that you could no longer sell units for money as in slaves and workers, then i found that crowns had been made even more rare, the one currency that makes this online world go round, all in the space of 3 days. i present to you, the GOTY, nerfsville. The devs should fix the bugs and rework the game before they start nerfing all of our tactics. Oh! i forgot to mention, all the large towns and villages you see on the title screen? they aren't player created. those are npc towns that they will most likely make you fight and destroy if you want to progress in the game. yep! your gonna fight that large wall with archers and catapults lining its top, with a little less then a catapult or two and some knights. good luck and dont win.

												Played this game a while ago because it promised a lot of things... and it didn't deliver on those promises.  I could sit here and type out a really long review, but I'm just not motivated to do so.  The game was just so uninteresting and just so time-consuming that I hated it.  The pay-to-win design takes away any sense of accomplishment and ruins the competitive nature of the strategy component.  What's worse is that the game tries to be an MMOG in all the wrong ways.  The expansions make no sense at all and should really just be considered game updates instead, but the devs behind this game do not seem to have common sense.			"

												Unplayable, the mouse is frozen on the menu screen.  Looking over the forums, the solutions range from reinstalling the OS, to reinstalling mouse drivers, or some mice work and others dont.  Ugh, when every other game almost on PC works with a  mouse and this game doesnt.  Its the game thats broken not the user's computer.  Who knows if this game is any good?  Who cares anyways, if the dev couldnt be bothered to even make a mouse work, it kinda says alot about the rest of the game.Rating:  0/10  Value:  $0.00			"

At the moment the multiplayer function is not even working, it says 'Connection timed out', I assume this is because their servers are overwhelmed as it's Steam's deal of the day and on sale for 75% off.

												To all who plan on playing this as a fun strategy game, I highly discourage it. I purchased this game about a year ago and the game had a great idea and setup to it. problem is, I paid $20 for this game so I exspect the full version. I came to find out that literally everything you do from building to upgrading cost acutal money. PLUS, in the latest update they introduced ""premium gaming"". Now you have to pay more money in order to get the full game. Unless you have hundreds of dollars to throw away at a, at most, decent game, go look for a different game to buy. A game that doesn't cost money upfront also money later on.			"

												Edit: Issue fixed, I'll have to give it a try some time soon.The game would probably be good if resource gathering early on wasn't so slow. Progressing is as slow as the pace of the game - it's not really a RTS when you have to wait so long on upgrades and things.Even though it is a MMO, it keeps you waiting too long; why not allow everyone to progress faster?However, if you have the time to spare and enjoy slow paced games, then go ahead and try it.

												This game could be good.. it COULD be, instead it highly sucks for few reasons:1. There is no unit collision, you don't understand anything in battles and you can't even defend walls cause there's no unit collision, we're in 2014 ffs.2. Graphics really sucks. I am not a guy who looks at graphics, but in this game you can't even set the resolution, there's no antialiasing, shadows keep moving, models and textures are fine instead.3. You can't place buildings/walls where you want, there are ""pre-made places"" where you can choose what to build, and in an ""RTS"" this sucks really hard.4. MOST IMPORTANT... You have to wait DAYS to get some resources, and yes REAL DAYS. Look, I just went to fight the army of a bot cause of a quest, my men all died, and to make the army again I should wait real days. If you get like 25 units of paesants to cut wood at the same time, in an entire day it will give you 5000 wood more or less, and you spend it all in 10 seconds. Same for food and gold. Making the army requires food and gold, and it's really really really slow.5. Formations... I would like to ""customize"" more the formations of the units, like in a Total War game, I really don't like it how it is now.. and by the way, without collisions and stuff, battles are just a massive charge and the more outnumbered wins...I won't play this game anymore untill the developers improve these points, I had literally no fun playing this game, I don't want to wait days to get some resources, and I really don't like those other bad points I listed.This game could have potential, I hope the devs start fixing at least these 5 points.

												As the famous Mon Calamari Admiral would say: ""IT'S A TRAP!"". This Freemium Frankenstein is not worth even the time invested, no matter how many in-game purchases of some crappy reskin of your lame hero. Slow loading screen, travel, and combat, lack of immersion, absolutely irritating unit responses when you assign them a task, (Your hero uses the word ""bloody"" in every sentence like its his job). I do however like the ideas and concepts behind this game. It reminds me of Battle for Middle Earth combined with the Stronghold Series, BUT THEY WORKED! This game is trying to be too many things at once and overwhelms the player from the very beginning.This game needs an excessive amount of work. I personally consider Clash of Clans and its vile offspring not games but money-raking, waste of time, mediocre pieces of garbage. I feel this game is trying to incorporate that into the wonderful genre of RTS. No no no. Don't give this game a chance,  IT'S A TRAP!			"

												This game now sucks... i played the game long befor the change to free to play and it was 100 times better than now. the devs would help via team speack, they said they would say that their was new racees coming out but because for some reason they changed the game to a pay to win it SUCKS. Never play this game dont pay anything for this game it is not worth it any more. So Go F*** your selfes devs, you ruined this game for me so now i wont even play the game its so bad... thats why the 30 some odd hours i played were a wate of my life!!!			"

												Not pay to win, but it is pay to play. To research almost anything you need Crowns, Wealth, or Influence, synonyms for Premium Currency. You gain this by doing quests, but you gain 1-2 per quest. You can gain them through PVP or PVE, but you get 1-2 per quest. To build walls around your town you need 32 Crowns. Increasing worker speed? 8 Crowns. It's not worth the grinding, and the grinding is required. I'd rather they just stick a price-tag on it and let me build my walls in peace.			"

												Take stronghold add huge amount of waiting from browser games like travian and you get this... the game could be fun if they could fix all bugs and give player UI that would actually work and give you some info on whats going on on the screen... for pretty much everything in the game you need currency called crowns (earlier it was cash shop currency but thank god P2W got removed). You need to buy crowns for 3k gold each or earn them from quests or fighting online with your armies or cities but the amount of crowns you need just to build walls is ridicullous and when you actually build them your attack protection will start to count down and then you become someones farm... income bar is bugged as hell and its critical problem when you try to play elves bcs they get everything from income... not even gonna start on units AI its pathfinding is fine but the rest is terible. The game is kinda fun but sometimes it feels like pretty much everithing in the game is working agains player and so my thumb is down at least for now if your looking for RTS just run away.			"

												Basically this game is Total War with fantasy Units, one city for your income instead of many provinces and much more buggy play. It is an interesting idea and you can tell that the developers wanted to make a game which provided many options for making an army. there are 3 types of armour and damage and all can be upgraded as well as many special abilities. However, all these good ideas are frustrated by problems with basic coding. My starter quest as the Orc Desert race broke and only completed itself days later. Many times when I have multiple unit groups selected, it won't let me select an individual one without deselecting and reselecting the group. When I'm attacking an enemy stronghold, if I target the enemy units on the wall, my units groups will just stand at the wall all around the wall. I can order the units to move onto the wall and they will. However, if I order them to move onto the wall and then to attack the units on the wall, they will move back down to the ground and stand there. I tried a few battles and the same problem happened. With such a fundamental aspect of the game being so broken I quit playing. If they fix these basic issues, I would reccommend this as a fun game. However, there are too many basic issues which make the game frustrating.			"

												Dawn of Fantasy - Kingdom Wars, is an amazingly fun game that makes you want to come back to play more. This RTS (Real time strategy) game is one of the best in its category for free to play,and  even pay to play games. You can ethier go solo or coop in a quest/siege. This game allows you to form your own army however you want, with whatever kind of troop you desire. Every unit in the game available to be bought by everyone. The only pay to play part about this game is the optional customization and premium. The community in Kingdom Wars is superb, almost everyone in the game likes to cooperate with each other. The [Dev] Developers and [Mod} Moderators in this game is always active and is willing to help out with your issues and questions. The major reason why this game isnt perfect is because of the connection lag issue during sieges, and the excessive amount of bugs and glitches within the game. Although this may be true, the developers and moderators are constantly trying to fix these problems. Lastly, this game is constantly updated with new features and new things to try out. In total, i believe that this game is worth the try.			"

												Not a perfect game by any means, but, there are few MMORTS's on the market, and this is definitely one of the better ones I've found. A bit strange with the micro-transactions... but overall pretty fair. Most of the store offers just cosmetic stuff, of which isn't insanely priced, and it doesn't immediately toss ""BUY THIS NOW!"" content the moment you start, which is good. I did find it odd, but somewhat understandable that the Singleplayer options were PTP. Graphics aren't terrible, and I can see why people are reminded of Total War and other such RTS's. The AI are pretty decent, on par with what I would consider standard for a free RTS. The community is friendly as well, which was a plus. All that said, there were some bugs I noticed such as units getting stuck in places without easy ways of getting them out, and ""Crowns"" (The in-game currency that's rare) permanently getting lost when cancelling unit builds. I haven't played for very long, but I can immediately tell it's not a terrible game.All in all, I'd give it a 7 or 8/10			"

												The worst game i have ever seen. Plays like a game made about 30 years ago. I took it for a game that you build an army and attack others but it is the lamest thing i have ever seen in my life. The system of play is the worst thing you will ever see in a game. Slow game play, like real real slow and hard to figur out so you stop playing after an hour of doing nothing. They do make it look great and but once you see it you see why i say so many bad things about it. Its nothing like what you hope for with what is seen from the videos. If you seek a better way to see it youtube the videos of the game play and see what i am talking about. Never pay for this game or you will hate that you did. I am mad i spent only 5$ on it and wish for a refund but dont think that is possible. Do NOT PAY for this game! Trust me on this, you will cry about it after if you do.			"

												I can't bring myself to recommend this game.  First off, I bought it only to find out 2 minutes later that the game is going free to play. The fix to that was your town goes Elite(what ever that is haven't seen an explanation, maybe your city cant be destroyed?) and they give you 30 days premium(i think you just get more crowns which is Game Premium Store currency) and you can have 5 towns slots(seems silly as my 1 town can't even function) Also game just poped up on BundleStars for 3.99, seem like they are trying to milk every drop then can before it goes F2P which will be end of Sept(2014) Supposedly.The Good-I Bought the game because it looked good, Has  single and multiplayer gameplay, the campain would definatly help you learn more about the multiplayer.-The Small tight knit community(which will get bigger more than likely) seems very active but thats easy cause theres only 50 approx active players currently.-The Dev team seems eager to get the game working/fixed and updated which is really nice-Has a RPG?RTS feel as you have a Hero character that handles questing in game, very nice and really liked that feature, takes it away from being a grind resources RTS and gives you something else to play with.The Bad.-Currently im estimating around 50 active players, havn't seen more than 30 at 1 time-BUGS BUGS BUGS, oh my is it buggy, In 3 days my 30 peasants mining stone only mananged to mine 5 stone(the hell), it doesnt register alot of what your workers are doing and money comes pretty easy but it only really usefull at the markets.-Room for soldiers, while doing the tutorial, you will find they don't adiquatly explain what all you need for a mission and more than likely, like me, you will get stuck with a cow that eats all your gold and can't carry anything, and then when you figure it out and get what you need. You will find that not 100% of the guys that came out of the city can fit back in(in a span of maybe 2 min )-The graphics aren't very good(they may be updating it). Currently the games graphics really hurt my eyes, it's not that they are bad graphics persay for an RTS , but its very bright and gritty looking. You cannot zoom in very far and the Character models and Character textures are really bad, probly why you cannot zoom in far enough(this is on highest graphic setting, on a machine that run Skyrim, Cryisis 3, Farcry 3, TItanfall ect on Ultra/Maximum with mods).Overall: The game isn't bad and it's still evolving with the soon to be F2P version. It has alot of good ideas and alot of potential to be more than a RPG version of Evony. They do claim that the game isn't going to be pay to win, though will be able to buy immortal units with the Crowns that you can buy, plus resource boosters ect so sounds a little pay to win. IMO not worth the 5 dollars for the extras they give you, or the 3.99 on bundlestars. Feel free to give it a try when the game goes F2P, but save your 5 bucks for Batman(which is onsale for 5 bucks at the moment).			"

												Hahaha, the reviews are entirely biased. If you want a laggy, horrible graphiced and programmed game, buy this by all means. 1/10 here. For a 2013 game, the engine is an insult to what games have came out in the past 2-3 years.  There is no melee options for archers making them completely useless on ground combat, you have to press 3 buttons to get your troops to run and this genre of game only exists on Mobile games.  25 minutes for a barracks? haha, go ♥♥♥♥ yourself. STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS GAME! AND THE GENRE IS GENERAL!			"

												Well I installed the game and found out that the Dev's who created this game decided to be lazy and not imput multiple resolution modes even with putting the game at a lower resolution (lower then 1920 x 1080 its still full screen mode). That alone is a game killer to me espeically when alot of people have older machines (like myself) the ability to make the game into a windowed mode takes away alot of the stress on the machine. My computer is not that old but still even though I set the game at 1280 x 720 it was still playing the game in full screen mode even though I had also checked the window mode option therefore my computer was getting really hot. All games have options to put the game into a windowed one and the fact that the Dev's are making the excuse saying ""the majority of players didnt like how the windowed mode looks"" is not only a ""lazy"" excuse its makes it so that players with older machines are not able to play the game. Now I know I only have about 13 minutes with the game hell I havent even started playing the game just going through the process of setting up the city and having the graphics on the lowest that they can be at was making my gpu hot (over 160 and was still raising when I alt/tab out). I am able to play World of Warcraft Rift hell even Defiance and thats because those games the Dev's choose to not force only full screen mode on the players. It would be best if all people that have older machines to stay away from this game (unless you want to chance your video card getting fried even on the lowest of settings) until the dev's decide to put an option for a windowed mode (not full screen window mode but an actual smaller window). I am certainly not willing to fry my video card just because the dev's are unwilling to make an option for a windowed mode.			"

												Not a bad take on the pay 2 win browser game.I've played a version of this before that was missing the actual RTS which makes this a refreshing difference from the previous entries I have played.Its still pay2win at the core, crowns, can be bought for real money and used to pay down wait timers... thats the very core of pay2win. It is just not aggresively monetized. During the first few hours you might feel a little pinched and desperate maybe wanting to buy those crowns, but that pressure alleviates soon enough.The core game is simple and offered some challenge but I found myself bored by the same basic strategies. Fun enough but too much time waiting.			"

												Main problem is that after paying for this game is it became free to play, second is that the single player mode somehow became DLC locked behind some infamous $$$.Menus are a bit confusing at the start and gameplay is long and grindy, and i mean Looooooooooong.It took me a month to unlock my first wizard, wizard of the deep since i wanted electricity for style, well, all their perks are halved, there frail like glass, they don't use basic ranged attacks but a sword for such a glass unit, and you have to unlock ALL their spells whice will take longer then they did in the first place, also you have to level them up and no perks apply to them from kingdom creation, 3000 health and i think 47 or something stamina when my average unit has 9000 health and 250 stamina.In fantasy games i like wizards and sorcerers and mages. these are lame knockoffs and pretty $hitful to use in such a game like this.I like my mages to be magical, because a wizard with a sword chargeing into battle to Level Up IS NOT a wizard its a frail old fool with a pointy stick chargeing dwarven riflemen. and with an improved 60 levels to grind through (Minus 1 level per death) i think il finish my intire fortress by the time it can use the single spell i want him to.Oh yeah, warning to people who don't know, Wizards cannot take part in quests, i waited... for nothing.As for this game being not pay 2 win thats only half right since you can still get premium whice unlocks high tier units for you faster and booster packs to resources and such :<.2/10 i want my 20$ back			"

												Interesting idea at the beginning but at some point it becomes too exhaustive to deal with all bugs and known issues, which a numerous. Disappearing units, disappearing resources, stuck units, duplicating units. You can build resource camp and supply it with peasants for several hours and fild it missing next day. Units got damaged for no known reason while moving or idling on the map. Created new army, added hero there and 1000 coins - coins started to disapper right on my eyes in hundreds while game displayed ~ -300/min income rate.			"

												I realize this is for if I recommend a game or not, but now its an opinionative piece. I haven't played very much of this game, about an hour 1/2. The game is great and for a free to play it can't be beat on its genre. It is on par with everything else. But there is just one nasty problem that I can't get over; it is SLOW. Your units move slow, the actions you give them are slow, the way they march is sluggish, there is some lag between commands on your troops, etc. Complain complain sorry haha. The base building is quite fun but the best stuff requires microtransactions so I am a tad disappointed. I guess what I'm trying to say is that this game wasn't for me, but I can see the booming potential of it for others. If I could have all my wishes granted, I would ask the game designers to work on how fluid combat and movement is, since they have clearly gone above and beyond in base-building. It is a good game that is rough around the edges. End of story. I will periodically check on it from time to time as it improves.			"

												2014/10/26I cannot recommend this game.The beginning is weird, kinda funny and really rewarding, especially with the economy its quite nice but then you´ll see that the game is very unpolished. The graphics look like the game is from like 2004 or earlier and even laggs on high end systems sometimes or units begin to rather glitch instead of proper walking sometimes. The combat looks fun from the outside but stuff is actually rather annoying and hard to control/select. When I have my hometown with my combat units and they are scattered arround I cannot simply select them all easily via a shortcut or an icon. There are icons for them but shortcuts like SHIFT and such do not work, control groups exist though. It is rather annoying that I cant even mass-build stuff because it cancels the building menu after every building and I cant shift build either, its annoying as hell which made me quit the game in the end after playing a little. I dont want to build up like this when the controls are rather annoying than good, for players who have much patience it might be something because I did had my fun till a certain point.			"

												I don't usually write reviews of any type for games, as I simply do not have the time.  But today, I simply must.  As for the game, it was fun the first 24hrs of game play, but then it became rather tedious.  As any gamer looking to rapidly advance, I purchased through their micro transaction store, the available boosters (which by the way, are only available once per City, so don't count on going very far without help).  And then today, I was sieged.  Before I begin with this, let me tell you about the good and bad.The good:Animations are good as far as details.provides a pve based scenario for you to have a sense of achievement and as well to grant you advancement in progression. The bad:Random Crashes while entering scenarios.The community is not inviting and at no time while attempting to communicate did they ever respond.Hackers are definitely prevalent and ruin a possibly good game.  I do not believe that they have any preventative measures against this.During siege it will state that you have the upper hand, all the while you are over run by armies of undertrained hoardes, rendering all your hard work, gone.  Graphics freezes, glitches like npc's and hero's randomly walking through or on water, or other impassable objects.And at Last, siege battle is more of a grab by overpowered players, or by hacks (which by the way we cannot tell but it is so very obvious when your games framerate drops to nearly zero and all the sudden you have a hundred troops at your door) so why bother?So with that being said, if you enjoy Glitch Glitch Glitch, restart restart restart, and being hacked to death by a uncaring community, then by all means, buy the game.

												So the game itself is pretty decent, it has multiple army slots you can use to customize some beastly forces, and not getting attacked while offline is a huge perk. After playing, it has only one real flaw I've noticed, outside of the pathing glitches.. The game allows you to type in a players name to select them as your target. And this is by far the worst idea. Trying to get some friends to play with me, helping them out to try and attack some small NPC towns and I end up getting constantly attacked by the same people, typing my name in to try to make me roll over and give up resources, or fight them, lose a bulk of my army in combat, and have to rebuild to get back to the point of helping my friends, just to be attacked by the same people because they can just type my name in.

												a game with alot of potential  and succesful progress over the time i observed and played the game. but has yet to reach the tip of the unique genre that is. i do recommend this game to all my friends though. its a unique experience unlike any other i've played to date when it comes to RPG and RTS elements in one. i hope to see the game fullfill its destiny. :D			"

												Best game I have ever known in RTS genre because of its combination with Total Wars, kinda a third age Lord of the Rings game and also stronghold Crusaders that combines not only weapons, and strategy; Build a Fort, Guilds, train, upgrade, do some amazing quests that you will want them to be repeated again, defend from enemies, select where to be in a forest, dessert, hills, or mountains, select your race; Human, Elf, Orc and theres almost no need of a powerful computer at least Intel Core i3 for the moment thank God we can disable Fog and smoke so frames dont go down and enjoy the game its pretty addictive for the moment.

												All in all, an almost decent game. i would love it and play it more, except that it likes to crash... a lot. U.I. is simple and works decently. What killed the experience for me really though? Bad coding causes the game to run like crap even on a decent gaming rig. As i mentioned before, it crashes for literally no reason, and there's no fixing it so certain aspects of the game cannot be played. In large scale battles, troops dont really follow commands well if at all which makes coordinated attacks almost impossible and renders any sort of strategy useless. You have to pay money to rename your character or have even a basic sort of customization. Sadly, this feels like a half-♥♥♥♥♥ project that was put to the side and never really finished and is now just another ""Early-Access gone micro transaction"" game that will never be finished.			"

												Although it truely is a great game, the amount of f**king glitches makes me want to kill somebody. Finally got over 1000 points on an army and sieged... almost won the battle, and then all my knights started bouncing and glitching and the game crashed! Battle was lost! Most units died and the army went down to only being worth 300!			"

												Not that interesting game. Feels like some of the those mobile games where you build a castle and are able to increase. I think I had to much of a Total war image in my head just with quests and building castles.But nope not even close to Total war series. Also the graphic could have been better.I like the basic idea with elves, men and orcs. (Not so much that the elves are able to train dwarves...)But the MMO thing are not that suitable for these type of games.			"

												Can't tell you if it's a good game or not.  I encountered a Win10 glitch where you can't see the mouse pointer, which renders the game unplayable.  ::shrugs:: probably Win10s fault and not the game devs, but hey just so you know!			"
