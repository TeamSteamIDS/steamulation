												What can you say.  Its Graviteam Tactics...  Either you love it, hate it, confuses you or you never heard of it.  Following up Graviteam Tactics: Operation Star is a pair of large britches to fill.   One of the most realistic RTS sort of games out there.  In fact RTS is to shallow a term to use to describe Mius Front or Operation Star.  Battalion level simulator is more apt a description.  Unlike the dark days for the Red Army in 1942 to early 1943 that Operation Star depicts, Mius Front is summer 1943.  The Red Army is on the offensive, everywhere.  As this takes place after Kursk for the most part and a bit south of that epic clash, the Wehrmacht is on the fence and no longer is the Red Army just trying to hold ground.  Its time to start taking things back.So whats different?   Most game assets have gotten a face lift.  GTOS looked good, this looks better.  A heck of a lot has changed.  THe UI, a new Artillery ribbon with lots of nasty shells to select for off screen guns,   air power comes in gaint flights and is MUCH more lethal and of course some new tanks, armored cars, and an anti tank gun.  The morphing land that got Steel Armor: Blaze of Wars tracks digging into the ground.  Watch your hapless tank in bad ground dig itself into the ground if you ordered it somewhere stupid, like a marsh.  A new tutorial system that while basic, gets the point across for the junior Hans Guderian in us all.    The game is based on reality.  Do not expect an army of Tiger tanks everywhere.  The Germans only made around 1300 of them.  Reality takes the front seat.  The land is made from satellite elevation data and it helps that Graviteam is located not far at all from this battle sight.  In the campaigns German and Red Army historical documents where consulted for units and their equipment.  Reality here and truth to history are king.  So do you have what it takes to command multiple companies and battalions?  Well get to it Colonel.....the Army is waiting on you!Edit.  Based on negative reviews....If you are expecting a main streamed RTS click game you totally DO NOT WANT THIS GAME.  This thing is more tacitcal simulation than rock, paper, scissors.  That does not exist here.  Click bait RTS is mindless fun, this is mindful mass murder simulator.			"

												A German artillery spotter attached to a recon unit makes his way to the top of the deserted burial mound, Savur-Mohyla, it's a little after 3.00 am, clouds obscure most of the moons light, but after an hour of squinting through binoculars into the darkness he spots the sillhouette of a Soviet infantry patrol as it crests a ridge to the South, he observes the patrols movement and quietly calculates the best place to hit them.The cable squad, after establishing a wire link with HQ, move quietly away, on their bellies down the back of the Tumulus as the forward observer calls in the fire mission, coordinates, suggested ordinance, fuse settings, 3 shells per gun should do it, he then hunkers down in the deserted trench with the recon platoon scanning the countryside for what sounds like approaching tanks, raises his binoculars, watches and waits.Within minutes confirmation comes through,'Message recieved, fire mission approved, ETA 3 minutes, stand by...'As the Soviets pause for a breather and take a knee close to the junction silence is shattered by the first ranging shell, the flash of high explosive momentarily illuminates the ground, hedgerows and trees about 100 metres to their east, russian voices begin to sound off as they hit the dirt and prepare to face the unknown threat, a couple of smoke grenades are thrown in vain. The German observer quietly calls in his corrections...The second shell explodes feet away from the southernmost soviet squad, fuse set for airburst the shockwave propels molten shrapnel outwards slamming into Earth and flesh, there is panic, men are screaming, the Soviet commander tries to get his platoon to pull back as the spotter whispers into the telephone handset 'perfect, fire at wi...'.. at that very moment a flight of Soviet ground attack aircraft carpet bombs the hilltop killing everyone.10/10 would forget to look up again.If you never heard of this series and you love wargaming, historical RTS, WW2... oh boy are you in for a treat. Warning - this game kills most other RTS type games, once you tasted this beauty the rest just won't do it for you anymore.There is nothing quite like this out there, it's not a traditional RTS, it's an uber realistic battlefield simulator, ballistics, damage, command & communications networks, resupply, weather conditions, day night cycle... all realistically modelled.Massive and accurately recreated battlefields that can be deformed by trenches and ordinance damage.Campaigns based on actual operations and are hisorically accurate to the tiniest details, all the units in the game were there at the time.Operational mode, campaign management, platoon organization, resupply, strategic manouvering.Tactical mode, atmospheric real time battles that look and feel extremely authentic.AI that never does the same thing twice, no 2 operations will ever play out the same way twice, virtually unlimited replayability.A powerful Battle editor that allows you to design and customize  your own battles.Years in the making, compared to its predecessor, the great 'Operation Star' this is a massive leap forwards, the UI, command system, sounds, graphics, optimization have all been significantly improved and numerous new features added.For grognards this is as good as it gets, the developers have a proven track record in supporting their games for years after release, DLC's will come with new operations, new units and new maps, there is even the very tantalizing possibility of multiplayer being added in the future.Don't take my word for it, read the reviews, visit the forum and see what other players think, then pull the trigger, buy it, this is the one!

												Graviteam Tactics: Mius-Front comes closer than any other game I have yet played to representing the complex situational challenges of the battlefield. It is a superb game, limited only by a weak marketing, that every serious war gamer should definitely have in his or her stable. Graviteam has clearly been designed by a team with a deep understanding of military tactics and a passion for realism and historical accuracy. I can't praise the game highly enough and I can only say to those of you who have not yet purchased it, or who gave up on Graviteam because of its complexity, that you are missing out on the opportunity to experience and contribute to the finest war simulation ever made.

												There is an amazing game in here. You just have to find it.I want you to look at the highest rated pictures for Graviteam Mius. That is how the game feels once you learn to play it. But you have to learn it, and it takes time, and before you do it won't look or play at all how the pictures feel. When I first bought Graviteam's other game, Operation Star, I had heard good things about it but was sorely dissapointed the first couple times I tried playing. It just didn't seem to ""have it"". I let it go for a couple months.But then I came back, and really tried to learn it. Turns out, I was completely wrong. If you like WW2 and strategy, it's a crime not to devote a couple hours to learning this game if you can. It's one of, if not the best. You just have to give it time, and you will be rewarded.			"

												Its GTT, major AI improvements, all HD textures, vast armies, huge maps, improved reinforcement, improved (? still not totally sold) command interface and operations phase. To any armchair general who hasnt yet played GTT, buy it now! Spend some time to re-educate yourself, persevere, its a mysterious beast to begin with, then be prepared for the most accurately recreated ""organic"" warfare available on PC. This is a game where every battle has its heros, dissapointments and successes.  Tactics work! You swing the battle to your favor, adjust, reinforce, withdraw or hold the line, not just 1,2,3 win, battles flow like everything you have read about in the history books. Wanna set up a rolling defence with a counter attack? Can do! Wanna have a solid frontline with some mobile fire teams? Can do! Need to replace that platoon running low on ammo with a reserve? Can do! Wanna bite your nails as your last Marder side slips into a ditch leaving your infantry to close assault the remaining enemy armour? Can do! Every battle is a story and due to its ""Physics sandbox"" style its never over until its over!You need this game! "

												Probably the best wargame of this scale around. In this game you get the feeling of being a commander, moving companies and platoons: you aren't the micromanaging-wierdo which we see in many games, where an hypotetical ww2 ""general"" go from soldier to soldier telling him where to aim, take cover behind that rock, switch to that grenade. In Mius Front the AI can handle that, and while you can certainly micromanage the placement of an AT gun in an ambush position, or should the need arise command single squad in a platoon, you do it only when you need it.The game has a turn-based operational layer, where you move platoons and manage your force calling reinforcements from your OOB. When the movement phase ends battles are resolved in the tactical mode, where you not only get to move troops in the field, but can also please your eyes at the really nice graphics, unrivalled in a game of this genre, which mantains a solid grip on realism and historical accuracy. In fact OOBs are historically accurate ( you will not see hordes of Tigers) and also gun penetration and vehicle damage mechanics are nicely modelled, without health bars which we see in too many games.Finally a HUGE plus of this game is the non-scripted AI. It's nice playing Combat Mission, but when you fall in that scripted ambush you will never fall for it again. Here nothing is apparently scripted: the AI can make good or stupid decisions, but will never make the same thing again over and over. This make the two campaigns (for each side) more replayable.Do not forget that there is also a battle editor, which allows for the creation of every battle you like using the campaign map.Compared to Operation Star there has been an improvement in the UI and several addictions, like better artillery support managament and tanks laying smoke for infantry to advance behind. Howewer, the sheer amount of content and campaigns of Operation Star with all the DLCs still make it worth buying imho. If i have to complain about something that would be the actual lack of multiplayer (which howewer seems to be added at some point, maybe as a free dlc. There is already a MP option in the menu but only as a placeholder). The learning curve is pretty steep like many games of this genre, and for a newb even with the tutorial it may be hard to get into the game. Also i hope they will make many DLCs like they did with GT:OS.For the techical part, as of now i haven't had a single crash. There are some minor bugs, like two infantry soldier stacking on each other, or the tank sinking in soft ground mechanics which need some work.The game is maybe a little less well optimized than his predecessor, with all things at maximum my GTX 670 can't always mantain 60fps, and in smoke cluster♥♥♥♥s fps can really drop. Still you can scale the graphics with many options.TL;DR version: + best game of this scale+ two layers, operational and tactical+ nice graphics+ good approach (no need for excessive micromanaging)+ not scripted AI+ muh realism- multiplayer still to be added- steep learning curve for newbies of the genre			"

												Where to begin?A wonderful piece of software, made with passion and expertise by a developer that knows the subject matter and strives to recreate the grim reality of commanding men on the field of battle.This is not a wargame, neither is it an RTS, it's a coldly unforgiving battle simulator that does a terrific job of placing the player in the shoes of a battalion commander, this is a game where actual knowledge and understanding of military doctrine and of the tools at yours and your enemies disposal will be advantageous, real world tactics not only work but are necessary in order to succeed.ProsHistorical accuracy.Level of detail is mind blowing, every weapon with all their various types of ordinance behave accordingly. Artillery craters, dead troops and wrecked vehicles/guns from previous engagements litter the battlefield. Fuel and ammo stores are based upon contemporary sources. Artillery strikes must be ranged for effectiveness and fuses can be set for air burst. Line of sight for every single combatant is factored in, including from tank driver periscopes and turret slits. On map artillery and mortars require a commander to have eyes on the target area and lines of communication must be open before they can be properly utilized. Flares can be used to illuminate the night sky, coloured flares and smoke signal the direction of enemy forces among other things. Tank crews repair broken tracks, as tanks burn paint blisters and peels off the surface, ammo stores cook off, fuel tanks explode, when an AT shell strikes a tank it may penentrate depending upon the thickness of the armour plate and the angle of impact etc, the shell may exit harmlessly or bounce around inside, it may remain in tact or break up, if it breaks up what happens to the fragments? do they destroy/damage the crew? the weapon systems? it's all simulated and the story of each impacting projectile can be reviewed and studied after the battle ends, the list it goes on and on... Visually beautiful and extremely atmospheric.Vast and topographically accurate battlefields with deformable terrain, buildings crumble, fences collapse and trees shed their leaves when rocked by a passing tank or concussed by exploding ordinance.Excellent operational phase with many campaign management features.Astonishing focus on realism. Ballistics, damage modelling, troop morale, experience levels, resupply, movement, command and communications systems, ambient factors such as dust, smoke, rain, mud, fog and darkness are all accurately simulated and have appropriate impact upon events and units ability to function.Literally 1000's of modifiable commands.Constantly being patched, improved and refined, active developers who engage (mostly) in a positive way with the community, several times I have seen players post a bug report on the forums only for a patch fixing the issue to appear within hours.Intelligent DLC policy, entire campaigns at fair prices.Unscripted AI which means almost endless replayability.Great battle editor with many tools for influencing AI behaviour, which extends replayability even further.Ability to import/export campaign and custom made battles to and from the community, increasing replayability further still!ConsFor new players to the series there is a learning curve (although personally that almost qualifies as a pro).AI can be derpy (but is also capable of astounding and confounding even the best players).New tactical map system is not to my taste.Infantry skins are well below the high standard of the vehicles, however Nightpostman's skin mod soon fixes this.No multiplayer (although it may make an appearance sometime in the future).Look, we are talking about a very small independent developer with other projects on the go, this masterpiece, this labour of love represents a truly staggering achievement, which frankly puts the paltry offerings of many so called 'Triple A' studios with their multi million dollar budgets to shame.If you are interested in military based strategy and fancy yourself as a master tactician then look no further, there is no better or more satisfying challenge out there.9/10			"

												I'm a fan of the idea of complex strategy games, but I've never really got into one like I have other genres. I've done a fair amount of research into this one, and I felt the need to buy it. Whether or not this is really your bag, I think we should support developers like this.  A small team making something so incredibly deep and beautiful...  It's insane that these guys aren't more widely known.  So many developers with much larger budgets try to do this and fail.  This is the real deal.			"

Posted: November 14, 2016
												(Very) good games are pretty rare nowadays, especially for PC gamers. I have been looking a long time for a game that can hold my attention span for more than 10-20 hours. Few games could, like Fallout: New Vegas, Diablo 3, CoH2 and some others. Lately I’ve rather been collecting games instead of playing them like many others on Steam. Just playing them for a few hours and thinking “no, this is not it…” and ending up with 1.5 – 10 hours played and already getting bored. So which game could pull me in for more than at least 200 hours?When Graviteam Tactics: Mius Front came out I already played around 10 hours on Graviteam Tactics: Operation Star. The controls, the confusion about what’s going on, the lack of a good tutorial, it all added to putting the game down and thinking: “Nice game, but I’m gonna try a few others first”. But when GT:MF came out, I immediately bought it. I guess something in my unconscious, said: “Buy it. Just buy it! And give it another try!” It still took a few months, but after being disappointed by another bunch of games, I started GT:MF, and this time with the determination to not let go before I got the hang of it.And after another 15-20 hours, it struck me thinking: there is absolutely no equivalent to this game when you like RTS war games. GT:MF (and also GT:OS) will leave you speechless. If and only if you persevere the first few hours playing this game. And with “first few” I probably mean the first 100 hours and more. It is so much more than a RTS game, it is a real battlefield simulator. And a damn good one too! Don’t rely on the fact that when you issue orders, your soldiers will simply obey them. If your commander is too far away and you don’t have telephone and wire cables set up, your orders will not be transferred among other things.GT:MF is no click-fest like most other RTS games with intense micro management. No, it focuses on careful planning, creating strategies, coordinating combined forces of infantry, cavalry and anti-tank units, setting up defenses, entrenchments, fire archs, calling in air strikes or artillery, which shells to use, reinforcing units, line of sight etc, etc, etc. Everything is done during three phases: the strategic, the deployment and the operational phase.Replenished your units and carefully planned your defenses during the strategic and deployment phase? Well, you can bet the AI will try to circumvent you and attack from completely other directions you thought they would attack. When you thought they only had a few tanks, suddenly there are ten T34’s crushing your only three PAK’s you set up in the villages of Marinovka or Stepanovka. Key points can switch hands multiple times during the campaign.Because the campaign is long! Very long! I only played part of the Marinovka – Stepanovka campaign as Germans and I am still playing it. After reinforcing my units at strategic phase Turn 1, the Soviets attacked my positions from… Well, almost f****** everywhere!  All these battles you have to fight before you can replenish your troops and start Turn 2. I played for 20 hours now and I am still in Turn 2. No campaign will be the same, so the amount of replayability is huge!GT developers made it possible to transfer your units under AI command and I must admit, I do that a lot. But when the Russians come too close I take over command. But the AI is smart and you can sometimes sit back, relax and watch all hell break loose. Most of the time I use the “helicopter view” to direct my troops, but when you zoom in, the physics of the explosions and hits are so good. I always zoom in after the battle to see the statistics and devastation on the battlefield. You can watch the statistics to see which hit did most damage and which hit knocked out that tank or PAK or whatever. Which brings me to the level of detail.The game is so insanely detailed: everything is carefully crafted and added to the game: weapons, calibers, tanks, anti-tank, artillery, armour penetration diagrams (ridiculously detailed), ammunition, morale, command level etc, etc, etc. If you’re a World War 2 / history fanatic like me then this is definitely a (no, THE) game for you.Another thing to mention are the carefully crafted environments and staff maps. Heights play an important role and you better plan your strategies based on these on the information on these staff maps. It is all there on the maps: the gullies, hills, rivers, woods, farms, bridges. I immediately believe it if they say it is exactly the same as it was in 1943. The surroundings, the atmosphere, the tension during night battles with tracers flying everywhere. Man, this is a tactical wargame! Nothing comes close and all other wargames are redundant / unessential for me now. I am not saying other RTS war games are rubbish but no game can ever live up to the standards of this one for me.DLC will bring you new campaigns and I just bought Dawn of Blau as well as a few other expansions for GT:OS (some depict the Afghanistan campaign and one does the conflict in Angola bringing you new tanks and units). Do I need it right now? No, but the DLC for GT:OS is sometimes on sale like it was this weekend. Was the DLC for GT:MF also for sale? No, but these developers deserve my money for this one. This is the game I was looking for to sink more than 200 hours in. And I will!Most of the stuff I found out myself. But if you’re stuck or confused (and you will get stuck or get confused in the beginning) there are plenty of good tutorials on YouTube. I recommend the tutorials from Arch Warhammer or Agrippa Maxentius. They explain a lot and it’s worth to put some time into watching these videos as they make it a lot easier to get into the game. Be as tenacious as the Germans or the Soviets in this game and you will be rewarded with some very memorable moments. After twenty hours I can’t count them anymore as I won and lost various battles but each and everyone of these battles had it’s share of the finest moments in my overall gaming experience.I am still confused about some partsof the game: buttons, movements by the AI, artillery strikes off target although I planned it carefully, replenishment of troops and lots and lots of other things. But never ever has an RTS game with a slow pace given me so much excitement and joy. It keeps me on the edge of my seat and I found myself sometimes staring at the screen whispering: “Take out that bloody T34, for heavens sake!”Totally and highly recommended! I can not praise this game / these games and the developers enough! I already collected some medals during battles but if there was one with the Order of the Ukraine, it should be pinned on the chests of these wonderful men and / or women of this game studio. You deserve it!10/10 Masterpiece			"

												Graviteam Tactics: Mius-Front is a good game, even a excellent game. But that doesn't mean it's a easy game, it is a terrifically horrifically tremendously hard game. One does not simply win a battle in Graviteam Tactics: Mius-Front. Even if you do win, the cost will be high.Graviteam Tactics has improved a lot since Graviteam Tactics: Operation Star. Let's start with the graphics, they are very, if not tremendously satisfying, just looking at Infantry walking to the front lines makes you want to go with them and see what they are going to do. The graphics make screenshots look like 18th century war art (not in a bad way). It is just superb, well done Graviteam *claps*. Secondly the animations, they are wonderful, they are one of the most realistic movements, but they do become unrealistic when they either go through terrain or when they just switch to the other pose so rapidly that it just looks like a mess, but it is getting better.Thirdly the gameplay (I am missing out 'music' because there isn't much music in the game, though it is wonderful), the gameplay is a stockpile of fun, very good, wonderful even. I like when some of your men lay down covering fire and the rest charge, it just makes a epic cinematic (you do that with ctrl + back). In addition you can have allies/team mates (in the campaign as well). That's not all, you can make your own custom battles with the Battle Editor, just very well done Graviteam, GG.But something to note is that there is bugs and the AI is weak and easy to exploit (unless you are a new player). One time it had the overall advantage, outnumbering me and entrenched on a hill, but it surrendered.For this I rate it a 9.7/10 and if you like WW2 RTSs like CoH or MoW and your looking for a challenge I recommend it (for MoW veterans I highly recommend it)!If they make multiplayer and do a Liberation of France Expansion, would be the best game ever, even HL3 can't beat it.Some epic ingame screenshots which are by me (at the time of the review):

The frame rates is absolutely great, even with hundreds of units.... Expecting first DLC soon ;)			"

												An amazing achievement and a worthy successor to Operation Star.For anyone unfamiliar with Graviteam's games -- yes, there is a considerable learning curve. It requires a real commitment to learn how to play. There will be some frustrations intially. But if you are willing to persevere, check out some YouTube tutorials and wargaming forums, do some trial and error, you will be rewarded by what may well be the greatest serious/historical tactical-level World War II game ever made. The charges of the 'terrible' 'clunky' UI are overblown. Yes, the UI is *unique* -- it's unlike anything you've encountered elsewhere. It does take some getting used to. Yes, the documentation (manual) is lacking -- although the ingame tutorials are decent. But once you understand the UI, you will find it a flexible and powerful tool for managing the game and for crafting battlefield strategems that are surprisingly and satisfyingly multifaceted. I've seen some complaints about performance issues -- not sure what to say there, except that I've found Operation Star and now Mius Front both very stable (no crashes) and well optimized. I'm playing on a fairly robust rig (GTX 780 Ti, i7 3770K o/c to 4.6 GHz, 16 Gigs RAM) and the game is completely fluid on max graphics settings. And it is *gorgeous*. The modeling of terrain is amazing. And these are hands-down the most beautifully detailed vehicle models you  will find in a WW2 game.Cannot recommend highly enough. A masterpiece.  "

												As an older gamer in his mid fifties who is obsessed with WW2 and especially the Eastern Front, this game is a dream come true. So far with only 16 hours in I am still on the steep learning curve as to how to do things but, that said, with every hour played and with helpful tutorials, especially on You Tube, even those for the earlier Graviteam game  Operation Star, I am understanding more. With this understanding you realise just what depth and knowledge this game has to offer, There is a saying that the Devil is in the details and there is one huge Devil in this game. The Binocular and magnifying glass view of your tanks taking AT fire, of hits and brewing vehicles with molten steel sparking high into the air as ammo cooks off makes the game worth the price alone. The inclusion of German and Russian as the language being shouted by the soldiers adds to the historical depth that runs through the veins of the programming that has been lovingly coded into this creation.        I could go on for many paragraphs about the attention to detail here but suffice to say, having a library of over 300 books just on the Eastern Front alone, Mius Front beats the oppositon in so many ways showing the War in that theatre of operations. Get over your concern about how to actually cope with all the menus and control options as they will make sense over time. I am still learning and will be for a few days if not weeks but who cares. Buy this game and Operation Star and a smile as wide as the Russian front will appear on your face.			"

												There is simply no analogue to this game on the market right now. As slow-paced and complicated as it is, every battle is unique, leading to high replayability and memorable moments. Developers continuously support it by improving the gameplay and creating new content. Definitely not for everyone, but if you are looking for a realistic and immersive WW2 strategy game, you should give it a shot.			"

												Mius-Front is an improvement to Graviteam Tactics: Operation Star in many ways from controls to sound. The series is one of the best wargames I have ever played and I've played them all ( I am not a youngster) from HPS to Matrix Games .Graviteam Tactics: Mius-Front along with Graviteam Tactics: Operation Star & Expansions create a WWll atmosphere that is both operational and very tactical. The games in this series are so involved that many more experienced players than myself are still learning hidden gems about the game's depth even after many weeks/months of play. Go over to Youtube and you will find some really good videos explaining things like movement, units, artillery, German Tanks,Russian Tanks,commanders and much, much more. If you like detail in your wargames this is definitly worth the time to learn! "

												I have played operation star and I have to say that this game is a big step in the right direction.   The Combat feels so good with all the dirt flying and the soldiers talking and running around , both infantry and armor combat feels right. The sound design is great compared to operation star. The overall graphics are better.  New UI is much easier to use and understand.  The only thing I can gripe about is the uniforms of the men.   If they could get the uniforms from the Achtung panzer mod for operation star then this game would be perfect.   Great devs, Great community, Great game. Can't wait to see where  DLCs take the game and what the mod community cooks up.Best WW2 RTS I have ever played.			"

												I'm someone who never had an issue with the previous games UI, however though many prefer this version I find it more complex.Saying that once the battles start it's absolutely awesome. I usually HATE real time games. The only ones I've enjoyed are Command Ops series, the very first Close Combat games (esp CC2) and this series. Reason is they aren't a click fest and are manageable. Great to see this one runs along the same lines.With the Battle Editor you have loads of replayability.Also a tip, even veterans of the series MUST go through the tutorials scenarios and vids that you can find in Quick Battles. Helped me alot. Though still unsure of certain aspects..I reckon it will all sink in in time.Anyway just like the previous game it comes highly recommended.This is a proper tactical wargame. It's not COH or MOW. For those wanting to get more ""real""  and despite the UI you really must step it up and buy this game. The only other tactical wargame in 3D as complex is the Combat Mission series and they too come highly recommneded. I prefer the CM serie sonly because of the WEGO aspect in those games. If it wasn't for that GTMF and OS come out on top for a superb tactical wargame experienece.			"

												This is by far the best wargame I have played and I played a lot :-) The tactics involved are super realistic and cinematic at the same time - a rarity in the grognard wargaming community. There is something about the way battles occur, that make them stick in memory long after the computer has been turned off. At first the interface seem almost alien, but once you figure it out, it is very logical and easy to use.			"

												-setting up defenses-only 2 effective pak guns -5 MG42s-start round after half an hour of setting up -10+ T-34s appear on oppisite ridge -accept my fate that i can take a few with me-first tank burst into flames after direct hit-continues rolling down hill-stops only after rolling through fence a shed and part of a house -second tank in column is hit and blocks road-guns destroy two more tanks slowing column -rest of column breaks through into village out of my guns line of sight-soviet infantry cant follow up under the firepower of 5 42's -tanks have no choice but to withdraw -retreat in column formation -lead tank hit spills fuel everywhere and lights woods on fire-HE shell explodes directly in front of one pak gun=mild heart attack-crew remans gun-destory 3 more tanks as they struggle back up the ridge -15/10 would beleive in the final victory again          The game does require a learning cuve but it is very satisfying when you pull off a victory. Because you cant just recruit new guns or troops with resource or base building it forces you to care about your men and to think your decsions through more than most games. For those coming from Operation Star its still a learnign curve to where it is a newer game but still has the spirit of the original. In my opinion this is how a sequel should be done.        If you dont want to take the time to go through learning and are used to always winning agianst stupid A.I. this game may not be for you. It takes time! It will be frustrating and there is no formula for winning. There arent specific counters built into the game and artillery isnt always going to come down where you call it. Its a simulator not an arcade game. And it wont be fair, if you want fair tank on tank combat go play War Thunder Arcade mode! Also if youre expecting a graphically beautiful game dont buy, it has its moments but the animations are clunky and vehicle models do look good but it isnt BF1.       What the game sets out to do it achieves. And that is a realistic depiction of small/medium unit engagements in WW2. Not for everyone but if you take the time then it will grow on you and you'll never go back to other strategy games.			"

												For people who grew up on games like Close Combat, this is a must have. For people who just stumbled upon it, please have a look at a few videos that are out there to see if this is your cup of tea. It's not like Men of War or Company of Heroes. It's closer to Close Combat, Combat mission or perhaps Theater of War. Some improvements for people who played the previous version GT:OS - Improved and friendlier UI- Much better english language support- Soldier Speech slightly better :)- Soldiers honor direction commands now, it seems- Bigger scale conflicts- New features and mechanics - smoke, infantry + tank assault formations, etc. - Better FX and much better sound effects out of the box. Overview and interesting points for people new to the game:- Battalion level tactical simulation of ww2 on the eastern front- Mix of turn based operation map and real time tactical map- Realistic tank vs tank warfare, balistics calculations, angle, temperature, wind, slope, type of ammo and area hit will determine what damage is caused etc. (dozens of possible damage types - chassis, tracks, turret ring, optical sight, etc.)- Vehicle modelling, animation and texturing- No game helps you to understand the principles of RL combat like this game.Things that still need work or modding:- russian infantry speech- soldier models, textures and animations (more variety to the faces would be awesome!)- AI could do with a bit more work.  It's decent as it is - just not aggressive and determined enough.- a few sound fx need replacing, but it's a minority "

Posted: March 10, 2016
												I am a very avid wargamer and have played a decent amount of titles, and this game is possibly one of the best wargames out there for its scope. There are several layers to wargames, strategic, operational, tactical and this game falls under the category of the last two for how the game plays out in its two phases. The first is a layer which shows a large map consisting of a company sized force. Which is organized down to battalion, platoon and at the lowest level, squad. Those that bought this game right away are fans of the first Graviteam game Operation Star, which was a gem in its own right but had its problems which come naturally from a Ukranian/Russian game studio. The most obvious of which is a very confusing user interface. Although it did change from GTOS there is an increased amount of abstraction but gives a decent amount of info. The first game allowed you to detach units from the reserve groups and manually attach them to platoons with a spare space. This is changed in this game because now you do not have the option to attach these reserves on a specific nature. Instead you choose the type on reinforcement on the management screen, and then hope you got what you wanted. For instance in the first you could move an anti tank rifle squad into a platoon, nice and simple, but now you would select ""anti-tank"" and you may get that squad, or a gun. If you select support you may get a mortar or an arty spotter. This simulates the ""you get what you are given so stop complaining"" nature of warfare but sacrifices control of platoon compositionThe graphics are amazing, and are much improved from the last game. It looks great, so I'll leave it at that.Sound is a bit to be desired with slightly cut off and strange sounding guns and explosions, however these will be modded in the near future. Going down close to soldiers also lets you hear them laughing...really...damn...awkwardlyTactical battles are a work of art but leave a little to be desired in regards of unit control. This game simulates high level command so there is only so much you can control. All you can basically do is tell your units to move in a certain formation, face a direction and give target priorities. Although you can adjust the modifiers of how your units move in a neat radial menu. I would like to be able to adjust rate of fire, and grenade usage. However this will be forgotten in the heat of battle.As I said before, the UI sucks. Its horrible, its ugly, and its only a minor improvement from GTOS. The manual does not help with this..Lets conclude this haphazard review. This game is NOT for casual strategy fans, that comes out as elitist, but this game is designed for a very niche group of people called Grognards, these people play very abstracted games focused on wargames with a high level of complexity. This is reflected in the type of warfare that plays out which is primarily skirmisher warfare. Where units get into trenches, spot the enemy and fight a battle of attrition. You wont flank through gullys, charge a fortification or storm a building. You will be placing your units through forests and positioning at the edge for them to fire at the enemy. This is pure skirmisher warfare and it is not for those expecting a Company Of Heroes or Men of War Experience. Behind the bad UI is a beautiful gem of a wargame that can allow one to simulate high command on a operational and tactical level. Where you can give general orders to your units and hope they have the strength to carry them out. This game is for wargamers, and not for people looking for a quick campaign.			"

												Game is amazing, frustrating and brutal all at once. UI and operations take some learning and getting used to, but it's definitely worth it. Battles feel and look brutal, from your infantry getting lit on fire by a hostile flamethrower wielding soldier you didn't see sprint up to your trench on the flank, to a tank crawling up a hill containing your defensive positions, only to catch a shell to the fuel tank and burst into flames and roll back down to the bottom of the hill. Night battles can be either maddening or fantastic. Maddening in the sense of not being able to spot♥♥♥♥♥♥until you have Russian infantry cuddling up to your frontline soldiers in their trenches, fanstastic that a Russian tank will roll right between two dug in positions with infantry hitching a ride on the back and not know it until a grenade catches it in the side and disables a track, getting it's hitchhikers caught in a bulletstorm. All in all, definitely a good purchase. This is the first time I've heard of Graviteam Tactics and I can definitely say I'm not disappointed.			"

												Graviteam has managed to deliver us in the last past 3 years, a game experience in wwII sim that goes beyond any other ww2 tactic game out there. Once you understand the commands and put in application the military wwII knowledge you have, it will became yor best wargame experience. Is just amazing how this small group transformed they're talent in this amazing product, and I am pretty sure that one day they will stay alongside to great developers. -> amazing attention to details: the models are carefully reconstructed taking in consideration, the historical period and                place, original footage and documents were consulted for the modeling.-> real tellecomunication system: the communication is very real in the way is reproduced, were fog and bad weather play an important factor.-> armor penetration and ammunition: realistic effect on tanks armor depending on the shell type angle and distance.-> map reproduction: every cm of the map was reconstructed on topographic maps basis (wwII era), amazing care for the dettails in general.This is a must if you love WWII tactic sim.

												Best in the series easy to recommend as a buy;The new interface took some getting used to but it's much imporved over prior operatoin star interfaces.   They took what was good about the prior series and enhanced it to make a better game.   They did not try to reinvent the wheel which is good because we all know the wheel works well.Graphically it's the best looking game in the series.   The tutorials are a welcome addition and I learned a lot going through them as well as the players guide.  The landscape and terrain are well done and the roughness and variety of terrain make many tactical options possible that could not be done prior.   AI is as good or better in some cases as the prior games it seems.    Any fan of combnat mission or prior graviteam products should like this one.   For new players this is more of a tactical wargame with a high level of complexity, if expecting something like battlefield...don't.8.5/10 - highly recommend  .  Like any new game of this depth, it will grow and get better with time.			"

It is not an easy game but it is worth learning it. This is realistic like close combat but with the physics of wargame red dragons. Only thing that could should be import from close combat is the sounds, they need to be more intense. If you like realistic wargame, try this. I hope future DLC will bring more countries and wars. I like to play battle editor with fantasy scenario. Like a modern russian platoon versus an ww2 german company and etc.			"

Did you want it bigger and with more options? well HERE IT IS!Yes there are not many campaigns to run, but the battles are massive now and much more intense. My first battle was some 400 germans holding off 700 russian troops! It encompassed 30+ Russian tanks, massive artilley barrages and planes divebombing! What is not to like about that? (Do note it was a graphic/CPU hog during the intense action, as i fell to 40 FPS and I have a good rig)This is the wargame for strategy fans, and great if you liked the other games in the series.A solid must buy, at the VERY least when its on sale.Note: a few minor bugs encountered, but nothing game breaking.

												Fun game, a lot more improved over GTOS, way more optimized, has a better UI, and can run on max settings without dipping frames with many units on screen. If you're an armchair general like me and like games like wargame or men of war, and want something a bit more realistic and challenging this is the game for you. Only thing is, is that AI could use some improvements, they can be a bit janky, especially in close quarters situations, which you rarely end up in anyway. Could also use some more units and models, but more than likely these will be released in DLC similarly to GTOS. It's not your typical rts, but it scratches an itch not many games can come close to with it's level of realism, you don't fully control units, it's more like you're a commander issuing orders that the AI will carry out. It's a one of a kind game in a very niche market that can create some epic battles and memorable moments and for the commander in me, it's a must-buy.			"

Maybe it will be added later.If you liked CM, GTOS, or Close Combat you need to add this to your library. "

												Fantastic Eastern Front simulation, but honestly has one of the most impenetrable UIs in the genre. However, once you figure out what information the game is trying to pass on to you, Mius-Front becomes a truly immersive experience. Hundreds of miniscule battlefield dramas unfold amongst the backdrop of massive clashes of infantry, tanks, planes and artillery.If you look at what negative reviews exist, you'll see that they have extremely low playtime, which indicates they weren't able to get past the first UI hurdle. This is understandable - I'm still learning aswell - but dissapointing that they'll miss out on a game for not giving it more time and practice.			"

												Any game where you can run over dudes in trenches with tanks to kill them is OK in my book.   This game is so good its funny. I still do not know the intricacies of the game completely. When that happens they better cancel Christmas.   Like other reviewers have said, its like Combat Mission games with less micro and more macro. You are more a battalion commander rather than every single officer in the game. Oh and its half the price of those games.   The operational interface is a bit obtuse, but with a little time, its workable. The actual battles are nothing short of amazing.  The AI is decent too. I've see flanking maneuvers, over watch tactics, ambushes, etc. all executed by the AI. They also run over dudes in trenches with tanks. Also a very deft, albeit direct, tactic.			"

												very good game after the notorious learning curve, simulation is on-par if not better than with combat mission, probably one of the most realistic strategy games I know of, only rivaled by combat missionlearning curve is steeper than that of combat mission for surei've gotten a refund to see if the previous game yields more content (which it does), and it crashes on me on the operational screen, re-buying this to support Graviteami'm an infantry kind of boy and I can say that the AI for infantry is much better than previously, such as units charging the enemy infantry in the case of no ammo to attack them in meleemusic is also pretty good, not on the level of something like red orchestra 2 but still pretty good			"

												What can I say that hasn't already been said?I'll just keep it short and to the point. Mius Front is a rare bird.  An incredible game where deep strategy meets in a real time world.  Players that can navigate a UI that, out of necessity, is very complex, yet gets easier each time you play, are rewarded with the most realistic WWII experience out there. Quite simply, there is nothing else like it that integrates operational aspects and tactical battles with such wonderful results. Graviteam included so many small details in this game that other developers overlook that make it truly unique. A masterpiece. But not for the feint of heart. It takes commitment to be an effective commander. That is my only warning. 9.8/10			"

If you want to experience WW2 battles which are dynamic and most intense, together with absolute accurate 3D Models of Hardware this is for you. Together with an incredible intelligently programmed campaign mode this game is king.Please read the manual, look into Quick Battles for short Tutorials and be patient learning the game - you will be rewarded, promise!

												I've never played a 'Graviteam'  made game before, so I'm totally unfamiliar with this developer. I have played Battlefront published games like the original Combat Mission series from 15 years ago or so. This game is somewhat comparible in style, however it is more or less a live action game after the pieces are set. This is not a RTS type of game like Company of Heroes, it's really a battlefield simulator with a God's eye view of everything and the ability to pause and speed up. Unfortunately, the developer sort of dumps you straight into a main menu with a couple of large scenarios right off the bat. If you're inexperienced, don't try to play these, use the quick battle option and you will find several tutorial type of scenarios to run. These are extremely sensitive to deviation from the instructions. If you misunderstand an instruction or click the wrong button, you will probably have to start it over again to complete it. Fortunatly, these scenarios are small enough to avoid overwhelming a new player.The game interface is quite difficult to understand and the overall presentation is not well thought out. However it is configuable and if you're willing to spend some time watching experienced players play this game on Youtube, it is not an insurmountable task to get to a point where you find it playable. The sound quality is fair, but not great, I get a bit of popping and crackling with button clicks and other actions that is annoying with headphones on. The music was aweful and I had to turn it off within munites of playing my first scenario. The graphics would have been cutting edge 10 years ago; today they are passable.The game play is actually quite fun. There is a setup phase, then a battle phase. The setup of your forces is a bit simplified, however there is a decent amount of complexity and you can do an adequate level of fine tuning of positions. The line of site tool is extremely valuable, especially during the deployment phase.Once the battle begins, your task is mainly scanning your God's eye around the battlefield and prioritizing targets or adjusting force maneuvers/positions. You never control anything directly, you can issues orders. There is a great deal of complexity and some battles are so large, that micromanagement would make the game too tedious. If you're looking for a good WWII battlefield simulation with lots of complexity and accuracy to details, you will like this. This is not the type of game most would enjoy or take the time to understand, but as a wargaming veteran, I am enjoying it.			"

												Just like Graviteam tactics operation star, this game is stupid hard and realistic.  Which is what I want to see in a RTS.  This has a better tutorial, but even those are hard to succeed with.  This game has a lot to offer, but the learning curve is very steep.  I highly recomend this game if realism at any cost is what you're looking for. "

												Absolutely the best wargame out there!!! Hard to master but once you get the hang of it your in for one **** of a ride, I gave up at first but once I came back and gave it a chance I love it. Its not your normal RTS every move has a negative and positive outcome, Artillary is terrifying or your best freind same goes with trenches. There is nothing better than having thinking you have set up a great defensive strategy only to find out 20 minutes in you didnt take into account one of your flanks is weak and their infantry sneak up to your pak guns and destroys 2 of your 3 and then you have to scramble to attempt to secure the flank with a unit that has low ammo and taken heavy losses and all other units are heavily engaged. Every loss and victory have atleast 2 memorable moments in that conflict and I say atleast 2 because every burning hulk of metal or fallen soldiers has a story that cannot be recreated in any other game just look at all the screenshots. After the battle you can look at the battlefield and see the carnage that I have never seen in any other game that can depict a battle that was never scripted. No campaign will play the same. I really dont have to many negatives besides sometimes the AI can act kind of funny but overall it does a very good job. I think other companies need to take a look at this and realize there are some of us still out there that dont enjoy the mindless click fests that most games are becoming. So thank you Graviteam for such a great game that we can lose hours into and I absolutely recommend this game to anyone who is sick of the click fests and enjoy actual strategy and thought and REALISM.

												A fantastic grog game. The battles play out in cinematic style and by the end the field is littered with burnt out tank husks and dead soldiers. Slow burning fire consume grass and trenches turn into large crates as they are deformed. It's a joy to watch battles unfield in such vivd detail. The UI leaves a lot to be desired but the game itself is pretty easy to jump into (doubley so if you've place a previous Graviteam game or Combat Mission). If you're at all interested in a more serious WW2 game pick this up!			"

												Updated Review: I had not a NO recommendation because I was below the recommended specs and the game suffered, HARD, on performance. It was like trying to play a slideshow. Here's my updated review:Given the fact that I've recently upgraded my rig (considerably) with upper level components, this game runs smooth as silk now. This is the best 'war' simulator you're going to get on the market. It takes some getting used to because it's not a typical RTS control system. If you're thinking about getting this, look up the YouTube videos, there's more being uploaded for this game everyday. But if you're REALLY leaning on getting this game, then you owe it to yourself to watch the tutorials on the Operation Star gameplay. While this game is much improved in many ways (UI is more intuitive, AI is better, etc...), the core gameplay and approach is pretty much the same between the two games. If the tutorials on YouTube for Operation Star seem like your cup of tea, then this is a game you will really learn to love. I'm looking forward to mods and DLC. This game is HIGHLY recommended *If you and ONLY if you meet the recommended specs*			"

												How this game has not been more noticed in beyond me.The learningcurve is steep but mostly in terms of the interface and all the hidden features in tactical mode rather than the gameplay itself. At least for someone like myself with many years of real life military training and experience and that's one of the first games that's actually managed to just seamlessly blend a game with the feel of a professional military wargame.The feel and flow of the game is purely outstanding. It does just about everything right compared to the competition and the realism and flow of combat is so nicely done real life battalion tactics simply work out of the box, without requiring a second thought on game-mechanics.If you enjoy titles like Combat Mission, Close Combat etc this is a must have. If you like titles like Company of Heroes but  want more realism and want to get an idea of the challenges of realistic large-scale combat then this is also something I recommend.			"

												Mius is Graviteam's latest deeply complex wargame, which we can expect to receive constant attention from the developers for many years to come.  Mius breaks new ground in Graviteam's steady march toward a true battlefield simulator.  Compared to prior titles, Mius brings noticeably enhanced graphics, a more elegant interface, more units on the field, more complex AI behavior, more complex munitions, more extensive use of air support in combined arms combat, smoke screen, artillery fuse settings, and more.  The developers respond quickly to reports of flaws and they are always working on new features and DLCs.  Prices are always reasonable, but sale prices outright undervalue the game.As with all Graviteam titles, Mius is not a game you can just pick up and play.  You have to learn the interface and commands, in addition to the funcitionality of all the weapons systems in the game.  You have to understand the effects of terrain, down to whether your heavy weapons can move through a muddy field.  You have to understand the effects of weather, such as how to deal with wind or storms.  Beware that you will only find Mius' greatest rewards after extensive efforts to understand details of the battlefield.			"

												Because I have never heard of Graviteam Tactics, I decided to pirate the game at first. The tutorials are a must for new players. they do a satisfactory job of explaining the UI and the game itself. The gameplay is truly something unique. and does a fine job of balancing operational and tactical modes. I was impressed to see the devs promptly roll out updates addressing bugs and decided to buy the game. I noticed that if you issue a group order to attack, the entire group will wait for everyone to get in line before advancing. This is all fine and dandy, except sometimes one unit will get itself stuck in a ditch, and stubbornly refuse to unf*ck itself. I guess manually having to reverse a vehicle out of the ditch and telling the dumbass driver to go around via waypoints is part of the realism experience. On a serious note, persevere past the learning curve and you will find a hidden gem of a game. This is the kind of game where you can sink hundreds of hours into, and I look forward to doing just that.			"

												Although the learning curve is rather steep, the game is enjoyable in all aspects. Mius Front allows me to reminisce about the days of Combat Mission with even more action-packed, t-34 inferno, corpes of the infantry hord, panic striken soldiers, incompetent gun crews, air-power striking, blood curling enjoyment. I only revently bought the game, despite the hours pumped into holding the German front. Enjoy slowing learning the outlay of the land and the capabilities of your forces while the Russians pump infantry, tanks, and artillery down your throat while slowly being pushed back in sectors and defiently holding out against overwhelming forces. If you are looking for a game that is both frustrating and enthralling, Mius Front is your pick. The essence of World War Two as I zoom in on my troops losing commanders and becoming shell shocked is only the beginning of engulfing yourself into the emmense outlay of the terrain and the wooden buildings that hardly provide cover for your troops and are more useful as fire tender. I have yet to complete an entire campaign as I continue to learn the best aspects of my individual pieces of equipment and the valiantly of my troops.

												EDIT: With a recent patch my game can now finally start and run fine. I know it seems a bit wrong to criticize a game that wouldn't run one moment but did the next, but when a dev tells you to seek a refund that definitely means the end of the road in most cases.So the game works fine now. I've spent a few hours playing it, and I've played a fair bit of Operation Star as well, but it still feels like just scratching the surface. The gameplay is terribly deep, and along with that depth there come a lot of confusing mechanics and questionable player friendliness. However, this is a completely unique strategy game. More a simulation than anything, it's a gorgeous attempt at recreating the tactics and difficulties of combat in Eastern Ukraine, Summer 1943.It's difficult, it's infuriating, it's opaque, and it won't even do a good job of telling you if what you're doing is working. In short, it's combat.			"

												Simply loved the game. But it is NOT for the men of war or the blitzkrieg players.  It takes brains and patience and TACTICS to really succeed at this game.			"

												This is a very good game. In confidence I can say that this is by far the most realistic simulation of modern combat, while also combining it with fun gameplay.If you enjoy simluations as well as World War 2 combat, this game is certainly a no brainer to buy.From me it gets a 9/10, great value for money and generally smooth gameplay to boot.

												GT Mius Front, like its predecessor GT Operation Star, is an excellent game for those who like realistic tactical games. It is not a click fest but a game where careful planning and preparation pay dividends.It does have a learning curve, but I found rather easy to get into. Of course, having success is another matter, but that comes with time and experience.It has many improvements on GTOS, and particularly, the interface is easier to use. In any case the rewards of playing far outweigh the learning curve, IMHO.Highly recommended for those who like the genre.			"

												13 hours later, I still don't know what the hell I'm doing.I assume the game will take roughly 100 hours to learn controls and game mechanics; at which point another one will come out with completley different game mechanics.			"

												I feel that this is a nice game, but not the gem it could be.Controls and UI are a bit hard to grasp. Actual impact on your actions once a scenario starts are minimal. So much is pure chance and it's quite oftan just an interesting simulation playing out without your input.I still haven't had efficient onboard artiellery fire more than two shells at what I actually wanted.Recommend this becasue if you like this type of game, this is a good one. I'd recommend demoing first if possible.			"

												I have always loved the Graviteam games. I have all of the previous ones. I was very excited about this game because it's been in development for so long and promised so many new and wonderful things. I'm dissappointed. This is basically a map pack. And not a very good one at that. They dressed up the UI a bit and tweaked a few things, but really, if you've played the others, you've played this one. The Maps: Large stretches of land that are mostly flat with some rolling hills. The towns are just different arrangements of the same towns you saw in the previous games. There's not much strategy involved with such bland maps. If you have AT guns just pick a hill and they'll pick off the piecemeal attacks the AI sends your way. The Graphics: I guess they were upgraded, but I don't see it. It's that weird kind of upgrade that some games try that actually makes things look worse. The AI: I'd love to see some sort of fight being put up, but haven't yet. It's a drizzle of a tank or two, a squad or two, but nothing challenging. Not like the mass human waves you saw in Shilovo. It's like the enemy is content just probing, continuously. The Environment: Please for the love of God give me the winter back. I have no idea what environment they were trying to create here. It's dark and gloomy with the sun shining in the background. It's dingy brown with fresh spring grass growing. It's confused. The Campaign: Make a flat boring map, a generic arrangment of houses and dirt roads, and add in three times as many units for both sides. Voila! You have Mius Front.The Bugs: Still there from the previous games. See a tank, see a tank disappear, see a tank appear, see a tank disappear. Hit a tank, wait ten seconds, hear tank get hit, wait ten seconds, see tank lose track. Fun.Play the older games, this is garbage. Peace.			"

												I'm a big fan of wargames; I grew up playing Combat Mission, really enjoy GMT board games, Paradox's strategy games, so it's not like i'm coming into this expecting Starcraft or Company of Heroes. Those are both great games but not the same genre, and I get that. But if I've put a good 5 hours into playing tutorials and attempting to get a handle on the gameplay mechanics and still totally fail, well that's when I put the game down for a time, maybe forever.The interface and user feedback is just a mess overall, and even when I found something I didn't understand and looked in the manual to try and figure it out, for example the command points system, there was a one sentance description that did nothing to clarify how it worked. A multititude of vague icons and colors will indicate status' on units, but there's no way inside the game to find out what they mean if you don't already know. Would it really be that hard to have some nice tooltips on things? Even when tooltips are present they are often unhelpful or even more confusing. And I dare someone to try and find uglier menu graphics in a game that otherwise looks this pretty. Or to try and understand the after action report screen. (5/200% of what??)This is all aside from other things i've seen that could either be a bugs in the combat engine/AI or interface and readabilty issues:I've had tanks with no apparent damage, morale, or ammo issues, refuse to fire at enemy tanks a stone's throw away. Infantry carrying AT grenades run up to enemy armor then just stop and lay prone, or slowly crawl away, while the armor resolutely ignores them. Halftracks circling each other literally a couple feet apart, one unshooting, the other taking no damage whatsoever, for about 5-6 minutes. Infantry often seem to ignore heavy MG fire, and will jog straight up through an open field under heavy fire and murder the crew, with little or no damage.Some or all of these could be bugs or things I missed in the interface that the game was trying to tell me about, I just have no idea.Good complex games don't have to have bad interaces and tutorials. Crusader Kings 2 or Unity of Command are great examples of complicated games that are relatively easy to learn thanks to good tutorials, and give you all the needed information in game once you're there.If you're really interested in this, at least watch a few long videos, or wait to see if they come out with some patches. I really hope they can improve things, because I can see the potential here, it's just not in a state I could recommened at the moment. "

												Ugly, over-sized user interface that is terribly organized and difficult to understand and navigate. Unintuitive camera controls that are very difficult to smoothly and comfortable operate(You can't change the keybindings for the important functions either). In combination with unsmooth camera controls it performs very poorly, I'm on a I7-4790k, GTX 760 4gb with 32gb ram and I cannot get over 30 fps with various settings, except for the first 5-10 minutes of battle. If you look on youtube, there isn't a single video of this game with good performance either. The sound engine doesn't feel directional or realistic at all, you can barely tell where sounds are coming from. If you zoom all the way out, most things sound as if they were happening right next to you, not far away. The use of extremely complex symbols for tiles -that have no tooltips, text or any other way of finding their actual meaning. These are crucial because they tell the statistics of tiles to place your troops, you have to memorize them or you will not be able to play the game effectively, and they are not easy to memorize at all. As a comparison, I've memorized the entire nato counter symbology and that made much more sense and was much easier. The mode of the game where you are not in battle, but in the wargame-style tactical map was also pretty confusing, it has an excellent tutorial that covers all of the functions, color coding and symbols for that, but I still came to completely dislike the entire design and flow of the game. The UI is ♥♥♥♥ing huge, you have to scroll through pages or so of unit information that could easily be smaller and your entire army could fit on the screen. Instead, you can't even fit a whole company of your units in the order of battle because just the button that has the name of the company is  1/5 the size of your entire screen.Hearts of Iron, War in the East, Advanced Tactics Gold, Men of War, Theatre of War, anything is better than this. In my opinion this game is a waste of money, it is unenjoyable and I doubt I will play it again. I'm not sure how this game got so many good reviews, but I at very least recommend getting Operation Star instead of Mius-Front. From the videos i've seen, the older one looks a bit better, but i've not played it.  Thanks for reading, I hope somebody finds this useful.			"

												Game would not launch when prompted. Subsequent reinstallation of the game did not remedy the problem. Steam registered the game as running in the background, though there was no instance of the game present in the process list in the task manager. To restart steam and perform trouble shooting measures, steam isteslf must be terminated by way of the task manager process list. Many false hours of play were registered by Steam while troubleshooting the game's failure to launch. Consequently, steam refused to refund the purchase cost of the game due to a balance of more than two (2) hours of play being registered in steam. This may be a great game, but my advice is if it does not work initially, apply for a refund as soon as possible and cease troubleshooting or risk being denied a refund altogether by Steam.			"

												After playing this a few days, I have decided to thumbs down.The reasons for the thumbs down:False advertising possibly.  Under system requirements on store page, ""Storage: 5 GB available space "", yet download and installed space used was 1.1 GB. Poor FPSVery bad language barrier. Very incomplete manual and instructions on how the game works. The forum is a joke due to said language barrier, and I will not even attempt to waste my time on there.Is the game worth $31.49 on sale? NO$20? NO$10? Maybe$5? YepAfter I spent some time figuring out some of the how to play, I have found some aspects almost enjoyable. (Although ALL tracer rounds fly over ALL enemies and never hit a darn thing.) The AI path finding on vehicles seems terrible. "

												Since I see nothing but positive reviews, I'd at least like to throw out a warning to people who might be as naive as I. This game is pretty impenetrable, and the tutorial is either broken or just infinitely too advanced for me.I assumed clicking ""campaign"" would be where you start. No, apparently ""basic training"" is in ""quick battle."" That makes sense, right? If your UI has more than 30 buttons and symbols, please accept the need for a tutorial to jump out at people.So I start the tutorial. Move your camera, raise/lower it, turn it. All good. Now what? No 4th message appears. I see I have a unit, so I start messing around with it and looking at the buttons (which are all delayed tooltips). A couple of minutes into this, it finally pops up ""move it here."" After another 3 minutes of waiting, halfway into which I find the option to make time go faster (you right click the pause button, I think), my tank arrives. Next it shows other movement types and waypoints. As that's moving, it shows some other stuff, like the ""halt order"" button. Well, I try to click it. That's common to do in a tutorial, right? Use every function as it's shown to you? I mean, I want to find out of the halt is a full cancel, if it just pauses the action and you can unpause it, or what? Well, I can't tell you anything else. After that, any attempt to order a move again was met with ""order not executed"" in the top right. Can you select ""order not executed"" to be told why? Nope. Who'd need that in a tutorial?All of this is that much more upsetting because it looks like a fun game - a /complicated/ fun game. But I had a much easier time getting into an ASCII roguelike. So it's a 22 minute refund - the first time I've used the function on steam.It looks like a really good game, possibly the best thing available for what it is. But I don't want that specific thing that badly to spend many hours digging through the internet to learn how to play this game. If you've got some experience, or the patience, I'm sure you'll find it rewarding. But I can't, in good conscience, leave this game as consisting entirely of glowing positive reviews from veterans. Accessability is an important thing.			"

												Okay so here we are now on Mius Front, lets start right off the bat and say that this game is extremely cool for what you get. Well the premise of it is cool anyways.This game is made by the usual E. Europe devs who don't really understand the concept of ""hey lets not throw a million buttons and leave things uncomplicated"" The turorial is a nightmare and you often don't even understand why you lost in a tutorialYou rarely even understand what the overall objectives are and some things are absolute nonsense. I have played complicated games as they are my absolute favorite but this isn't ""complicated"" this is a button-tastic nightmare of confusing commands and silly overlays. The FPS drops are also extremely ridiculous as I can run ArmA 3 on Ultra in a city of 100 people and get 50 FPS but I get 26 FPS here in combat. Oh and combat, lets go there. You don't tell your guys who to attack and you just make suggestions. For instance I have a PaK with a T-70 right in front of it. It could hit it perfectly and I designated that ""Priority Target"" The PaK gun crew laughed at me and continued firing at infantry. The sounds of this game are also absolutely, extremely terrible and overall it isn't an enjoyable experience. It would be more fun with multiplayer as well but thats ""coming later"".You spend 30-40$ and you expect a game that you can make sense of and enjoy, right? Well don't look here for that.Also to the fanboys, yes I have played multiple extremely difficult games. No I won't go back to (insert pleb-tier game) because I am not from there. Devs, I don't know how you can fix it but if you do I will buy it again.			"

Product received for free
												Extremely lacking in content. I managed to learn how to play (really wasnt that hard as somebody experienced with complex WWII strategy games), and had a blast. Then I realized how empty this game truly is. The base game has 1 map...ONE. Okay so thats not so bad considering the size I suppose. Then I went to try and change the settings to make a custom battle take place in winter since of course, this game takes place in ♥♥♥♥ing Russia, right? WRONG. You can not get a single drop of snow on the ground in this game. You can make it winter, you can make there be a blizzard with snow blowing around, yet the grass will remain green as a hot July day, even though tanks will have winter camo, and trenches will be white as if they were dug out of snow. Thought something was wrong, so I check the community hub. The Dev comes off as an absolute moron. They say ""Well people didn't like snow in GTOS so we completely removed it from Mius Front. The game is exlusively set in the summer"" Which is just an absurd thing. I could understand this quote a little better, if there wasn't an option to ♥♥♥♥ing set the battles in the winter, and change infantry camo to winter, only to have it do absolutely NOTHING. Its a joke of a game, really. I'm fortunate enough that this was gifted to me for Christmas, but I feel bad that the money was wasted. This game is NOT worth $35, it is NOT worth the sale price of $22.74, and it would not even be worth $15. I would say this game is worth $5-$10 TOPS. It is an overpriced P.O.S. completely lacking in content. It will be fun at first, but once you get the hang of things, you realize how awful this is. If you want to get into it, get Operation Star. That game is also lacking in content, but the price during the sale is very reasonable. This game however, is a joke. Please do not buy it for more than $10. I wish I learned sooner how much of a steaming pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥this is, so I could've taken it off my wishlist.*I do not care if there are more maps in any sort of DLC. The point remains that you still can not get any snow on the ground, and everything is locked to a summer theme. I will not be investing any more money into this garbage unless it was some sort of snow map, which sounds ridiculous. Why should I have to pay extra to get snow in a setting that is known for its harsh winters and heavy snowfall?*			"
