												Triggerwarning: (this will be a ranting first impression review)TL:DR version at the bottom.My oh my. Deck13 along with publisher Astragon Entertainment, what is this and did you listen at all to your fanbase?I don't even know where to begin, I clearly remember a dialogue about what the fans wanted for the follow-up and did you collectively decide to do the opposite of what they wanted in about every way imagineable? 2 hours in Im hating everything about this game! Even the good aspects like its music and graphic design which is completely irrelevant in an economic simulator! Why would you focus on that...why? Here's a list of the top of my head:-The impossibility of micromanaging a fleet of ships when one day at normal speed lasts like 7 seconds. Even with pause this game feels like a chore since there's not enough tactical considerations to be made when in port. An AI-captain system would have been nice. Thou, that would automate the only gaming aspect of this release... so yeah... :-(-The attempt at a story...why, its an economic simulation game?!-The non-pause catastrophe. Which ironically is currently somewhat saved by what looks to be a bug (you can pause the game by double-clicking spacebar.) -Developers haven't done anyhing to add in fun gaming elements to break up the monotony. Sending the exact same 3 versions of every ship type around in ports picking up the same-sized identical cargo with little to no variation until the end of time. Or some arbitrary deadline if you play campaign. There's just no decisions to be made in this game of consequence.-Whats with the horrendously random repair costs automatically accepted every time a ship comes in? (ships that currently also detoriate way too fast. Don't think a ship goes from 100% to 33% condition in like 2 months time...)-Are there any pop-up events or gameplay or anything happening ever in this game? Nearly 8 hours in I've not come across anything that wasn't better in the first version in the game. (which was just the ""docking and undocking""-minigame when tugboats were on strike) -Why is the AI driving back and forth between just two docks in the first tutorial like tug of war OCD-victim?-The simplicity of the economy simulator. Let me re-iterate: The simplicity of the whole point of a game like this. A sequel should ADD to the complexity, not SUBTRACT from it.Dear Deck13. Did you even playtest this? How about listening to your fanbase the next time around instead of wasting everyones time with this possibly meme-creating epic disaster of a game? I keep seeing you guys mention that people wanted multiplayer in this game. Were you listening to the players actually playing your first game, or the few not in your targetgroup which has no idea how next to impossible it is, making a game like this play in real-time? Your target audience are NOT people who like to frantically click their fingers stiff in some headache-inducing RTS-mode to beat the map before anyone else. They are methodical empire-builders happily spending minutes in port with each ship weighing their alternatives if enough options are given them. Often grinding for hours on end in a relentless ""just one more turn""-mode until the early morning birds are chirping away...  And thats just finishing the first three months of play.TL:DRTo anyone considering this game: Do not buy at this point. It's the plague incarnate. (aka modern gaming developers focusing on nothing of relevant importance in their genre games catering to none in their actual audience)Pro:-the UI is functional, mostly because there's no complexityCon:-everything else.edited 11th of may.(completed 2 campaign chapters with silver and gold. I couldn't bring myself to start chapter 3.) P.S: Music is no longer good. I tried it turned on for 4 hours. My ears are now asleep from the monotony of it all.			"

												""I AM AN OFFICER IN THE MERCHANT NAVY"" This is a review on release day and is subject to change as updates appear!I was and am still a big fan of the first game! For those of you that want a short read, just buy the cheaper first game there are little to no differences, apart from multiplayer, even the graphics look much the same in my opinion.Pros:Muiltplayer - Of no interst to me what so ever But its there!Graphics - More attractive world map. Port graphics have changed but not for the better in my oppinion!Cons:Muiltiplayer - could it not have just been an update for the first game?Graphics - dont appear to have really changed at all apart from world map and port screen.Game Play - Exactly the same as the first game no real changes inculding with the two new ship types managment of them all is exactly the same whats the point?Manual Berthing (subject to change) - appears to be gone even though the controls are in the options menu!Dry Dock -  In reality ships go into dry dock aproximetly once every two years not every month as they degrad so quickly!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- However to be honest there doesnt seem to be a noticable difference bettween the first and new games apart form the introduction of two different types of vessels, which on a management stand point to start with appears very, very basic! There is litterly no difference to the management of tankers/container/bulk ships what was the point in adding them???Graphics no real change that I can see and I am running on Ultra. The only change I have noticed for the benifit of the player is the world map appears more visually attractive! And although the port screen has had work on it, I personaly feel it looks worse!Also I am hoping I simply cant find the option or figure out how to manualy command the vessel in and out of port like in the first game, it appears to haven been removed?!?What the hell is sabotage doing in the game? What is this Airline Tycoon now??? Thats all I have to say on that matter!Brokerage of second hand vessels can occur anywhere in the world why have you limited them to certain ports. I can understand ship yards and dry docks in kimited places but the rate of degregation of vessels needs to be radically decreased and ship yards need to be confind to new builds.All in all I have to say im severly dissapointed! As someone who works in the industry I was looking forward to a new, more indepth approch to the first game. With a more hands on contract stage(managment), and a more realistic set of physics for the manual handeling of the ships when berthing, as the first was awful (arcadey, nothing close to realistic).In my honest oppinion it feels like they are trying to flog you the idea of a new game when infact all they have done is add two new catogories to the ship market, neither of which really bring anything new to the game, as the contracts work exactly the same as in the containers/first game (litterly no readily apparent change). And multiplayer which should have, and could have been an update for the original.Feels like they've removed more than added!?!These are my opinions and I hope they help you decied if TransOcean 2: Rivals is for you or not!

												I preorder this game, offering my trust in this developer and I'm disappointed.I loved the first game, a management game that was very relaxing and quiet, and very entertaining. Here I found my haven of peace among so many explosives games.I expected this game more than any AAA this year.Now with this second part I find a competitive and exhausting game.The disappearance of the pause, the limitation of time in multiplayer, the short campaign and removal of dockage, have ruined my experience.It is true that I did not play too much, because I'm thinking of applying for the return if developers do not listen to its fanbase and announce changes.I do not understand why these decisions against his own followers.Astragon I'm sorry, but I must give my negative vote.

												After ""Ports of Call"" and ""TransOcean"", ""TransOcean2"" is the successor of 2 pretty entertaining games. The UI is far better than in TO and the new features (regional upgrades, rivalry with up to 7 AI opponents or real MP) are very nice additions.I´ve played through the campaign in about 100 hrs to achieve everything. Not a lot of games keep me interested for so many hrs.Most negative reviewers were writting at release date (they wanted a pause button). Most of those reviewers didn´t change their review even thoiugh the devs made a pause button the next day. That´s how a good game gets ""mixed reviews"" - fyi.			"

												This game should have been an improvement to ther very fun part 1: Trans Ocean the shippingcompany. instead the mecanics have been changed that much that is has become a compleetly diferent game.just some of the flaws:- no pause option, ther are only speeds 1, 2 and 3 inwhich 1 is still faster than noemal speed in the original game. threfor even if you are picking loads the deadlines are creeping ever closer and all other docken ships are paying a day worth of portfees ecery 5 seconds or so.- nolonger can you chose to dock manual/automati, this is now determend at random with as reason thug boat company strikes. therefor you cant save mony by docking manualy in a finachaly poor situation.- all contracts haw have a (sometimes imposible) deadline and becouse of the lack of a pause option some contracts become imposible while selecting you cargo.what did improve:- now thre is not only container cargo but also bulk and tanker cargo. this however does not add anything new since the jobmarkets for container bulk and tanker are compleetly separate.- when leaving port manualy (or entering) there is now a much bigger enviorment.- there is a minimap and a fullscreen map when sailing in to or out of a port.if you liked trans ocean 1 this still is probably not the game for you.overall 2/10			"

												I tried very hard to find something positive about Transocean 2. But after two hours of hair pulling, swearing at my computer I gave up. I loved Transocean 1  but for TransOcean 2 they royally messed it up. Unless the game designers consider a dramatic turn around and overhaul the game in everything they messed up in (See other negative reviews) then I am going to say stay well clear of  this game until they have an enjoyable finished game.

												Disappointed. Always wanted to buy TO1- did not as I saw Part 2 will be released soon.Its just not fun. Bad graphics style. Time runs and your ships get into ports the game does not stop. So you have to hurry to get some random orders loaded and send off the ship...Ridiculously bad manual docking...thinking back to Ports of Call and wondering if that old old game is still much better. :(			"

												Wow.....how underwhelming, i thoroughly enjoyed the gameplay of the original game which mixed strategy/economy with a little bit of simulation with the actual ships. This current iteration is simply boring and overwhelming, you will spend your entire time micromanaging as you can not pause to catch a breath. It's simply not enjoyable.Add to that the areas that the translation is not completed and its just a little frustrating.			"

												Not sure what else is to be said about this.From a first impression, I found it hard to find anything good in this game aside the concept. And if it's a shipping business simulation you want. Stick with the original.The ui and controls are confusing, the story mode seems a waste of time, so on so forth as in the other reviews.Having started the game I looked forward to getting back onto the ship and taking her for her maiden voyage only to be told ""Oh no, we'll just get the tugs to do it each time, just load up them contracts"" only to have my ship left in dock for 4 days as I couldn't cast her off. I understand that they will want to provide a thorough tutorial, but most people considering this game will be players of the first. But a simple re-cap and focus on the new content would have been far better.The game isn't finished, and I'm not sure if I will try it when it is. It's a mismatch that just doesn't seem to be my cup of tea. And I will most definatley stick to the original. "

												If there is 3rd opinion than Yes, No, and Netural. I would choice Netural. But, If people ask me for this game. I would have say ""yes"" and ""up to you"" Many review upset about no pause. At first I think it's not big deal about no pause. After all I have only one ship... then two ship.. 3rd ship... as you get more ships it become stress for not able to pause as they arrive port. you're not there to dock while tug ship is on strike as you time run out then get fined for arrive late. I hope they will patch to add the pause for single game. I will understand if there's no pause in mutilplayer. But It's still good game. They just need little fix like able to pause and some other issue.			"

												As it stands, I'd say stay away.There are some interesting ideas there, I love business simulations like this, the problem is that Transocean 2 is more shallow than a drained wading pool and a lot of that has to do with... well, everything.I played the first ""adventure"" mission and it was... well, okayish which I could forgive as it could be considered a tutorial.The problem is that in the sandbox game it's just..... boring. I played probably two hours of it and I have several hundred million in the bank, run a huge profit and spend most of my time micromanaging each individual ship. It's just..... dumb?It's too bad, there is potential there, but this should have never let out. I am seriously considering returning it.EDIT: As it turns out I played more than two hours, so I can't return it any longer. Well played developers, just provide just enough content to have someone exceed the two hours and you got your money. Suggestion for your next game: Just a giant big red button someone can press, sell it for a million dollars, it will provide pretty  much as much entertainment as this game.			"

Posted: May 12, 2016
												TL:DR - This, this is a piece of crap. Do not waste your money.What was presented as a promising and entertaining game/simulation is far from what is expected. Horrible gameplay mechanics are fused with an inadequate UI that together are about as refreshing as Ghandi's flip flop on a hot summer's day. The constant battle against the inexorable timer to get your cargo in before its deadline passes, mixed with an AI that is always far more powerful than the player even on the easiest settings, leads to a feeling of emptiness. I feel all used and neglected after painstakingly investing 11 hours of my life in the hopes that it would get better.I particularly disliked the story. It's a joke. The way the goals are laid out it doesn't really make sense. They somewhat contradict each other. I'm all for something that's a hard challenge, but there's got to be some light at the end of the tunnel. So far it seems the only way to progress through the laughable story is to manually choose every contract, which then leaves you in the ineviable position of not being able to take a holistic approach while you frantically find the next contract before you send the boat on its way. And therefore you end up losing out on neat little Subsidiaries to the AI's 'Mongol Horde' approach.The performance of the software, is poor. It slows down far too quickly and leaves your computer whimpering like it just did ten rounds with Mike Tyson on adderall.Are there any positives? No. Wait! I might, I might just get my money back if I'm lucky.Why is it not possible to see which ports are size limited? I have to take a huge guess and a leap of faith to discover if it's just too big to fit.Why can't the automate cycle actualy do something useful? Why is it unable to be told which speed you would like to set it at... Why can't it keep doing that cycle until I tell it to stop? By the time you get to six ships you just don't have the time to do anything but fill them with contracts. Yes Automator, this is where you step in. Only it's that inept that you might as well be urinating onto an icecap in a bid to melt it.Don't even bother giving this a go. It is by far the most miserable gaming experience I've ever had. I'm a patient person, and will happily admit I don't get them straight away... But after 11 hours, surely I should be feeling like I'm enjoying it? Not just growing ever more frustrated. "

												If you liked TransOcean 1, go play more of that. I played this for 14 minutes then requested a refund. I only wish steam could also give me my 14 minutes back.The interface is clumsy, cluttered and hard on the eyes. From my first moments in the game I sat there wondering ""how do I change my avatar or company logo?"" Then I noticed a little scroll bar along the bottom that I had to drag across the screen to show me a several icons at once. Why not just show a page of a bunch of logos or an set of arrows at the end of each box? The actual in game interface is really cluttered and hurt my eyes as I tried to race around the screen to gather useful information. This is beacuse the game doesn't have a pause button. While you're trying to choose cargos and routes the clock is always ticking. I felt rushed just trying to manage one ship. I cannot imagine how anyone would manage a dozen or more ships and find any kind of enjoyment. I don't understand so much about this... This game needs to be scuttled.			"

I can't comment on multiplayer as I play to enjoy my time, once I got to 2 ships the micromanagement became constant, I can't immagine trying to manage 10+ shipps.DO NOT waste your money on this, let them patch it a few dozen times before you even think about it.-Problems:  Increased pace without pause (currently a bug allows double space to sometimes pause the game)  Story is a joke, and wastes the players time.

												I was so incredibly hyped for this game, I have watched the development from the day it was first announced, that being said I've struggled with debating if this game is a good, short answer yes long answer: not till they fix a few things. For starters what is new? New vessels such as bulk and tanker vessels, however, they all play the same have very different benefits, The region points system, this system allows you to get benefits from a region by building subsidies and collecting a profit share off of those buildings. There is also now multiplayer which in itself is a mixed bag of nuts, on one hand, I love being able to take on my friends and see who can make the biggest company, however, dont expect to build a shipping empire on multiplayer(ill get into that later). Now what is all the fuss about, well there are a lot of drawbacks from the first game for example in the first game managing a fleet of over 10 vessels was possible (now not as much) the automation system shuts off after running one pattern and doesn't make money so you'll be stuck with notifications that ships need orders. The next system is the sabotaged system which consists of 3 options: bribe subsidies, call in a notification of contraband, freeze bank account. In multiplayer the only real useful one is the contraband call, freezing bank accounts is annoying but does literally nothing to the player other than waste money. Speaking of multiplayer here is where a lot of shortcoming with the game show them multiplayer is great, sorta... the fact that we can to take on other humans makes planning and competing for more fun and more challenging HOWEVER multiplayer is incredibly restricted and I've yet to have a game where I'm able to buy a tier 5 ship by the end of the match, another issue is even while hosting you can't control any of the settings other then sabotage on or off, and game time at 1hr,1.5hr, 2hr this time restriction make 0 sense why cant we play endless or set better goals a good way they could make multiplayer 100x better is by allowing the host to set the goals of the game, by setting the victory conditions such as first company to own X amount of ships, first company to hold X amount of regions, first company to hit X value will win. This would make multiplayer not feel like such a crapshoot another thing would be able to join a game mid game allowing the multiplayer menu not to look like a Gamespy server. The last to MAJOR drawbacks are the UI everything from TO1 that worked so well got completely screwed up the UI is annoying and confusing even for a returning player. The last thing that I have no doubt in my mind will end up changing is the price 25$ is a way to steep for this game currently with all the bugs and drawbacks however if the devs listen to the community and change a lot of the problems it would be worth 25$ easily. However even if the devs don't fix a lot of the drawback the game is still worth picking up on a sale for around 5-10$.TL;DR version PROS:Lots of new contentMultiplayer! No more forced goals multiple game modesthere is now a pause button in single playermost issuses can be fixed through updates easilyCONS:HUGE LACK OF MULTIPLAYER CONTROL (pointless restrictions)Terrible and confusing UINo loansControlling a large fleet is near impossibleyou cant see the cargo loaded on the ships anymorevery high price for what you get			"

No pause option is a main thing, it's understandable in MP but it's unbarable in SP and the time also needs to be slowed otherwise it's giving the players no breathing space which is a bad idea IMO.

												TransOcean 2 Rivals is an great example of what not to do when creating a sequel. The big element of this game is switch. It used to be focus to making a great single player game. Now the focus is set to a very crappy multiplayer game. Why did they do this? My thoughts is the people on TransOcean 1 discussions page complaining about a lack of multiplayer. Not every game needs a Multiplayer. special when it is shoehorned in like this.So the game boils down to is earning points to spend those points on land. The land will give you money. So you can then spend that money on ships to earn more points to get more land. That is the whole game. The game is ment to be played in a skirmish MP style. Where there will be goals for you to get to win. The worse part is people think this is an unfinished game. Which it pretty much is a finished game. It was just focused purely on this crappy mp gameplay.Buy TransOcean 1 and let your wallet do the talking. Now if they should ever remake this game. Going back to TransOcean 1 and dropping this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MP play style. Then you might want to give it a try. Hell I will change my recommendation if they should ever make the game worth playing.			"

												I must admit that, at first, I was disappointed with this title.  I had played the first TransOcean game and fell in love with it, so I was highly anticipating this game.  The game mechanics are changed quite a bit and that put me off for a while.  However, as I have started playing through the Single-Player Campaign and actually learn how to use all the new game mechanics I have found myself falling in love with TransOcean 2.  I'm starting to get that feeling where I just want to keep playing it to try new strategies in hopes of improving my performance.  I'm currently only on the 4th Mission of the Campaign but can honestly say the game is starting to feel like TransOcean again.  So in short:Is this the game I expected it to be? NoIs this like TransOcean 1? NoIs this a good game? YesIf I liked TransOcean 1, will I like this game?  You might not like it at first, but if you actually give it a chance and learn the new interface and mechanics, it's possible you might get the same joy and excitement you did with TransOcean 1			"

												EDIT: My old review got obsolete after the patch so this is a new one, and I have to give game developers some credit for listening to user feedback.My old biggest complaint about the game was that it had no in game pause function to be able to plan your route properly. Now it is fixed as well as some bugs. Now it more resembles a tycoon game it is supposed to be and is marketed as. Some of my complaints remain unfixed like being able to repair ships only in designated ports (I think it would make more sense to make it possible to repair your ship in any port, just make prices different), but it seems this game now is going to direction it is supposed to be. It still has some technical issues (like resolutions over 1920x1200 are not supported so if you have 4K or 2560x1440 monitor – you are out of luck, play in windowed mode or not fully use your resolution). There still is no easy way to quickly get to the port that your ship is standing in from list of ships menu.Now I can give it a careful recommendation if you are into tycoon or management games. It still has some issues, so I would recommend to wait for some more patches to come out before buying it. If you did not played the earlier game this might be more friendly to you, because it has a tutorial and should be more easy to learn for newcomers. If you played the earlier game this is not much different, but it contains new types of ships and campaign missions, so it is upon you to decide if it is worth the asking price for you.			"

												I really enjoyed TransOcean 1 and jumped right on board with this latest version.  After playing for 10 or so hours I find I just don't enjoy this version, I'm finding it just frustrating to play.Campaigns are a mutha to achieve even a simple 1 start rating in order to advance.  Some chapters are easier than others, but after chapter one, I don't see how you're going to achieve more than 1 star and even then it's pretty garsh darn hard to do so.  The AI should be gimped enough to allow at least a basic win for all but the must inept of players.The User Interface needs added features with the added diversness of the ports.  Okay, you can't get repairs at every port now but the interface should show icons of repair ports at least so you don't have to memorize repair ports from the world map.  Port features  also need to be added to contracts display for route planning.The coloring/customizing of your ships is a huge downgrade, you get just one bland color now.  I understand why they did it for simplicity of multi-player identification, but...  YUCK!  Especialy in contrast to the beautifully scenery.  I suppose it doesn't matter as my ship RARELY shows up in the port views, wasn't until Chapter 3 mine even bothered to show up.So, how are we supposed to sell those old, smaller, junky ships now?  Once their ours they are forever ours?Story continuity and game play don't sync.  The sister moves on in chapter three and her brother takes back over while she returns to feed her dogs.  But guess who's picture shows up with every contract you accept?It's obvious this was rushed out before it was ready as the level of quality in this version lacks a great deal over the previous.Overall, not fun, not enjoying it, and wished I hadn't delved into this release.  Hopefully we'll see some updates that change my feelings on this else it's destined to the dust closet. "

												Ok, I did not play much, but the only single player game I tried did get me a bit angryat some of the game mechanic.First I was lucky to have waited and not have to fight with the lack of pausewhen the game was launched. But right now I am fighting with another game mechanicthat seem flawed like hell.I tried to play a game against the maximum amount of AI competitor. Starting to build myown company I saw one of the AI company starting to soar, while working inan area that should not produce that much money (legally).Wondering if anything was 'amiss', I decided to put a Contraband detectoron my ship, and there it was. ALL the AI ships were constantly runningwith Contraband ONLY, to the point I was just swarmed under bythe message of contraband detected messages.The worse was that those ships were looking like they never get controlledby the custom (where my own was controlled almost every 3-4 Port Entrance).The AI was even more looking bad by letting their ship sink, and still geta good ""bargain"" of letting their ship sink. What company could afford to lose 3-4 ships a year, and still being""afloat"" ? The worse was that even by losing ships, and running contraband onlyrun, they even managed to perma attack me with the Customs check.Not running any contraband on that ship of mine, it was a real annoyanceas those ""check"" were done on tight schedule run, and making me losemoney. At a time I decided to try to send the customs on one of thebiggest company with contraband, and to my surprise,the very cost of my attack almost killed my company (in monetary term),but being caught red handed did almost nothing to the AI company that was caught by the customs.Running contraband should really impact a player, be itAI or human. Like losing lot of points with the area of working,or even to the point of losing invested money in project(like losing the ownership of a port installation)and not being a way for the AI to cheat it's wayup the scoreboard. But what finally got me stopping that run was the factthat the UI really need a way to have messages being less invasive.Or get a way to have those Contrabands detection warningbeing visible at another place, as I was so much floodedby the warnings that I had barely any ways to see the real importants messages about my single ship.I guess that until those issues are corrected,I will play a singleplayer, single company runand just enjoy the building of my company.

It was frustrating for me to play without a pause.So, now after the devs brought the pause function back, i'm enjoying playing the game now as i did with the TO1.There's still bugs, but the devs are (hopefully) very busy fixing them.

												As others have said,  no Auto-pause once you enter the port - which is very confusing considering TO1 had this automatically.  Weird glitches where you get the red exclamation point (to tell you that you won't make your deadline at your current speed), but your eta is sooner than the deadline, which goes away if you slow down <yes, makes no sense>!Wrong names for portsTutorial asks you to clock on a port to enter, you click the port, it doesn't let you enter, and now you are stuck on the main screen...A.I. is glitchy as well - going turbo charged between 2 ports the entire time in chapter 1.Removal of some of the basic economic things I had used in last game (like $/TEU).  I feel like I bought a beta version of this game (did they upload something from 3-4 months ago before playtesting and QA!?)  I do not recommend in its current state.BUT - The core is still there with some cool new types of ships and more variety in the game - especially later in the game.  I feel like if they work through these issues and get some additional QA, that I'll come back to a good game in a few months.   "

												I originally DL'd the game, and jumped straight into the Endless Play and couldn't even refuel my ship.  I've since been informed how to get to the tutorial, and it's educated me how to.  I do argue that with a good interface (for a sequel), I should be able to muddle my way through, and that wasn't the case in the beginning. Freight menu makes it hard to see what's selected (a grey vs a medium blue doesn't contrast well... on my screen anyway).  Quite a few language issues also, which are of course fixable.It's new, imperfect, and with some questionable changes which will be proven good or bad over time, and by the individual... but will it be a suitable spiritual successor to the first title?  I hope so.			"

												I waited before a few updates had been released before I started playing this properly, and it is quite enjoyable. Very different to the first Transocean game and clearly designed with multiplayer in mind. Running through the challenges playing through them opens up more new game features, so it gets more complex slowly. I almost gave up on the first challenge as it seemed too simple and boring, but as you go through them things get more complex so give it time. The most ships I have owned is 8 and its quite a lot of micromanaging with even just 8 large ships. It's not perfect, but it is playable and enjoyable and despite poor reviews (most created before updates were made) the Devs have continued to push out updates for it.			"

												Oh what to say about this game.Waited eagerly for the sequal to come out after loving the original game yet the developers have dropped the ball.Firstly the single campaign is way to short, and as a player who doesnt like multiplayer games (because of all the griefers and rage quitters that multi player games seem to attract) I find this trend disturbing.But its not only the shortness of the campaign that is the problem, it is the game mechanics. The game is one whole click fest especially when you either get multiple ships or on the later levels. Time passes so quickly when you are looking at contracts you have literally seconds to accept them or bang they are gone. Numerous times have I been furious clicking on missions to a certain port only to find the list has shifted up slightly and I have added cargo to a completely different port (hence losing me money through penalties)On that note lets talk about the way the game handles payments etc, say you haul a load of stuff and its says your bonus is £1.2 million there are certain deuctions that dont make sense especially when you get charged for wear and tear on your ships but for that money they are never repaired.On the note of the ships, seems to me that the sea is made of acid or some kind of corrosive substance as your ships decay at an alarming rating so in some scenarios you are left with a choice of either fixing a rotting ship or buying a new one to increase profits etc.To be fair I was saying to people hold off buying the first game and buy the sequal instead but after playing the campaign mode and not being interested in multiplayer I would have to say the first game is superior to this one. Dont get me wrong I am a big fan of the empire\tycoon money making genre but this is just done wrong.Edit after patch please read.Well it is a pleasant surprise for developers to actually listen to customers. (EA and others take note)There has been a patch to this game and so far it has improved the single player game no end. The addition of the pause function has turned this game from the click fest it was before the patch to a proper strategy business type simulation game. It gives you time to think out your moves instead of widly clicking contracts because you have 20 seconds or so.Another patch that has occurred is that they have slowed down the ship decay rate so it doesnt feel like you ships are sailing in seas of acid anymore. My only major grip still left is the exclusion of a 2560x1080 mode as I have big black lines down the side of my screen and in todays world 2560x1080 is pretty standard.But I do have to give props to the developers for fixing most of what was wrong with the game and it is now enjoyable to play so i revise my rating from negative to positive			"

												Straight up, Deck13 are good people and they've made a good game.On release day I wrote a pretty negative review of TO2, mainly because it lacked single player pausing. It made the thing, in my mind, basically unplayable. I guess a lot of other people felt the same way, so in the most recent patch, Deck13 added it in. It's super clear all they want is to make a really good game that lots of people enjoy. I'm into that.If you liked TO1, you'll find this to be pretty familiar. Rivals add an interesting challenge and the campaign is a lot more fleshed out. If you played TO1 and though 'I want more story' then this is definitely worth buying. However, they've simplified a couple things in the process - money management doesn't feel as big, and the ship handling minigame is, somehow, even more annoying than last time. If you played TO1 and thought 'I want more intricate mechanics', you might be dissapointed.Regardless, I'm really enjoying TO2 and Im probably going to play the hell out of it when I get the chance. I'm looking forward to multiplayer as well, which is kind of a first for me. Like I said, Deck13 are doing what a lot of other companies don't by actually listening to what players are saying and building their game around what they hear.I've left my old review for posterity below, but it's now totally obsolete.------------------- PREVIOUS REVIEW (MAY 10TH) ---This game has good bones but it's a serious departure from TransOcean 1. Where its predecessor was a careful, intricate, satisfying management sim, TO2 is an uncontrollable mess. I attribute this almost exclusively to the lack of pause in the time controller. I get what they were trying to do, but because time never stops you're just frantically pushing through the game mechanics instead of actually enjoying them. It's supposed to be about selecting the best contracts, planning the most efficient routes, building and managing a fleet, and keeping up with objectives and rivals - but when a day goes by every 10 seconds you can't afford to stop and spend a GD second to think about any of it. It plays like a reactionary mobile game instead of a sim. Not to mention the fact that time continues even when you're docking/undocking or in a port loading screen. The hell is that about.I just feel totally detached from the many great things this game offers. I can only afford two seconds to look at the helpful economic graphs and variety of well-modeled ships. TO1 felt like so much more of a realized world - TO2 might be even better in that regard but I was too busy manically trying to keep up with the game to tell. All I want to do now is sit in silence and have time to think.Also probably 10% of it's still in German.			"

If you see this game for $5-$10 or under, scoop it up for a couple of hours/minutes of shipping fun..I liked the first one too, it had issues, but I thought they were gonna improve on them. This is somewhat of a different game..  Which isn't bad, but not what I was expecting and not executed properly.			"

												I am very dissapointed with this game. I loved the first one and I was under the impresion that this second one was going to be even better, but is not.  I was able to play the game when first came out but after the first update, is not loading anymore, it just stay looping at the splash screen and not tech support is telling me that is my computer not meeting the minimum specs.  so how was I able to play the game in the beginning??Personally I do not recommend this game at this time,			"

												I liked Transocean 1 and was hoping on an improvement for this title. Boy was I disapointed. It's worse then the first in so many ways. I asked a refund after 31 minutes of play time, but I guess this had a silver lining because I started searching for another game like Port of Call (which I hoped this game would be) and found http://www.portsofcall.de/ I really recommend everyone who's dissapointed or hasn't bought this to check it out.As for Transocean 2 rivals, stay away, even if they implement the pause function, it is just too shallow!

												-Update: After the latest patch I have changed my review.  Check ***Update*** markers for changes.Problems:-I understand no pause in multi-play, but why in single play?  I always feel rushed and can never take time to plan things.  What is the point to all the ship stats, you don't have time to read them, your ships are arriving in port now.  What is the point to the ships finiancial stats, you don't have time to read it, your ships are arriving in port now.  What is the point to the contract list, you don't have time to read it your ships are arriving in port now. = Not fun.***Update***: This has now been fixed with a patch. :)-There is a feature that lets you plan a ships route 4 stops in advance, but it costs an insane amount of money so don't use it if you are not a tanker.-Bulk ships are not a viable starting ship.***Update***: Now that you can take your time to plan, the starter bulk ship can work.  The trick is to upgrade the ship right away or it will never make money. (Still a tough one to start with.)The orignal game with bulk ships and tankers would have been much better than this.  A little tweak to company contracts, a tweak to to the jobs list, a tweak to how you can drive into port, and poof a great improvement.Bottom Line:I liked the original game much better.  Don't be in a hurry to buy this unless they patch it.I am not asking for a refund, I am hoping they patch it.***Update***: They patched it.  Simply adding the auto pause makes all the difference in the world and it is possible to get into this game.  I have chnage my review to recomend. :)			"

All aspects have been thoroughly thought, and the result is just astonishing.Moreover, the game is being improved over time, and this shows how dedicated the Developers are - just another advantage of the game that has all potential to grow and become even better!

												“TransOcean 2: Rivals” is developer Deck13’s sequel to their shipping company simulation and economy management game, “TransOcean: The Shipping Company.” The “Rivals” part in the title hints mostly to the multiplayer aspect of the game, but it can also be considered a part of the story.Didn’t think a shipping tycoon game could have a story? Neither did I.The story for this game seems to pick up right where I assume the first game left off, which I haven’t played before. Our avatar is a former shipping magnate who has been reduced to bankruptcy, living life out in the boonies until a lady named Heather Witherspoon approaches us. She introduces herself as the sister of our former advisor, and she wants our help in raising money to pay for her brother’s exorbitant bail. In order to do so, she needs us to helm a shipping company again. With our reluctant agreement, the game’s story mode begins.“TransOcean 2” does a great job in introducing game mechanics to newcomers. Within each chapter is a new mechanic, and by the time we reach the last chapter, we need to use everything we’ve learned in order to succeed. The tutorials are thorough and easy to learn, thanks to their step-by-step examples and hands-on opportunities. Continental regions are introduced gradually in order to give us a feeling of expansion, and to let us get acclimated with the increasing shipping demands. The map, where we will spend the majority of our time, has several viewing options to help us with what we need to do. Those who already know how to play can also opt to skip the tutorial.The only problem with the tutorial is that you are forced to take time out of the chapter to satisfy the requirements. I found myself failing some missions because I lost valuable time and resources trying to follow the directions. Eventually, I just decided to go ahead and do the tutorials before restarting the chapter anew.Considering that the mechanics are integral to your success, the tutorials should not have been designed to be executed at the cost of your mission time. The tutorials should have been a separate instance which closes as soon as you’re done. Imagine if your math teacher started teaching your class the basics of parabola on test day while time is ticking. You’d be hard-pressed to finish the test on time.Once the tutorial is over, you can finally set sail and start conquering the seas. Each chapter has three assigned goals - you only need to fulfill one in order to unlock the next chapter. Fulfilling all three goals per chapter doesn’t really net you any bonus, other than bragging rights and a gold medal.But before you even think of nabbing that gold medal, be prepared to click a lot. This game, which I lovingly called “Carpal Tunnel Click Fest” at one point, pits you against computer players that operate a little too perfectly. They’re not impossible to beat later on in each chapter, but they gain ground against you very quickly in the beginning.This results in a mad dash to your micromanagement zen, this game’s true heart and soul. Each chapter, you are left to micromanage your growing fleet of ships in order to meet the minimum goal. You click through a lot of screens just to load your ships up. Even though you can disable some of the interfaces that pop up, there are still a lot of clicking to do when you’re managing 25 or so ships. You click to buy a ship. You click to pick a contract. You click to take that contract. You click on a destination to sail your ship in order to fulfill that contract. You click to fast-forward time because let’s face it, watching your ship sail slowly is gutwrenchingly boring. You click to check your ship’s gas and maintenance level. You get the idea.---------------------------------------Full review at http://playertheory.com/review/transocean-2-rivals "

												Payed $30 NZ for this game. Spent the afternoon shagging around trying to get it to run. No go! Cant get past loading screen. I can only assume, especially after reading these reviews, forums and considering that it is a sequel,  that the game suffers from shoddy workmanship.  Life is too short to mess with some one elses mess for too long, so I am cutting my losses and uninstalling. Shame could have got a really good game for that money, and TO1 was great.			"

												I played a lot the previous version of the game and spent counless hours in ports of call when i was  young (this was on amiga console. Basically the same game but a lot less shiny.) Some of the reason i dont really like this game is likely because im tired of the game. To me, preferring to play single player the game doesn`t really seem to bring too much new in the sense of gameplay.I do like the way information is presented in the game but the mechanics in general to me feels annoying more than anything else and I`d rather get my money back to play something else then trying harder to enjoy it.That being said its not a bad game, I just think the previous game was better. At least from a single player view.			"

												Can I recommend this game  YES/NO.First of all the game is beautifull, and if you played the first game in the serioues then number 2 is very much the same, but with a few new things such as being able to buy ship yards and other businesses.You can also in the new game sabotage ohter players ships, though I cant really see much reason to do it due to many reasons I will not write about there.Gameplay very fast become very much the same, and borring. At the point where you have 4x50million ships you will make so much money you can buy a new ship very often, and even with 4 ships they come and go so often that you very much do nothing more than sit and select contracts all the time and seeing your other ships just sitting there doing nothing waiting for you to finish and giving them a new contract while the days passes by since there are no pause function. This is good but once you have many ships you simply will see pop up messages all the time and it ruin part of the gameplay. YES you can make your ships automatic them self choose contracts and sail arround, but i did not my self try this much. Never the less game became borring after a few houres and I doubt I will play it again.Though I do not like the game much, then it is a nice game like ""ports of call""  and there are allot of different ships to choose from, and you can sail in all of them in and out of the harbour now and then wehn tugs are on strike.Game have many nice features such as the harbours and sailing the ships ( arcade style ).and you can upgrade your ships in many different ways from cooling containers to the ability to sail with illegal goods.You can even sabotage your enemys ships with ordering costoms check for illegal goods if and they pay heavy fines if cought smuggling.All in all nice game, just get borring very fast.

												I don't know what the negativity is...Just fired it up so I haven't played much but wanted to comment on the often bad review for game lacking pause... ummm, the game HAS A PAUSE.   You simply hit space bar TWICE, the menu pops up and then closes.  You can then do whatever you want in pause mode and then click the button or the numbers 1,2,or 3 to speed game again.  Don't know how that could be overlooked as I figured that out in less than 5 minutes.  I will come back to update this later... right now I want to play it.   I never had TO-1, so right now this game looks pretty cool.			"

												Transocean 2 is a game in which you play as a shipping company tycoon. Your goal is to manage your ships and earn millions, avoiding contracts failure. The mechanics are very similar to the first Transocean.Developers added several new features to those already present in the first game: now there are tank and bulk ships, in addition to the container ships on which the first game only focused, there are subsidiaries in all ports, that let you earn extra cash, there is a very useful automation features and, as the battle horse of the game, rival companies that fight with you even with sabotage.The gameplay is focused on fast-paced multiplayer sessions, but there are also singleplayer modes like the endless game and the competition mode against IA rivals.That means that each single match is difficult at the beginning, but once you're on the way, it lets you earn millions with no difficulties. This is good for multiplayer and competition mode because sessions can have a length of a maximum of 2 hours, but is bad for singleplayer endless mode because, after the starting difficulties, it's a 5 lane highway to billions of cash.The game is also a little bit ""arcade"" in my opinion, in comparison with first Transocean; ships need to be repaired too much for my tastes, refueling costs a lot and sometimes contract value are totally unreasonable, not depending from distances between ports but from ""x"" factors still I dont' understand. But, I think, this is related to the different structure of the game, if compared whith TO1.On the technical side, the game is very well built, no bugs or crashes after several hours of gameplay. Graphic is very nice.In conclusion, the game is good, it disappointed me a little 'cause I was expecting a worthy successor of Transocean, and Transocean 2 Rivals is not what I expected, but if you like a fast-paced arcade multiplayer focused on shipping companies, this is the game for you.If you like a singleplayer slow-paced more simulative gameplay, so the first Transocean is what fits you best.

												I was a big fan of Transocean I, and had been looking forward to Transocean II for a long while.The developers have invested their time and effort in making this a multi-player game. Unfortunately for myself and for a lot of die hard TO1 fans, this is not something I was waiting for. In the meanwhile the multi-player room seems dead. My preference was for a proper business simulation game, which I prefer to play in endless sandbox mode, and this is where TO2 is lagging behind compared to TO1. Over and over we have asked for more economic realism and complexity, but  child of 10 would be able to start TO2 and turn 20 million in 1 billion in less than a year. The developers have been made aware of this point and of many, many other frustrations (e.g. still no full / unlimited automation). We are now 6 months after the release and have only seen patches to fix things that were clearly broken, but nothing that properly addresses the issues at hand.Initially I had given the developers the benefit of the doubt, but the lack of communication / roadmap is simply not acceptable anymore. Don't ask for feedback if you are not willing to engage in the dialogue!The game has the potential to be fun, but it's time for more patches, and for proactive communication about them.Bernard			"
