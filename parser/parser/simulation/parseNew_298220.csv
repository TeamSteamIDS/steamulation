								This isn't one of those games that you sit down and click away with one eye open and half a brain engaged -- this game is HARD. Not hard like impossible for bad reasons, or stupid puzzles. You're marooned on Mars with no support, no other people, and no plan but to survive. How easy would that be in real life? And you have an entire planet to deal with, and explore. You have to change Mars itself into Earth using pretty much nothing as starting equipment. It's a long, long process and you have to really THINK about what you're doing the whole way. This game isn't for the average 6 year old IQ who just wants to blow stuff up. You have to build and maintain everything you need to live, keep it all topped up, hope you are able to grow enough food to survive, bust your butt to ensure you can get enough fuel to just keep from freezing, keep the air flowing, and keep every bit of lichen, or bacteria, or shrub alive in conditions harsher than anything Earth has to offer. Making Mars into Earth isn't easy, but man is it worth it.			"

								Graphics: For a large voxel, i.e. minecraft type game, when smoothed, looks really good, when in construction mode, blocky, still looks fairly good. Sound: Monotnous. At the moment, I've only noticed one track playing which is very ambient. The breathing you get naturally is annoying, but can be tuned out.Options: There are no real options at the moment, other than resolution, windowed/fullscreen, texture, and anti-aliasing. Definitely a point that needs worked on.Gameplay: For 3 arks in this game, the first two are relatively quick, and the third part, is just waiting. Overall lack of depth.Bugs: It is still beta, but I would say it feels more like a late alpha. Lots of glitches to the game. Certain people get horrendous lag in certain areas. Dissapearing items, and such forth.Overall: I would recommend this game with one caveat, if you want a polished execution of a game, at this moment, this is not the game for you. But, if you want to have some fun, in an adult form of minecraft, this game could be worth your while. Overall, if you are not sure of the game, I'd wait a while till you buy it, but definitely keep an eye on it			"

												I really want to like this, but I can't recommend it without serious stability improvements. Constant CtDs and no autosave make this an exercise in frustration, and annoyingly if you're interested more in the terraforming aspect there's no way to avoid a fairly tedious dungeon crawl early on.Infrequent updates don't help - going months between patches is not acceptable when your game is this unstable. This could be a great game, but at the moment it's a bug ridden mess with a terrible UI. Given the apparent lack of developer attention I wouldn't risk money on this while it's in Early Access.Edit: retried after release. Crashed to desktop within 10 seconds of starting. Don't bother.

								Glitchy, buggy, and rough around the edges. If the developers keep up the work it might be interesting, but for now it's a little too unstable, a little too difficult to control, and a little too unclear about how to play or craft to be playable. Invest if you dare, but realize that this is an extremely early alpha at best right now.UPDATE (11/19/2015):The game continues to be plagued with bugs which will cause random and frequent crashes to desktop. I wish I could play this game but I can't. Crafting a shovel seems to have a 25% chance of crashing the game, even after several months of waiting for this issue to be fixed. Crashes while loading are also common, as well as a bug where you can jump, hit the ground, stay in a floating animation, and forever be unable to jump again. This and many more bugs make the game unfortunately unplayable, and as such I can't reccomend it, since it appears these bugs will be with us for a long, long time.UPDATE (2/8/2016):Good and bad news. The good news: game is stable now- I didn't experience a single volatile crash in about fifteen minutes of trying it out.The bad news is that everything else about the game is still the same. The tutorial is still underwhelming and doesn't explain how to do much of anything besides craft a pickaxe or open our inventory. The third person camera still clips through the planet. There appear to be absolutely no changes or additions besides improved stability (although that may just be luck) from when I last played in November. Level 1 pickaxes can mine the brown dirt near the crash site but not the tan-gray surface dirt, and I still don't know why and will probably never find out. I still don't know what a bucket is for, or how to use it. Our astronaut even still has empty eye sockets that creep me the hell out and make me wonder if this isn't Mars but instead some sort of spherical purgatory. I cannot reccomend this game.			"

								If you are space/mars exploration enthusiast, this game will leave you sweating and gasping for air. You will come to appreciate the availability of oxygen, water, and food (which most of the time is just a spacesuit-not-needed-bus ride away).If you are not a space/mars exploration enthusiast, you will sweat and gasp even more (and possibly experience mental breakdown at some point), but even in your despair, something amazing will happen. You will discover a new kind of appreciation for your life on Earth (because you will realize how ****ty everything is millions of miles in every direction from Earth). Self-help taken to the next level.  "

												tl;dr: Game is completely broken and bugged, no QA been done at all. Graphics are horrid, pricing is completely inpurportunate=====I got this game as a gift a few years ago when it was still in early access.Back then I tried playing but the game was incredibly unstable and buggy. A few weeks ago I tried again but little has changed, the entire tutorial is still the same, buggy and crashed the game in the end.Graphics are way below any standard, so are the sound effects. Gameplay looks like it has the elements to be there and to be a game in it's own right. I'm not here to insult the developer, I'm sure there has been a lot of work and learning here but this doesn't mean the product of that can be excused for what there has been put down here.-Stability is the number one issue here, crashes galore and bugs for more.-Menus are clunky and UI/X has not been iterated up on since early early access.-Graphics got a call from 1998 and it was laughing, models and textures both really lacking any quality, let alone animations, a lot of actions even lack animations.-I'm sorry if you like survival, terraforming or mars, there are better games out there more decently priced for their performance.-Price does not match quality what so ever, I don't have the hours to know all the content at all. But the instability, bugs and problems surely ruin the experience to even try.Sorry can't even rate this game out of 10. Without any improvement of a working product it's 0.			"

												I bought this game back when it was in early access to support what sounded and looked like an amazing concept (along with several other survival/colonization games of the time).  After years with no updates I had forgotten it was even in my Steam library.  Imagine my surprise to find that not only are there still no updates, but the game is no longer in early access.  What the heck, I'll install it again...Nope, looks just as bad as it did two years ago.  Crashes 3x trying to play the first 30 seconds of the tutorial.  So screw it, I'll try the real game - it can't be that hard to figure it out.  OK here are some metal plates and rods, I'll make a....shovel?  Surely that's the most important thing to craft when stranded on Mars...I now have a shovel, it's time to do some terraforming!  So let's see, I'll click on the dirt?  It's not doing anything but I can't stop shoveling....maybe I'll try to equip one of these steel rods instead, I can plant it upright and start building a shelter.  Oh wait, all I can do is put it back down just like I found it but look!  The crafting menu says I can make a hammer; we all know hammers are necessary!  With my new hammer and trusty shovel I decide that I'll explore my surroundings for a place to build a new home.  After a 30 second jaunt around the planet, I return to the wreck of my ship and attempt to use my hammer on it.  Apparently this is NOT what you do to survive on Mars as Terraformer immediately stopped working.This is one of those games that has made me hesitate to give any money to early access developers in the future - it could have been great but they settled for mediocre.  2/10			"

								I like the direction it's going. I really do. The only real issue I can see so far is its early stage of development. When you are constantly living in fear of the ""Falling"" glitch, that's something to be said for a game that tries to be so immersive that it plays you the song of your respirator's people.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, I'll explain... You have to constantly listen to your own breathing. Oh, you meant the game-breaking and ever-lurking bug? Why, that's when you hit terrain funny, or the edge of such, or the game just gets a wild hair up its♥♥♥♥♥ and decides that you aren't touching ground. You can 'float' along, stuck in the falling animation and gaining digital momentum,  until you manage to trigger either the same or a different bug, which forcibly helps you meet the ground directly under your boots, at terminal velocity. For me, it happens about once every hour. Could be more, could be less, and I often forget to save. That... is what makes this game unplayable in its alpha state for me. That one bug. Does that mean I say the game sucks juevos grande? No, of course not! Like I said, I like the direction it's going.  I like having to care for the suit and all your needs, (power, water, oxygen etc.) and feel it's a nice touch to differentiate it from other block-mining games, as well as giving the term 'SURVIVAL' its meaning.  The enemies, once you find them, I couldn't help but laugh at when I glanced through the forums and first found their lairs. The crafting system, while not very intuitive or flashy, works well, (I'd recommend mentioning to people that turning on a forge while holding it will kill them... and a better guide of what to do to advance your tech wouldn't go amiss. Particularly iron. Maybe some sort of mission parameters and planned actions tab on the PDA, like proper space missions. Could even tie in the milestone achievements in-game to it.) As with all early-access games, especially alpha-builds, this thing needs work. A lot of work. But... if this all pans out right, I got a good feeling about it.It's tough... but I'm gonna say I DO recommend the game, not for what it is now, but what it looks like the dev wants it to be.			"

												I would be without a conscience if I agreed with the claim that this game is finished. The interface is just awful, the tutorial and guides are all but useless and the game crashes. A lot.Has the game improved in the past year? Yes. greatly.. is it worth getting? If you like survival crafting games? Yes. very much so. Is the game a full release? Nope. But they are very close.What this game needs? A more intuitive and streamlined user interface, a more comprehensive tutorial covering MANY aspects of the game in a virtual environment. A sequence at the beginning of the game in which your character crashes TO the planets surface. and of course... Less crashing :3This games' flaws do NOT outweigh what they have done properly so I DO strongly recommend getting this game, if only to support the developers to encourage them to update the game.

												Considering this game was released in 2013 and I have had to for two years with no updates Id naturally assume the dev took the money and abandoned this game. Therefore Id say dont waste your money. It is buggy and crashes ad least 2 times every hour and considering my PC can run the witcher 3 max graphics on 4k with 60fps id say its deffinatly the game.The graphic quality is on par with minecraft, A.K.A♥♥♥♥♥♥ The game itself is slow and does not flow. The conscept is ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic however due to the lack of a proper developer and a decent engine the gane turned to♥♥♥♥♥♥Someone PLS make a game like this I want this concept to become a reality and not just a money grab like this lump of♥♥♥♥♥♥simplely put, dont buy this game unless you want to waste your money.

												I'd like to say yes, and tell you all to buy it. But the game is just... it's boring.I got this because of the premise, Terraform Mars. Instead I ended up being put in a game where you look at everything and think ""God damn who dredged this out of the crap heap?"". The features are good, yes. But the look, textures, poly's, bugs, learning curve are such major down points.I died 17 times trying to get enough materials to survive and set up a small shelter. 17. In most games you don't even get close to death before you've made a shelter.			"

								I am a fan of this game, as a si-fi fan, I really enjoy the idea behind this game. The graphics remind me of a sort of Source Engine game such as; Half-Life or Portal. Although, I did find a jumping/sprinting bug while playing through the tutorial where after your character jumps, it glitches and you find your screen jerking around, opon zooming out, I see my character somewhat, in a mid jump. Once this bug is fixed, I think this will be a great game :D.Although the menu could use some work, I rate this game a 8/10, due to a few bugs. A definant pickup for fans of open sandbox games and things of that sort :D.I am excited for future updates.			"
