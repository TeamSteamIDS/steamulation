								It's a simulation game. It doesn't hold your hand at all. The game wants you to build a shelf? How about some messed up looking modern art instead? The choice is yours. I had fun messing around in this game, but obviously it's not going to be for everyone. Pros:- Do whatever the hell you want. - There's a bunch of tools so you can modify the furniture to make it ""better.""- Lovely soundtrack and a very clean visual style.Cons:- Very hard to actually build things.- Controls may be frustrating, although that's part of the game's charm			"

								Heck yeah this game is fun.  I find it brilliant when people make really fun games about mundane activities. I played this with three people and it plays like a really challenging (yet lovely) puzzle game. It is basically an IKEA simulator. You get DIY furniture and have to figure out how to assemble it. Its really difficult. I don't think I have made anything perfectly yet.Pros:+Full controller support+Really nice artwork and overall ambience (i.e. you can adjust the lights and play with everything in the rooms)+Plenty of content so far (three rooms plus sandbox and a community challenge)+Music is greatCons:-Not a big deal, but it would be nice to have a zoom function for those small parts when I am playing from the couchOverall, this is totally worth the small asking price. I will definately be playing a good bit of this. "

												After about an hour of assembling furniture, much like the first time I moved into my first apartment, everything look horrible. It was all misaligned and strewn about the room in a fashion one would expect from a newborn elephant attempting to decorate. I love it. The music in the background really allows you to relax and focus whatever you are working on. It sets the tone for the ""ikea"" home decorator we all have inside of us. The gameplay feels super solid and made it fun to actually assemble furniture... then destroy it... then play in confetti... This game hits all the fun points of a unique puzzle indie game. I highly recommend picking it up.			"

								TLDR; this game is really fun as a casual party game. The sandbox mode (called 'Form' in the game) can be a blast with a few friends, and the building challenge(s) are great for solo play. Definitely recommended at this price, and more features promised within the next few months is a bonus.Pros:- Really entertaining w/ a few friends- Funny premise and furniture titles- Challenge(s) are great, show potential- Sandbox mode gives free roam for creative designsCons:- It's early access.. so there's not a ton of content just yetYou could call it 'furniture building simulator' or '[redacted for legal reasons swedish furniture store] simulator', but that's kind of missing the point. It's pretty clear from the start that the objective is to be as creative as possible, not to assemble things by instructions (actually, there are no instructions). The game doesn't currently rate you by how well you built anything or whether it looks anything like the box your furniture came in- the point was to have free roam instead of linear objectives. Building things the way they are supposed to look becomes difficult fairly quickly, so instead I tend to build pseudo versions of that piece or make robots. I could see the benefit of a mode that rates your creations against what's on the box in a future update, but ultimately that would be to give the player more choices on top of the really entertaining modes that are already there. In the 'form' mode, which is like a sandbox, you can order new pieces from the catalog. The boxes float in and, once you open them, the pieces spill out. There are pegs and holes to line up in any way that you wish, and up to five people can join you. In the sandbox mode, having a few friends around really helps. While messing with pieces and trying in vain to coordinate with friends, I was reminded of great couch co-ops like New Super Mario and the like. Things can quickly turn into a hysterical yelling match as two people with best intentions create a monstrosity of a bookshelf, while the guy at the other end of the couch chases them with a mallet. It's a blast.The 'function' mode gives you challenges by which you must build furniture to meet a stated objective (there's only one challenge now, but it's pretty clear that more will be added). This mode is great for solo play, and really shows the potential that could be had with the elements of the game. Group play definitely works here too, as long as you don't have a rogue friend with a mallet destroying your hard work (ask me how I know)..I play with a Xbox 360 controller. It seems this was the intention of the devs (there are pics of 360 controllers in the initial loading screen). I briefly used a touchpad when some friends were over and, while it works, it wasn't how I'd recommend playing. There's a slight learning curve to figuring out the best way to rotate pieces, but it's pretty straightforward and easy to pick up. The cursor movement pace speeds up and slows down depending on what you're holding, which really helps when you're lining up pegs to put together. Basically, controllers work best and buttons are simple and intuitive.Overall, I'm really glad I picked this up. It's great to see more games like this available on steam that focus on local coop (because yes, some PC gamers like that). Definitely happy with the current state, and very much looking forward to where this thing goes.			"

												TL;DR, If you want MORE unintuitive control games like surgeon simulator, I am bread, QWOP; but with the added twist of the spatial perspective problems of inside-out meshes, you might like this game, otherwise, you'll be very frustrated by it.I honestly didn't enjoy it for two reasons.1:  This game relies upon unituitive controls for it's difficulty, and I'm starting to view games that do this the same way I view goat simulator: Made for youtubers.  Don't get me wrong, unlike goat simulator, there is a challenge involved in this (though whether or not you like this sort of challenge is another story), however, I'd imagine the demand for watching this type of game is much higher than the demand for playing this game.  I wouldn't be bashing the game for something like this if it marketed itself as Surgeon Simulator builds Ikea.  I take issue with this difficulty because it's a cheap cop-out to making an actually difficult game while simultaneously weasling your way out of making a control setup that feels good to use.  It's the kind of difficulty that rewards unending patience rather than developing skill, it's not my cup of tea.But, I understand that there's still a niche for games like surgeon simulator, and I won't talk poorly of a game for trying to fill this niche.  I will, however, damn such a game that says ""You know what, clunky controls and a generally obstructed view of what you're doing isn't frustrating enough, let's mess with spatial perspective itself!""2:  Most of the screenshots and videos for this game make it look like you have an Isometric perspective, right?  Nope!  all the gameplay footage that isn't taken with VR is actually viewing the world from the bottom up rather than top down if we make the dangerous assumption that the edges of an object indicate it's orientation rather than the faces that we're seeing.  It took me a few minutes to realize why things didn't look right, but basically the way that it works is that they take the camera's viewpoint really far away from the actual world, put it below the structure in question, and then turn the meshes inside out so that we see the far edges of an object on top of the close edges.  Or for a simpler understanding, go find something that you can view a wireframe cube and manipulate you're viewpoint, figure out which side's the front, and then tell yourself that it's actually the back side and imagine that face as the back of the cube instead of the front, then move the camera around the cube, things should move weird.  If that sounds confusing... it is... it's something you only learn if you look at enough wireframe objects the wrong way for long enough periods of time to actually notice it.Shame, I was actually in the mood for a good team-ikea building game, unfortunately this one not only gives you some crappy controls, but goes out of its way to make it worse by turning everything inside out and upside down			"

								First off, I don’t know too much about the developers, The Stork Burnt Down, but if this is their ‘freshman’ effort then I’m eagerly awaiting any additions to their catalogue. The team behind Home Improvisation has put together a polished product that is at once both meticulously thought out and almost boringly simple.  Taking one of the more straightforward and frustrating tasks known to humanity-- assembling store bought furniture--Home Improvisation turns the tables (pun intended) on domestication, allowing players to transform the task of assembling furniture into an effort of intellect (following the sole source of direction via the picture on the box) or free expression (throwing inhibition to the wind and making abstract art a la Duchamp).  Home Improvisation is a puzzle of a game that’s fun to tinker with for hours on end.Notes:1.	I’ve played both single player and with friends, and found that this game proves that the human imagination has a knack for turning anything into play and that this is best enjoyed with others.2.	I’ve appreciated how well the developers have kept their audience in the loop. It seems that they’ve been quick and appreciative in their responses to criticisms and concerns.  Very good sign that this team will keep their audiences in mind as they continue to make more games.3.	The controls have a small learning curve. I handled them OK from the get go, but I’m sure that has to do with my 3D modeling background.  Interesting take on the game mechanics. Excited for more polished explorations to come in future titles.PRO TIP : The cat has nine lives…uhhherr…uses.     "

												For the record, I have only played this game single-player and in the HTC Vive. Is this a game? Is it software? I'm not sure how to answer that, though I can say with certainty, it is a REALLY fun VR experience.When I first played it, I wasn't really sure what to think of it, and only played for about 30 minutes. My second session lasted 1.5 hours and was a lot more fun. Am I still terrible at putting furniture together? You bet! Does it matter? Nope. This is one hell of a VR experience, and I highly recommend it for people who are looking for things to do in their HTC Vive.			"

												I can't say enough great things about this game. While I don't like how the new trailer markets the game, the original trailer shows how pieces of furniture don't quite fit together. That was the selling point for me, as you're really building this crappy Ikea furniture, and experiencing how frustrating it really is. This game excels in VR. I REALLY feel like I'm sitting on the floor of whatever room I'm in and building this furniture. Then there's dollhouse mode that allows you to feel like you're building everything on a little set. I love this game, and it's absurdly innovative.			"

I didn't like the controls i would of prefered something more along the lines of shift click to move on Z-axis and middle mouse scrolling to elivate is not a good option imho.The game had potential to be a fun replacement for the home creator in the sims, a game which can consume HOURS of someones life just making a dream house. This is def something i'll come back to but till then i'm going to not invest at this time.			"

								Have you ever said to youself, ""If only I could have the stressful experience of assembling Ikea furniture, without actually assembling actual furniture?"" Then this game is for you. This game is stressful, but oddly rewarding. I don't know how to describe the feeling of ""successfully"" building a ""kanelbuller stol"". For those of you who played the demo, this version offers multiple rooms: the attic, basement, living room, and dining room. The game isn't perfect, and at times I cannot access the dining room, but this is a kind of game that I make my friends play just to see their reaction. I have not yet tested the multiplayer mode, but so far whenever I try to connect to other players online I have not had luck. Something else to note is the lack of depth perception when you play; your mallet may look like it is in the middle of the room but it may actually be in the edge of the room and there is no real way of figuring that out without dropping the item.TLDR: Somehow fun, very challenging, bit glitchy at times but the developers seem to take player's comments and criticisms, could be fun with friends.

								I had the pleasure of testing VR in this game before release, and it was an absolute blast. It's a perfect fit.If you have an HTC Vive, this is a must-play. It even allows cross-play between VR and non-VR players so your friends don't have to just WATCH what you're doing, they can participate!But even without VR this game is great fun, especially with a group of people. As a sort of sandbox furniture-building game, there are a lot of ways to have fun playing it -- one person might enjoy the solitary experience of carefully crafting furniture and decorating a room juuuust right, another might enjoy making clever furniture mash-ups with their friends, while yet another might just enjoy making a great big mess. I once watched a kid play it for HOURS, perfectly engrossed in exploring the different rooms and playstyles.A game about building furniture sounds absurd, and that's because it is. This fantastically weird game embraces its absurd (yet strangely compelling) subject matter and takes it well beyond its logical conclusion. And with a high level of polish, too. It's clear that a ton of thought went into every aspect of this game and it's really impressive to see that in such an off-the-wall indie release.Did I mention that this is a great drinking game? Seriously, it's hilarious.If you're at all curious about this game, check it out. You won't be disappointed.Note: I played this game on my friend's account, for the most part. I've probably played it for about 10 hrs total so far.			"

												First of all, to address the controls issue that everyone else seems to have with this game: they are honestly not that bad. I was playing this game with my brother and he was using KB+M and I was using an Xbox controller. This game is much better with a controller in my opinion, but that doesn't make using KB+M impossible either.What you see with this game is basically what you get: you have a house with rooms, and each room has its own set of furniture. Complete pieces of furniture to get access to more tools, rooms, and some challenge levels.Even though this game is technically a sandbox I would probably say the most enjoyable bit is building the pieces of furniture regularly, which took the two of us about 3 hours total. I'm sure this part can be replayed over and over with new people, and I can't wait to see which of my friends want to play this game along with me.I will admit that once you've unlocked everything, the free build part needs more work. I would prefer if you could order individual or custom pieces instead of getting whole boxes, and if there was an option to clear all the pieces in a room.That being said, I had a fun time with this game, and it's definitely a new experience.

								♥♥♥♥ing amazing. Made me wanna go to Ikea and put my newfound table building skills to test. But then I realised I had crossed the line and delved into some sort of sadistic table craving weirdo mentality. y'know, the kind who hangs around furniture stores breathing really heavily whilst shaking...Before you buy this game, know that It is really only meant to be played with friends. So first off, you're gonna need to find some friends... You'll also be needing a few controllers to play with, I suggest Xbox controllers, as I found difficulties using PS4 and WiiU Pro controllers!Once you and your mates are all sat down armed with virtual hammers and nails then you can get started creating wooden abominations that truly are things of nightmares. The game is basically split into two modes. In one you can choose a room in a house, Garage, Living room, etc... Now you can open up an Ikea-esque manual and choose what you want to ""try"" and construct. Upon choosing, parts will rain from the sky! Now comes the tricky part. Using the tools given to you, you and your friends will now need to put said pieces into place. The problem being, that the end product may not look anything like what was on the box. This is great fun to♥♥♥♥♥♥about on with some mates.The second gamemode is a party mode, which will yet again see you and your friends testing your new found powers. Things in this gamemode include stacking parts like a big game of Jenga, and whatnot. This is kinda a secondary afterthought of a gamemode, which serves as a little extra bit of fun after you've had your fill of the actual game. Would I recommend this? If you have some friends who are willing to shout and scream at eachother over table legs and who keeps dropping the priceless vase then yes, this game is great. I'm not entirely sure if it would be worth buying to play alone though, this game really lives and dies on the fact that people will be playing from the couch all talking and laughing.			"

The game is, essentially, IKEA Simulator. You are requested to build a series of furniture, different pieces for different rooms, and each room has about 4-7 items in each.After decorating your home you are then provided 3 pretty fun challenges, which are orientated around building, speed of building, and smashing stuff. Overall, a pretty cool and fun experience. Sadly, I did not get the opportunity to try this out in a VR environment, however, I am sure that if I had, it would have been pretty cool.Nilesy			"

We build a monstrosity and name it sam... and then stuck sam to the ceiling. 5/7 best time I've had with a friend, never laughed harder.			"

												Home Improvisation is a fun little game with a few quirks here and there. The controls can be a bit wonky and the challenge room does'nt reset right but overall it's a fun little game that you can play a lot with friends and (Even though I don't have a virtual reality headset) I assume it is also very fun in VR and VR Co-op. Overall Home improvisation is a fun game with a few quirks, after all it was made in 48 hours. I reccomend the game to people with the HTC Vive or a lot of creativity/time on thier hands.			"

												Home Improvisation makes me actually look forward to the next time I might get something from IKEA. Even though 'putting together furniture' doesn't really sound like fun, the goofiness of the game together with the addition of VR makes this game definitively worth picking up. If anyone is interested, you can see my experience with it here:

												This is a fun and lighthearted diversion of a game. I'm happy to say that Oculus Touch support is working again. There are multiple rooms, each with a different furniture theme. You can switch scales from full-size to dollhouse size which is a really useful for organizing or taking a break from reaching. Touch controls are a bit.. strange. You don't actually use a handgrip. It's more like using gravity guns to grab pieces, so you still have an interface between you and your furniture. I still recommend picking this up. It seems like a novelty at first, but it actually is a fun puzzle game.			"

												I love this game, my favourite game of the month!The concept is wonderfully silly and original. I have been both proud of my designs as well as laughed at how stupid they are. There is no real goal in the game but your sense of accomplishment grows as you fill out your house with your own creations.However, this is definitely not a game for everyone. It involves a lot of frustration and if you buy it expecting it to be a silly game for laughs then you'll be dissapointed. This game requires a decent amount of creativity and patience for someone to put more than an hour or two into it. While I love it, I dont expect a lot of people to feel the same way.Now just to put a quick warning, this game has a lot of bugs but the team behind the game is actively working on it. The bugs can be VERY frustrating as the limited controls aren't always easy to work with.Virtual Reality: At current time, I'd say this game actually seems to work better in VR. It still has a lot of bugs, but the Vive controls make this much less of a problem. I find it very calming to sit and work on furniture in VR. However, part of the fun of this game might have been how hard it was to build something decent looking, in VR, everything is easy.			"

												You know that ikea VR game? This isn't it.This is better, this is perhaps the most time I have personally spent playing a game with my vive and a group of friends.Not because it's building furniture with your friends, but because it's building furniture with your friends and at one stage you will think it's a good idea to spam about 500 beds into an area and start smacking the one person in VR with them so they spazz out and fly all over the place.Thats right, this game lets players outside of VR interact with the person that is, and it's brilliant. It's simple, cheap and hilarious. You have to finish furniture to obtain different items which you can then spawn as you like. You also open up new areas (such as the garage with a light up sign you can turn letters on/off). There's also tools that you get so you can modify parts of the furniture so they fit the way you would like them too.I think we spent at least an hour trying to get a manakin to spin as fast as possible from its butt by attaching it to the ceiling and adding more and more fan parts which we then drilled holes into to put more fan parts on.

												Vive user only here.The game had a bug a day or two ago that prevented vive controllers from showing up, but was hotfixed rather quickly. Swift action of devs are always a good thing to take note in, but we're talking about the game itself.Controls are simple, and the game itself starts out simple. Just put pieces of obviously shaped wood together. But give it some time and it will make you think about how exactly pieces are supposed to be lined up.The game jumps a large scale when you get access to more tools to create zany products of your own.I imagine the fun to only be that much greater if you have someone else to mess/help you with your products, though local play looks perfectly seemless between the two view types.

												You can't advertise a game as being multiplayer without mentioning anywhere on the game's store page that it's region-locked multiplayer. Literally the only reason I bought this game and now it's getting refunded.No tutorial to start with, found myself fiddling around trying to figure out what I was doing for some time. Shouldn't ever have to take that long. Keyboard + mouse optimisation is also god awful, so damn fiddly and hard to do anything. Generally too buggy for a fully released game too.I'd say save your money unless you plan on playing solo/with people in your region, and own a VR machine. Can't judge what VR is like though as I don't own one myself.			"

												Any sort of menu is locked until you have completed 2 or so pieces of furniture. Very annoying as the game kept launching on my 2nd monitor, plus my GPU was running like crazy because vsync was off by default. If this were on console, ok that could be acceptable, but not on PC.Controls are rather poor, and can't be rebound.Basically no camera control. Would have liked to be able to rotate around the rooms...Graphically it's pretty, and has a nice soothing soundtrack. Unfortunately that's about all I can say for it.Bought spontaneously as (at the time) reviews were Very Positive and seemed like a fun party game on paper. But I'm afriad it's just meh. Still feels like an early access game. Asked for a refund.			"

												It's a simple idea, and it's acutally fun to build furniture with a friend online. But the game feels like a beta version. First of all, there is no chat option, so communication with the person you are building furniture with is difficult. If it's a friend, you can talk on the phone or something similar. If it's a random person you were paired up in the game, there is no way of communicating. And that's a little bit frustrating. Playing online with a friend is fun, as I said, but the game is full of bugs. Connection drop-outs, parts of furniture locks in place, or every finished piece of furniture just disappears... I recommend you wait before buying this game until these huge bugs are fixed.			"

												Having played this for about 20 minutes with others, it has the potential to be a funny game however playing this with a mouse and keyboard is near on impossible to do. the items you construct expect you to put things together at the right angles for example, a lamp with 3 legs. using a mouse and keys to do this is near on impossible.I have have also played this using VR and it is a bit better to control and you have more control over the turning and rotating of items, that said i can see this getting boring very quickly.The music gets old pretty quickly and becomes an annoyance more that anything else. For 7 quid its not that bad but i would suggest that if you play this, use the VR if you have one.			"

												At the start, I was enjoying it quite a bit. But the more I played, the more I found that the perpective being completely bizarre was a level of frustrating that I did not like. I could build stuff all day, even with poor controls. There is, in general, a feeling that the release was rushed and unfinished. It feels like it should still be EA.First step, you can alter two dimensions - you can't alter the third until you've committed the piece. Second, final dimension can be altered. Rotate until you *guess* it's in the right place. Third, rotate whole object and see that the second step was off because what you are seeing makes no sense. Things closer are smaller than things that are farther. Edges appear to line up, but don't. This is counter-intuitive and the lack of real depth perception can be a nightmare. I'll rotate an item and find at times that I can't tell if it's straight up-and-down until it's already attached and can't be altered further.So, remove piece. Then repeat from step one.I like the idea of this game a lot. I hope they fix the confusing controls (you probably will have to spend time in the discussions to work them out), and make it possible to alter rotation after attaching a piece. I didn't sign up for a game that feels incomplete, so I have to request a refund at this point.			"

												If you like building furniture (without instructions) in real life, then this game is for you. Personally, I've built so much furniture in my house in real life, I completely dread it. Lets be honest though, if it's in VR it's made to be better so I gave it a shot. This game just didn't do it for me and I think that's coming from the multiplayer.At first, I actually liked the concept. I thought it would actually be fun to assemble furniture with other people. Although, I tried multiplayer on 3 different occasions at 3 different times of day and did not find anyone to play with. I can probably enjoy this with other people online, but after sitting in singleplayer for 20 minutes trying to figure out how to build furniture without any instructions, I was done with this game. I can enjoy a game like Fantastic Contraption but not this.			"

												Not really sure why I bought this. I can't really recommend it unless you find great joy in fiddling with furniture and making modern art. You just kinda... snap pieces together.Disclaimer: this review may be biased because I'm ocd and every second of this game made me want to scream			"

								I never thought that it would be harder to assemble furniture in a game than it would be in real life.However, the controls for putting together furniture in the game, be it with the controller, or with keyboard and mouse, are very difficult and illogical. Object rotation isn't sure whether to observe local or global positioning, so two attempts to make the same mouse motion or joystick press yield weird results.Comparing the assembly time of the LACK corner table in real life, and the BORK corner table in game... it was about two minutes faster to assemble LACK than it was BORK. Don't even ask me what to do with FHQWHGADS. I mean, COME ON. The game was jockin' me, actin' like it knew me.			"

								I don't like it. I've played it for a couple of times now and I have just experienced graphics lagging but other than that I'm not using any controller and I'm playing this single player. My OS is Windows and it's great but for me the game sucks. I thought this could be like a practice sort-of of AutoCad or something but I guess not. I regret buying it but good thing I bought it duing the holiday sale so there was a discount but still, the money was wasted :(			"
