												Ok I've spent an embarrassingly long amount of time in this game so I think I can say a thing or two about it. There are really nice things about it and really awful things, the latter being more abundant but I'll still split this into a pros and cons review. I will admit that until fairly recently I thought this was a good simulator until I learned more about how locomotive systems actually work and found alternative simulation programs. This review is based on what I now know. Also I feel I should mention that I almost never run Steam Locomotives, so I can't comment on that aspect.Here's what this game does RIGHT:-GRAPHICS: To my knowledge, better than other trains sims in terms of lighting, quality of objects/models, and simulation of movement (head/cab shaking)-AMOUNT OF ADD-ONS: Yes, I'm counting this as a pro, but only the availability aspect. See below for everything else about DLC. There is a decent variety of content, albeit only for UK, US, and GER.-ROUTES: Some (SOME!!!) of these are really well made and scenarios from the workshop make them better.-WORKSHOP: Integrated much better into this game than others (such as a mod made by someone named Garry). There is some really good content on here from users who care about making good scenarios.Here's what this game does WRONG:-Complete disregard for quality control. Majority of available DLC should not have been released as-is. This applies mostly to older routes (those have drastically improved lately) and nearly all locomotives. More info on this below.-Refusal to fix bugs. I don't think ONE problem that I have with my content has been fixed since I first got this game. What does get “fixed” is stuff no one gives a dookie about like the passengers having their clothes change depending on the season and “improving” their AI on platforms. I swear to god this was one of the embarrassingly small number of changes DTG advertised from 2013 to 2014, and even that just broke more things (now passengers will float in mid-air and run around in little circles!). Only other change I can remember them saying was the menu interface. Wow, thanks. So glad that got worked on and not the completely broken air brake simulation.-Accuracy of simulation.  To my knowledge... not so good. Brake systems behave completely wrong. Slack forces between cars are unpredictable and inconsistent. Amperage vs. engine speed often seems off.-Price to play. DLC is way overpriced (ALL of it), and the base game comes with almost nothing, so you're forced to buy more add-ons if you want to have any fun and be able to play scenarios from the workshop. Seriously this is the worst part. There is no excuse for the cost of add-ons. They cost as much as full games which require 200x more work and testing and NEVER get cheaper. Sure once or twice a year a handful of them will go on sale, but what's the point of that if during this last March Madness sale I saw DLC where the original price was raised before taking the 20 or 30% off. I face-palmed instantly.While there are definitely some good things here (the base engine of the game is fine), all the problems that are continually piles on top of them completely cancels those few pros out and renders me unable to recommend it to fellow train enthusiasts and simulation fans.It also seems like DTG has disabled the ability to review DLC (because no one would buy it), so here is a bonus review of the DLC I have been (for the most part) SUCKERED into buying.-CAJON PASS: Bad. Lack of signage, bare minimum of buildings in towns, no smooth gradient changes, a few turns where the track speed is dangerously high, no track speed reduction for crossovers.-DASH 9: Absolutely horrible. LCD's in dash display NO info, traction is too powerful, sounds are weak, brake cylinder pressure is always 0 on HUD, dynamic brake is so overpowered it will derail your train at over 25%-EAST COAST MAIN LINE: Lacking detail in scenery. It's just OK.-F40PH CALI ZEPHYR: Terrible physics, same dynamic brake problem as Dash9. Luckily there is a 3rd party fix from railworks america. Rolling stock included drags as if the handbrake were stuck on each car.-LONDON-FAVERSHAM HIGH-SPEED: Short route, but very detailed. Signage is good and dynamic signaling system on CTRL works well. Included stock is pretty good, although sounds for the class 395 are really bad. Overall this one's pretty good.-LONDON-BRIGHTON: Like this route, class 377 has good physics but no 2-tone horn. Annoying.-MARIAS PASS: I really like this route, can't really say anything bad about it. This was about the turning point for route quality. The included GE ES44DC is also one of the best locos for the game. It's the only one I have where the dynamic brake works like it should. Other systems work better than most, but still aren't perfect.-MUNICH-AUGSBURG: Same boat as London-Faves. Short but detailed, PZB/LZB is good. Comes with ICE-3 so you don't have to buy it separate.-PACIFIC SURFLINER: Route itself is amazing. Very detailed and accurate, the best one I own. The EMD F59PHI included has major problems with physics and air brakes. Exterior sounds are good, interior bad.-NEC/ACELA: Complete lack of signage, impossible scenarios, unsmoothed gradients, track speed too high at some points. Acela has problems such as auto brake-blending not working. AEM-7 is decent.-PORTSMOUTH DIRECT LINE: Decent length route with acceptable detail. There are many branches on the route that are unfinished which is very weird. Included rolling stock has horrible physics especially with the brakes. I dare say they don't work.-CLASS 70: Horrible physics all-around, impossible scenarios, nice model and exteriors sounds though...-DONNER PASS: Nice and long, detail is OK, scenarios are terrible (some impossible), included locos are really bad.-HORSESHOE CURVE: No signage at all, no track speed reduction for crossovers, included locos have worst physics ever, location markers are confusingly named, stock scenarios are decent.-ISLE OF WIGHT: Terribly short for price, impossible scenarios included, no detail on or in rolling stock.-RURH-SIEG + SEEBERGBAHN: Just bad. Don't get either. Also no workshop scenarios.-SD70 VOL.2: I was so mad after I bought this. All the same problems as Dash9 plus more! The head and ditch lights don't actually emit light! I don't get why this is so bad when the SD70-M that was included with Sherman Hill was fine.-SHERMAN HILL: This route's pretty good, signage is decent but not much detail in towns. Included rolling stock and scenarios are pretty good. Lots of workshop support.-SP GP20: Hands down the best locomotive for this game (probably 'cause it's 3rd party). Physics are great on traction and all brake systems, sounds are nice, startup procedure emulation, engine overheating, etc. all adds more realism than any other add-on. This is a must-have if you want real simulation and proves that the base game system CAN support good simulation; just that no effort goes into the content!-SP/UP SD45: Physics are okay, offers more in-cab interaction than most, sounds are bad (except exterior engine). Needs more scenarios, barely any in workshop.-WEST COAST MAINLINE NORTH: This route is pretty good except one major problem—the track speed on most of it is DANGEROUSLY high. Like so high I feel I'm going to derail when going 30mph under. I don't know if the curves are supposed to be banked or if the speed is just wrong. Class 86 is one of my favorite locos to run because of the tap system.That's all the DLC I own. I've been afraid to buy any more since the last two I bought were really bad. And that's too bad because I really do want some of the new routes and locos that have come out recently, but I would hate myself if I gave DTG any more money and would probably go crazy if they turned out to be bad, which there is a great chance of that.

												TL;DR - You'll have more satisfaction from buying WinRARTrain Simulator gets some things right, but too many things wrong. You play for a while and kinda get interested, but it doesn't take long until you see the massive amount of flaws and disgusting customer service it has. I've now uninstalled it and I certainly won't be buying any additional content ever again.First, what does it get right?+ Lots of DLC which means a huge amount of content to play with (see cons though)+ Fairly easy to understand and get into+ Steam workshop expands the playtime hugelySo what does it get wrong?- Physics are terrid, and in no way represent any sort of realism- This is not really a simulator since there is only about 5 buttons in the cab that work..- Crap optimisation. Framerate dips below 20 sometimes. Probably due to lack of multi-core support.- Tile loading system. This means the game micro-freezes each time it loads a new tile.- Sounds are often inaccurate and poor quality, and they copy and paste them from train to train. - Way too many bugs that they won't fix. - DLC is overpriced. Where do they get these prices from?- They reskin a train, call it a new one and sell it for another £11.99.. - Graphics are OKAY in areas, but horrid in others.- Level of quality is inconsistent. - They force advertising of their next DLC down your throat any chance they get. On the menu, on the loading screen..- Customer support just ignores you or gives you false promises.Could go on for a while. It's a game that has a lot of potential, but the devs are too busy concentrating on treating their customers like cattle and chugging out new DLC rather than patching the game, and fixing existing DLC.

												The 2016 update is nothing more than a few graphical tweaks with some DLC smacked on to the game.As of writing, since I got the free 2016 ""update,"" absolutely NOTHING is different, aside from a slightly different splash screen, and the REMOVAL of features such as Sean Bean's fun little intro, and all music in the game.My ""upgrade"" actually gets me LESS content than the previous version!  On top of that, Launch issues plague the system, and it took me 45 minutes of work to get TS2016 to even verify its files and launch.There are no UI changes (flaunted by Dovetail in the promo material), no graphical tweaks, and no more music or Sean Bean.Plus, it's well known that they are moving to a completely new and VERY advanced engine for the next version, so this one is.... pointless really.Save your money.  Wait until the next big release.  I find this a huge disappointment from Dovetail, and it has me worried about the future of all of the properties they hold.			"

												Thanks Dovetailgames for unnecessary deleting forum threads which in no way broke any of the rules set up in the forums.Also thanks for never publishing any update for all those 3rd party DLCs, even if they were available from the original authors for months. Even when it is just a 2 kilobyte textfile missing from the Steam installation. It just brakes the destination blinds for the BR420, but why care? People will buy it like sheep anyways I suppose. Just like the new addons to this DLC, which still do have this bug!So DO NOT BUY when you want a bug free, polished product with regular and fast fixes. The game still carries on issues from it's first release five years back which never got touched at all. I admit most of these are smaller issues and none is gamebreaking so far, but when the update policy is so low, I wonder if a gamebreaking bug might be fixed at all. So far all they ever did was saying ""yes we do have a fix coming up soon"", but when asking when that ""soon"" might be there is no answer at all and half a year later everything is forgotten about. Instead any well put criticism gets blocked and deleted.By all means this game has so much to offer and is so good at certain points, but it is ruined by incompetent community management and question worthy update politics for me.

												I wanted to add a little thing for the 2017 version to show how DTG respect it's Customers.... For existing players you get the -75% on the tracks for the Pioneers editions... that is what you think but if you have none you have to pay 34 €, but if you are a new customer then you pay, 33,99 all included! what a joke this company is. So if you wait for a sale at 50% (probably in october-november) you will get the pioneer at 17 € and so it is proven again how DTG how they see us: A  bag of deplorables....Let us put it straight, It's a good game in the wrong Company hand. Everything Dovetail touches, is outdated, overpriced and bugged and they have an amount of greed I have never seen in any other game.They don't care about you, they just care about Whales, the guys who blindly buy all DLC's. I bought a few on sale, but there is not one single route or train that isn't bugged, will crash on you at some point or just things that don't work in their script.Will I still play it, yes because the game was good YEARS BEFORE DOVETAIL touched it. It's the same with FSX, a great game that is now getting destroyed by weekly DLC's (some are 8 years old dlc's) Now they just released the so said flight school that is a ripped out FSX version with 2 planes for 15 € while FSX does have a flight school already integrated. They just can't do things right, they just make money on the back of gamers from outdated games that they bought licenses from.When you buy a DLC at 30 € it should be astonishing, like Carenado, A2A, JustFlight, PMDG does for Flight simulator, where every freaking button works. With dovetail you get a rushed, bugged train with 5-8 working buttons... oh and if you are lucky 5 scenarios. They would actually produce quality even like a simpler versions that Alabeo produces I would respect them much more.I have nothing against the game it is Just Dovetail that is probably the worst Gaming compagny I know, No let say they are second... There is also EA, but at least their games are optimized for new machines and bugs get adresses at some point in time. Dovetail has bugs that are 7 years old and still not fixed...Oh and then you have the last and wonderful thing with dovetail. They don't accept critics, you point bugs out and say it is enough  now, and you will get banned on their site. But Hey lucky we have Steam where you can't delete our reviews can't you! it's just pathetic.As I said great game in the wrong hands. I have over 2000 steam games, I am someone who supports the game Industrie, but let me tell you that with Dovetail, it became the only company where is just download their DLC on other places, because they don't deserve a penny anymore. It's sad because they have no idea how much DLC's I bought for FSX like ORBX and more. if they even 50% of their quality I would buy it, but it's more like about 5% of their quality!Isn't there one intelligent guy at dovetail that says, hey guys, don't you think that 4000 + € crap DLC's  is wrong?

												Don't mistake my 100-odd hours in this game as a positive tale. Most of them were put on in 2011 and 2012.This game is based off an outdated physics engine, using textures that are years old, by a company with a business model that puts that of PAYDAY 2 to shame. Just look at all the DLC. If I foolishly press ""ADD ALL TO CART""... I am left with 232 items totalling upwards of $3000. I'm not joking, and here's a screen capture to prove it.[i.imgur.com] (For the record, if you foolishly add all DLC to cart, you can clear your cart by going into Steam's settings, to 'web browser' then hitting 'delete all browser cookies.)(Edit for clarification 2016-02-21: That screen-capture was taken during a sale and is actually a thou or so under the current price for DLC. /edit)Each new iteration, all we get are UI changes and more DLC. In order for us who bought Train Simulator 2012/2013/2014 to ""upgrade"" to what DTG advertises each year, you have to essentially buy it again. Guess how?And don't get too used to the DLC you buy functioning (especially DLC routes). If a change they make breaks it... it won't be fixed unless you go in there and ♥♥♥♥ around in the editor long enough to figure out what you need to do to fix it.Steer clear. "

												NOTE: The following review was written for TS2014 ... I can not yet review TS2015 because the compulsory re-branding (free upgrade) has broken my installation completely, I'm not sure I can be bothered to re-install TS from scratch, but If I do I will review TS2015 then.ALSO NOTE: (for the hard of intellect) The ingame hours listed above are from TS2013 a version of this simulator I would reccommend, unfortuantely later versions of TS are compulsory and cannot be avoided. which is the main reason I dont reccommend TS and why the following review is still relevant.TS is a hybrid, existing somewhere between game and simulator, because this gamulator lives in this middle ground anyone interested in casually driving trains for XP or serious rail simulation fans looking for the experience of driving a train like real driver in a simulated environment or those like myself with an interest in creating scenarios and routes may be frustrated in equal measure, however for very different reasons.TS2014 is not a new product, its a compulsory upgrade from TS2013 which was a compulsory upgrade from TS2012 and so on.TS2013 can be used off the shelf as a ready to play product, in this form it works adquately but its very limited in scope, to get any meaningful use from TS2014 requires a serious financial investment in some of the DLC (depending on your area of interest) and an investment in time in making your own content in the form of scenarios and routes. For anyone interested in simulating reality making your own scenarios using the editor is essential, this is probably TSs strongest aspect  however if you undertake this you will come up against many of the software’s myriad bugs and design limitations, the process can be encapsulated in one word: ""Frustrating” however it can be rewarding when you do discover a work-around for any of the problems you will encounter.TS also suffers from (in my experience): *Poor unhelpful patronising support with less than a rudimentary understanding of the product. *Falling value for money in packs that come with less skins than previous releases and routes released without the common stock that use them, Ubiquitous stock is conspicuous in its absence while the developers release rare and one-off locos. *A complexity of incompatible assets, and cut down incompatible replacements for withdrawn DLC making the sharing of scenarios impractical. (for instance there are 5! different versions of the class 66, all incompatible with each other!)*Variable quality in DLC from “outstanding” to “not-fit-for-purpose”, some DLC cannot be driven without using the driver interface, because of little omissions like the sounds of doors closing not being included, this is bad news if you want full immersion. The sounds on some of the DLC are diabolical others less so.*A game menu UI that is a temple to style over functionality.*Long standing unresolved bugs including, benign graphical bugs such as floating passengers and more serious CTD session ending bugs such as the corrupted asset in the scenery folder of London to Brighton that crashes the editor.*Aggressive marketing, in-your-face advertising and the monetisation of almost every aspect, you are spammed with advertising when waiting for scenarios to load and you cannot even work towards achievements without investing in DLC *Widespread censorship of genuine concerns on official channels, giving other users advice on workarounds or patches for bugs is prohibited.*Design limitations, such as its impossible to create “late running” scenarios because the software wont allow the pick-up of passengers from a stop you arrive late at and a save and resume system that can cause AI to be mistimed, collide, derail and off-path in scenarios.*Unless you have a powerful set up you will have to chose between graphical quality or performance, if you take the performance route TS is ugly but it can be pretty if you don’t mind some stuttering.All of these things you should not expect from a premium priced product but can be overlooked or worked around if you are a serious rail simulator buff, I would still recommend this product even with these (and other) Shortcomings.However:The reason I cannot recommend TS2014 is confidence. Every autumn there is a compulsory relaunch of the product, Its called a “Free update” and in general it carries new ways to monetise the software, some new bugs and a few “bread and circuses” changes, the important part of this is the software changes and unless you want to isolate yourself from ever using the product again you have no choice in accepting it. [EDIT: On the 6th Jan my last working copy of TS2013 was automaticly upgraded bypassing Steam disabled automatic updates, It appears its not actually possible to prevent the update at all, only delay it by a few months. the updates are fully compulsory, as a customer you have no choice]Because things change every year it has completely smashed my confidence in the product, how long before it becomes intentionally or accidentally unusable? There is no way of knowing if all the hours that may have spent on scenario creation or weeks of gaining achievements or months on route building or the considerable amount of money spent on DLC will just be wasted or unusable a few years down the line. I find this single aspect utterly demoralising, I simply can no longer be motivated to spend time creating something that may in future be taken away from me without my consent, in this sense its a self fulfilling prophesy. The release of TS2014 has turned a flawed but enjoyable entertainment (TS2013) into my biggest ever regret, I feel like I have been conned. All the hours I spent making scenarios and routebuilding in TS2013 have been wasted because I have been forced to ""upgrade"" to TS2014.Not recommended, unless you are a masochist.EDIT: 4/12/2013, I think the fact that Railsimulator marked this and many other reviews as ""off topic"" says more than I could ever say about TS. Actions speak louder than words.http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/12/06/train-simulator-2014-developer-hiding-negative-steam-user-reviews-flagged-as-off-topic/EDIT: 6/12/2013 Steam moderators overturned DTGs off topic flagging and made this review visable again.

PrefaceAs some people don't seem to be getting this, the reason why I have ""played"" this game for 2000 hours is twofold. The first is that I like trains. They're great. This game is a pretty old game and I've owned it since about 2009/2010. I've probably clocked some 3-400 hours of playtime on this, as I have developed my own routes and driven trains up and down the existing routes. That still leaves 1700 hours. This is due to a glitch in the earlier game. It used to leave a process running that I never noticed that told steam that I was still ""in-game"" even when I was sleeping or out at uni/work. This wasn't patched until very recently. As I said in the earlier part of this review - This used to be a good game. Right up until DTG started doing an EA on us. So, to the people not understanding how I've played it for 2000 hours and I don't recommend it, there's your answer. If I'd reviewed it in the 2010, I would've wholeheartedly recommended it. Oh and it's always good to see some intelligent criticism of this review. Calling me a ""douch(sic)"" because I don't agree with you isn't going to ameliorate me to your cause. Can we have some maturity please.ReviewRighty-oh, think I'll jump on the bandwagon. I've owned Railworks (or Rail Simulator, Train Simulator 20xx) since 2010. Back then it was Railworks 2. We forgave it it's shortcomings. It trumped MSTS on features (for the time), was slightly pretty (even if it was behind everything else) but we were still in the warm glow of the community led MSTS days. A time when UKTrainsim flourished with add-ons, and near enough every class of British locomotive, DMU, EMU, DEMU etc was represented. We were expecting the same with Rail Simulator (as it was back then). I remember the posts on UKTrainsim's forums about how there was going to be community support, that if we all cobbled together we could develop our own content and it would be MSTS with a much improved physics and graphics engine.4 (maybe 7) years on, and oh how things changed. First they took our HUD. That thing was good. Throttle display on one side, brakes and others. It was non-intrusive, fitted well and meant you could happily drive the train from an external view. That went. We tolerated the new HUD. It had more features but it was clunkier and intruded on the display. Uktrainsim published it's expansion packs. Which have remained in pretty much the same form to this day. They were good. A good starting point. They were free which was fantastic. But they were killed away. Railworks was rebranded as Train Simulator. Imagine my (non) surprise when I booted it up and nothing had changed apart from the overlays. It was laggier, and my content didn't work as well. But I forgave it this. They promised patches that never emerged. Instead we got more and more DLC. Trains that no-one wanted. Routes that made no sense. Train Simulators 2012, 2013, 2014 and now 2015 passed and the same base game, but less compatibility. Less focus on community content that didn't feature payware DLC (even on Uktrainsim, the once bastion of free content). The broken features from Rail Simulator remained. The crap dispatcher. The recycled sounds and features. The HST has remained in that form since the first game - update anyone? Finding fixes for relatively minor problems has been a continuous, frustrating and in some cases, fruitless exercise. Especially when it came to content creation. Scenarios that fail for seemingly arbitrary reasons. Non-negotiable (even by mashing G) pathing on freeroam scenarios that will place an express in a 40mph freight loop. The way that the game has two signalling systems for UK routes that don't talk to one another. One that is a pain to set up and one that isn't. In 2011, I started developing a midland mainline route for this game. That went nowhere because we got updated to TS2012 in the middle and I lost the ability to easily edit the route. And to finally ice the cake, with the release of TS2015 and it's subsequent patch, I managed to lose a partition on my hard disk due to a bad file downloaded from Steam. Bye bye 2 years of research. Thank goodness for back ups.If I could say that I have gained anything from TS, it is the following. I am a theoretical chemist. I use the high level software on a supercomputer to compute quantum chemical properties. In many ways, using this is a lot like using the content creator on TS2015. It's broken, and if you don't do it exactly right it will fail, but when it does work, it is the most satisfying feeling in the world. Shame it only happens every few months.People, don't buy this game. Don't buy the add-ons. Leave it alone. Move on to OpenBVE if you want realism, OpenRail if you want features. Oh and DTG, if you want to save this sinking ship, stop trying to monetise everything. Let the community create more non-DLC dependent freeware. Stop selling reskins as separate DLC. Basically, stop treating your (otherwise) loyal fanbase like chumps. We were loyal to begin with, but we will move on to other programs that don't treat us as walking wallets.EDIT: doing more investigation into TS2015. Even more of my DLC doesn't work. And my JT voyager seems to have vanished entirely. Hmm... fishy.			"

												*EDIT* Minor amendments after Episode 18 of my show.I guess it's time for me to write a proper review of this game now.To cut to the chase, I think that Train Simulator 2016 is one of the worse video games I've played in my life. Bearing in mind, I've played Sonic 06, Megaman & Bass, Spyro: Enter The Dragonfly just no name a few. TS2016 doesn't even qualify for the ""So bad it's good"" tier or even the visualy pleasing tier and has been simply getting worse and worse every year. Some of the problems I have with this game are as follows:- Appauling opimization on high end computers. I've heard reports of people with GTX 960s having various issues with this game.- No DX12 support or DX11 support.- No Rebinable controls. In 2015.- Most of the features, such as Career Mode, serve no purpose. The XP points you recieve do bugger all at the end of the day. Unlike in Pokemon, Final Fantasy or Chrono Trigger where XP points actually help you grow stronger in the game.- Unrealistic physics.- A very unstable engine. One could say you have a 50/50 chance of the game crashing whilst driving.- Terrible loading times.- Lack of respect for the source material for trains and routes (Great Western Mainline, North London Line and London To Brighton are good examples of this.)- The game's downright INSULTING model for DLC. No, seriously, it's one of the worst. The company shove out DLC on a very frequent basis. Trains most of the time have unrealistic physics, sounds, consist formations and a lack of features. Routes are usually short, linear and offer the player to drive on...about 1 or 2 full services. Again, unacceptable for the money they're charging.But by far the worst thing about this game is the company itself. As evidenced by the amount of DLC (totaling £3000+ mind you), they clearly only care about the money as trains have a sporadic field of quality, old routes are almost never updated with the new features and they constantly clog up the game with more content, in an attempt to say that ""They listen to us"" or ""We do want to improve."" The game is also becoming more and more of a casual scrub slideshow simulator than a freaking train simulator, with things such as Railfan Mode, which has been done before by members of the community and Career mode, which has zero gameplay purpose. Even after sending an E-mail to Dovetail Games, they for some reason, didn't manage to properly defend the purpose of Career Mode or Railfan Mode. I wonder why...Out of the goodness of my heart, please, I emplore you, DO NOT buy this video game. You'll save yourself time, money, headaches and most importantly, sanity. You could end up becoming like me, sitting around making podcasts where I tear this game to shreads on Youtube. It ain't as fun as it sounds.For the developers of this game, I shall leave you with an altered quote from Jesse Owens. ""We all have dreams.

												Now if I'm honest, I'm going to go on a rant here.[rant]Now although this has been an excellent rail simulation game since I bought it back in the RailWorks 2 days, and have spent many hundreds of pounds worth of DLCs. However the last few years has been a significant downfall for DumbFail Gaymes (who I shall call here).DFG has recently decided to start ripping off customers for various reasons:Too many variants of 1 loco - they've decided to release 5, yes 5 variants of the Class 66. I mean, who needs 5 SEPERATE variants of the Class 66, when you can shove the whole loot in a bundle instead, charge it £15 for 5 liveries, I'm happy.Unscenerized parts of routes - it seems that recently, DFG have decided to limit the scenario possibilities by releasing routes with limited/no scenery on sections of it. Take a look at the ECML-S route for example, they included the Hertford Loop track and signaling, but no scenery? This is absurd! Goodness knows how many more scenarios we could've seen in the Workshop. But no, they decide all they want is the £££. This is exactly what they did with the Sheerness Branch for London-Faversham, leave out the scenery, then added the scenery items over several updates, then charge £12 JUST TO ADD THE SCENERY IN. Oh, and added a Class 466 in.Lack of effort - this is a big notice in recent releases. Their favourite motto in house is ""Let's rip off the customers, recycle everything!"". This has been very evident in some releases. For example, look at the Class 365 passenger view. I think many people were thinking they were going to use a whole new view, or re-use the Class 465 passenger view and reskin it a bit. But oh no, they didn't. They decided to recycle the Class 166 passenger view, which is how old? FROM RAIL SIMULATOR DAYS OH GOD. The quality of that pass view is awful, it's like they've stuck several pieces of cardboard together and added some adverts. It's even noticeable that it's from the Great Western Link 166, as the logo is on one of the ads in the passenger view.Another good use of recycling is the Class 321 sounds. Now, what were DFG THINKING OF?! They decided to use the 455 sounds, which is ok I suppose, but just cover your ears when it comes to the doors. Oh dear, what a disaster. They decided, to use an 1938 UNDERGROUND train, for the door sounds. I'm sorry, but the 321 didn't exist in 1938, so why use sounds from a 1938 train then?!Terrible customer support - I've read various posts on forums complaining about DFG's support. It seems that their staff know absolutely little of the base game whatsoever. Now for some issues, clearing the blueprint cache, or verifying the game cache won't 100% fix your problem. It could be a core issue, of which DFG need to fix. And that is exactly what I'm going to go into next, bugs and issues.Bugs and issues - It seems that every year when a new core update is released, more and more bugs creep out of nowhere. It seems that DFG's attitude falls to the community to fix these bugs. There are some bugs which have been in the game for years, which STILL hasn't been fixed. An example of this is the WCML-N buffers. There are some at Glasgow Central and various other places on the route. This is affecting scenario creation. Imagine you are arriving at Carlisle, then the game stops with an error saying a train has crashed into one of those buffers? Wouldn't you go ballistic? I'm sure you would. And unfortunately DFG are too lazy just to issue a simple fix for this.Pricing - In mine and others' opinions, most of the DLCs are waaaaaaaaaay too overpriced. Now think of us today, we all have jobs and families, however all of our money goes for the bills, mortgage, food, essential stuff for us to live. And yet they want to nick £25 from our bank for a route and maybe 1 piece of rolling stock.Scenarios and AI - Let me just say 1 thing, the AI dispatcher is awful. If you think scenario creation with AI on a busy route was easy, you can think again. It's way too buggy, it will route your train to the wrong place/direction, and it will just fail your scenario. However, the freeware community have done a great job on scenario creation, including those on the Workshop. If you had problems with the AI dispatcher and have fixed it, I hail you.So in theory, a great game, some good DLCs, just a rubbish company, DumbFail Gaymes to deal with.Rant over.[/rant]			"

												While i'm a fan of railroad simulations (and other simulations) i can't recommend this game. The first problem with it is that this isn't a simulator, but arcadeish, even the very old MSTS+bin patch have more realistic features that this game doesn't have, like the airbrake lag simulation along a long train, limited achievable speed in each throttle notches).There are a lot of features that are totally broken, bugged or missing, and doesn't changed since the first version of this game (Rail Simulator) was released in 2007, like:-diesel hydraulic and mechanical simulation-manual field divert/shunt capability is missing-have ridicolous bugs like the shaft driven compressor on diesel locomotives works while the engine is off, or the electric compressor works when the pantographs are lowered and the main circuit breaker is off.-wheelslips are totally unrealistic, and have unpredictable behavior.And hundreds of other bugs, which i got known, as making addons/helping for others to import content to this game (locomotives, routes, signaling).But the biggest problem with this game is the AI. The dispatcher, and routing/pathing AI is a real pain to handle as it is really blunt. That's why you can see a lot of scenarios without any or rare traffic, on routes where in reality there is heavy traffic. And in same time, the free and opensource Open Rails, does perfectly this job, as it routes and controls HUNDREDS of trains for a day in timetable mode, just like OpenTTD, even on single track lines with passing loops. see here:

			Views: 1,665		

			Breve video che illustra il traffico della stazione di Vicenza, realizzato sfruttando la modalità orario di Open Rails (X2461).		

I've just played a default scenario for Hamburg-Hannover route, where i didn't meet with ANY rail traffic, just static consists on yards. This looks weird, everything is empty, like in the zombie apocalypse movies, and makes the game really boring, as you don't need to stop/slow don't because of a traffic jam or another slower train, or a crossing, but every signal lights are green for you, and you only get yellow signal lights because of a diverted switch, not because of other traffic.I can't blame the developers of the game for making DLC-s as that makes them money, but the problem is they focusing only on DLCs, and not fixing the bugs, just searching for excuses.For a good example for their support: I've sent them a report about a long time existing bug of the TrainDecal.fx shader in game (what is for the dynamic numbering of the locomotives), that makes the numbers look dark in non-TSX graphics mode (which is used by a lot of laptop, or low end PC users), and their answer was to use TSX mode, and they won't fix the bug.However i have PC for which the TSX mode isn't a problem, but not everyone can run TSX mode...I have so much play time in this game, because i having it since 2010, more than four years. BTW the most of the play hours are not play hours, but testing and debugging addons for the game. But since i don't see any future of this game, i ceased to develop addons to it, i only start it to test bug fixes of the existing rolling stock, since 2012, and to test how this game doesn't get improved with every new release, except of menu changes, and smaller graphical eye candy.

												I could forgive all the issues with this game if the admin staff stopped deleteing or moving threads about the problems. If they spent the time it takes then to read and them delete comments that are asking for help replying to us and telling us what they plan to do to fix things we would all be a lot happier. The game has problems, the DLC is over priced, the yearly rebrand often breaks addons from the year before. I feel this is more of a cash cow than an on going project that the dev team care about. Disapointed. Don't buy it.			"

												This game is not what it seems to be. From looking at the screenshots, it would seem to be a good looking train sim, that provides an authentic train driving experience, using highly detailed models of real locations and real trains.Unfortunately, and as much as I wanted to enjoy this game, I have found it to be a great dissapointment.First of all, the game engine is a mess.  Sure, the graphics look good when you turn everything up, but even if your computer was built by NASA you won't be able to, because it will kill your FPS.So, turning the graphics down to acheive a reasonable FPS means that there are artifacts and graphical glitches... shadows that continuously ""catch up"" a few feet in front of your train for example.However, even when using minimal graphics setup, the game is FULL of bugs, glitches and other problems that make it extremely frustrating to use. But it's worth pressing on because of the authentic ""feel"" of the trains, right? WRONG. The trains in this sim are trains that I have been on thousands of times, when commuting from Brighton to London, for example. This sim fails to model the sounds and operating methods of these trains.For a game that is supposed to allow you to control trains, there is an astonishing amount of difficulty in setting up your controls. They have gone out of their way to make this game frustrating to use and difficult to control.Also, forget about gameplay. This sim is strictly about driving your train, with many scenarios requiring you to perform tedious ""shunting"" tasks to assemble your train, a task made even more tedious by the games lack of user friendly options. The various scenarios are almost ALL BROKEN and have not been fixed by the publisher.The publisher of this game charges a fortune for all the DLC, and it's broken, they don't fix things after it's released.Instead, they rely on the ""community"" to add more workshop content for the game, which is completely ridiculous, like something a child would think of.So, I am not recommending this game, unless you are looking for false promises and an un- authentic train sim.

												This is a 2015 release of a PC simulator game, and you can't even rebind the keys.Wait, let me go back a bit.A bit of background on me: I used to play Microsoft Train Simulator religiously back in the mid 2000s. I was a member on UKTS and a proper modoholic. I bought several addon CDs (yes, CDs. Remember those?) with routes because it was the only practical way to distribute them at that time.Then Rail Simulator came out, I can't even remember when, and it pretty much killed my interest in the genre. That sounds a little over-dramatic, I know. But the thing was, there was all this content for MSTS (Microsoft Train Simulator), but the graphics and physics were awful and the game engine was really struggling even with contemporary hardware.  Then there was Rail Simulator, which had pretty (for the day) graphics, but no user made content. Each one spoiled the other for me. So I stopped playing, and vowed to come back once the community had matured. I wasn't good at content creation myself, so I thought I could be a bit selfish like that and get away with it, and the developers were promising to work with the community and provide all these tools and so on and so forth.When was that, 2007? I'm writing this in 2015 and all I see is overpriced DLC and what is, essentially, the same game as Rail Simulator. In fact, some of the content is even *exactly* the same. Those god awful sounds for the HST? Those are from 8 years ago, and they were well below par back then, too. I mean, I know that this has essentially been a rolling update, from Rail Simulator to Railworks to Train Simulator, 2011, 2013, 2014 and so on, but this is pretty sad.I don't know what happened to the community in the years I was away, but it seems to have died a death. All I know is from reading other reviews. They're talking about the developers refusing to engage with the community, except as a cash cow. I don't know how true the former is, but the latter is obviously true. Go and look at all the DLC available, then look at the price. OK, got that? Well, maybe if you end up using this content a lot, like maybe the buses in OMSI, then it might be worth it, right? Now look at the scenarios included with the DLC. That's all you're going to get, dear. There is no way to set up a timetable and just drive it with AI traffic. You either go free roam, or the 4 or 5 pre-packaged scenarios (which may also rely on other DLC, watch out for that), or the same scenarios but with a score logged at the end. Thanks for the £25, good bye, don't let the door hit you on the way out. You know how in a game like OMSI you can just get in there and drive at any time of the day you want, with the weather you want, on the line you want, and the game just makes everything else up for you and you can have a happy bus-filled extravaganza of mid-80s German-ness? Yeah, that's not what you get here. You will exhaust these scenarios, and then you will be done.But wait! What about Steam Workshop? Good luck. Good luck finding anything that works with what ever selection of DLC you've happened to buy. In my experience, it's useless. Yes, this is something that plagued MSTS as well, but good god that game came out in 2001 and hasn't been developed since. That games gets slack. This thing has been in constant development for more than 8 years. Let that one sink in. This is 8 years worth of work, and it's still the same pre-made, finite, static content as it ever was. Oh, but there's bloom effects, so that's nice.So, enough about the overpriced content and lack of community. What about the game engine itself, what about the environment? The content may be limited, but perhaps we can immerse ourselves in what we have, and really enjoy it for what it is.Na. Sorry. The game engine looks ok, yes. But it's just ""OK"", and that's not really 8 years worth of work, is it? It still looks reminiscient of Rail Simulator back in the day, but now it has some slightly fancy lighting effects. In fact I was going to start talking more about some of the nice graphical things they've added since the original game, but I actually can't think of any off the top of my head. It just looks like it did back then but now it runs worse. Although, there is the bloom. There is always the bloom. If you smudge vaseline on the lens, that makes it look all realistic and next-gen, right?OK, what ever, I'll stop moaning, turn on my TrackIR and-oh wait, there's no TrackIR support.....Fine. You know what? Why do we even need TrackIR on a train sim, It's only one of the main components for immersion in first person simulator games, but I suppose I'm just looking straight ahead most of the time anyway. I'll just get my controller out and have fun with that instead. I've got some nice realistic analoge controls set up here that I can use for the throttle, brake and so on. It will be so much better than using the bizarre keyboard layout. Boo for digital controls, am I right?My god. Why is the ""controller"" menu just a picture of an XBox controller? Is this a joke? Well, maybe I just rebind it in the main menu instead, it's probably just a reminder of the assignments I've already set up and... wait, there's no way to even rebind the keys?!This is a 2015 release of a PC simulator game, and you can't even rebind the keys.I give up. You win, Dovetail. You win. 6/5 stars, game of the year, game of the century, take my money, take my dignity, take my god knows how long I spent writing this review. Learn from my mistakes.I'll be in the corner sobbing into my old copy of Microsoft Train Simulator like the sad, sad person that I am.			"

												Whilst I have personally learned to forgive many of the mistakes in this game, I will not recommend it to other people before the developers get real. Sure, a lot of work is probably put into the routes, but the exorbitant prices they charge border insanity. Especially since most of the stuff comes with bugs which makes the pricing even less acceptable. These bugs range from small annoyances to game-breaking trouble, as if it wasn't even playtested. You'll pay for graphical glitches, buggy sound, impossible missions and random derailments. All of these issues have been raised by many people over many years, time and again, but are never or extremely rarely resolved by the team. False promises concerning solutions are made over and over, and the official ""support team"" seems to consist of a single highly efficient paper shredder, as people rarely get replies.About the game itself; it is definitely not the most entertaining. You need to have a huge interest in trains otherwise you'd just be bored all the time. In all fairness, the devs are not entirely to blame here for once, cause driving a train is just that... You're on rails, you set the accelerator and you watch the scenery go by. Scenery that could have been modelled a lot better, too. It would have been more interesting if the controls weren't so painfully lacking in depth. But the game world also feels very dead, you just feel like you're driving on your own in a void world. If you expect bustling traffic and challenging rush hours, you'll be disappointed. The main activity in this game is... staring. It's painful to realise, but that is actually what you'll be doing most of the time you decide to have another go.The exception to the boredom are steam trains which provide sufficient depth and challenge for more than the usual 30 consecutive minutes I can play this. Only you need to learn how to drive and fire them yourself cause the game does not provide much in the way of learning material. And to make matters worse, the HUD is not optimized (read: entirely unfriendly and frustrating) for steam trains. If you want the line graph to see the route and signals, you lose control over your engine, literally, because the buttons on the hud override the actual controls.I've had this game since it was called Railworks 3 and in all the years since, it has improved painfully little and the devs just keep churning out new expensive stuff of the same mediocre quality. They really should focus on improving what's already there, and listening to the community instead of muting all the critics. Fix all the bugs and improve the graphics and physics before moving on, that would be properly appreciated. The core game is lacking, if you're lucky you can get some DLC in a big sale without too much bugs that will entertain for a couple of hours at most. But even then chances are you will be wondering why the heck you are playing this rather than all the great actual games out there.This product tries to appeal to casual gamers and simulation lovers, but it will fail to please either.

												23/9/15 The obvious lack of testing shows with the update and they have taken everything and seemingly decided to make it more complicated or worse where possible. Why are us fans still holding out hope they'll ever fix the game when they churn out new stuff without revisiting old stuff. What hope do we have when the only ""upgrades"" make it worse?As of 11/5/14 (now 24/8/14) it's sad to see (still) nothing has come from their so-called ""bug squashing team"", other than more promises. The same bugs that spoil the game are still there. I wouldn't moan so much but when you spend so much on expensive DLC you'd expect them to sort out at least minor issues withough pretending they need months to test.....Please DTG show us you mean it and aren't just being dishonest. After all this time with very little I think we can safely say now those who said the bug team didn't exist were correct.As a way to experience the sights and sounds of rail driving it's not bad and I have enjoyed it for almost 300 (now 700) hours but due to Dovetail Games particularly abysmal customer service and the fact they are reluctant to address faults that have been in the game for many years now I cannot recommend it. I've spent hundreds on it but realise that nearly everything they release appears to be relatively untested -  i've never known so many faults in a game. You only have to read other reviews to find this for yourself. Some of the oldest sets - which are still priced the same as new content - are still plagued with issues that make them unusable, such as the class 390. As a tilting train designed to corner faster than the average train it is absolutely impossible to complete the career scenarios due to ""ride quality"" being compromised unless you go so slow you then end up being behind schedule, this on DLC that has been around for an age. Also the night lights are non-existant so you can't see where you are heading at all in the dark. This is quite typical of most models that seem to miss the most basic real life functions of any train. Routes are many but most also very flawed and in the average route each time you will be guaranteed to see something new that should have been found in testing but one assumes the testing is done by us and advice/complaints then ignored entirely, dare mention this though anywhere and they'll do what they can to have it removed. Don't waste a penny on it and if you must wait until the sales at xmas or easter, any other time you'd be stupid to pay full price...i'm stupid I and have payed for many routes at full price....wish I hadn't.The only real entertainment from the game is from buying loads of DLC and relying purely on fans of the game to create decent scenarios as the ones in game are nearly all rubbish with very few train varieties that leave you with no sense of immersion at all.I should also point out that despite building my own PC for over £800 most of the routes run terribley (some would be over the moon with what I see as bad, it's 60fps half of the time and as low as 14 in places (e.g LLS in GEML) not including user created scenarios where it's to be expected at times) due to a badly optimised game engine, despite the fact I can run literally anything else at full settings, BF4, Crysis 3, Arma 3, not this though. It looks terrible at times on some routes (as do many of the older trains) but still can run badly. Some routes you can go underground in free roam and see why when most of the buildings you can see over-ground are about 4 times deeper into the ground which I'm guessing the CPU still has to deal with it as the GPU doesn't seem to be at all bothered by it (evga 670).  Some older routes aren't so bad but some look appalling in places. Newer routes are at least vaslty improved in comparison but nothing is priced accordingly. Look for 3rd party content for the best additions to your collection. Does seem a shame though that despite sometimes being a pretty game it often feels no better than many beta builds i've played over the last ten years, potentially great but without the effort by DTG it'll die off soon enough but the arrogance will blind them to the fact until it's too late.If you doubt the content of any of this just use the search filter for reviews of this game and check for all time most helpful. You will have to search hard for popular positive feedback.It pains me to write about it like this but we're all as fans being made mugs of :(			"

												There just isnt anything special with this simulator. It's really more of a game considering bad physics, tons of overpriced DLC, a controverisal community, but still with poor optimizations. All the company, Dovetail games, seems to want with this is a big simulator, not a detailed one-quantity over quality-when a real train fanatic should want quality over quantity. But even for the people that don't care about quality this is still a bad game due to it's 7 year old game engine that has been changed minimally over the years.I know I have spent tons of time in this game, but dont call me a hypocrite-I've played the original 2008 version and that gave me a lot of time to rack up the hours back from 2008-2013. But as more time goes on, nothing gets better, and the game is just not robust enough to keep going-even if it was fun back then.			"

												I got this game as a gift two years ago. It was fun to play at first but as time progressed I realised this is half-finished product. I am trying to find some pros for it - it has decent graphics, a great variety of routes, add-ons and several non-steam forums when you can find help, advices and even free stuff. On the other hand you get a game with a number of bugs - for some of them there are workarounds, for some not - you have to live with them somehow. Yes, there are DLCs, but they seem overpriced for the quality you get - even if the main line is finished, when you go to explore it you may find tracks only, without scenery etc (PDL is an example). Steam forum wont help you, not because the community, which is eager to give you all the remedies, but the RSC policy, namely RCS moderator, that deletes all the posts related to the issues people are encountering, giving only support email as an advice. Unfortunately support does not respond to your emails and there are no patches for problems, known for several months, event years.To sum up - you have to decide. It is true you can enjoy this game for the first several hours, but you might get in trouble without any help as well.			"

												I bought this a while ago when it was on sale for really cheap.Almost a year later, I finally got time to sit down and try it out.Okay, the tutorials are kinda stupid.  I have to repeat the same basic ""this is how to drive forward 50 feet"" tutorial multiple times for different train types?  ""Here's how signals"" work without any explanation of how to use the routing map or read signals remotely.  And so on.  Alright, bad tutorials but I will just dive right in.After completing a bunch of tutorials, I was pumped.  Woo, gonna just pick a train and drive it somewhere!  Wait, I have to select from a handful of trains, on just a handful of routes?  Wait, you mean I only got like %1 of the game that I paid $45 (minus sale discount) for?No steam locomotives provided out of the box?  Well, game has DLC, let me go see how much they cost.  Twenty bucks for a single loco?  What does a new route cost?  FORTY BUCKS?I then look at the Steam DLC page for this game.FIVE THOUSAND AND FOUR HUNDRED BUCKS FOR ALL THE DLC?!ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

												Have to downvote this game because of shady practices Dovetail Games inhibits upon its customers.As of now, there are three packages including Train Simulator 2017:TS2017 US First Class Edition, TS2017 UK First Class Edition and TS2017 German First Class Edition.Now, every one of those packages includes base Train Simulator 2017 game but neither of those includes any of routes listed as included in the base game description (namely LGV Marseille - Avignon, North Jersey Coast Line, Hamburg - Lubeck and South Wales Coastal). In other words - the content they are selling doesn't match the content provided.This is blatant FALSE MARKETING that is illegal in many countries.The next thing is you are able to buy Train Simulator 2017 with all four included routes only as new player but existing players can't buy this upgrade as Steam doesn't let them to add it to basket and there is no package available for them (it was removed with no alternative). This only tells what they really think about loyal customers who supported them all along (and yes, I know there are workarounds for this but that doesn't change the fact they could easily fix this thing in few minutes but for some reason they didn't even care).Other shady practise is selling non-functional or broken DLCs that goes months of even years without fixing it and there is no word from developers they are at least trying to fix it. Any customer support is basically almost nonexistent here. One look to forums will tell you everything. The only thing DTG actually cares about is money.The game alone is quite good and addictive (when there are no bugs or other quirks and technical issues involved - and those are numerous) but I simply can't stand their behavior any longer.I'll probably change this review is anything changes for better on their behalf but as of now, I can't really recommend supporting this company by buying any of their products.

												I must say I am very worried by the number of bugs contained in  Train Simulator 2017. Examples : Normal : Castle Rock Intermodal transport to Monument : the train derails systematically at Long 108,88, Lat 39,25 without any reason -fair speedness etc. Donner pass Sparks to Truckee : when arrived at Truckee, the scenario never stops. Career Berlin to Leipzig River Elbe to River Elster : impossible to make the train starting after saving and that happens to most of the lines of this scenario. It was my intention to acquire the train simulator premium edition but I am not prepared to spend such a high amount of money for a so poor quality.			"

												Bittersweet would be the best way to put it. While this gameulator can satisfy the rail fans wish of driving a train (at least virtually), it doesn't do it very well. A plethora of never to be fixed bugs, a greedy development team and addons which are overpriced, fluctuate in quality and usually have some part (such as sounds) either recycled from older addons or completely inaccurate. I've played this game for about 3 or 4 years now and while it looks visually like its improved, its actually gotten worse. The only thing that saves this game is the third party developers that create far better addons as well as offer better service.Don't bother with it. For all its good looks, its not worth it.Edit: The latest iteration of the game, TS2016, presents us with a somewhat game breaking bug where the game will lock up or CTD 4 times out of 5 while playing the new and rather unnecessary intro video (that's before you even see the main menu), so by the time you finally get into the game, the mood is lost and you end up exiting anyway. If you do happen to still feel a little like playing however, the game now comes with increased susceptibility to generally freezing or CTD whilst driving anyway. It seems with each yearly 'upgrade' they distribute, stability is lost and consequently playability is lessened, forcing you to torrent an older and less broken version just for some playability.

												I was lucky with this game, got the base pack cheap in the steam summer sale. Got some extras thrown in for £19.99.Its not a bad game, something to enjoy when you want to chill out a little. Its just a shame about the following points:- The cost of extra content is ridiculous- The graphics are, to a word, crap- Optimization is frankly terrible, one minute I've got 80fps, another 10fps and it jumps all over the place- Sounds are bad, like it has been programmed by a 3 year old using a synthesizer.And now we get to TS2016. So you get a nice upgrade with a new user interface (although aside from a couple of splash screens there isnt much to shout about) and all of this new ""Take it to the extreme!1!!1!!!11111"" branding. But only if you pay £99.99 for it....ermmm, nope. Thats like saying ""hey, last week you bought a bacon sandwick from us so here have a pork chop....but if you actually want to be able to eat it you'll have to pay £100 for it""Thanks Dovetail, thanks a lot.

												i admit this game has an amazing gameplay, and i would recommend it but...the amount of DLC just makes me immediately throw it out the window.the fact that you pay $30+ dollars per ♥♥♥♥ing train! its horse ♥♥♥♥. i mean they could of made a bunch of train packs consisting of 4 or more trains, that would be exceptable. and the fact gets worse considering there is 230 DLC and to buy them all it costs a whopping $4997.70 dollars. now DLC is optional, you dont have to buy it. it should be removed from the steam store temporarily, it makes valve look bad to have a game like this, with all its rediculously expensive dlc on its game distributing application. we dont need something as abhorred as this.

												I would leave a Mixed review if I could, but because a large majority of the DLC is of low quality and low support I'm leaving a negative review. I've decided to only buy 3rd party dlc mainly steam trains because they seem to have more quality to them.I ONLY RECOMMEND BUYING THE GAME AND DLC WHEN ON SALE!The prices are way too high. I buy DCS planes for around the same price as some of the dlc trains, and DCS plane quality is HUGELY better so asking the same price for one of these trains is a joke.PROS:-Lots of trains and routes to chose from if you're willing to pay-Although graphics are dated, can look nice especially rain effects on windows-Some train dlcs are very nice and well done, if you're on a limited budget make sure to buy the 3rd party trains first-Interface is nicely designed-Includes an editor for making your own routesMIXED:-The ""simulation"" is fairly tame compared to World of subways; Often not all buttons work in trains and many small features missing that make a game a true simulator-Amount of dlc would make EA proudCONS:-Questionable performance and optimization; I originally refunded this because of how bad my fps was on a powerful computer, I still can't play on full graphics-The dlc seems to be quantity over quality type production-Very high price dlcs considering their quality and their content-Apparently many dlcs have low support and have bugs or problems that have never been fixed-Game uses an old game engine, game has been renamed to ""2016"" to make it seem like the newest version-Graphics are dated in many places			"

												Hi dear Trainsimmer on Steam,As a great railroad fan, I like to spend my pasttime playing TS2015 by Dovetail Studio.Please don't be to harsh on my review, as it is my first one ever. But this needs to be said in my opinion.I played all versions of Railworks or as its now known Train Simulator 2015.When Railworks started out it was a revolutionary develepment in the way we preceive and play with train games.Graphics were out of this world good and realism was really captured well. It was all doable but extremely hard to get a perfect score on a scenario. I liked that a lot, I liked the realism in it, though be it with its own limitions, as most simulators do. If I look back and compare over 6 years of develepment and multiple releases to our current release, I must conclude that I really regret spending 42 euros on steam to buy the Special Steam Edition of TS 2015.I find the game to become oversimplified, too mainstream and too commercial, moreover the absolute lazyness of dovetail and friends and the shear nerve to rip us people off by reselling their existing DLC content again, without any noticable changes. To say the least, I'm really disappointed.If you wanna make a kids game or entry-level trains game, then by all means do so, just don't call it 'SIMULATOR'. For the record to all that don't understand the definition of simulator, (especially at dovetail and friends) here it is:Simulate = recreate something or someone to the closest possible.Or in plain english get as real as it gets.... not oversimplifying controls and forcing hud screens on me to use....Bottomline.... if you do not recreate or want to be as real as it gets, then by all means, don't call your game a simulator.There are also numerous little quircks and bugs in the game that date back from their first release of Railworks 1.E.g. My keyboard partially fails to react or simply looses connection to the in-game controls, but at the same time I can change my cam views...very annoying when you know you have to brake for a speed reduction and you can't in time because your keys for braking are temporarily disconnected to the train controls.... whoopsie there goes your perfect score for your scenario.Another example is clipping is still going on here and there, where you pass a tree that's kinda low-branched and close to the track, on occassion the branches will 'decapitate' you in your cabin, because they sway through your cabin as you pass the tree in question. ( ofcourse this is not really possible in-game....It just looks that way...LOL)Also one point of critisism is ""the feeling of speed"" is way off. Still after all those years.If I for example pass through a station in a ICE3 or similar HST @ over 160mph+, I still feel I pass through it at maybe half that speed. If I drive 100mph instead of 60mph, the world virtually still passes by at the same rate.... this is unacceptable in this day and age, Dovetail.Last but not least, their constant performance-lag in-game. I didn't always owned the right PC with specs adequate enough for Railworks in the past, I must admit. But these days I own a very respectable gaming-rig with more than adequate specs and I still, after all these years, experience stuttering and lagginess while playing, no matter if it is a new map or an old one... But aside all the little quircks and bugs and the fact that neither the tracks or the trains, or even the overall world has been majorly overhauled and updated, (it basicly all looks and feels the same since Railworks 3 aka Train Simulator 2012), the fact that really angers me the most is the nerves of steel at the Dovetail consortium. Where they now have gone completely haywire on the DLC. Basicly what they did is change some little itsybitsy code and converted some important files to a different fileformat, which basicly renders all previously purchased DLC useless in this so-called new Railworks 6 aka Train Simulator 2015. Then they have the nerve to resell their DLC untouched and unchanged back to the public in their new fileformat so it can be read by the game.You can check this fact by checking your Routes folder of your game in the SteamLibrary/SteamApps/common/Railworks/Content/Routes folder.If you would take a look at your folders in there it will useally look like: 00000029-0000-0000-0000-000000002014This folderstructure goes for most of your routes in Railworks. The last four digits in this example is 2014.This is the buildyear or release year of the original content. But this time it contains the same files with the new modifications in it. If you would compare these files with the original DLC from last year, you will find they are the same files but some now have a different fileformat at the end... Like many other reviews I read here on Steam regarding this game, conclude in a similar manner.Unfortunately I cannot conclude otherwise.In my honest opinion, I feel they are proving they are not only lazy, but also very devious for trying to sell people what they already own. Therefore I must conclude this as the worst release yet of Railworks and cannot recommend this game positively to others.I hope this was informative or helpfull in anyway to at least one person, so I can be happy with this review.I could go on and on about a lot of things that are still not up to par yet, after all these years. But I'm not the kind that just wants to complain about everything. I always was a big fan of this Series and curious where they would end up later.... but seeing now what they did and where they are after all this time, is for me at least very dissappointing.Sincerely yours,EradicationGod			"

												First off, I LOVE trains, when I first loaded this Simulator I was very happy with what I saw, then that started to fade away as the reality of the game set in. I've owned this game for a few years, and have found the content/game buggy with no fixes for them in sight...  I brought up bugs in the forums only to have been banned for life.   Anyone posting about bugs in the forum will have their posts deleted or locked.  Perfectly good steam reviews are marked off-topic by the developers.   Somewhat pretty graphics, shadowed by a myriad of issues, partly simulated routes/trains.. hardly worthy of the name Simulator.Numerous 3rd party bug fixes for certain routes, not all of them, are available throughout the web for bugs the developer has never fixed as they have stated to me that its working as intended.The game itself has dropped in quality in the years I have owned it...  expensive numerous DLC releases in leau of bug fixes.   The game itself is lackluster for it being 2014.   Forced upgrades each year breaking numerous DLC and introducing even more bugs that most likely will not get fixed.   Many trains over the years have been broken by these ""upgrades"" only to be released a while later as NEW for full price.  Most of the DLC that is offered are developed by 3rd parties, some of which are quite good... however the DLC developed by RSC themselves are not of a high quality.   EDIT:  It must be cold in the netherworld ...  DTG/RSC have actually added native support for the TrackIR.  I'm floored.   I wish this Steam rating system was a number system and not based on ones and zero's  as I would just slightly increase the score.. however as it still stands.. its yet to be seen if this is going to change to a thumbs up.  However THANK you DTG/RSC for implimenting support!No multi GPU support..  NO multicore CPU support.   Requires a fairly beefy computer to run.			"

												I really, really, really, really, really want this game to be good.  It has a few things going good for it, and most of them are the fact that it has trains.  The tutorials are half-♥♥♥♥♥, I needed to look up the signaling system on Wikipedia and learned it from there instead of anywhere in the game.  The sounds are pretty bad.  Optimization is HORRID, though some of the trains and the scenes are really pretty.  Also, the DLC is a ripoff.  $40 for a route, and a couple locos/stock would be almost worth it if it came with more than 3-4 scenarios.  As I look through the comments I'm seeing some suggestions for other trainsims, and I think I might want to go ahead and check them out.  I am however, going to say that despite all of its flaws, I do keep coming back to this game and driving more trains.  Here's to hoping eventually the game gets better.Oh, and one last thing.  I like how driving a train is so easy, they need to have Sean Bean narrate a monologue about how hard it is to drive a train.  Really, its REALLY hard guys.  Boromir says so!			"

												Train Simulator. I don't really know where to start on the game. I have owned it since Rail Simulator back in the days and when it realeased, it was a good game! However, over the years, the game has been upgraded and features have been added. The development of the game has been taken over by DTG that released it as Train Simulator 2012 and offered free updates over the years. And that is where the problem arises. The game was upgraded with new features that clogged the main engine.You might think, ""Hey, new features, that's nice!"" but think again. Most features means more use of resources which, in this game, are pretty scarse. Since the engine is still from Rail Simulator, it is 32-bit, pretty inefficient and it means when you get over 3,4GB of memory (and trust me, you can hit that limit pretty easy!) it runs out of memory and the game crashes in a tempdump, if it hasn't crashed already in a random crash, which happens quite often.Having that said, the game looks nice. Most train models are good quality and are well worth driving. The BR155, the recently released TGV Duplex on the LGV from Marseille to Avignon, the Class 395 Javelin are all great trains that are worth a drive. With real and correctly working TVM and PZB / SIFA implementations that'll make you scratch your head every now and then why the train throws itself into emergency again.But what is a train without a railway? The game luckily includes routes where the trains you buy fit on perfectly. Most of the times. Köln - Koblenz, Sherman Hill (re-release!), Rivera Line in the 60s, and the Norfolk Coal District. The Köln - Koblenz route was released around 1,5 years before the release of Train Simulator 2016, Sherman Hill was included in one of the very first installments of Railworks, Rivera Line in the 60s is a re-release in an older era of an existing route and the Norfolk Coal District... *sigh*The routes included with Train Simulator 2016 were among the most laziest I've ever seen. The developers didn't include any new routes, just one new locomotive (the BR155) with the Koblenz route, the Gas Turbine locomotive with Sherman Hill, some steam engines with the Rivera route and the Norfolk Coal District included some existing locomotives. Also, if you had Train Simulator 2016 and you wanted the new HUD (which was also updated from Train Sim 2015 to Train Sim 2016) you had to BUY THE GAME AGAIN FOR €29,99 (now 22,99). Basically for a worsened HUD and two locomotives from which one is actually really nice.Having that said, most of the add-ons in this game are not included in the base game. You'll get three or four routes. Depending on which version you buy (German First Class, US First Class, UK First Class, Steam Edition, Epic Journeys). That's it, the rest of the add-ons you'll have to buy. And boy, the prices of these add-ons are ridiculous. Let me take the LGV: Marseille - Avignon as example. You'll get a 100km long route and ONE SINGLE train, the TGV Duplex. All of that for... Just €29,99! Wait, what?! This single route costs more than the base game which included four routes?! And you get only one train?! Yes. DTG is asking ridiculous prices for their add-ons. This LGV route alone costs more than the entire base game conbined. The recently released Maglev route basically lets you press a button before the train drives itself to its destination where the scenario ends. All of that for just 22,99!Also, DTG does not support other countries than their base three. These are Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Do you live in The Netherlands (like me), Belgium, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Japan, India, or any other outside these three, do not expect DTG to make DLC from your country. The French DLC they released was the first (and probably the last) in THE ENTIRE LIFESPAN THAT Train Simulator EXISTS (wait, Semmeringenbahn from Austria was also released. If you don't count that they reused only German assets from previous routes except SOME assets and included only a repaint of an already existant locomotive. Heck, the passenger coaches didn't even include a luggage and first class car). They simply deny that other countires have rail enthousiasts, I think, while they could expand their userbase explosively by adding more and different countries to their collection.After complaing about the content of the game, let's move on to the working of the game. The trains you drive are pretty good, as mentionned earlier. They work, they drive, they have accurate safety systems. They drive on routes that look pretty nice, but lag at busy places. Mannheim, Munich, London. All these cities lag like crazy. Its not some 'busy area' lag where the framerate drops to 30 instead of 60, but true lag. 5-15fps depending on your system and on what quality you have set the game to. The standard scenario's that come with the games trains or routes usually lack any AI-traffic (trains you meet on the other track or during your journey). Especially the LGV lacked any AI traffic whilst its one of the busiest LGV's in France. If gives you a feeling you're... Alone. It gives the route a feeling of... Emptiness. If you meet or encounter one or two other trains during your drive you are quite lucky. Happily most routes have integration with Steam Workshop, where users can upload their own scenario's. With dozens of proper scenario's you can find some nice scenario's there. But wait, most users use more trains than included in the route you're trying to drive. Yeah, you'll need to buy those first before the scenario works properly, if it doesn't crash because of the memory limit. But Munich station completely empty looks nice, at least.Creating your own scenario's is quite hard. You need to get used to it first. The AI trains have the mental capability of a teaspoon (©FringeStalin) and usually the dispatcher that checks every order after you insert it and calculates everything between the orders fails if you work either longer than 20 minutes or insert more than 3 AI trains. This makes the scenario fail itself alltogether making you angry and the scenario unplayable. But hey, if you restart the game entirely everything is magically fixed! Only thing you have to wait for are the loading times, which if you are not on a SSD, are amazingly slow.Don't even bother building your own routes. The number of workarounds and things that are NOT documented by DTG is so high that making a route yourself is close to impossible if you don't put enough time in it.There is some nice 3rd party material available for free. Altenburg - Wildau from SAD is one of the best available and I highly reccomend you getting this one straight from the start.Overall I give this game a 4,5 out of 10. There's much more I'd like to tell, but my tip: Only get this game in Steam Sale for 75% or more and make sure to thouroughly check if any add on you want to buy is in a package that's on discount.

												Trains are awesome, but this is a train simulator that is difficult to play, and runs at a surprisingly poor frame rate even on decent PC hardware.The DLC policy that these developers have is obscene, with over AU$4,000 worth of DLC! I find it hard to believe that there really is that much worth of content in all the DLCs put together.The developers don't seem to want to add any Australian train routes, despite the Aussie routes being some of the most beautiful in the world. There also seems to be a lack of African and Asian rail lines. Instead, they're obsessed with European routes instead, and the odd US route.The only good point about this game is that it always seems to get upgraded to the latest version at the end of each year, free of charge; Train Simulator 2014 got upgraded to Train Simulator 2015 free of charge, which in turn got upgraded to Train Simulator 2016 free of charge. However, in my mind that simply demonstrates how little changes between each version, and how much the developer is trying to milk customers with DLC.My recommendations to the developers:Combine DLCs into packs and drastically drop their prices. Perhaps have a UK pack, a US pack, and a Europe pack, each for a reasonable price.Look at improving the efficiency of your code, with the aim to improve the frame rate.Add routes outside of Europe and the US, including areas such as Asia, Africa, and Oceania.Consider adding multiplayer capability, allowing two or three other trains on the same line and the use of spurs and sidings (loops and stubs).

												Where to start with this? Railworks 2 was the first game I ever bought, and I loved every minute of it. It was the game that caused me to get the gaming bug.Fast forward to now.Train SImulator 2015 has to be one of the worst games I have ever played. Despite being an IT engineer myself, and knowing how to get a computer set up, despite spending 1000's of pounds on a gaming rig with an Ultra M.2 SSD, overclocked i7 4790k, and a GTX Titan Black, this game is still laggy and doesn't play properly.It's old. It's out of date. It's expensive (apart from in the sales), and DTG spend more time creating more and more DLC, rather than sorting out the abomination that the base game has become.DTG claim that next year the game will be using the Unreal engine. 'Great' I hear you cry, until you then realise that the hundreds, if not thousands of pounds of DLC you have already bought won't be compatible with it. So guess what? You're going to have to buy it again. having been a loyal fan of this game for a few years now, I feel like I've been bent over and well and truly shafted by the developers with a substandard product. I understand they are a commercial business that are out to make money, but to make money, you need to keep your customer base happy, and if you look at these reviews, you can see that more and more loyal customers of DTG are fed up with them.If you want a game that seems incomplete, substandard and frustrating as hell, (not in a good way) then part with your hard earned for it.If you want a game with an excellent game engine, superb graphics, realism, and is reliable - then look elsewhere because you ain't going to get it from this.

												Train Simulator 2015 still falls short behind the 2014 release, it offers no actual improvement related to gameplay and quick drive functionality then the previous generations, there is no option to manually set up a route and stops for your self in the Quick Drive screen which is a massive let down. Fog is still bland, you can't set fog distance at all neither any other options for rain or even worse conditions like icing on track or so. The developers attitude still remains the same, utterly disgraceful and they still think this is a family game, because it is not. This game have to get past the ""game for kids"" attitude by the developers, and they have to keep focusing on making the simulation aspect a lot better, e.g.: they could implement manual startup functions for trains, better sanding, more control functions like the ETCS, radio communication, train station announcements, and there could be a lot more that is actually not in this particual game, and certainly someone who is not a hardcore train fan will find this game extremely boring.The game have so much potential with Quick Drive but players requests are still not being met with equal amount of support to implement better usability for that particularly interesting game mode. I have to note that the lack of custom, fictional maps, there is literally non, other then what Kuju did back in a while but that is freely available on the Steam Workshop. Ah yes, the workshop is integrated horribly badly, you won't ever find what you want to find to be honest it is just a failed method of implementation for this game.Some DLCs for this game is amazing, but the prices do seem a bit overly extortionate especially on tracks and trains that are way out of date and are only updated so that they can roll on the track, e.g.: Metronom, Düsseldorf-Köln, Münich-Augsburg, Ruhr-Sieg line, these are really in bad condition.But yeah, try convince the developers that they are at the wrong when when we are actually experiencing all the bad, they could easily upgrade the Ruhr-Sieg line and make it all cool and dandy like they did with the last two german maps.I must say I'm highly dissatisfied with the company's policies, they are too intrusive, obtrusive and they will ban all their political foes whom speak out against them in what ever manner. Still is today.[2015.02.20] I can only rate this game 3 out of 10. [Only buy when 75% or more discounted!]Edit 2015.07.08: So, according to the news DTG is going to release TS2016 as a brand new game separate from the current 2015 platform, and by that they won't be continuing the current platform upgrade for this game and we don't receive the update. This is actually one hell of a bad idea, but on their part it is very genius, because... If they create a new game, and leave this one here, they can basically delete and eliminate content that doesn't function properly, they can apply fixes to maps and other content that they will re-brand and fix, but next to that they gonna be able to start clean with the rating system on this game by having a clean slate of reviews from users.Well, all I can say right now to DTG is good luck, if they managed to implement in a lot of game experience enhacing effects like more dynamic traffic, alterable path and priority system, then I guess the game could become a massive hit, well I as a game designer I do think that could be great addition to the game and could improve the relation between the company and the userbase.But, if this is gonna be another let down by the company, then their effort to try to start with a clean slate will completely backfire and will get a lot of problems in the end, let's hope for the best, since there are possibilities for it.Okay, so 2016 update.Apparently, it become a pay-ware upgrade! What a shame, how far did we have to sunk, bugged DLCs and still such a broken and utterly unoptimized game, I just can't beleive what the developers are doing to this franchise. God forbid them from ruining Flight Simulator X, I hope Microsoft will revoke their license if that happens.2017.Nothing has changed, and the game is being abandoned, this is disgraceful. The developers are horrible, they are very disrespectful of people. They are failing, I will call them as the failing DTG, horribly failing.			"

												Just awful, even as a free update. Quite how Dovetail can take a fairly good engine and make it so buggy is beyond me. People walking off platforms into mid air, light flickering, impossible to see anything at night, DLC no longer working, passenger view graphical issues, and the game crashing on loading a session are some of the problems in the 24 hours since download. Avoid at all costs.			"

												Train Simulator. It's a promising title isn't it if you love trains and want to be a train driver but otherwise can't, but behind this title, there is a game that although great for it's time, looks so cartoony and sterile with no sense of real-world immersion, and it is more of a game than a simulator, but what realistically what much else can you do with a train simualtor? This isn't FSX, you apply throttle and brake, but there's no real challenge to the game. Train driving is a very responsible job with roles more than just driving a train, but you don't get more than that in this simulator. Some random train faults or signal failures or something would be nice. Or even follow World of Subways with a character to walk about.Passenger AI in this game is a disaster. They have the IQ of a teaspoon when they walk off the platform onto the tracks whilst somehow defying the laws of gravity in the process, and showing no care that a speeding train (or slowing one) is heading for them. Though let's face it, you wouldn't care if the train was just gonna go through you and not leave you with even a scratch. I mean it would be grim to include it, and this isn't Grand Theft Auto, so we can let the lack of an effect slide. It wouldn't be good advertising to show the windscreen wipers smearing blood on the front train window would it?The trains themselves are for the most part nice, and the newer more interactive ones with realistic features such as lights on the front not affecting the lights on the back (you could drive with headlights on at both ends if you so wish, unless I am very wrong). But the sounds are also a disaster, I mean gaining access to depots is very difficult, and if we spent long enough waiting for access, DTG would lose customers cause of the demand for new DLC. Let's just say either waiting ages or forever for a train, or one with atrocious sounds. Whichever suits you best.Routes are the best things in this game without a doubt, because despite the complex tools that most people aren't even bothered to make an attempt to get use to or understand, the outcome is very nice if done properly. In terms of detail and accuracy, routes are the strong point, because the quality assurance is vital in order to make profit. Some routes dominate others, but nowadays they're just getting too small or have too little trains. Germans have it worse, I mean why build something like Munich Augsburg at about 60km when you can build up to about 200km of railway? Time and money of course, but if there is any investors pumping money into DTG to do stuff like this, then by golly they are not paying them enough. There is a route builder and scenario creator in this game, and this is probably the only time you will get something truly different. Unfortunately, most people decide ""this is too complex"" after spending five minutes trying to figure out how you make a train station or even put a train on the track. The tools are complex, but when you get use to them and become aware of them, then it's a nice little thing to do. Whoever thinks it needs to be simplified, try chatting to Network Rail telling them how hard you find it setting out cetenary wires which are created automatically in game without the need to get smelted iron for the overhead wires, and all the engineering plans and precision. Thought not, let's proceed.Price of DLC is, like most people think, overpriced. Now everyone blames DTG for this, but I think it's Steam who set the price, and I do think this is unfair to pin the blame on DTG. I mean if a tube of Pringles is cheaper in Asda (or Walmart if you're an American reader) than it is in Tesco, clearly the crisp makers themselves aren't setting the prices, cause the one's selling need some cash as well. Unfortunately, unless you're well off and willing to spend a lot of money (which I have, but I'm quite the tight-wad) then you'll have to wait for Steam sales, cause otherwise you might need to have a word with your bank manager for spending over £2000 on Train Simulator DLC. So overall, it's an alright game, but I wouldn't recommend it. Maybe I would've recommended it when it first came out, or even a few years after, but we're nearly in 2016, and with the UE4 version coming very soon, all the energy should really be put into that, kind of taking into account some of my points such as a playable character, less cartoony and more organic (something like dirt and grime and that, I mean this is UE4), more advanced trains with realistic interactivity, longer routes, and maybe more to do than just drive trains. I mean that should be the primary thing, but if every journey is the same, which for a real train driver it isn't cause anything can happen, then you're gonna get bored REAL FAST if you, like me, have no life and have spent around 1000 hours on the game in total already. Final score... 5.5/10 (good, but really needs improvement).			"

												A dated game with overpriced rubbish DLC and awful devs who only care about money and nothing else.The whole 'omg £3000 for DLC that's stupid lol' misunderstands the simulation genre however. You don't have to buy all the DLC you buy what you want.Microsoft Flight Simulator X hasd individual planes that can cost £100 or more and has thousands upon thousands of addons for example.The difference is FSX addons are all third party, and many are very good quality and priced as such. The trainsim DLC is just bad and expensive, very little work goes into them, mainly the locos.Compare a train made by JustTrains or Armstrong Powerhouse to something the devs have made and you'll see the difference.Having said that, the devs do a good job of the routes which look good but are all too short. They also went with the 'we can't be bothered making scenarios, we'll leave the community to do it!' so you'll get a pitiful amount of missions per route.Most annoying thing is the quick drive, you can't even do multiple stops and there's barely any AI. In my opinion quick drive could have saved this game and made it great but the devs, as incompetent as ever did a terrible job of it.They've been hinting at a new engine/game on the latest  unreal engine, which will probably make all DLC incompatabile, but I'm sure it will be an improvement as the current game is very dated.Unfortunately this is really the only modern train simulator. There is Trainz but that's not on the same level as this game. Maybe if another company made a train simulator and provided competition then this game would improve.			"

												Overpriced DLC and constant bugs. Buy Microsoft Train Simulator, Trainz or take a look at the free Open Rails program.

												This company needs a real competitor or new leadership. They must hire more programmers to recode the game from the ground up. The 3d models are nice but the game is not based on physics only some arcade movement approximations. The game needs a supercomputer to run with acceptable frame rate. The scenarios-missions not connected in any way, they are separated in time and space. It's like a bunch of train driving mini games. The game is only a demo for 30 euros, not containing even the trains on the cover image. It's more like a DLC browser with full of advertisements. The DLCs are on insane price, i wont buy any of them till they lower the prices to 4.99.			"

												Ok, so first off, DLC's are priced way too high. $40 for a route!? No, just no. Secondly, they're support is useless. You contact them, it says "" Well get back to you soon""...No reply. Third, They ban you from there fourms if you say anything remotely bad about there game. And last but not least, there are a ton of glitches and freezes. Like on the Amfleet cars that come with the NY To New Haven DLC,the couplers are all spread apart and messed up. Will they even attempt to fix it? Nope...Or, I'll be just driving along, then boom, my train flies into the air, or my train stops and it just says ""derailment"" and i'm just sittin there like ""what?"". Not to mention that the physics are off most locomotives. This is very unfortunate because i see a lot of potential in this game if they would just fix simple glitches! If you dont mind any of this than purchase it. Its not a terrible game when it works, just dont expect it to all of the time.			"

												Most probably the most immersive Train Simulator/Game that is ""current"" and if you love trains, chances are you'd get intoxicated in it like how I used to be.  However:The Developers are perfectly capable of developing stunning and immersive add-ons with the right trains like The Woodhead Line add-on but:- They have a habit of not fixing bugs and issues with their DLCs.  When they fix them, it is often a very poor fix.e.g. 1. The Class 455 comes with unique ""shadow-casting headlights"" which is a massive fps killer.  Not fixed.e.g. 2. The Class 166 ""fix"" is a half-hearted one.  It used to take off like a rocket so they quadrupled the power lag to ""solve"" it.e.g. 3  The Class 450, which has been ""fixed"" twice but braking is still not sorted.- Obnoxiously priced DLC trains containing just one paint scheme.  They then sell a second paint scheme of the same train at full price.- Duplicate DLCs of the ""same"" train, adding massive complexity for 3rd-party scenario developers as these duplicates are not compatible with each other.- A good number of default scenarios are rushed, devoid of AI traffic and have niggling bugs.e.g. AI trains collide with each other due to bad routing, Scenario-specific speed restrictions not marked etc.- The TS2014 community can be vile at times, with a proliferation of negative comments aimed at the developer.I've been playing this since June 2011 in the Railworks 2 days when the developers were slightly more humble, and the cost of DLCs less prohibitive.  I still love trains and play this for enjoyment and to get the most out of my sunk costs.However, I recommend new users to stay well away from this sim/game due to its massive cost, bugs and poor developer support.  Due to my previous intoxication with this game, I probably handed over far too much cash and it took an unrelated truck simulator for me to realise how mediocre TS2014 and its support really is.

												Since I'm a real train engineer in Belgium I felt the need to experience the joy of the job in other countries than my own. When I first got this I was rather excited but then soon problems started showing. First of all,it's not correct to call it a ""simulation"" when so many features just aren't there,it's like calling Need For Speed Rivals a driving simulator...just because it has cars/trains and you can drive those doesn't mean it simulates the experience. Many issues within the scenarios/driving stock also tend to ruin the experience,reporting those will not change anything,the company has 0 transparency and tends to mute those who try to bring up these issues on the steam forums. There have been little as none patches to fix the current problems and they refuse to publish the list of errors they ""resolved"". The lack of any competition is the biggest problem here,since there's no real other big developer they tend to think they get away with more. The continious production of more and more DLC while the previous releases are half finished is a good example. Maybe in the future another big developer will stand up,bringing us all the true rail experience we want or maybe even force this company into stepping up their game but until then we have no real option.

Neutral RatingI'm really on the Fence to give this Game a Positive Thumbs Up, as there are some great qualities to it, but at the same time it also has a lot of Negatives to it... and some are substantial. However, I'd never give it a Negative Review, because I have enjoyed it, and still do on occassion despite my issues I experience.Train Simulator 20xx is without a doubt, the most successful Train Sim out there currently, which is mainly due to the large amount of Content available which gives Players a wide variety to build up their own Collection. For a old Game Engine, it can look really good, most Models are done well, and a lot of the new Content has stunning visuals. The sounds are 'meh' for a lot of the Content, but they have improved slightly on occassion.It is definitely not a Game for everyone, and mostly appeals to Train Fanatics, or Sim Fanatics [like myself]. The hours can be endless depending on said person.As the Steam Store has a lot of DLC created by 3rd Party Developers, I am excluding them completely out of this Review. The DLC created by DoveTail Games can have a YoYo effect when it comes to Quality on their DLC. For an example:- Loco 'A' released in November will have Great Modelling, nice and Crisp Textures, and a wide variety of Features.- Loco 'B' released in December will have Blocky Modelling, Blurry Textures, and a lack of Features.I'm sure this is due to a different Team working on different Content, but there should be Standards to live up to, especially when they are sold at the same Price.Although it is called a ""Simulator"", it leans more towards a Game. The Features it offers are very Basic, and most of the Switches and Monitors are just there for show [there are some exceptions though]. So if you are looking for a indepth, and highly Realistic experience, then keep looking, or alternatively learn to play without the HUD, and ask about External 3rd Party Content which produce Realistic Loco's [though the Variety is low].Despite how enjoyable it can be, the Game has many issues. I'm only going to name a few, because I'm not into ""Bashing"" a Game I enjoy [that's what Forums are for]. Such as Features not working Correctly [or at all], Scenario's which cannot be completed due to AI crashing, Dump File errors, and Signals not Functioning correctly.I would say if you want to invest in this Game, then it is essential to do Research before any purchases, and do a lot of Reading on the Forums, and never be afraid to ask any Questions there, even ones you might think are silly.Genre- SimulatorGame Elements- Commuter Train Operator- Freight Train Operator- Shunter Train Operator- Train SpotterAverage Playthrough- UnlimitedLiked- Supports TrackIR- Wide Variety of Content- Good Visuals for an Old Engine- Good Models and Textures- Some interesting Features- Helpful CommunityDisliked- Broken Content- Lack of Bug Fixing- Moderate Sounds- Lack of Advanced Features- Quality YoYo's too much			"

												Train Simulator 2016. Beat The Extreme. It's not extreme. At all.The game play is driving a train from A to B, as the title suggests. There are lots of different trains and routes but the thing you do is to drive from A to B.The base game.Pretty cheap for what it offers. The 3 routes and trains are all pretty good. While the UK route is a re-hash of a previous route, made in 2014, it is a decent package.However, in order to get a full experience of the game, you will need to buy some of the mountains of Train Simulator DLC.That in itself is a bore.The next thing you find is that the base game and a few of the collections are actually value for money, the rest is daylight robbery. For the British stuff (which I'm focusing on, I'm not that clued-up on the other countries), all the sounds are terrible except the Class 395. If you've never heard a train before, the sounds are great but otherwise you should go to Armstrong Powerhouse and buy the Sound Packs. Well worth the fiver. There are also many annoing bugs. There are the trivial ones which involve cars going through trains at some level crossings and some bridges blocking the track which you just drive through but there are the ones which are annoying.The game is very unstable on many very good systems meaning crashes happen quite frequently. Sometimes trains will derail even when you are well within the speed limit or just stopped; the game will come up with the error ""Game over due to consist tilt"" and you will be chucked back to the menu. Once you actually get into this simulator, you will realise that Dovetail Games treat the players not like customers but like walking wallets which they can dip their hands into whenever they have not made enough profit.You will also notice once you get into the franchise a bit more that everything is re-used. A lot of the British rolling stock have the default 455 sounds, which are poor anyway. The re-using of appauling sounds is normal, and something you will have to get used to, I'm afraid. Then there's the routes. They are usually decent, if a bit short, but tend to come with trains that are already in the game. The Midland Main Line is an example of this because it comes with the 66 and 319, both already in the game. Trains that could have been included that are not in the game are the 222 and 387. This is repeated with the Munich to Rosenhiem (101 and 423) and various other add-ons. While I can see this happening if only 2 trains run on the routes, many of them have multiple trains on them, which instead of filling some very large gaps in the game, DTG recycle. And recycle. And recycle. This means various people have to fill the gap.At some point, this game is going to crash because people are going to get fed-up with what DTG are doing. It has been getting worse recently and there are no signs that this is going to improve any time soon. Before you used to get a free upgrade to the next Train Simulator (even though it is just a patch with a new title) but TS2016 was sold as an entirely new game because it had ""so many new features"" that it warrants everyone paying for a game they already have! Well, it didn't. It had a small extra funciton that helped (like a patch) and a mode that is completly redundant as it's unofficially been in the game for a long time now. So it did not. You will get used to this constant overhyping and mis-selling of content if you get into this game. So don't.The developers keep saying ""We are aware of our standard and are trying to improve it"" and ""we do care [about what you want]"". To pick up on the first point, we are yet to see any evidence of this. And to pick up on that last point, the things that we have been asking for for a long time such as a Eurostar route and better default sounds have not happened. Even when they do, it is usually not 100% of what was requested. For example, the Midland Main Line route for train sim only goes from St Pancras to Bedford although originally Elephant and Castle to Bedford was requested. And to pick up on the first point: nice try but nothing has happened yet. Additionally, once a route is finished, there is no chance it will be updated. Gravesend, Finsbury Park, Peterborough, London Bridge and many other stations are in old models which, as a community, we know will never be fixed by DTG. Instead we wait for people to do this stuff for free while DTG sit back and rake the cash in. A combination of ""can't be bothered"" and ""we need to make loads of money"" attitudes mean this game is on a downward curve. If nothing is done, it will crash. Hard.It must be said that new members of the game get good value for money when joining. But this changes the moment you dip your toe into the game. DTG will exploit your desire to have your favorite train or route in the game and so you will pay the full price for it (£12 per train, £25 per route with some exceptions). This in nearly all cases is not value for money at all. It must be said that if you know a train very well, you will realise that DTG make good trains rarely. As far as I know, only 1 actually good train exists, that being the class 395, which comes with the very linear London to Faversham High Speed route.So if you want a very realistic train simulator that gets everything right, this is the only one around. Although it doesn't get nearly everything right, as outlined above. But be prepared to spend thousands of pounds. And I mean thousands. There's more than £3,000 worth of DLC for you to waste your money on.Form your own opinion.Felix.			"

The AI humans do nothing but walk or stare at you in the train8. No instructions besides telling you how to move and stop9.

												Some of the content is pretty nice but much of the content is priced as you would expect from a very detailed simulation when it's actually just mass produced trash filled with bugs that will never get fixed. I guess the developers have realized that people by their stuff anyway so they don't need to waste any time fixing older stuff.Can be worth trying if you buy it during a good sale, just be prepared to play broken scenarios and get emergency stops when you've done nothing wrong.

												2 ** Really there are a lot of things this title does well, but it has some real issues. Some of the DLC is simply a lie, there are some packages which do not actually include what they advertise. Thus the sore I give is very low. I contacted the developers but they have not done anything to fix the issues I have. So sadly I can not recommend this title. Avoid it for now.			"

												TS2015 can be broken down in to the Positive and Negative aspects:Positive:- During sales, it is cheap to absurdly low levels, even in special editions. This makes it easy for anyone to pick up and play it.- (Almost) full controller support.- Wide abundance of downloadable content from nearly all parts of the world.- Some DLC content is also free (Including re-released routes on the Workshop).- The game has a very active community, with many groups to join.- Highly acclaimed as a very detailed, expansive, and fun train simulation game.- Many third-party addons to expand the collection further.- Amazingly concentrated and detailed physics, geography, and train movement.--------------------Negative:- The game is a DLC-pumping machine. This manages to pump out more useless DLC than PAYDAY 2 does. AND THAT GAME HAS LESS DLC.- A lot of the time, the game breaks laws of motion, physics, and gravity.Examples:

Before that they were about as detailed as any passengers you'd see in Trainz 2004 or in any low-poly interior (which there is a lot).- A lot of the tools are confusing to figure out at first, and a lot of tutorials offer little help, as the game changes around every September. Sounds a lot like a good amount of games today. Isn't that right Ubisoft, EA, and whatever COD is?- With each game, the system requirements change. I get this is common in technology, but a lot of us don't change like everyone else does.- I've been interested in this game since Rail Simulator, and as of this release, I'm starting to want to revert back to Trainz. Or even venture into Run-8. (Protip: Don't buy Run-8.)In short, if you want to get the game, get it. I'd prefer you get it on a /deeply/ cheap sale, however. I'll probably get comments of autists spewing their views, and you're more than welcome to.Like my videos and screenshots I post of this game, I'm not responding to it unless it deserves being responded to.Cheers, - Fancypants			"

												TS2017 is a mixed bag of beansWhile chugging along in a train can be relaxing and surprisingly fun, this game is also a source of aggravation. As example I think I have a decent computer: GTX 970, AMD A10-6700 quad Core, 8 Gbyte Ram, Windows 10 AE. I can play games like World of Warcraft and Elite Dangerous on highest settings without problems and decent frame rates.In TS 2017 my framerate can drop down as low 6 fps in certain scenarios. I might get 20 fps if I am lucky and reduce all settings to low.Switching from Windowed borderless to fullscreen in the settings would cause it to no longer start.That's for the technical things.For gameplay I have these complaints:The career mode is too strict:Driving your train at 101kph instead of 100kph? You lose points. One minute too late at the station? Kiss ANY points you might have accrued goodbye.Also DLCs are extremely expensive.Would I recommend this game? If it's for sale under $10, yes.Full price? No.			"

												I'm glad I got this in a bundle and didn't pay much.  I really wanted to enjoy this game, but I can't.Horrible framerates for a game with 2000's graphics.  Nobody wants to play a game that drops to 4fps every 30 seconds loading a station or new stretch of track.900+ achievements and thousands of dollars worth of DLC?  Maybe you could include more than 3 trains in the base game, how about that.Notchy controls in the cab.The final straw for me was the speed limit changes with no notifications.  Usually, you are given warning that the speed is changing ahead on the track.  But on some missions, when you are pulling into the final stop, the speed limit abruptly drops, and screws you out of points because now you are speeding, and slamming on the brakes makes you lose even more points.  Goodbye (insert x amount of time the run took you) and goodbye perfect 1000 point score.  FORGET THIS GAME.			"

												This review is written treating the game as a simulator, which is how it's titled after all. Firstly every year the name of the game changes from 2012,2013,2016 ect, that game is actually the same with a few very minor changes. The game hasn't really changed since 2012. Different DLC are included in different years but you need to purchase the game every year to receive them. So it updates for free to the latest year but you don't receive any DLC that comes with that year unless you pay again. The biggest gripe with this game is DLC content is priced at an extremely high and unreasonable level. You could easily pay £3000 to buy all DLC. Dovetail say that you only buy what you like, but routes cost around £24 and trains £12. Considering the level of detail and there inaccuracy’s this pricing is just beyond a joke. As a simulator of driving trains in the UK it is really terrible. As a train driver who has driven trains and routes that appear in the game I have to say it is very unrealistic. It certainly isn’t a simulator. Almost all the trains have massive aspects of there function, and operation missing. The operation of AWS and TPWS which are integral parts of driving trains are either missing or integrated incorrectly. AWS magnets at signals often don't even register. Most of the buttons in the cab don't work. The starting of engines and even down to the basics of simply pulling away is completely wrong. If you think you are driving a train when you play this then you are mistaken. Obviously it has to be basic so it can be played by people of varying degrees of knowledge but there isn’t even an option to play a realistic mode.The routes are never updated; the signals are mostly in the wrong place and act in un-characteristic ways. Platforms lengths, scenery, junctions are generally works of fiction. The performance characteristics of the trains are also inaccurate. It’s impossible to drive the train in a safe manner and keep to the timetable. Games like this only exist because people pay good money for rubbish. This game could be so much better and bigger and make even more money if its production company put a little effect in and weren’t so greedy.  There is a massive gap in the market for a realistic train simulator, probably community developed, when that happens the train simulator franchise will be dead.  "

I'm not talking about the mindless ""the whole lot costs THAT much!"" look of incredulity, I'm talking about some SINGLE DLC's costing almost as much as the game itself.Quite quickly I saw I had been suckered with a honeypot.I don't like being ripped off and this title is no more than a demo with click-thru DLC ""buy now"" buttons. Stay clear unless you REALLY like trains and are blind to a pretty blunt business model.There will be detractors of this review. Of course there will be.

												Don't buy this game, you get 4 or so base trains and a track or two and then they expect you to buy more in the form of DLC at ridiculous prices and because the base game lacks content you're either forced to buy DLC or de-install the game. I chose for the latter.Another thing is that each year they change the name to make the game seem as if it's a new one, but it's simply the same one from last year with an updated year count and a new menu design.

												Unless you find it in a bargain Steam sale for 5 quid, don't waste your money. The developers are one of the worst in the gaming industry, constantly making empty promises and releasing overpriced and broken DLC. The game itself has had tons of bugs since its original launch over 5 years ago, don't let the '2016' tag fool you, this is an OLD game, yet after loads of updates, it remains as bugged and badly optimized as ever. The latest '2016 Extreme' update has been laughable, with most users who have already given the developers their hard earned cash being given a slap in the face by having their 'TS 2015' game broken with extra bugs generated by the 2016 launch. After 6 years in development, they still can't handle something as simple as getting a menu right, it's a shame.			"

												Let me start by saying I actually like this game.It's fun to play, and you can spend hours and hours in it without getting bored. At least, if this is your thing. This is not a fast-paced shooter. It's a game simulating trains. Obviously.However, despite me liking this game, there are some serious reasons why I would NOT recommend it.First of all, the basic game is already quite expensive. You can have some fun with what comes with it by default. But a little more would never hurt. When you're done with the vanilla content, and turn to DLC's, things get really expensive, really fast.The amount of DLC available is huge, and I applaud that. But the prices for these packs are not just high, they are exhuberant. In my opinion, the prices are at least three times what they should be at most.A very, very big downside that shows itself in this DLC library, is that much of this DLC was made for older versions and weaker PC's, and has never been brought up to modern standards. But it's still sold at the same very high prices.So you end up with a large library, but of very varying quality, especially in the visual department.Another downside is that it's hard to tell how realistic or how deeply simulated a given locomotive is. Some require quite a bit of study, others are hardly more than visual skins over a very simple simulation. Again, hard to tell the difference beforehand.And another problem I have encountered, is that even old, well known problems never get patched.So, my advice?If you like trains, and there's a sale going that will get you this game at -75% or so, by all means go for it. I did.But at full price? I'd stay away if I were you. There's better things you can do with your hard earned cash.			"

												Dear Dovetail Games,I purchased Train Simulator 2013 back in 2012, and have been watching the game's...growth...throughout the years. Here's a few suggestions:1) When you create a new version of a simulator, don't just change one texture and actually REMOVE features that people loved.2) Release bundles of trains for what you're currently charging a single train for. I know, this isn't a good business model, but having your game be known as DLC Simulator and having only a 66% (at time of writing) positive review rating really isn't a good one either.3) Maybe a good idea would be to just add some of these DLC trains into the base game. For example, instead of charging $45 for a game, then telling your customers to buy MORE TRAINS NOOOOOWWW... you could have an unlock-the-more-you-play system, and bring your company out of EA-like depths.Thank you for your time, and I sincerely hope you will make TS2017 not a huge pile of nothing like this one was.Sincerely,NickEDIT: I'm not sure about this, but I think that Dovetail also counts every train as DLC. So what this means is that you can't refund it.Very sneaky way to prevent a loss of money, Electronic Ar-I mean Rocksta-I mean Dovetail.ANOTHER EDIT: No, I haven't played the 2016 edition. I don't need to. It's the same game as last year but with less features. So I think my review would be actually further in the state of development, because they're removing features. LAST YEAR'S GAME WAS MORE ADVANCED THAN THIS! OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD			"

That is it i can't seem to find any other differance, the worlds and scenery look identical, and there are hundrads of bugs. To me it seems that they are tring to pump out hundrads of DLC's at a low quality to make a tune of money becuase they know people will pay for it, while they keep bug fixing at a low.

												Train Simulator 2014, a remake of Train Simulator 2013, which was just a remake of Train Simulator 2012. In fact nothing much has changed to this ‘simulator’ since the very first incarnation of it back in 2007. So what has it got to offer? For a start the graphics are brilliant, so you really can enjoy the scenery as you drive through it. Another plus would be the world editor, allowing users to create new routes and upload them to the steam workshop for free. That’s just as well because once you have got through the small amount of content that come with it the official DLC’s are extremely expensive and usually of low quality. Unfortunately there are major problems with this simulator; the train physics are unrealistic, AI trains powered by rockets (or so it seems), a very limited range of on train systems are simulated, with some trains not even having such simple things as DRA! The list goes on. I would urge anyone looking to purchase this simulator/game to think again, many other options are available.			"

First things first, the game has turned to a pile of poo. Say back in ts2012 it was awesome I loved the game then in ts2013 so much changed, then in ts2014 a little bit changed and there was a new sleek UI, then in ts2015 hardly anything changed, then in ts2016 pretty much nothing has changed. The game is just not fun anymore it just isn't. I remember back in 2012/2013/2014 this game was dope but after the 2014 update nothing happen. The 2014 update was the last good thing about train sim. TL;DR This game is for the rich. If you don't have a billion dollars to spend on very overpriced dlc then you might not have fun, and nowadays you get one game, and every year you get a patch to fix some bugs. Not an entirley new game like before...			"

												It’s really sad that the only fleshed out Train Simulator on PC these days is this poor excuse of a videogame.I won’t even speak much of the thousands of dollars’ worth of DLCs - some of which are little more than a badly made 3d model being sold for a full game price. There are plenty of other reviews that cover that.It started out fun. I enjoyed it enough to invest in some extra content (the route bundles are the least overpriced). Then I made the ""mistake"" of upgrading my computer.This game, which is called Train Simulator 2016 is almost unplayable on a 2016 computer, thanks to frequent crashes, consistently low framerates, ugly visuals, and FPS drops that are almost rhythmic with the movement and sound of the train. I tinkered with the settings, between highest and lowest. It made no difference.I emailed the developer. They replied after a massive delay, ""but it runs perfectly on our much weaker computer!"", and promptly closed the issue within days before I could get a chance to respond.I asked the community for advice. They tried to convince me that it was most unreasonable of me to expect this 2016 release to run on my 2016 computer. Or how my set-up is ""unbalanced"" or ""not good enough"" despite running every other game flawlessly. Some referred to their real-life experience of driving trains, and how that has made their opinions on computer hardware and software paramount. But credit where its due - most of their passive-aggressive sermons began with hello and ended with thank you.For people who have spent hundreds and thousands of dollars in this game, and are now unable to enjoy them, the dev's solution is to release a new game engine, which of course, will NOT support said hundreds and thousands worth of content. Meanwhile, they keep repackaging this broken software as a ""new release"" every year, and keep selling a thousand dollars more of DLCs, WITHOUT any warnings to buyers about the horrible expected performance, and without any commitment to give players their money's worth.If you are still living in the last century, you might love this. Everyone else, (and I wish I could suggest a better alternative) wait for the new game engine next year.			"

												I really tried to like this game.. I really did but:.....1.  All that really matters in this game is the speed indicator.  In order to do some of the missions you have to go a little bit faster than the speed limit (i.e. going 35.5 instead of just 35) in order to make it on time.  Problem is... if you go 36 you get penalized. With trains that have a lot of cars, the speed get very irregular. You may go 3 mph under the speed limit and all of a sudden in a matter of milliseconds be going 3 mph over the speed limit which results in penalties. Since the only thing that matters in this game is the speed limit indicator, it is such a shame that the people who developed... say the scenery wasted their time cuz you can't enjoy the scenery with your eyes literally GLUED to the speed limit indicator.2. I love steam trains... and they are still bugged from the 2013 version. 3. Saving your game is detrimental. I don't know if the developers didn't save the states of the junctions, but I have noticed that when I reload a saved game, the game bugs out and I can't get onto the correct track or other trains end up running into me, or light won't change because I am not where I am suppose to be.  They have a save game option for each scenerio, but it is a gamble if you use it.4. Expensive expansion packs. With as buggy as the game is, why would I want to pay more for expansions when the base game is buggy?It does have its good points, but the more I played this game, the more I realized that the suck sucks way more than the good points. Beautiful as this game is, I can't recommend this game to someone when everytime I install and try to play this game, I am reminded why I uninstalled it in the first place!			"

												Got this game pretty cheap a while back. It's nice that you get free updates from 2013 to 2014 etc. but there's not THAT much that changes. The DLC is very expensive and if you pirate the DLC it doesn't work either. (I don't have money to waste on virtual trains that should've been included in the base game).Feels half finished and there's not that much to do. Too much emphasis on DLC. I complained on their YouTube channel and they blocked me from commenting.Stay away.			"

												Train Simulator is - at least to me - the most realistic train simulator out there. The variety of the DLC's that you can buy allows you to play in the most known railways in the world. The controls are, for me pretty nice and realistic. But this game has flaws. Way too many flaws...Pros- Realistic train controls- Nicely modeled trains and environments- Huge variety of contentCons- The base game brings only a few scenarios and trains to drive- The DLC's, where you can bring more scenarios and trains, are often expensive- There's a huge flaw that makes the game crawl when it needs to load the scenario - not on the loading screen, but while you're driving- While loading the scenario, the games becomes almost inresponsive, so if you try to brake there's a huge chance that that's not going to happen- Some scenarios are almost impossible to achieve the 1000 points mark, the max you can get. For instance, with the Train Simulator: LGV: Marseille - Avignon Route Add-On DLC you have a scenario where you need to wait on a red signal before stopping in the last station, making you get a penalty due to arriving at the station late- This one is new for me There's a probability where after resuming a scenario, the save corrupts Proof- When, for any reason, the game crashes, it can lock your computer. In my case I have to disconnect the HDMI cable, connect it again, press CTRL + ALT + DELETE and open the Task Manager, press WINDOWS + TAB and set the Train Simulator window in another Desktop - otherwise I can't click on anything -, go to the Task Manager and close the Train Simulator there.ConclusionIf you like trains, and like simulators, then this might be the game for you - I don't know other train sims out there that can beat this one, to be honest -, but keep in mind that you'll probably need to spend a lot of money in DLC's, deal with freezes and crashes that the workaround is not acceptable - or play in windowed mode.

												Well, Iv'e had had this 'product' for a few months now, originally a gift for my 50th, it then updated to the current version, as I tried to get to grips with it I noticed lots of silly faults... Wrong speed markers or missing speed markers on routes (sherman hill being the worst), scenarios that simply didn't load (Isle of Mann). After repeatedly contacting the now dovetail manufacturer, all you ever get is some stock answer that they are aware of the issue, but never, I repeat never, do they actually fix the game. Surely there are rules to prevent any company selling a product that does not work, oh! of course there are, it's called trading standards. In any other walk of life if you have a faulty product you take it back and demand a working one - simple!!!Not being very computer savvy, I then bought the Steam version during the sale, got a few more DLC's whilst they were cheap, only to find the same old problems still existed. Look at all the reviews, mostly negative ones, they are all correct, there can be some enjoyment from this game/simulator, if only it worked. There's nothing worse than spending an hour of concentration, keeping to speed limits, folowing the instructions, trying to keep to time, only to hit a 30mph zone, at 29mph I might add, to suddenly see the 'speeding -6' repeating and all your efforts wasted as the speed allowed is actually 20mph. Surely the manufacturer 'tested' the product before releasing it. Apparantely not. The only way to get this sorted and have a game that fulfils it's expectations is if all the users banded together, created a petition and approached trading standards with a 'class action' against Dovetail to repair all the issues within the game and put it right once and for all. If half their efforts (Dovetail) went into fixing the game instead of trying to censor the 'true' comments of concerned users, who are simply trying to get a working product, then all would be well.I'm also sure Steam are well aware of all these issues, yet they too seem impervious to users concerns, surely they should stop selling the product as it clearly is defective and not fit for purpose, Oh!, perhaps they simply make too much money out of it to be bothered.I have an old copy of Trainz (2009) on disc bought for a couple of quid, does the job, loads of stuff to do, and it works...Don't waste your money until you see that the game is fixed and works.

												As you would expect from a game called train simulator, you drive trains. Each train available has interiors and exteriors that are spot on when compared to their real life counterparts. however many parts of the game simply fall flat...1. Even when doing sandbox/free runs, your choice of train is limited by what track and region you choose, so there is very little freedom there.2. In spite of being a simply more advanced update of an older game, many graphical shortcuts have been used, which affect the gameplay, pedestrians that board and leave the train are very undetailed, move stiffly and aren't interesting, even though the game lets you view them up close. The levels use a very small dome for a skybox and use all but the most basic of geometry for the landscapes, which really make playing the game for more than ten or twenty minutes a choreAll in all this simulator just simply isn't worth the price tag when compared to simulators released even 5 to 6 years ago.

												This game is a nightmare. So many issues that never seem to get resolved. Dovetail Games should be ashamed of themselves putting out software that in reality doesnt work.At the time of writing thousands of users cannot use this game because we cant get it to even load.Another warning is that DLC for this game is an absolute requirement or you run out of things to do with it very quickly. Dovetail Games DLC is very very expensive. Expect an investment of $1000 plus to have a game that has any variety.Overall dont buy this until its been out a year, it takes them that long to sort most things out. If you are buying after that, assume an outlay of at least 10 times its cost to get an interesting game			"

												I ve only tested the game on a free weekend but i have to say for its outdated graphics and very limited content in the base game i cannot recommend this game.Some of the trains are very detailed but you cannot be sure all of the dlc meet up same quality standards as some of them are created by a different company.I like the idea of a good train simulation game and maybe back in the days of its origin i could have recommended the game but as for todays standards i simply cant.However you should keep an eye on the Train Sim World which will be released in February 2017.You can get out of the train, check a lot of trainfunctions and even connect locomotives and carriages manually.Also the game is built on unreal engine and will feature multiplayer (which is not neccessary in my opinion but a neat addition)			"

												I know theres people geniuinely interested in trains and I know theres people that buy this just for thousands of dollars DLC meme.I- got this because it sounds fun to me, was I disappointed? Not a whole lot.Is it a good simulation/game? I wouldnt say so, no.I mean sure, the physics are whats most important in simulations, but aside from that, to me this is lacking alot until it could achieve and rise to what would be the best product in this niche market of simulators.First of all they should overhaul the sounds of the trains. Now Im not dedicated to listening to the sound of those gigantic diesel engines or the rather silent but soothing electric motors modern passenger trains often use, but I feel like the sounds are off, very off. Second would be improving the graphics as well as the performance, and I know these teams run on a rather slim budget most of the time so testing their game on a variety of hardware configurations might be difficult, then again, how do you explain dovetail buying out the license to FSX? Anyways.I wouldnt know how to properly judge this title really. It does have its right to existence and frankly I did enjoy the time I got to spend with it and being slightly overwhelmed by the powerful map editor. To me this is just missing one thing that would make the experience so much more worth it: Atmosphere, or immersion even... The sounds are weird and it doesnt present itself well, heck the passengers still consist out of like 32 polygons with a face slapped onto their flesh colored cubic head. If they manage to, at some point get this right and make it actually look good and make the whole world look more alive, I would absolutely recommend this to anyone, really this could be the ETS2 of trainsims. But for now, I sadly can't... unless you are very passionate about this. "

												So I have hesitated in getting into train sims for a while now. I have read reviews, and watched youtube videos. I read all of the complaints and the to-do about the expensive DLC. It made me not want to try this game because of all the negative reviews. The recent Steam sale gave me the opportunity to get into the game cheaply. Figured if it sucks, I lost the price of a pizza. Having played the game now let me add my 2 cents from the prospective of someone completely new to Train Simulator games. About the DLC pricing: I'll compare it to one of the most successful game franchise.. The Sims. Nobody complains about the Sims add on content, or Flight Sim X add on content or any other game that pops you for $20 bucks for an ""expansion"". I mean if you bought the Sims 3 game today at full retail price with all the expansions you are looking at $600. But by comparison look at how many ""stuff"" and ""expansions"" packs are available for this game compared to the Sims game... So of course it is going to cost more to get all the content. As far as the old graphics and bugs, I see it as DTG doing their best to keep the 6 year old content users have bought still compatible and therefore usable in the new version of the game. I think they should have split the games into each year and set out compatible DLC for each edition. You want the next generation graphics... gotta by the new game. (See EA's Sims, Sims 2, Sims 3, Sims 4 model) Nobody is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that their Living Large expansion pack for Sims 1 doesn't work on the Sims 4 game today. Yet Dovetail has tried to give their customers equity in the DLC they buy. They have tried to update the game without completely changing the game engine so that previous content can still work. Imagine how crappy Sims 4 would be if EA was still making it compatible with Sims 1 stuff. That being said, I caught the Steam sale and pulled the trigger on buying the game to try it. I have to say, it is not going to be for everyone. There is nothing shooting at you. There is nothing for you to shoot. You don't race anything... Except maybe the clock on a time schedule. It's a Train simulator... You drive trains. That's it. Its not the most exciting thing in the world. But then again neither is Flight Simulator in between take offs and landings. And even ETS2 and ATS can get boring in the long haul between pickup and delivery points.But the game does have a certain quality for those who like simulator games. Driving a big train in and out of yards is great fun. Operating a heavy coal train in the driving snow down a slippery slope is challenging. The workshop community has tons of free scenarios for you to run with your purchased DLC, giving this game an unbelievable amount of play time. I have played for 72 hours and have not even began my career mode yet. I have my favorite trains and my favorite kinds of routes and scenarios. But I have yet to really explore any of the UK, German, or Asian routes and trains yet. I've been running freight across North America, and have not gotten into passenger trains yet. 72 hours, and I have barely scratched the surface. I think I am getting my money's worth.If you are new to train Sims like me and just want to know what is a good place to start, I have a suggestion. Wait for a sale.. Then buy the TS2016 Steam edition. You get an extra route and more trains and content then with the base game. Then pickup the Aurora_Chicago route add on. This will give you a good mix of freight and passenger train scenarios to try. That's really all you need and should get at first. Try out the different types of scenarios, try out the different countries. Drive the different trains. Find out what interest you. Then target your DLC purchases around that. I went in thinking I would like the high speed European passenger trains, but I have fixated on the American freight trains so far. I have almost 70% of the DLC for North America now. That's quite a few pizzas, but I am happy with most of the DLC. Just like with the Sims stuff packs, sometimes you get something that leaves you feeling like there should be more to it for the money you just spent on this piece of DLC. But then there are plenty of others that are like getting 100% more game! So you need to try the different types of trains and activities to find out what you like. That is really the only way to get started with this game and the mountain of DLC. Hey if you want all $3000 worth of DLC for the game then go for it. But chances are 60% of it is not going to intrest you that much. Kind of like the Katie Perry expansion for Sims 3. What the hell do I want with a lollipop couch and a hot fudge futon?I know there are plenty of people on here and other sights that have been with this game since TS2009 and before. I can sympathize with their grief over all the yearly ""updates"" and roll out difficulties. I would be frustrated too if I was forced to upgrade a game that has been playing fine, and that I finally got all the bugs worked out of. Especially if I knew that the update would screw things up and introduce conflicts and errors and make my working game crash forcing me to start all over.  But they still play the game and that should tell you something. And the news is that Dovetail is not going to be ""upgrading"" TS2016. They are finally going to make their ""Sims 2"" version with TS2017. But Dovetail has promised to continue to support and produce DLC for TS2016 for the foreseeable future. So maybe not such a bad time to finally get into this game.As far as performance issues, I cannot be of much help. As a Computer Engineer, I am baffled by the number of people who believe meeting the MINIMUM system requirements means they will be able to run the game on high graphics settings. Understand this, as it pertains to any game: If your system just meets the listed minimum system requirements, this means the game will run but at the lowest graphic settings and everything turned off. That is why it is called the MINIMUM system requirements. I have not experienced any crashes nor drops in frame rate or rendering problems with this game. I run all games on maxed graphics settings and all options turned on. Why? Because I am well beyond the minimum system requirements with my gaming platform. I run all my games on both my PC and my gaming laptop, switching between the two weekly because I travel.

												As much as I'd like to recommend this game, I unfortunately cannot.  After getting it way back in 2011, with some of the DLC attached, I originally adored this game, being the railroad fan that I am.  But, after getting into the game for the first time in a few years, I now realize that this game has really gone downhill, from constant framerate issues, to the fact that the game cannot even run stable on a gaming computer.  And I will not even get started on the DLC issues for this game, or the issue that in order to get the new content for Train Simulator 2016, if you already had the game, you had to pretty much BUY IT AGAIN!  This game has quickly become quite a disgrace for those who love trains, and is ultimately a shadow of what it used to be.  Unless Dovetail gets their crap together, and decided to incorporate all of the DLC they put out for Ridiculous prices into the game, or lowered the prices to more reasonable amounts, I would wholeheartedly NOT recommend this game! I mean, seriously!? $5,000 for over 270 DLCS that don't even add that much into the game!? That's practically robbery!			"

												It's a halfway decent time but it is HILARIOUSLY overpriced.  I got the Holiday route/train for 3 bucks (given by a friend) and it was worth that... but apparently it retails for 19.99 USD.  I actually laughed when I read that.  For three dollars it's a magical and fun little minigame.  For 20 dollars?  I'd want someone's head along with my refund.  Then I read I would have to pay 40 USD just to get the base core of the game.No.  I get you're appealing to a niche market but.. no.  Also, marking this review ""Off Topic"" is slimy.  Don't do it.

												Asked them in support why they are selling the TS2017 special edition more expensive for existing players than for new players, just got the (probably canned) answer that they have a discount if you own parts of it already. Well, since I don't buy all DLC as fast as it comes out, I hadn't bought any of the items/routes in the special edition and the price I was given was higher than for new players.No logical explanation from Dovetail, no possibility to just buy the parts of the TS2017 content you're interested in as DLC at reduced prices (only full price options are given), just the usual payola stuff.Damn you, Dovetail Games. Will probably never buy Trainsim World either, just because of how you treat your faithful customers.			"

For a genre that is heavily graphics-based, this is a huge letdown.- The train models aren't that great either, and look dated.- While kudos for including some okay American assets with the game, the included selection as a whole is limited. This game is obviously a DLC driver, which is severely overpriced (to the tune of $20 for a single locomotive).- Suffers from intermittent framerate drops, even on decent hardware. Game will run at 70fps most of the time, and randomly dip down to 30fps.- The trackside camera (the one you're likely to use the most, other than the cab view maybe) is repetitive, unimaginative, and often puts you in weird places (like spawning inside of a hill, where you can't see anything).- The sounds are repetitive and poorly edited (some of the train horns clearly repeat loops, etc.). Plus, there seems to be a near lack of ambient sounds to try to enliven the already dull environments.- The environments as a whole feel dead, and are poorly decorated (everything looks too clean).- There are pop-in issues, and the draw distance is not that great (sometimes there's just nothing drawn on the horizon).- While tutorials getting you started driving are included, not everything is explained properly (in one scenario, for example, the train randomly keeps stopping with no explanation).- While driving a train in real life probably is difficult, I feel like there should be better options to ""control the difficulty"" (for example, assisting you in helping your train keep moving up a snowy mountain without stalling or slipping, as some of us just want to drive the train).- The main game interface is okay, but could be improved. Same for the OSD.- The DLC is mega expensive.There is just too much wrong or poorly done with this game for me to recommend it. If you really really like train simulators and this is on sale then you might want to give it a go, but otherwise leave it alone.			"

												No matter what mode I pick, when I click ""Go"" it just freezes. I have to CTRL - ALT - DELETE to end the program. The group is pretty much closed off in what wreaks of Dev's Drama, because of some poor choices and they don't even make it easy to get in touch with Tech Support. No emails, not messages nothing. I got it for £6 on deal, so no big issue for me. I guess I could wait for a patch or something. But no, I don't recommend it. At all. I wanted to crash some stuff but I didn't quite expect this kind of crashing.			"

												Train Simulator is a fun game if you enjoy trains and want to drive them. If you don't like trains or driving them, absolutely do not buy this game! No seriously, don't! Because otherwise it is probably the most boring game you have ever played, or will play. It looks great and all, but the routes are mainly German, English or American (because f*ck the rest of the world) and if you want to expand the number of available routs, than please take your wallet and empty it on the counter of the moneyloving ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s at Dovetail games. This game is literally a cheap basegame with a sh*tload of overpriced DLC. How overpriced? Well every new route or locomotive (yes, a single locomotive) usually costs around 15 bucks or even more. So unless you're a millionair or such a railway fanatic that you want to spend all your hard earned cash on this money hungry sons of b*tches, don't buy this game!			"

												Simulator?  Hardly!  Do not buy this product if you expect it to be very much like running an actual train,  I have run both freight trains and passenger trains and I can assure you that there is so much more that could be added to this game to make it a really great simulator.  I could type up a complete list of items that need to be rectified and/or added but I have better things to be doing.  A short list would be little details like the whistle posts on the CP Mountain Sub are diamond shape, not square.  Approach signals are usually staggered and display proper sequences, for example: not clear to slow then medium to stop.  Train braking physics are way off as well.  Do not pay full price for this game, wait for it to go on sale first.  @Steam, if you read this, I am very sure there are some experienced Locomotive Engineers that are using Train Simulator that would be more than happy to give you input for improvements, I know I would offer advice.

												Everything that is wrong with selling gamesoftware nowadays comes together in this piece of turd.Every year the consumer is told this is a new release, but its just the old version with a new year added to it. If you are unlucky you could even have bought the same route twice. The store features a touched up pre-rendered video and 5k screenshots to hide the fact that the game-engine is a stuttering trainwreck from at least 6 years old. Even on a high-end rig it will never look and play that way. Steam should not allow this kind of marketing tricks. Just scrolled through 'PRE-RELEASE' reviews for a game from 2009, don't make me laugh.Yes i have 240.8 hours on record, but thats from way back in 2011 when i was hopeful it would improve somewhat.STAY CLEAR!!!

												With great disappointment, I'm not able to leave a positive review.I love trains, and I love simulators -- what could be better than a combination of the two? There was a time when I believed this game would be. Don't make the same mistake as me. I sometimes find myself playing this just to make myself feel better about how much money I wasted on it.To put it in perspective, I was able to use Microsoft Flight Simulator X to practice advanced topics for my real life pilots license, the base FSX software came with almost every airport in the world and a wide range of aircraft. In contrast, this GAME, by itself comes with virtually no content, the content it does come with is mediocre at best, and the realism level is severely lacklustre. Sadly, I've been foolish enough to spend more on this than on FSX, hoping it would eventually come remotely close in terms of delivering.If you want to experience any variety in locomotives or scenery, you will have no choice but to purchase DLC. In my experience, the DLC is often as bare-bones as the base game and usually buggier, though seldomly priced less than entire full featured games. If my understanding is correct, you can't get additional skins for a locomotive, you have to pay full DLC price for each skin you want. If your interest is in observing the spectacular outcome of a high speed derailment without all the loss of life, don't waste your time. As soon as the train derails the ""simulation"" ends and you're presented with a menu. Also, when you switch between front and back of the train cameras, the angle stays the same so you have to re-adjust every time you switch cameras.You get an upgrade every year but I seldom find any observable improvement. If its possible to get any closer to a piece of software that performs zero function at all with the exception of allowing you the option to buy more of their software, Im sure it will be the only ""improvement"" in the 2015 edition. I'm convinced they really just change the name to something containing the current year so they can create the illusion that the game is new and justify charging exorbitant prices.I honestly mean to be constructive because I wish the devs would take advantage of the game's potential. I will say that the graphics are pretty decent. Par for the era. If noticable improvements in realism were made, and content prices were more realistic and reasonable -- combined with a dramatic change in how the company treats the customers (ie. fixing problems instead of covering complaints up, not charging sucker prices for questionable professionalism) the game could definitely have a future, but based on the current state of the above, I have to say 3/10.

												Where to start!,if you thought EA was bad then this company and game makes them look good. For starters the game is so unpredictable, one minute the game is fine the next it is suffering random crashes. The amount of bugs and glitches in the game, you would think that you was playing a very early alpha release. The company prides itself on been the best Train SImulator, which is not true in some respects but there is not much competition out there to rival the fact.As you start to play the game its fairly good and has a fresh approach to the genre, although as you start to immerse yourself into the game and the community things start to change. This is a game which is very moddable, where users can create things and share there creations with the community. But there seems to be a trend where every modder wants to charge you for there work. Unlike Skyrim, GTA iv etc where the user content is varied and free, in this game you will find a lot of greed where people only do it to get money. So it is a very money orientated game. Even the freeware site that provides free content is subscription based, although you can download for free if you  want to wait an hour in a que.It is this greed factor that contributes to the feeling of contempt every time you start the game, immediately faced with promotions to buy overpriced DLC that has bugs or does not work. You will also in time have to contact support as this is inevitable, everyone I have spoke to has done this. And you get an automated response, one of which outlines how there not that bothered.If you are planning on doing some freeware projects for this game like I have done in the past, I would advice against it. As you will be faced with a barage of hate from a majority of the community. In short the game is just bad in game as well as out of it. The only major freeware project was the ecml, and the creator was abused on so many levels. So there idea of creating content was for me a big no, and one of the reasons why I stopped developing.This is one game you should avoid at all costs, not only for your sanity but also for your wallet. If Steam has any credibility in protecting it's customers then it would be in there best interest to remove this game from there store.Overall has potential, but the greed,bad customer service, bugs and glitches and a majority of the community let's it down.As a side note to show you what you can get for the same price as there DLC's including 3rd party DLC'S ( comparisons current from date of this review ):A second hand Rolex WatchLG 60"" HD TV + XBOX One + Playstation 4Top of the range Alienware Desktop Pc150+ Full priced Steam Gamesand if your a train fan, 6 Luxury Train Holidays in the UK.Quick Edit: This company have changed there name to Dovetail and have appointed a new executive from EA, says it all really. And to top things off this company have tried to hide negative comments by marking them as ' off topic '. Shows how much they do not want you to hear the negative side of things. Every game gets negatives but thats part and parcel of games, but i have not seen other companys trying to ignore customer feedback on Steam as much as these.			"

												Unless you LOVE trains, like, REALLY REALLY love them, don't waste your money. You basically have to buy each scenario which is 20$+ for EACH one. The game is pretty much accelerating and braking so you don't derail and the objectives are start and stop here. I know its a train simulator, so what do you expect? I was just surpised that to actual play the scenarios you have to spend way more money than they're actually worth. I got the christmas scenario on sale for 3$ (pretty much for the trading cards).

												I have played this game for over 800+ hours since 2010, but I can not reccomend it. I have a computer that can handle any game at maximum stettings, but this game will bring it to it's knees because of bad design. There is too much focus on DLC wich may not sound like a problem, but the pricing for the DLC makes it seem like RSC is  more focused on the profits than the experience of the game. There are a lot of areas of the game that can be improved. It seems like they are only putting a new user interface on the same game every year and calling it new. With the amout of money they charge for DLC one would think that they could afford to overhaul the game and give it a fresh start instead of a fresh new menu every year. I think the DLC should be half of the price they want to chrge for it. Yes, I realize that there is work that goes into each piece of DLC. I also know how much work goes into creating a route. I have attempted to create a route myself and it is a difficult task because of all of the objects that need to be placed.			"

												As an American railfan I love the American locos on this simulator. But the DLC is way, way overpriced, mostly full of bugs, annoying little things like non-functioning headlights on 2 of the 6 UP Heritage locos that still haven't been fixed after purchasing the DLC months ago. You charge tons of money for DLC, at the very least it should be properly detailed, work right, and have available tech support. It's a neat simulator, but it's too expensive for the problems, and not worth the money.			"

												I've been considering Train Simulator for a while now. Up until now, the main reason I didn't get it, was the price. However, during Steam's recent autumn sale, the christmas DLC was 80% off, and since it didn't need the (expensive) core game to play, I decided this was my chance to try it out and see for myself how I like it.Well, the game itself could be fun for a while, but my overall experience wasn't all on the positive side. While the game doesn't seem too complicated, the interface isn't very comfortable, to say the least. It took me a while just to figure out where exactly I'm supposed to stop to complete a scenario. You'd think it should be really simple, right? Well, so would I. At first I thought that maybe I was just being stupid and impatient, so I gave it some time and soon enough I figured it out. Regardless, I was feeling a little cheated, sort of like ""Okay, I got it, I completed the scenario, but what now? Is that supposed to be it? Where's the fun!?"".Still not being sure whether I should give this little game more time or not, I figured I'd go read reviews on Steam, see what other people think, and then I encountered the reason for my decision not to get the game. It seems like the moderators the developers assigned to moderate the reviews to their game are quite the dictators. Watch how they mark this review as ""off-topic"", just like they did with the other negative reviews this game received. While those reviews described flaws and drawbacks regarding the game, they were fair, to the point and as on-topic as you can get. It seems like the developers of this game would go quite far to hide any negative criticism, justified as it may be. If this is how it works, it makes me wonder - what are they so worried about? What are they working so hard to hide from everyone? I don't know about you, but if I ever find out, I promise you - it won't be by playing the game itself. Those guys are not getting any of my money. Not only because I have doubts about the game (and I do still have doubts), but mainly because I feel I'm being manipulated and left in the dark.In conclusion, while I'm still not completely sure about the game itself, the attitude of the developers made me decide to stay away from this game, and I suggest to you to stay away as well.

												This is a game that could have been so good, a game that really should have been so good. And I really wanted to love it, I tried as hard as I could to ignore the negative reviews and the harsh criticism in the forum. Unfortunately they all proved to be true.There are plenty of bugs and the graphics are outdated. Instead of fixing existing bugs, they keep producing more overpriced DLC, with even more bugs that most likely won't be fixed. And a game this CPU, RAM and GPU intensive that isn't 64bit in 2014 is almost embarassing. My new high end computer can barely handle some DLC, due to the fact that the game can't use the resources available.The worst part however is not the bugs or that the game isn't updated to make use of newer and better technology, the worst part is the developer's apparent lack of will to fix the problems and their awkward and sometimes outright negative attitude towards the community. A community with such a love for the game; or rather for what the game could have been. A community increasingly frustrated with the lack of support from the developer.Do I regret buying it? No, not really. Would I reccommend it? No, I can't.Call it stupid, call it naïve, but I really want to believe that there is a brighter future for this game. I really want to believe that this game one day will become what it has potential to be. Right now however, even though there is talk about them working with a new game engine for next year's release, nothing indicates that that will come true.Though I sincerely hope that I will have to rewrite this review one day.

I have to agree with a lot of other people on here saying the DLC's are way overpriced. Some are the same price as the game itself. Wow, really?

												I have payed this game every day since I got it, almost logging in more hours than I should, but this game has been worth it....or has it? I got this game for me and my father to play together since we have been rail fans for years. Ever since I can remember. My passion was HO models while his was G-scale. Anyways, when I got this game i was expecting....more. I dont like the simplicity of the free roam, how it has only one set map (even after I got two others) and creating (truly) can be fun to some, but sadly I'm to busy to spend days on end just making a map. I live in Garden Grove California, not far from the actual Pacific Surfliner, heck I see that thing almost daily on the Amtrak/Metrolink line. Anyways, the point I'm trying to get across is ""Why is there only one map and one set of trains allowed in Free Roam?"" I'm a HUGE fan of steam trains, my personal favorite is the UPBB 4-8-8-4. I even got to see the 4014 (Soon to be the only running one of its kind) and I was amazed. Now to drive that thing down the Surfliner track in free roam would be amazing! But... the downside is....I can't. Why? well, i believe the developers made it abit more...realistic in the sense of that most of the tracks in the game are all urban areas, not freight or rural areas like the Pass. I can kinda see the point there. But seriously. I wanna just.....PLAY! Not have a task list. Being able to go from San Diego to LA without having to worry about other trains and scenario finishers. I wanna be able to control where my train goes. The pass is fun, sure, but there's such long distances between most of the switch tracks that you hafta choose right at the beginning by checking your map (again, the Pass is a rural area through the mountains so cant really B**ch) and the closest thing TO a quick drive free roam is the Holiday Express. You can control the track at least in there....but still, the map is so tiny....nothing really to do there.. You cant go anywhere cause of the lack of FREE ROAM! Seriously....The word FREE is in it.... 0.0 Shouldn't there be more? Unless this is a ploy to make us waste our money away on nothing but scenarios and trains and no GOOD free roam maps.... Anyways. I still wanna see the rest of the maps. I haven't even been able to see that skew off on London-Faversham. There's a whole lengthy track I've never seen! that probably no one has ever seen. Why? Cause there's no Free Roam for it. Only A-B.... Anyways, I've rambles your ears off and you're probably tired of reading. Just asking for a lot more for the money I've put into the game for me and my dad to enjoy a game where you can only do 2 things.... (The standard game + 6 DLCs: 4 trains and 2 maps).(Update as of May 06, 2015):    Is it just me or are the prices going UP for the DLC of this game? I'm looking around and they are STILL ridiculously over priced. Yet I do see something....strange.  Or o it just me. Some of the DLC are saying: You do NOT need Train Simulator 2015 to play this game. Now to me that's just plain weird... Are you telling me that your so-called ADD-ONS are also STAND ALONE GAMES? Dafuq is the use of that? Hmmmm. Dovetail...have you ever thought of, oh I dunno... reducing the price of your DLCs to below $20 USD period and maybe...just MAYBE you'd get more people to buy yo sh*t?    I....really don't think so considering the developers of this game either 'hide' the negative reviews or just plain ignore them. I dunno what kind of company they are, but they are doing a bad job promoting such an unbelievable amazing game. I bet if their DLCs were cheaper and not trying to be sold as Stand-Alone content, a lot more people may find this game more enjoyable and want to play more of it and, oh I dunno... SPEND MORE MONEY MAYBE! TAKE THE HINT! It also may hafta do with them being British...or not from the US....Dunno. Just a theory...			"

												Ok let me start with this - If you're in the UK do NOT purchase Train Simulator through Steam. Purchase it through Amazon UK downloads instead as its far cheaper (I payed 75% less), Amazon will give you a redemption code to use on Steam.Now onto the game itself, it's an incredible train simulation game - there's no doubt about it. Everything about the simulation is great! Sure, I would like to have a few more features such as train announcements and lifelike NPCs - but the game is still enjoyable. Also the Steam Workshop is a fantastic feature for this game.So why the 'Not Recommend'?Well first, the DLC. There is WAY too much of it and the prices are ridiculous (for some). Now the extra routes are justifiable for £10-20, but over £20 and you're getting ripped off. Then we have the trains which you can unlock, they're priced stupidly. There should be no train DLC over £10 AT ALL! Yet there is, and there is loads of it. Half of these trains should've come included with the base game yet they didn't. So yeah, the DLC is a rip off.Maybe the DLC could be justifiable for a game that has no performance problems, and that brings me to my second point - performance. If this game worked flawlessly then maybe I could justify the DLC but it DOESN'T! In fact, this is one of the worst performing games I've ever had. I have a GTX 970. i7 Quad and 16GB RAM. This game should run at easily 60fps on high settings - does it? NOPE! What about 50fps? NOPE! 45fps? NOPE! 44fps, that's the most stable it can run on this PC. So you're probably thinking, ""Why doesn't he just turn the settings down?"" I did - did it change anything? NOPE! And this isn't the worst part, constantly there are frame rate dips to 10fps, these are happening almost every 30 seconds, pretty much making the game impossible to play! Is there a fix to this? NOPE! There are countless amounts of forums with people with the same issues, nobody can fix it. It's literally impossible.Dovetail haven't even addressed these issues, they are literally ignoring their fanbase. This is totally unacceptable. These issues have been happening since 2013! 2013! That's 4 years! 4 years and what have Dovetail Games done? Shoved a load of DLC in your face which - surprise surprise - ISN'T OPTIMISED EITHER!I just can't recommend this game for those reasons, even though this game is a perfect simulation game. All I can say is Dovetail Games, you've really let me down...			"

												Not sure if my hours will show up in the corner of this, but I have logged what seems to be a very impressive 973.4 hours since purchasing TS2013 back in July. While I do run a below bottom end computer, the game initially lived up all my hopes and dreams despite the horrific framerate (which after disabling TSX and dropping many other graphical settings usually hovers between 14-15, occasionally going higher to 24 or more, which is good enough for me). Though I quickly lost interest in route building after realizing how time consuming it was.Well my opinion of the game has been changing since then and I feel like I also need to share what I think of the game noow and add to the growing list of negative reviews despite this being my first review ever and my sloppy writing style.While I don't hate the game, I've become disappointed to the point I no longer recommend it to anyone or scramble for the DLC.One of my biggest issues isn't the pricing (not saying I don't have issues about it), it's the quality. The routes tend to be very good in my opinion despite the lack of TSX and reduced density in my case, but the same isn't as true with the locomotives and that was the first thing that made me start thinking ""Is this really the game I wanted for over two years?""While driving around on Sherman Hill I noticed the sounds, specifically the horns, weren't consistent enough. One locomotive would have a loud horn, but another may have a horn that was dramatically lower in volume. Vastly different bell sounds and quality also disappointing, like the Challenger having such a bell that sounds much too high pitched. Lights are another common disappointment. The variation in all the different styles quickly becomes an eyesore when you start mixing and matching units. Especially with the new headlight glare from the upgraded locomotives (though it does look awesome). The Cab Forward takes the lighting issue to another level with not even having the textures for one of the marker lamps in the correct locations.The best example of lack of quality in my mind is the A4 pack. While the driving programming is decent, the unrealistically quiet whistles kills much of the fun of driving them. Then there's Dominion of Canada. I was highly disappointed that not only did the sound not match the whistle's appearance, but also the bell didn't function (though I recognize that bells aren't usually needed in the UK).Graphics and sound aside, you then come to functionality. While all the basic functions are simulated, how well they are simulated varies. The brakes aren't realistic across all locomotives (though the Marias units are well simulated with their dynamic braking). I'm told that independent brakes are the best for stopping locomotives running light, but I have yet to see independent braking make a difference at all, in fact I wrecked on my first scenario because of it. Then there's throttle operation on some diesel locomotives where the amps instantly jump to one point and the rpms slowly catch up, I would only find this realistic when reducing power not increasing power. I've discovered that the operation of certain features aren't consistent inside and outside of the locomotive, such as the case of the road locomotive included with Marias Pass where all wipers are moving outside the locomotive, but one of the wipers isn't moving on the inside. My latest disappointment is also my biggest, how Railsimulator treats its community, trying to keep the bugs in the dark to the point where reviews are targeted. If a company is taking extreme measures to try keeping bugs and glitches in the dark instead of fixing them, then their products aren't worth buying regardless of price.Until they stop trying to censor and start fixing bugs and issuing the patches free of charge (for everything and I don't mean introducing another version you have to pay for just to get one problem fixed), I don't recommend you invest in this game. No company should ever treat their community like this and expect to get away with it. If they straighten up their act and start fixing this game like the community wants, then I will start recommending this game again and with much more effort than I ever did.			"

												This games DLC is worth more than my whole steam library!This game also suffers from a huge learning curve, with such little provided via tutorials.i couldnt even figure out how to get a train to move from a stopped position.The visuals are terrible, even maxxed out this game looks like something off of the playstation.i was expecting great performance with my current setup, and at some points the frame rate would just randomly crash and be nearly unplayable.seeing as there are very few games in this market its said to see that this potential was wasted and thrown behind a paywall.I havent been so frastrated with game controls since arma 2.3/10. just hope someone else decides to make a new train game soonA key here would be to optimize the game and add an in depth tutorial so that newer people can figure the game out and have fun.

												Horrible physics not realistic at all.  If you practice on this sim and go to real life you will brerak a knuckle in a half a second.  The air brakes release WAY too fast not to mention the whole braking system is made up and not true to life.  If you are 8 years old get it.  If you like trains and want to drive trains like how it is in the real world, there are better options.  Also, much of the scenery is missing I will odten find my train floating above the ground.  Plus most of the things they release now are very buggy and have little rolling stock.New name !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!It's now called DLC the game with a free physics engine that is from Minesweeper!

												I have a super high end computer and even still this poorly designed game does not run smoothly. Everything else I have does though. Strange. Another thing is all the completely ridiculous DLC. You basically get crap with the game and all the good stuff will cost you an arm and a leg. I mean...$20 for a locomotive and you still have to spend another $10 on the scrienario just to be able to use the darn thing? Really? Whos ridiculous idea was this? Its no question almost all the DLC is always ""on sale"" because no one is buying it. They failed with this game. ITS ONE BIG FAIL.			"

												Great game but the DLC is TOO expensive. I'm pleading to the Devs to sort this out as I'd happily buy up a lot of DLC if some of the DLC wasn't as expensive as a game. I realise the sales are a good time to buy but I don't want to have to wait for a sale. Devs, READ the reviews as i'm just repeating the voice of thousands more that have said the same thing.  I reccomend this game if you're happy with the current content but be ready to fork out for the DLC.EDIT: Devs I'm now BEGGING you to sort this pricing out. You're literally killing off this sort of sim because now people just associate this game with having close to £3k worth of DLC which is INSANE. I'd even be interested in seeing combined packs which make better value for money. Devs take your heads out of the sand and sort this out please.			"

												Seeing how I am train traffic controller in real life, I wouldn't even dare calling this a simulator, there is nothing in this game that needs simulating. Granted, the engines look nice and some are graphically well recreated, some major functionality is lacking in this game which I find totally immersive-ruining and plain unrealistic, switches being the most fundamentally important thing to give direction on a track, and they don't work as expected at all.Also the business model this company has seems to be focused on getting a release out each year with doing minor improvements on a way too dated game engine, while only adding new locomotives. The sprites and scenery are years old.My tabletop railroad is even more realistic than this.			"

												So, as a lover of Train simulator from Microsoft; I went ahead and purchased this game....well I can't really say that it is a bad purchase, but it is not a good one either.It is true that I didn't play 100 hours or so; but if I was able to spot the issues after few hours, either I am really attentive (maybe because I used to work as QA?), or for most, these issues are not really issues that can be considered a deal breaker.As is, the game is worth probably not more than 10-15 USD.Let's clarify more in details, so you can have an idea.Overall the menu is clean; the options thou are quite confusing, so it will take you a bit to understand how can you make a new route or check which add-on you have. there is a quick drive option, which will be useful to give you an idea of the game, and also some tutorials that explains you the controls.All right IF you can survive the hate against the in game purchase screen....the game won't leave you be if you change train or track in the free roaming mode, pushing you to buy more.The graphic is OK; overall it feels like a bit antiquated at times, but it is clean and overall does its job. There are some issues with the textures, where they flicker (especially if you are on maps that has water; you can see flickering where the water meets the land, but there are various instances all over the game); but overall the game is not showing tremendous corruption.The train itself are made quite nicely; lots of details on the outside; inside they are so-so, with some good textures but overall very simplicistic and not super detailed. Considering that they are the main point of the game, I would expect something similar to other products in the simulation realm  (like airplane or car simulators; just to mention few...this is a simulator after all, so it has to be compared to other sims).The object on the side of the route are many and well done; not super but they do their good immersion job.The arrangement of the objects and scenery thou may vary from map to map...some are quite stunning, with light effects and awesome arrangement; while others (like the mountain maps with snow), are so dull and bland.Also you can see in the distance the issue with object placements, where tree just disappear, and you see basically the area that goes from tree populated, to bald.The human 3d models are quite atrocious: their animations are approximate, there is very little variation among the meshes and textures, and also the collision and AI is quite disappointing....at times they just go for a spin, walking around the same spot like a dog running behind its tail. This is more evident if you just sit in a station and set the external camera. After a bit they just go trough scenery items, or start to act totally weird.The cars are OK; after all you don't have to have many different ones, since you rarely see them, but at the crossing they are there, and you can see that the variation is limited to 2-3 types. Also their collision with the ground is uneven...in some maps you see them sinking in the ground plane....The engine seems to work decently, but using high speed trains, you can see the framerate getting choppy (2x8 core processors, Radeon 5870, which is able to run more demanding games with impeccable performances); it feels like the engine is not that optimized, or maybe is based on old technology (I didn't follow the whole story of the company honestly, I just know that they are around since quite some time). At times feels like an indie game made with these free SDK like Unity or UDK, instead than a dedicated engine (nothing wrong with indie SDK; but you need to know your limitations).But I can live with these issues in the end, altho the main problems are on the central gameplay itself.You are basically a conductor (engineer), and the main point is the career, where you go trough scenery after scenery, which has different tracks and trains, and get rated based on your performace on 3 categories : - comfort of passengers (basically how good you are with accelerating and breaking)- Speed limits compliance- time table complianceThe idea is fabulous; but the implementation is full of issues.I tried few scenarios, and there is an underlying problem with speed: there is a screen that show you where the speed limits are, so you can act accordingly and set the train to the right speed. Once you pass the limit by 1 MPH, you get the alert of speeding and you start to loose points.This is where the issues start.The first problem is that the limit does not allow you any kind of room to fail....either you time perfectly your brake and acceleration, or you start to slow down too early, which makes you loose time (which reflects on the time table compliance; since the schedule is quite tight ). No room for errors, which is unrealistic (isn't this a sim?)Any person that drive a train knows, that you are allowed to exceed the limits to stay on schedule, by a certain percentage; while here the developers decided to set it to 1 MPH. Now the justification is ""it is to make it harder and more realistic""; while the truth is that is easier to just set things in this way, instead than work around a flexible way to allow speeding; and give different kind of penalty to players.The second issue is due to the incorrect sync of the speed limit between the map and the main view. You are nicely riding, look at the map, see the signal and prepare to slow down...and then out of the blue, the limit change and you find yourself speeding when you are few miles away from the signal.This happened to me almost in any scenario that I tried so far; basically the map that you see on your display, is not synced with the track, giving you incorrect data. Playing like that is like to drive a submarine with an elementary school map not in scale.You will loose a ton of points, get frustrated and overall, end up not enjoying the game.In one instance; I had a limit of something like 225 KPH, I was at 190 KPH, then at one point, while approaching a station (after playing for 30 minutes or so); the limit changed out of the blue, and the train engaged the emergency alarm. I ended up being stopped in a tunnel, 2 miles away from the station, and no chance to have the train to restart (the alarm was on; even after resetting the alarm, it would not allow me to move the train no matter what). I had to restart the mission and throw a couple of things from my desk on the wall, for the frustration. Nobody mentioned that you need to put in neutral, then pull the brake control all the way back, then start again...not even the manual.Then let's talk about the content itself: the base game is limited to few tracks; so if you want a career, you need to buy DLC (20-40 USD a pop). Which is absurd, after spending money for the main game. Imagine Final fantasy where after the first mission ask you to go buy the DLC to continue the game.Last disappointment: the editor for the various scenarios and tracks; I was not able to even use it. The camera was stuck under the floor.Overall, I give this game a 5 out of 10; avoid at full price; may be worth at discounted price. I doubt that they listen to their customers, and this show already from how their site is organized: the king is DLC and screenshots, while there is no forum, no FAQ, no support area, other than an email. You know how a company works when you see at how they setup their site.You may enjoy it for an occasional train ride (maybe for your little ones), but as simulator this game is insufficient on many aspects.

												Train Simulator 2014 is the first game ever that made me test the [sadly non existent] Steam refund policy. I still can't believe I spent over $50 on this totally crappy game. I played it for barely 3 hours before I realized I will never want to play this game again and uninstalled it.The base game has very little content out of the box and DLCs cost so much I thought it was some sort of a glitch with Steam at first, then reading the forums I realized it is how the routes and train model are priced. I still can't believe they are seriously trying to charge $20-$40 for a route or train model.The game comes with no tutorials to speak of. There are supposed to be tutorials in the game and they do appear in the list of in game tutorials but trying to run them gives some cryptic error. I had to dig through the forums to figure out that these tutorials are leftovers from previous versions of the game and require some DLC (which of course, I will never buy).The game crashes too often. By today's standards, It doesn't look all that great graphically. The User Interface feels like it was designed by a fresh year student as a home project. There isn't much content and overall, the game is pretty boring.Maybe total die hard train simulator fans have no choice but to buy this game but for anyone like me, who just wanted to play with trains, this game isn't worth it.

												Are you sitting comfortably - then I'll begin.Once upon a time back in September 2007 Kuju and Railsimulator.com made their introduction to the scene of Rail Simulators, and at that time, both Microsoft and Trainz had, or were in the process of, folding.At this time, Railsimulator.com, driven by Messers Siddell and Lucas, were a very approachable company, and quite frankly, they lifted up this game 100% in the first 4-5 years.Then, in marched Mr Jackson, an ex Manager from EA and also a supposed Railfan. Alarm bells rang with me then, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt, and I persisted with this game through to 2015, even though the company, by now called Dovetail, had effectively closed off any sort of communication with themselves, were selling, selling, selling - but made no visible effort to correct any of the major bugs now being sold to us.As someone else here said, while it can satisfy the rail fans wish of driving a train (at least virtually), it doesn't do it very well. A plethora of never to be fixed bugs, a greedy development team and addons which are overpriced, fluctuate in quality and usually have some part (such as sounds) either recycled from older addons or completely inaccurate. I've played this game for about 8 years now and while it looks visually like its improved, its actually gotten worse. The only thing that saves this game is the third party developers that create far better addons as well as offer better service, especially Thompson.So if you buy this, please bear these points in mind, and make your own mind up about the truth of it all. I will be buying this for myself, but am pretty sure this will be the final year, unless they pull their socks up, and realise that any successful company ALSO needs Customer Support.ADDENDUMJust found out the reason for all the hype whilst not telling us too much - that is because it will cost UK users £99.99!! ($150, or 120euros approx!!) This means I am gone, as no way I'm going to fork that out in one lump, and going by recent Twitch reveiws, what do you get for it - Stevens Pass (which I actually wanted), a China Clay pit and an ""olden times"" Dawlish Riviera - otherwise the game is the same as we have already. For that price, I would want a real engine to drive. :)			"

												Played Euro Truck Simulator? Great isn't it? Made by a reputable company renowned for rewarding its loyal fanbase with superbly crafted, highly polished games. And all delivered at reasonable prices too.Now meet Train Simulator. There's literally pages of diatribe I could write about this game, but I really can't be bothered. So let me break it down into a few sentences - The developers of this game have a monopoly on the Train Simulator market and they're ripping off train enthusiasts with this dreadfully under-produced and overpriced game.Train Simulator is a joke. It really should be better when you think of how many enthusiasts are out there and how much money has been poured into this. Dovetail Games are a joke. Hopefully a quality Developer like SCS Software will see an opportunity and release their own version.Considering how popular they've managed to make a truck simulator, they'd make a killing on a train simulator.

												When this game was released in 2009 under the name ""Railworks"", it wasn't too bad and was a lot better than the Microsoft Train Simulator that it was based off.Fast forward to late 2015, and it appears the only thing being taken for a ride in this game now is me. For a start (at the time of writing) the DLC is priced at a whopping £3,295.56. Yes, that’s not a typo - 3 ♥♥♥♥ING grand. Couple this with the constant bombardment of adverts in every menu and loading screen, and a lot of things that I used to have in the game I purchased now paid-for DLC for whatever reason, I'm less than impressed.The game has turned into a cash cow, and makes the DLC and season pass nonsense in other games look almost tolerable.

												It's really hard to recommend this game. I've played it for several hours learning how to drive those trains, and found out how buggy this game can be.First of all - I like simulations. I already own Truck Simulator and have had my fun with it. Train simulator is great deal different, but i still like the idea of driving these heavy machines. I also have patience to learn through trial and error, so with this in mind:- A loco, having towed 20 cars doesn't have wheel slip, then all of a sudden, while towing 10 of them it HAS ENORMOUS wheel slip, so you have to apply ony 20-25% power and accelerate to 80kph, can't apply more power or wheel slip at e.g. 40kph. What's the deal with that? Sunny day, by the way.- You know how side track view (the one at the bottom) shows speed limits, then all of a sudden one of them grows just in front of my train, there's no way I could have slowed down as not to cause my train to enter emergency-brake mode or incur a penalty.- Red lights ocassionally show up right after a 90 degree turn with no indication beforehand. This is in one of these scenarios with intermodal train, Hamburg - Hanover route, fourth difficulty level.Game loading speed is abysmal. My kettle boils water faster. I have decent PC, mind you, games are on 4x2TB Raid drive. Should be fast, right? Other games load fast. Lots of texture flickering on screen. Game looks like it had no anti-alias at all. And in 1080p resolution. Truck simulator has an option which can increase detail at distance if you had enough power. Here said distance is minimal, try changing FOV in order to observe distant train - it sometimes even appears half-way under ground, which is funny.... not. And what the heck is it with all these route or loco DLCs carrying whole game price tag... I mean you can have fun with only these 3 routes provided... but not for long.Anyway, wasted potential, for a simulator. The fact that I have bought it at Christmas Sale price saves it a bit though.			"

												TS has been the best actual simulator of railroads, but has offered numerous frustrations which I've tolerated. But upon hearing the release plans for TS2017+, I am depressed that it is no longer a viable use of my time and I have wasted hundreds of dollars for years for nothing.I'm extremely disappointed in:- the yearly releases that don't add or fix anything for existing players, without requiring those players to fork over extra money for new routes- the astoundingly overpriced DLC which has many bugs- the extraordinary lag even on new computers with dedicated GPUs (you can disable lighting but that actually ruins nighttime visibility on some routes and actively removes scenery from others, making them as useless as wireframe)But most of all, I'm disappointed that every bit of content I bought is now worthless in the ""World Edition"" which we're being asked to buy. How do the developers expect me to keep gigs upon gigs of binaries & content which I can only play in my old version, and get a new edition comprising gigs upon gigs which I can only play separately? This demonstrates the utter lack of support for existing users of this product: the team has stated they're completely uninterested in backwards compatibility AND even in rebuilding prior routes -- such as, say, Northeast Corridor -- for the new edition. And if they ever DID rebuild a route for ""World Edition"" you can guarantee it'd cost you tons of money to re-obtain it.New gamers beware: I can't recommend buying 2017 because you'll have to keep it as a separate game and have to install a future edition that won't play any of the routes you received (or ANYTHING else currently available for sale - look it up, it's true).Existing gamers, which are bread-and-butter for competitor developers like Auran, already know that this team's behavior is pathetic. This is just the nail in the coffin.			"

												You probably already know if this game is for you.  If you are wondering, it probably isn't.  It sounds like it could be fun to drive trains around, but the scenarios are extremely specific and leave little to no room for error.  I just played a 45 minute course where I was penalized for timeliness so often that I earned 0 exp.  Yes 0.  I am not sure when that becomes fun, but I am not sticking around to find out.			"

												I'm going to keep this simple up until TS2015 this has been a Train Simulator railfans would love. However I strongly recommend that you read the community posts before you decide to buy. This upgrade is causing a lot of problems across the board, including the release of a BETA patch that did more damage than it fixed. You DON'T release beta software to the public! I would hold out for now and wait to see if they manage to fix the issues.			"

What is it?A simulation that exists somewhere between 'game' and 'realistic'.  There is a variety of driving offered, from high-speed modern electrics operating fast passenger routes, diesel shunting in rail yards, to vintage steam locos.  Train driving itself isn't so much of a challenge as operating to a tight timetable without giving your passengers a severe case of whiplash or screeching to a stop about three miles beyond the station platform!  A range of difficulties and lengths of play are offered in both career and non-career missions.Is it difficult?Driving a more modern train included in the base game is easy: start, stop and a few speed settings in between when using basic controls.  You can opt for more advanced controls and difficulty options (like your train being forced into an emergency stop if you run a red signal - it will take you about 900 years to get back to speed again so kiss goodbye to your timetable)!  The difficulty comes in maintaining safety while keeping to a brutally tight real-world timetable.  Steam locos are considerably more difficult, but this is where Train Simulator is really immersive.  The levels and dials are best operated in 3D for a full simulation experience, and you probably won't be able to see clearly where you're going - that's IF you're going, rather than chugging out a lot of black smoke!Also included in the product are all the tools to make your own routes.  You are rather left to your own devices with what appears to be a very confusing interface at first.  However, quite a few of the DLC routes now sold through Steam started life as fan-made routes using the tools.  There are likely some decent user-created guides out there by now (this game started out as Rail Simulator many years ago so it's been around for a long time now).What regions does it cover?The UK, US and Germany are heavily supported (the base game was originally only these countries and players who went on to make DLC routes tended mostly to be from those same countries).  There is (slowly) increasing support for other countries through third-party developers offering coverage of some routes in Canada, China, Netherlands and South Africa for example.  Mostly, this has been left to gamers to provide this content, but much of it is every bit as high quality as the base game assets, if not better - and has started to earn its creators some money.Why the poor reviews?Mostly, the negativity has been because of the DLC pricing, with some claiming that it will cost you in the region of $5000 to buy it all.  But they miss the point.  You're not meant to 'buy it all' (and if you did, there probably wouldn't be enough years of 'useful life' of your PC, your version of Windows or life-span on Planet Earth to play it all).  No, the idea is that there might be 2-3 routes that interest you in addition to those provided in the game, and a few locos that you like or which suit your routes.  As a guide, since 2009, I've acquired in the region of 7 routes, and perhaps twice that number in locos, and have had literally hundreds of hours of play from them.  Although DLC locos are sold with missions that might depend on a particular DLC route, if you don't have the route you can still place the loco on one of your owned routes.  There are hobby sites such as UKTrainSim as well as Steam Workshop that offer free content, and plenty of third-party sites like JustTrains that sell advanced DLC.  The DLC made by the game's developers is usually half-price during Steam sales, with mega-bundles being an excellent way to grab a lot of content relatively cheaply.In a highly moddable game such as this, there are also the inevitable bugs.  In the base game, these are fairly minimal, but additional content from third-party creators can be the cause of crashes and failing routes (as usual with any game that supports player content, mods can clash or cause crashes, and not all creators update their creations to keep in line with each iteration of Train Simulator).  Finally, performance is a constant bugbear.  This game has always been a mixed bag on performance, with some heavy city locations with busy rail traffic and overhead catenary slowing even the best of PCs to a crawling framerate.  Mostly though, the game plays very well on a gaming-grade PC.  It is both CPU and GPU heavy, and places similar demands on your system as MS Flight Simulator FSX does, so the majority of players find that they're dialling down a few settings for better performance.In summaryThis won't be a game for everyone.  It's a rather niche product with a dizzying array of DLC (much of it expensive - wait for sales) and it needs a beast of a PC if you can't live without using SSAO graphics settings!  However, picking a few favourite locos and a couple of routes in addition to the decent amount of content in the base game will keep you happy (if not your passengers - poor things) for some time to come without breaking the bank.And if you are the first person ever to have bought ALL that DLC, can I have a new car please?!  One of those swanky sporty things that millionaires have...  I would catch a train instead, only I crashed the last one.			"

												Several 'updates' have made little, or any, difference to the overall satisfaction in playing this game.... I have scenarios that just don't work any more, indeed one whole loco type ( Deltic Prototype ) that won't play ANY scenarios after a previous 'downdate' and highlight another DMU set as being unavailable to load, even though I have the original route DLC and that type is a core type included within it ! I purchased the 'Sir Lamiel' add-on, but it is not visible anywhere in the menus to play :-(  Waste of money ! Some of the route DLCs are 'over-priced' for what actually are and some of the controls are very 'odd' ; eg. out of the cab views, forward and rear do not 'add up' to what you would see - many diesel/electric locos switch to the 'other end' if you look backwards to see the consist behind :-(  A few of the sounds are annoyingly repetitive and intrusive ; US cab radio 'traffic', UK level-crossing warning, GWR 0-6-0PT brake squeal to name just three !  Some of the scenarios appear just impossible to complete with unachievable timescales unless you are driving 'Concorde' - do the developers/testers actually try out all of these before publishing/selling to the paying public ? To be fair, some scenarios ARE actually quite interesting/challenging and fun though ! If only they were all like that ! Where has the 'recently released' WCML Trent Valley route gone ? ; it's not in the DLC list anymore ! Lastly : who will actually use the ""Add all DLC content to cart"" button on the main page ?

												There is a sad lack of progress (devolution, even, in some cases) over Microsoft Train Simulator. The addition of arcade-like features seems to indicate that the developer has decided to compete with Trainz, rather than create a 'simulator' in the true sense of the word. More than 10 years after its release, I would still recommend MSTS over this to anyone wishing to enjoy a more realistic driving experience, and Auran's Trainz series to those who want to play with a digital model railway.

												This isn't a simulator. At best it's ""sim-lite"", for the Kalladooty (Call Of Duty) crowd.

												Only recommended if you are a brand new customer as you will benefit from a brand new UI menu, some very nice trains and four new routes I believe. But the downside is that the TS2016 upgrade for existing TS2015 customers is buggy and there is some glitches with some of the AI trains appearing white at a distance with no textures. Also I would like to point out that there is no brand new UI menu for that matter either in the free upgrade. 4/10.			"

												So far I have had an incredibly frustrating experience with this game. First off, no manual whatsoever. The tutorial is a very short run on a generic electric train that only shows you the very basic controls. It doesn't tell you that there are speed ""limits"" (which you get penalized if you exceed by 2 km/h and ""suggested"" speeds that if exceeded by ""too much"" (how much is anyone's guess because there's nothing explained about them) suddenly slams on the emergency braking system (which they also don't tell you how to de-activate) which results in you being penalized first for having the emergency systems activated and then because you are decelerating quickly, then penalizes you for poor ride quality. Did I mention there's no manual for any of this? Or that this mission after the tutorial is the easiest? Oh yes, when you start the second mission it neglects to tell you that you must raise the arm to conact the overhead power lines, or which control does this. If you look at the outside of the train with the chase cam at the front of the train, you will not see the arm raise or lower because the one at the BACK of the train is going up and down. So unless you happen to click the right camera view there is no indication that you are hooked up or not.The ""suggested"" speed comes on from 225 km/h and says to slow to 200, then to 170, then straight to 100... and if you'r enot already braking hard from 170 down ( why would you there's no indication you would have to...) it slams on the brakes...The HUD shows your speed in MPH and the dashboard shows it in km/h... And the two don't have a precise match. So, if you are enjoying your run outside the train with one of the chase cams, you can easily start speeding and get penalized for it. There's also no way (that I can find because there's no manual... Did I mention that?) to change the units the HUD displays. When you pause it it gives you 2 options in the menu. Turn the HUD off, set it to minimal or full. The other option is the opacity of the HUD. That's it. The people that walk in the station look like pigeons strutting around, wih no natural walking motion whatsoever. They also appear to be walking on spongy concrete and clip into the station floor. Here's the best part, the run they pick for the first 2 missions is in England. It involves driving through a LOT of underground tunnels. Guess what there is to see in a tunnel... NOTHING! So you spend minutes at a time driving a train through a dark tunnel. Even if you turn the lights on you still can't see anything. What idiot was responsible for picking a run that puts you in the dark for your learning missions? Why not put you on a run somewhere open and bright and allow you to enjoy the scenery, mechanics of the engine etc.?  Oh yes, when it rains, you can wipe the window with the wipers and it clears a patch where the wipers are. But... When you speed up and achieve over 200 km/h, that apparently has no affect on the rain still on the windscreen.I haven't played the free roam mode yet, but if they make the beginning this frustrating, I have really no interest in the rest. I should say that I am an avid rail fan and I have been since I was little. I have ridden the cab of steam engines on excursions, I have chased iconic trains through the Rocky mountains, watched the train climb the Spiral tunnels in the Rockies and a lot more. This is a bitter disappointment and I'm glad I only paid 10 bucks for it.			"

												So I finally got the pleasure of downloading the 1.4GB update to TS2016. I went to load my custom consist with SD70s on Union Pacific's Sherman Hill, one of my favourite routes. I haven't read into it enough to know whether or not this is supposed to be a beta, I hope it is because this new version is just awful. Instead of background music you only hear the continuous winter wind blowing on the menu screens from the introduction video. Exciting. There's no loading bar or screens to showcase recently released routes/trains as there was in the past, you get to stare at a black screen for several seconds/minutes and hope your desired route/scenario is still loading. The SD70 which was my favourite locomotive for being one of few with excellent audio, has been 'improved' to now sound nothing like a train. Rolling stock over the tracks sounds are even more terrible. On top of it all, the stupid brake decrease glitch - which I first discovered driving Soldier Summit's SD40-2 which requires you to spam the decrease button to shut the brakes off - has now also plagued my beloved SD70.This is an embarrassment. Not only for Dovetail, but for me, having spent so much money on this. They've even seemed to have taken a step backwards as far as optimization goes, as this is now the only game I play where I can't achieve 60FPS (I don't even know if I'm getting 30) with an i5 and a GTX970 ACX2.0 on a 1440p monitor. If you haven't already, I highly suggest you do not update and resume playing TS2015. In my eyes, after this update, this game has fallen to ""shovelware"" (Google it if you don't know what that means) like quality. I'm not a person to rant, but this is an abomination. I pity the folks who have spent even more than I have on Dovetail's now even ♥♥♥♥♥ier DLCs. If I'm off my wagon and this is supposed to be some kind of Beta (Alpha??) or if there's other routes that have seen real improvements, please let me know. I'd like to have some sort of hope that the Train Sim I've enjoyed in the past has some potential to be playable again.As far as the ""All the DLC would cost over $3,000, that's stupid!"" I don't really see the point of complaining about that, you certainly don't need to purchase more than a couple routes to enjoy the game. With that said, paying $44 CAD for a route I expect it to not have the poor optimization and bugs that they have. Even on sale they still cost too much for what they are. This wouldn't be the case if they worked like they should and didn't have any issues - these things you don't learn about until after you've spent your money. So yes, folks are right to complain about the price because most of them don't see how bad the routes are until after thay've made the purchase.The icing on the cake is the beautiful video they have showcasing the UP Turbine, which features absolutely no in-game footage. Their beautiful In-Detail videos on YouTube and screenshots are appealing, but hide the truth about how horrible this game is/has become.In conclusion, I'm disappointed to say that this update has officially killed the game for me. The sheer amount of bugs, glitches, and scenery issues would be tolerable if the game cost $10 and DLCs cost $5, but the state that Dovetail has released this game and at the pricepoint it and the DLCs, in addition to the ways that they advertise the game as mentioned above, is more than wrong, it's immoral. I do not recommend anyone spends any money on this game and supports these people for what they are doing.			"

												It's a fine game, though if you want to  buy it, buy  it while it's on sale. Full price for this game? No,  buy a previous version, it's basically a ""better"" TS16, though I did experience a lot of crashes. Not  a lot of trains, though  a couple of different maps with the Pioneers edition. At first I was excited as I thought that each map would have at least one unique train to it, such as a British Railways train on the British line or such. The game does  have such a train, but that's one out of 10 or something, and that's on all maps/lines, so you basically drive English trains  on French and American lines because logic. I'd give this game a 4/10. It's a TS game, so like the previous ones, just an upgraded version of the one before it.			"

												I have reinstalled this to see if the 2015 iteration has brought any improvement. Simple bugs seem to still be present such as pedestrians on platforms walking onto the tracks or sinking into the bridges. Over the last 2 years there has been little change to the codebase. Optimization has not been completed on anything so unless your computer is a beast this is likely to load and run very slowly. Still a serious lack of proper controller support. Just a non remappable implementation of the xbox controller. No option for mapping any other controllers in. The sad part of this is that implementing these controls has been something that the modding community has been able to do.  Base package of trains, routes and scenarios pitifully small almost forcing your hand to buy a $20-$40 DLC to get more out of this. scenarios have a difficulty level of impossible due to tight margins.I initially bought this game as TS2013. The devs continue to upgrade the number on the version without making much in the way of changes.			"

												This game...is...of debatable quality.TL:DR:Bad physics. Unrealistic timetables. Basically DLC Simulator 2016.The Good ThingsBeing a hell of a rail-fan, this game has ways to deliever. The graphics are fairly good overall, but I think tweaks here and there are needed. In terms of controls, they are fairly realistic to my knowledge in terms of setup. The wheelslip is fairly accurate, as starting a train on a snowy hill side is a pain in the ♥♥♥ (as it should be).Routes are fairly accurate in detail.The Bad ThingsFor starts, this game is spammed with DLC. And it isn't done correctly. I payed nearly twenty bucks for this thing when it was on a sale exceeding 50%. Given my tight as hell budget, that was pushing it. I hoped that it would be worth it. Wrong. For starts, you get maybe three different overall routes, about a total of a dozen senarios (not including tutorals),  a little over a half-dozen locomotives (half of which cannot be drived outside of Quick-Drive), and next to nothing in terms of passenger services. Freight, freight, frieght. Last time I checked, that was what it was like in most of the US. While I am from the US, I do wish to remind you that I live in Illinois, an area which sees a good amount of public transport being by train. And I know as far as Europe that it is practically a nessisaty. So in order to get more content, I need to get DLC. And it isn't the $1.99 type of DLC either. I'm talking full price. If you want another route, more engines, freight, etc. and maybe 4-5 more scenarios, then expect to pay at least $20...more likely it will be above that. How many Steam engines come with this game? One. And it is in the stupid Academy paint scheme. It looks real dumb when you want to drive one, and the only way to do that is to play a quick drive and try to ignore all the electric and diesel trains that flash past you, making you look kinda stupid. Now, with wheelslip. Is it something that people like? Hell no. But last time I checked, wheelslip is usually something that is out of a driver's control. I'm sorry I gotta start on a steep hill with a 50 car train; that light was red. But I don't think I should be forced to give next to no throttle and allow my train to slide down helplessly, or risk recieveing huge-♥♥♥ penalties. Now I know you guys are not exactly aiming for a 100% realistic road simulator. I mean, that's kind of a given to me. But on the other hand, I don't think most railroad crossings have the lights going off well before the gates even go off. And I mean that your train is doing 30 miles an hour, up a steep hill, and still close to a mile from the crossing. Then on top of that, the middle of the train will still be crossing through when the gates will go up. I mean do you know how stupid it looks when that happens? And then lets have them drive through the train like it's a hologram.The speed limit is kinda crazy. I think most people will go five over and not have much of a penalty. But when you are are triple-digit speeds, the tenth-of-a-mile in the speedometer goes away. And if you suddenly are going 121 miles an hour instead of 120, then say good-bye to your points. Also, a little hard for most trains to go down a steep as hell hill with a massive freight train, and manage to spend the entrie time at a slug-like pace of a mere 25 miles an hour. I'm sure more then one engineer have gotten bored with the sluggishness and went a little bit over on the straightaways to cut down some time. They aren't being reckless.Derailments are horrible in terms of accuracy. I understand that you are not wanting to focus on such a thing, but face it; these things happen. That said, four railcars derailing should not make the entire 50-car train derail as well. That's kinda stupid.It's a good game. It has potental. But poor physics, next to no content without paying hundreds of dollars, abnormally-strict rules, among other things make what could be a fantastic game into a mediocure-at-best pile of ♥♥♥♥.			"

												This is the first time I play train simulator, overall I'm very dissapointed by this game. For development year 2013 (NB - game edition 2014) if has outdated graphics and effects. The list of shortcomings is too long to put it here, I guess the most frustrating experience are the numerous bugz in the game: speed drops from 140 to 60 without being announced on the HUD, camera view doesn't switch where needed.There is a huge amount of development work needed to make it a decent game, I'm gonna make sure I avoid buying anymore games from the same company.

												This is a perfect example of what Dovetail is capable of after aquiring a piece of software.- do very little to the product, release product and wait for cash.- kill off freeware support and release crappy payware DLC, wait for cash.- tell people you plan on upgrading it then do nothing, wait for cash.See the trend here?  This company is perfect for killing software and the people that use to support it.  Save your money and don't feed this Troll company...this includes Flight Simulator!			"

												While as simulator it's okay(ish), I'd not recommend to buy it because of the DLC and downward compatibility (or lack of it). In the past I've bought a couple of DLC packs, which over the year have become obsolete with new changes, but the developer does not take the effort to update those DLC packs. With that, the obsolete DLC packs ARE NOT downloaded to the current version of the game, so you CAN NOT make them compatible yourself (I can make a couple of disc DLCs I have compatible with the current version of the game). Also, I've noticed that a couple of old and obsolete DLCs have been readded as new DLC to the store without replacing the old obsolete DLC for the players who have bought it.			"

												This is a hard one.  I like trains, I like train simulators (OpenBVE being by far the best and is free) but Train Simulator 2014 (2012 when I bought it) is so...lacklustre.Don't get me wrong, the visual detail ranges from adequate (ground textures, houses, cars) to impressively realised (stations, viaducts, overall scenery) however it is in how you drive the train which is very uninteractive.  I draw comparisons to OpenBVE because everything has a button and each diesel/electric train has throttle *positions* rather than a throttle that cannot be set to go at a certain percentage (and goes through the power level percentages extremely smoothly), the sounds recorded by amateurs for OpenBVE have the realism that Train Simuator lacks (trains sound like they are idling, even when the throttle is at 100% and going up a gradient) and if you care about the little details (such as replying to the guard's buzzer) then you're going to notice their conspicuous absence.For the most part you will be sat there doing nothing, whereas in OpenBVE you would be constantly adjusting throttle and braking to ensure best possible speed, time and passenger comfort (should you be doing a passenger run) or taking into account how the freight changes the handling.  This is the kind of pressure that's present in Euro Truck Simulator (which is disappointing on a different level, but not in terms of the actual driving of the trucks) but not here in Train Simulator 2014.I even bought the Settle-Carlisle pack during the sale, just to see if the experience would be any different to those included as standard.  The answer, rather resoundingly, is no as the trains still sound awful (the horns may as well be weak synth or foleyed car horns, the steam engine noises are equally weak), the amount of interactivity is negligible and when there is pressure on the more difficult routes? Be prepared for awful controls and trains that need to go to their virtual depot for either scrapping or rebuilding from scratch as they are that poor in terms of performance.I would have loved to have said that Train Simulator was - at least - good.  But it isn't.  Until Train Simulator receives a thorough reworking, it is best that you avoid this and either go buy a train set; play OpenBVE/Transport Tycoon or volunteer at your local heritage railway.  You'll save a lot of money (especially where all the DLC combined costs over £1000 prior to a Steam sale) and you'll have a far more enriching experience.			"

												I first bought this when it was called Train Simulator 2012, then it was worth the price. But now they upgraded the steam version every year, and you need to pay for the routes if you wanted them. The dlc cost is skyhigh, and they probably release to much dlc even a month. Bought just a few here and some are not worth the money!If you buys this, graphical is really nice, but buy dlc outside of steam. Like Justrains, Christrains, Fopix3d and so on have way better quality routes that are worth way more of your money.But If you want something realistic, this ain't the game you are looking for.			"

I'm running on a GTX 780TI and Intel Xeon machine yet get about 28fps on low setttings despite getting 80+ on the highest settings on Battlefield 4 (a much better looking game)...

												Buggy game, requires paid DLC for it to be fun. Imagine something like Flight Simulator that requires you to buy DLC to fly anything other than 2 aircraft along 3 routes (within small regions). I'd expect it to be one of those Free-to-play games that relies on DLC, but the base game is already expensive and is riddled with bugs. I can't run the tutorials because they simply won't load, and half the time the game either crashes or the menu doesn't load properly. Really disappointed, it had so much potential. When games like Euro Truck Simulator can create a similar experience with free-roaming trucks in Europe, I don't see why a train game would have to cost 100x more.			"

												About the ""Trains vs zombies 2"" add-on scenario:One may expect much from something picturing large heavy motorized vehicles lashing out against hordes of soft squishy stumbling flesh-bags ; one might also be so, so very wrong.So here is trains vs zombies 2 for Train Simulator 2014, a deceiving name really as most of the confrontation will take place with  steam's support when you might ask for a refund. In fact, they should've called it, ""Trains and zombies, friendship is magic"" as, most of the time, zombies will just engage in social talk on the boarding station or make happy parties around burning wreckages.Anyhow, scenario goes like this: You drive a train in New-York suburds, weather goes bad (or so they tell you), random walking NPC's skin turns green, oh god zombies (or so they tell you again) , you must get as far as possible, fearing that people might laugh at you for cosplaying Green Giant®. Most of the fun you will ever get from this game should be made by you, goofing around unrailing your train and trying two wheelers. Going from a quality perspective, graphics are horribly simplistic (especially for a game which, in the end, is only sightseeing), pacing feels like everyone in the world has went to ""special people"" school, music is inexistant and glitches are frequent occurence as NPC's do tend to park their car around 50 meters above ground, in mid-air.

												Bought this on sale for the Christmas Holiday Train. Ridiculously buggy, graphical glitches, and system dump files abound. The Christmas DLC is a very lacking one-room track populated with ugly textures (circa 1990s gamebuilders), questionable inclusion of scene assets (outdoors/stairs/doors/hallways in world editor), and overall poor optimisation and execution. Had originally decided to try this to see if it would be a suitable holiday steam gift for friends... big resounding 'NO' on that. Game control layout is terribly though-out and the UI is not intuitive. This christmas sale seems to be a marketing ploy to push TS2014 and hope users buy ridiculously over-priced DLC content to expand a virtually empty content game engine. Stay away like the plague.

												It's OK(ish). However - The graphics and believability for the scenery and environment are quite poor (Looks too legoish and repetitive). The add-on's are way, way overpriced. £12 - £17 for 1 Loco to run up and down the same line that you're now getting bored with is absolute extortion.Worse still - It doesn’t come with many routes. So you will be looking at spending around £25 per route, once you have completed all the scenarios for the few existing routes that you got with the game.You can download free stuff from steam for this game e.g. routes, scenarios etc, but be warned - You will find that you still need to buy more routes and add-on packs to actually play them and make them work.I downloaded the 56xx GWR Steam Loco add on for this game in loving memory of my Dad who always wanted to drive a steam train (I thought I'd complete his ambition for him). When I went to the tutorial list for this class of loco - I found that I could not play any of the scenarios or use the tutorial because I don't have the ""Memories Of Maerdy"" route add on priced at £17.99What's also annoying for me is not all of the listed scenarios in this game are playable using the loco's that you already have with the original game. If you attempt to play one - You just get greeted with an in game pop-up advising you that you need to purchase yet another route to play this scenario.It's full of bugs too - e.g. people walking across the track at a stations, people walking through scenery, people walking through each other, cars hovering above the road at rail crossings, the game randomly crashing etc. Unless you are an absolute die hard rail fan - Best not to bother because you'll end up spending far too much money trying to improve this game with over priced add-on's to make it more interesting, before you realise that it's just not worth it.I purchased this when it was on special offer, and after playing it for quite a while now - I still think that it was over priced then for what it is.To me - A simulator should fully immerse you inside it, making you forget what reality you are actually in for a while. And also, to a certain extent; teach you how to fly, drive a truck, race a car properly or a train etc...I’m afraid that this game just makes me feel like I am playing with an over priced virtual train set. And that is a great shame!I really want to love this game. I keep giving it another go, hoping that it will click with me, but it’s just not happening.It just doesn't have that come back factor for me. And I am a big simulator fan.Overall - 5/10			"

												I cannot recommend this for anything outside of the German rail routes.  And, even some of those are bugged out.General Issues:- Routes suffer from 2 locomotive, 3 car syndrome.  Any more costs money, and usually have to be manually added in via modding if you want to actually see them on a train other than the one you yourself are driving.- Expensive DLC.- No indication if the dead man's switch is alarming from outside of the cab view. - Cannot disable the dead man's switch.- Seems to not be well optimized:  has periodic performance issues on even high end hardware.- Some of the scenarios have long introductiory npc scripts where you end up waiting for 5-10 minutes just for the first block to clear.Bugs:  - DLC routes are often missing from 1 or more of the game modes.- Dead mans switch fails to operate correctly.  It sometimes just fails to deactivate without explaination and eventually kicks on the emergency brake.- Emergency break kicks on unexpectedly, even if keeping up on the dead man's switch, and sometimes cannot be reset, breaking some scenerios.- Game will insist that you are exceeding a speed limit, even when you are not- Game will sometimes not tell you that the speed limit changes ahead until it's too late.- The times between stops in scenerios are often so tight that you cannot reasonably make it in time.  This is sometimes so obvious that you can't make it even with full throttle, full brake, and breaking the speed limit.- Switching on main lines in some scenerios and on free roam will inexplicably be routed into sidings and into parked NPC trains.- Dialog missing/nonsensical on some scenerios, even on introductory ones on flagship routes.- Occasionally a scenario will fail because of a hickup while coming to a stop:  Complaining that you went underway again without completing the objectives of the stop.Other thoughts: They at least fixed the bug where you got penalized for sounding the horn when going past a whistle post.

												Mixed feelings. It's fun to play the game just until you get bored with the bundled scenarios and all the bugs coming with them.Have you ever tried the shunting scenarios in Köln? It's absolutely ridiculous that the game glitches after cupling like 4 or 5 wagons and you have to save the scenario, quit the game, rebuild the game cache and return just to complete this mission. I've also experienced some weird AI collision without any actual AI present on the map (had to restart the scenario).The same applies to the bundled ICE missions where the whole signalling is just broken. Stuck in the depot while waiting for the red signal to turn green (waited for like 5 minutes) also had fun time applying emergency brakes just because some ghost speed-limit from 160 to 80 kmph. My virtual passangers thanked me at the end of the drive for sure! :)And for this whole DLC model. It's insane. Their in-game store lists some locos for €6.99 but when you click the Steam checkout button you can see that they want to charge you €13.99.Also €20-30 for routes containing 3-4 scenarios with 30 minutes of drive-time per each is utter BS. You can find highly detailed, realistic, non-glitching maps for MSTS for FREE. Almost forgot to mention that you can drive full-routes on those not just 4-5 stop services starting on deserted main-stations and ending in some random town in the suburbs.For €7 it was OK to buy the game (seen worse for that much of money) but I absolutely wouldn't recommend spending even an eurocent more on that.

												Patchy AI (for both signals and trains), persistant bugs that should've been fixed in previous editions, expensive DLC (because apparently it ""supports releasing a new version"" even though I could simply offer a $5/£5 or whatever upgrade to the latest version), in someways poor creation tools, lack of modding documentation/updated tools, complete ignorance of 3rd party content (unlike in the past when this game was still Railworks) and removal of the traditional ""X types of Y activity"" achievements (say performing 100 shunting operations or driving 500 miles) replaced with ""Play X dlc"" makers this game feel tired, out of date, and in some instances not fit for purpose.Would recommend you look at Trainz: A New Era (currently scheduled for Q4 2014 release) as a much better alternative from a company that listens to the fanbase.

												I have played hundreds of hours with all the iterations of Train Simulator for years. This newest version, TS2014, is at best buggy and unoptimized and at worst unplayable.  Bugs have existed in this game for years w/o fix.  Problems with scenarios and routes have been reported time and time again, yet no fix, years after release (I'm looking at you Northeast Corridor).DLC is very overpriced.  $40 for routes and $20 for rolling stock?  More reasonable would be $20 for routes and $10 for rolling stock.While I have enjoyed this game in the past, I cannot recommend it now.  My only hope for this game is that another company will buy the current owners and start from scratch.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~TS2015 Edit: Game is a bit more optimized now and runs a little better on high end machines. However the years old bugs still exist and the DLC is still way overpriced. Still would not recommend.			"

												The worst freenium has to offer!This includes only 1 toy train and 1 interior track layout for that train with 5 missions.  There are no other trains and no other locations included.TS14 is extremely slow paced, more so that you would expect.  The menu's are slow, DLC popups appear before every mission, and you must watch the obligatory introduction before each mission.  After the first couple of missions the game stops explaining your objectives.  It's really great to unexpetedly fail after 10 minutes of hooking up carriages in the right order.The final blow to this blatant money grab is it's poor implementation and physics.I give Train Simulator 400 out of 2014 obviously lost years of progress in game develepment and design.

The original price is $54.99 which is way overpriced. You get like 3 different routes and around 5 trains. I don't even want to mention DLC. Let me just say, Overpriced. Graphics are good. Physics are somewhat good but you barely meet any traffic. On a 100 minute scenario I probably meant 2 trains which isn't reaqlistic at all. Heck I have about 6 that come into my twon in just an hour.So to put it short, I would wait until this game is on sale. For the original price I couldn't see how any one bought it,			"

												OK, with 569 hours:1. This is a marvelous game. It simulates not just driving trains, but the experience of being in them, around them, and the countryside through which they roar in all four seasons. Some look and sound so good you can almost smell the deisel. Stop at a station along the way - get out and have a cucumber sandwich and a cup of tea from your thermos.2. Don't be put off by the DLCs. This is a train enthusiast's game; a hobby. Like a train set in your attic. If you want a new loco, buy it. Add it with pride as a new thing for your collection; it's not like a patch for a broken game. Buy a train because you like it, you want it - to look at, and learn about, and drive, and watch and hear rushing by. And if you want a route, buy it to EXPERIENCE it; spend time on it. 3. The experience can range from excitement of a high speed run, to a peaceful, even cathartic experience chuffing through hills and dales and towns and cities which so well represent the lands portrayed.I cannot recommend this game more highly.

												Sure is alot of DLC for the worst Train simulator ever made.  The game is a nightmare to play, just figuring out how to START the game requires watching youtube tutorials.  There are so many menus with 99% of them being useless instead of just letting me play the game, its telling me stats, there are offers for buying more Train DLC but there is no option to play the game ANYWHERE on the frist set of menus, to play the game requires navigating about 7-8 menus correctly, make the wrong choice and you start over, or worse the game freezes crashing.  The controls are terrible, using a controller still requires a mouse and keyboard, operating a real train would be easier than this game.  Is this game a joke?  Seems my trains they only go backwards using the left trigger.  Wanna see how bad the design of the game is without buying the game or downloading a demo?  Lets look at how dumb the game designers are.  On this store page click visit the forums, see those couple locked topics at the top.  The designers even managed to mess up steams forums which work for every other game, to get to their forums, you need to click an option on the right.  Avoid this and all its DLC they managed to vomit onto steam, go buy a real train at the store for the same price, its more fun and will work, plus you can go all Addams family make the trains hit eachother which you cant do in this game.Whats really strange with this game is the more people play it the more they hate it, looking over the review most people with over 100 hours of gameplay hate the game, but people with under 1 hour like the game.  Wow, they even manage to annoy the few people who figured out how to play the game, Great Job!Rating:  0/10  Value:  $0.00			"

												Train Simulator is certainly a game that any railfan could enjoy. If the game was not plaqued by so many bugs, it would be more enjoyable. Dovetail games should really focus on fixing the bugs in this game. This game crashes on me and has frame rate issues.  Instead of realasing the thousands of dollars worth of DLC for this game. Focus on fixing this game Dovetail?The frame rate is higher when you pause the game. if this game comes out to VR you will have people throwing up all over their computers from the constant frame rate issues.Pro'sThe detail that goes into the routes that you play.Realistic sounds and physics for the game. The Locomotives are pretty accuate. Its addictive Con's When you pay for an expansion for a game that is 30 bucks or more. It should have less bugs. Drops in frame rate. The expansion are two damn expensive Issues with the Alterter. Even when I press down on my xbox 360 controller the alerter still keeps on going off. Than the train stops and I can not start the train again. Fix the alerter bug please!Constent bugs They say they come out with a new version of the game each year. Maybe for that new version you should really fix those bugs.bug's, bug's, bug's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This game is unplayable. As much as I love playing this game and as much I enjoy being a railfan. I can not run this game without it crashing on me. I run this game on  a homebuilt computer sporting and i75930k. I have been running this system stable for a good year. This game is an unoptimized peice of garbage.

												I bought this Game os  Steam sale, was quite cheap with an 85% on it. The only way I'd buy it as the price tag is quite high, so I could pick on the Steam version with some extra stuff. Well, besides the price tag, what else the game offers? not many things.Let's start complimenting theese guys on making a visually good game. By visually good, I say it by making textures for dirty windows, rain drops on the windows, and other enviromental stuff, but, the textures on both interior and exteriors aren't that much good looking, as on a resolution of 1366x768 I can't read some of the things written in the cab controls. About controls, they have support for a controller, but you can't customize the controls, and what about the conductor to help you out?Another down side of this game is the missions, with and EXTREMELY short timetable. A second more or less to press the load/unload command and you're already late and loosing points, not to say that you have to figure out the exact distance to start braking from the speed limit to stop wit the entire train on the station, toherwise you're loosing points too. Physics? they have some good things but bad things, but I'd say they still have some work to do.What about the IMMENSE number os DLC's? they throw you off from playing this game, they give you a loco on the tutorial that ISN'T EVEN AVAILABLE TO PLAY!, what the heck are you doing people? Still, work to polish your engine, I'm running it on a decent and considered high end machine and it lags, that shouldn't be happening IMO.This is my first review on a game, and it's a negative one. I gave you a chance on this, and I'm not happy with it, you lost a possible client. For everyone else up to buy it, get it on a heavy discount, it's not worth it unless it's 75% off or more, maybe don't even buy it, save for something better			"

So I tried on of the easier missions and failed for going to fast or passing it up? Take your pick. The game looks better in screen shots then it really does in motion. The game doesnt look that great compared to other games like Euro Trucker 2. The world that the train goes thru feels empty and its boring. Unlike Euro Trucker 2 that feels alive and the scenery makes you want to drive in the world. I wanted to like this game and tried to like it.

												The world’s favorite train simulator eh? I sadly must disagree. I bought this game thinking it would be cool. But apparently, all I purchased was a “demo” with a cool background. Over half the missions require maps that you don’t even have. And these DLC maps aren’t cheap. Each of these DLC maps cost $20+. It’s basically just a demo. You don’t even have half of the necessary content to play this game as if it’s the real thing. I was very disappointed. Once you get in the game, you see a store with a very cool background. So basically all you purchased for $60 is a demo with a few maps and a DLC map store (don’t forget the very cool background), so that you can spend more money. If you really like trains, go ahead and buy some of the DLC. But I recommend staying away from this game. To “upgrade” your game to the full version, you would need to buy all of the DLC to make the game fully functional. This could cost up to $1000. The gameplay is very nice, but there isn’t much to do at all without the DLC. I have some of the DLC content but it doesn’t make much of a difference if you don’t buy all of the necessary DLC. I hope that there are better train simulators, or that this one will make all the DLC free. If the DLC came with the game, this would be a very good train simulator. Until they make it free, I’ll be watching that very cool background.			"

												Giving Train Simulator 2014 the thumbs down is a difficult decision, but I'll explain why I feel I am compelled to do so.I first purchased TS2014 when it was TS2013 / Railworks 3. TS2014 is essentially an updated version of last year's game with a new menu interface and some minor patches. The same routes available prior to the conversion are compatible with the current version.First, I'll evaluate TS2014 as a game. Graphically, it is probably one of the best looking simulators in the genre, and while the visuals are not cutting edge by any sort, they adequately represent the locomotives, rolling stock, and scenery. Some locations and trains are impeccably detailed and create wonderful scenic panoramas; others are nothing special, but still pleasing, while some models and locales are devoid of details, incomplete, or just plain ugly. Some graphical bugs present themselves, usually missing or clipping textures, but this is largely dependent on the route or locomotive. Certain assets are far more polished than others. Sounds are overall nothing spectacular. They work for the most part, and some locomotives are equipped with awesome sound packs, replete with CB radio voiceovers, the hum of the engines, and great horns and bells. Unfortunately, other trains were not given the same treatment, and sounding the horn is an anticlimactic experience when the sound is muffled or lacks an echo, and instead cuts off the second the key is depressed. Much like visual detail, quality varies with sound and is dependent on the developer of a given asset.Gameplay is fairly standard for a train simulator; there are no interesting new features or design quirks, and let's be honest, I didn't expect there to be. The standard by which simulators are judged the most is realism, and by and large TS2014 provides a fairly realistic experience. Steam locomotives, as expected, scale in difficulty compared to their diesel and electric counterparts. You are expected to obey signalling and dispatcher orders and are penalized harshly for failing to heed these warnings. Points are awarded for timeliness and subtracted for recklessness and tardiness. There is enough challenge in most scenarios to keep you on your toes; of course, you can free drive, disable all the realism settings, and run the game like MLG PRO EXTREME TRAINZ SIM 420 and surf on rails if you wish.With all being said, Train Simulator 2014 is a decent game. It looks nice and will engage players who are interested in railroading and simulators in general. However, it is a terrible value, and I hope to illustrate why.In the Standard Edition, which retails for 39.99 USD, you get the game itself plus three routes (the specific routes have changed since when I purchased the game). These routes range anywhere from a few dozen km (15-20 miles or so) to 300+ km (180+ miles) and provide usually no more than 3 trainsets (some are generous enough to give you 4 or 5) along with anywhere from 5 to 12 scenarios, on average. You're paying a bit over 13 dollars per route in addition to the base game. Fair enough. Where Dovetail Games (formerly RailSimulator.com Ltd.) will suck you dry is through the numerous DLC available for the game, and I would consider Dovetail one of the, if not the absolute worst offenders on Steam in the practice of pumping out overpriced and underwhelming DLC.Consider that the typical price of a new route add-on is 39.99 USD. I bought the base game and three routes for that same price. What justifies a ludicrous markup of over 200% on additional routes, when some are smaller or less detailed than those included with the game? Moving on to locomotives, you can purchase the Amtrak California Zephyr F40PH (a common diesel found on North American railroads) for 19.99. It comes with one livery and a few missions for a DLC that, thankfully, is now included in the base game, but at one time was a separate purchase. Even more pathetic is the attempt to sell the BR Class J74 tank engine for 7.99 with a few scenarios. But the most egregious example of how bad TS2014's DLCs can get is the listing on Railsimulator.com for a silver livery for the PRR GG1 locomotive for 4.99. Yes, for 5 dollars, you can be the proud owner of one skin. Locomotive not included. This is absurd.I understand that a lot of content in this game is developed by third parties, and that they need to be paid for their hard work. Yet the price gouging set in place by Dovetail can hardly be justified, especially when the developer's quality control team has a history of overlooking minor and not-so-minor bugs in the DLC they allow to be published, resulting in a wide variation in the quality of the addons. Do they want their game to have a reputation for uncertainty? The exhorbitant prices combined with the developer's curt attitude to criticism by the fanbase drives potential players away and hurts the rating of what otherwise is a decent simulation. The Steam Workshop and the intensely devoted railfan community have the potential to improve this game by leaps and bounds if the developers understood that mod friendliness and accessibility can only help their product.If you are a railfan and value your money, just go and build a model railway. You will meet more people, gain more useful skills, and enjoy the experience much more than if you buy this game and the accompanying DLC. After all, the cost of all the DLC combined could finance a fairly large-sized model railroad. Besides, you will have more creativity at your hands and create more lifelong memories with that than by investing that money into Train Simulator 2014.			"

												Few games manage to get worse when the developer continues to work on them. But this is one of them.For whatever reason, the developers of Railworks Train Simulator changes things that doesn't need changing, adds things that doesn't need to be added, and yet, doesn't fix what needs to be fixed.In my opinion, this game is not worth buying. When i first got onto this game, it was the 2012 edition, with the 2013 edition being better in a few ways, but this 2014 edition is awful. There is a career system with icons and graphics that look like they were quickly made in MS-Paint, nothing has improved as far as i can tell, and old routers/scenarios are still bugged. For the casual player who wants to have fun driving a train, i honestly wouldn't recommend this at all. It's frustrating trying to get a good score, when suddenly with no warning the speed limit changes, which seems to happen on alot of routes. Saving and returning to the game isn't fun when the load times are this long.And for whatever reason; i have performance problems. My game runs on a AMD Radeon 7970 GHz edition, FX-6300 OC'd, and is on a Corsair SSD, but, when i drive a train at a high speed the map sort of loads in ""chunks"", meaning every 20 secounds there's a slowdown in FPS. What the hell?!Every now and then i fire up this game, feeling like driving a train, enjoying the view (which the new limited camera view has ruined, but whatever). However, i am met with bugs, anger, and frustration. This could have been a great, realistic game, with the look and feel of the real thing, but the graphics havn't gotten much better since the 2012 edition, the only additions has been casual features such as controller support and career-mode. The terrain feels dead and people still look ugly. i do not regret the day i purchased this game, however, i do regret having ever purchased any dlc once this game hit 2013 edition. It is a giant, giant mess of a game, with so much DLC it has gotten out of control, not because there's too much to chose from, but because none of it gets fixed.			"

												If you want laser-cannon firing trains that shoot out spikes to kill aliens, then don't bother. But if you want a game that is strangely absorbing and relaxing at the same time, requiring almost no skill to enjoy but weeks of practice to really be an expert, TS ticks all the boxes. I can see why the shoot-em-up fans don't 'get' this game, but I really do. You struggle to get up a hill with a thousand tons of freight behind you, then worry about running away down the other side. Or you have to pick up on time at every station, stopping literally within a couple of feet of the marker on the platform. Or drive along a country route enjoying the scenery and watching out for interesting trains coming the other way.It's pretty much the only Steam game I play, it's got so much extendability - driving a freight train in the snow is VERY different to driving the same tracks with an express train at night in the rain. It not only makes me respect train engineers/drivers much more, it provides me with a lot of pretty harmless fun. Oh, and unlike so many games, it's one that I'm perfectly happy to let my son play. He is SO impatient but he is quite happy to take a two-hour trip on TS.Highly recommended (unless you think GTA V is the bestest experience of your life, in which case probably not).			"

You buy it thinking you have a full variety of trains to drive and routes to travel on but you don’t. Fairly limited really. I don’t mind DLC but this game has hundreds of it, each worth lots of money. Feel sorry for those who paid the full price. Paying thirty five pound to learn you have to pay a further twenty pound for one train or route you wish to play. And lastly, I don’t think much of the games graphics either. Basically, don't buy this game expecting a lot in return.			"

Not much of a game, as there is nothing to do but passing green lights and watching your speed. There are no emergencies, no irregular events or even the slightest problems to solve. No knowledge required nor to be gained by playing this ""simulator"", in which not even the brakes function normally.But hey, you get about 12+ camera angles to watch your train whilst driving it. Hope you can get your enjoyment from that part of the game, because it is not to be found in the rest of it.			"

												This game is alright at first sadly i have played 3.9 hrs so far after owning it for since July and i have gotten bored of it. This game has great graphics, good trains, and tracks. But everything comes in DLC. After purchasing a $55 game it seems it is too overpriced for the content that is delivered with it. I have bought DLC on the latest Steam sale and it came with one train which has a specific map to drive in career mode. Is it wrong to feel swindled out of my money because now it wants me to purchase the 2 $20 maps. If I had known this I would have spent the money on something else or had saved it. This game feel they did the 3 levels and made the 4 different trains and put it out there partly done. I just wish that they had done more and added more to the game. Summary- I wouldn't recommend this game because it doesn't have enough content to be priced that high. If you dont mind spending $100+ on DLC the I would say you should buy the game, but look at other reviews as well they same almost the same thing as I have stated.			"

												Updated 26 Feb 15 following comment and release of the Isle of Wight fixes.You might think it would be fun, or at least different, to be able to drive a steam train, or indeed any train through rolling countryside, perhaps relaxing and a change from killing stuff. If so please look elsewhere.The idea is good and I know simulations are not for everyone but the implementation is dire. There are repeated bugs and crashes and every update seems to introduce new problems without fixing the old ones. There are 2 sides to this game. Driving stuff and building stuff in the editor. Driving first.Having never driven a train I cannot say if the simulation side is accurate, what I can say is that the missions and game play can be frustrating. You get a handful of trains and routes from the outset and can purchase any number of additional DLC from Dovetail (or whatever they are calling themselves now) and 3rd party devs. There are missions where you have to take a train from one place to another in a tight time-table without speeding, falling of the tracks,crashing or going through a red signal which is harder than it sounds. Trains do not stop quickly, or like rain, hills etc so running on time is tough and it is very easy to miss a speed restriction resulting in a failure (or no awarded points). Missions can last over a hour and you will loose if you go through a red signal, or make a serious mistake,. There is a quick save (press F2 - thanks paned) but to reload you have to quit the mission and then reload from the mission select screen. Some of these routes are very long and take quite a time to load. You only get one save slot per mission and so even doing a reload may not save you if you are about to pass a red signal. Get it right and there is a sense of achievement ( or relief ) but the bugs just get in the way. There are other computer controlled trains on the line and you can be perfectly on time, top scoring only to have one of these crash miles away from you for the mission to fail. You did nothing wrong, the game bugged. remember how long some of those missions are? Imagine that happening 45 mins into one. It will.You might like to purchase some of the nice shiny DLC, in a word don't. There is zero, zilch, nada, zip, guarantee that an update won't break it without warning, and never be fixed. When I first wrote this review in Dec 2014 the Isle of Wight career scenarios were totally bugged and would not load and had not since the 2014 update. Well at this has at last been sorted along with over 100 other bugs and glitches for one, rather old, route. OK congrats for at last sorting the problems devs, but you have released countless new bits of DLC in the meantime many of which have their own bugs. One of my 3rd party routes (can't remember which) has you so that you are embedded in the roof of the train cab making driving 'interesting'. That broke in 2012. Since the original review I have found that some of the wooden post semaphore signals from the UK set have the signal arm at the bottom of the post (so embedded inm the ground), rather than where it should be at the top. I have no idea how long these have been broken, but given the devs priories (new DLC, new DLC etc) don't expect these to be fixed soon if ever.BuildingHanker after your old train set, want to build a virtual one? Look elsewhere or the bugs and frustration will get you here as well.The editor is complicated, and you have to do a lot of background reading before you start. Signals are complex things and getting them wrong with cause you no end of problems. This would not be a problem if editor loaded and didn't crash, and allowed you to move a track without sicking buffers all the way along it and has a sane way to build tunnels and didn't crash if you raised a track for a hill and... In short it's bugged as well. As for the documentation welll....To sum up its a nice idea ruined. The graphics are nice (and bugged - check fully leaved trees that cast the shadows of bare branches, solid walls that have light flooding under their bases etc), and it could be a relaxing way to spend a few hours.If it worked.

												Although the basics of this game are quite cool, It has been stripped of a lot of content. A large number of trains and maps have to be bought seperately. For example, there are no steam engines in game. The UI is not very good either; Figuring out what everything actually does is a pain. I was greatly dissapointed by what the game has to offer, especially considering the last version I played (~2007) offered a bigger variety of both maps and trains.			"

												EDIT: The fact the Dovetail Games does not really have much competition in the train sim genre kind of begs the questions why sell the DLC as these ridiculous prices, let me tell you why, there numbers are dropping and they struggle to maintain healthy continous playing users, lets looks at another game like Euro Truck Simulator 2, they have DLC not many but they have some and are all ridiculously cheap and they even give players free noticeble game changing updates, Dovetail Games doesn't, SCS have one thing that Dovetail Games doesn't a strong continuous player base that play most of the time, look at the numbers for yourself on the steam stats they are one of the top 10 games that get played daily, train sim doesn't have that player capture towards a game that Euro Truck is, and this is why Dovetail games struggle and force the high DLC prices just to stay alive, they are expanding there company having over 100 employees that very difficult to maintain if the numbers are not showing and now they have DTG Fishing and FSX under their belt. This is why Ladies and Gentlemen Dovetail Games have these high DLC prices and this why the game haven't significantly changed from day 1 all those years back, DTG have grown to comfortable with this routine of pumping out medicore DLC at these high prices as its the only thing they can do to just keep them in busniess, if they had more players playing the game daily like Euro Truck has DLC wouldn't be that expensive. DTG need to get the next train sim right, they need to listen to the players for once (not saying they dont) but the whole model of the game needs to change from where it is now! Well time for me to contribute my review for Train Simulator as a whole franchise.First even though I do recommend the game it isn't the perfect simulator everyone expects however.Lets go over the positives about this game to not sound to anti Train Sim:PROS:- This game overall is very good and solid for a Train Simulator; it does all the basics you would want from a simulator; get in train different trains on different routes (all covered)- Graphics are genrally pretty good (but I will elobrate a bit more in the cons)- It is now a very user friendly game and new comers will find it extremely easy and fullfilling to get into the game and start driving- The Steam workshop intergration is one of my biggest pros for this game (it in some ways saved the game from being forgotten about) you have access to free community made scenarios which are far better then ones Dovetail Gmaes try and make with each DLC route, there is always someone you can find on the steam workshop- It is sort of immersive I guess....- For the DLC collection they have to offer it isn't that bad but more can be done (I will talk about pricing in the cons)and well.... thats all I can really think of for the pros currently, it a solid simulation that is great for new players to get into ... But I am not a new player so for long lasting players maybe some of the pros I mentioned are relateble.Now the CONS (sit tight)- DLC pricing.... This is a whole topic for itself: Since the beginning of Train Simulator DLC weren't the cheapest but were reasonable, in the present day I personally think DLC is way overpriced for what you do get. The standard game has also increased so more money to spend if you are getting into Train Sim. Dovetail games has increased as a company and has a much larger player base then it once had, I do not understand why that should mean to increase DLC price it is obsurd! A route generally costs £25 with any additional trains (that they do not bother to add with the standard route) adding on another £11 to £15.............. this is just way too much money to keep investing into, the most smartest/desperat time for players to get DLC is during steam sales (imagine if they didn't exist?) - DLC Routes & Trains: Adding on from the pricing point of view.... Routes and train have come a long way through the history in Train Simulator no one can deny that detail has gotten better over the years. But I do not think it is good enough, routes to me do not feel very unique most assests are copied over from other routes e.g. most station exteriors and interiors are just plain simple and copied, they only add sometimes big nice fancy details to show of a particular place in one area of the route. Trains are even more disgusting to think about sure again things have improved but not enough (WHY DO WE HAVE 3RD PARTY WEBSITES like Armstong Powerhouse [which they do a fabulous job] having to step in to fill the gaps dovetail games miss out?) The Class 321 is probabaly the best exmaple of this the one dovetail game released was a total shambles, and then AP released their version with better visuals and sound (especially), it makes you wonder why can't dovetail games include these more improved features? We pay large prices for them? And then you have AP who does a better job for the fraction of the price...... - GRAPHICS ENGINE: Ok this is proabably my most passionate point and I know that TS 2016 is the year where an upgrade to Unreal Engine 4 is due but let me elaborate my concerns for the past few years with this current engine we have! The graphics engine is just too old now. This game have been out for 6+ years and we have been faced with the same PhysX engine and frankly its showing it age! When I said the game is quite detailed I ment only to a point, of course is massively better then an 8-bit game but in the present day with many advancing graphic engines and great game looking games being produced you would think something like a simulation game as one as popular as Train Simulator can have the same treatment. The current engine prevents dovetail games from making far larger maps (which is something many complain about), high 0fidelity of textures is something that cannot be achieved in the current engine; certain assets and textures currently look so terrible and can be compared to a game of ten years ago, Dovetail games only focus on certains things to catch your eye from the reality of the surrounding game! MULTIPLAYER: This actually links to the graphics engine issue, the current engine apparently wouldn't be able to handle lets say ""a open world multiplayer"" which I think is so needed in a popular simulator like Train Sim (I have talked in my youtube video about the lack of connecting the community and friends together with this game, it discourages a connection between player and the achievement system in the game now is just such a bad attempt of dong something to make it look like your friends are involved with your gaming experience. Any the whole multiplayer issue is much deeper than this so I won't carry out but you get the point.ANNIMATIONS: Again to the with the engine, dovetail games promised better passenger animations in TS 2015 but I think thats a total lie, nothing has really changed and they kind of lied when they released a post about the new features only turning out to only be implemented with the 3 routes thats come with TS 2015, so thats a bit cruel. Many bugs and glitches are still present within the game and its quite shocking that they haven't fixed them for how long the game has been out.That raps up my opinions of TS as a whole, I will edited this review if anything else come to mind.I do recommend this game if you are someone new and wants to get into a Train Sim but beware of the over priced DLC's you will get into (wait for sales if you are tight with money), and people like me who are long serving players and who want change within game franchise we shall wait till next year for TS 2016 where will see the pinicle moment for TS if dovetail games bring it to the table of completely collapse on their face. (DLC for nexts years game is also something very controversial....)Thanks for reading my review! I am QwertyAfro (Sam) I bid you good day!			"

												I have put alot of time into this game, HOWEVER...There are many faults with this game/simulator and most likely will never get fixed. -Poor optimization, -Substandard DLC specifically rolling stock even though i have spent a great deal, poor support, developers silencing the coummunity forums. The list goes on, but i want to keep it short  The community side has changed greatly in a negative way as many long time players would agree because of the developers. Do some research before buying this game. I think the fact that Railsimulator marked this and many other reviews as ""off topic"" says alot. The fact that many forum discussions are getting moved or deleted never to be found again ""PC Gamer Review"" says alot. Actions speak louder than words.This is another review by pcgamer to help make the decision.http://www.pcgamer.com/review/train-simulator-review/The coummnty that built this once great game is getting silenced everyday.

												Visually this is a great game.  For me, that's about where the positives ended.  I like a variety of games and don't need constant action but this was tedious.  I especially enjoyed when I arrive at stations and had to sit and wait for 3-5 minutes (real time) to elapse to leave the station on time.  The controls for the trains I have require me to have to either constantly hold the throttle or keep losing speed then have to shift back down to not lose points for speeding.  I guess the people who made the real trains these are modeled after never found a way to have linear controls that would stay in place so instead you have 25, 50,75 and 100% power or you hold the throttle in place at a mid point for 3-10 minutes as you travel.  Don't read the speed limit signs or follow their map or you will lose points for speeding when you hit the occasional bug in the game where the programing doesn't match the visual cues.  I can't bring myself to do a single scenario that will take 3-4 hours.To buy all the DLC for this game when it is all on sale gave a price of over $1,500, I think this may be the most expensive game in existance.

												A few versions ago I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this game, but Railsimulator.com have taken their position for granted and have become sloppy. The DLC system is an overpriced mess and far too many bugs have been creeping into the main game. Bizarrely, they also took the decision to remove the (essential!) tutorial from the game with the initial TS 2014 update, so good luck working out what the hell's going on if you're a newbie. They did apparently add the tutorial back in a subsequent update, but half the players still can't find it anywhere in the game, such is its bug-ridden nature.If the game turns up dirt cheap during a sale, by all means check it out if you're curious because there is a working game somewhere in all this mess, but don't go into it expecting a polished experience. Railsimulator.com are currently more interested in bending you over for the DLC rather than fixing the core game. Until they wise up I can't currently recommend this game to interested parties.			"

												This used to be a good train sim but the company has been going downhill ever since. They release buggy DLC which they never play test not to mention their own base game is still buggy. It has also gone down the path of an arcade game as of late rather than trying to push the realism aspect of train simulation. Also, I understand that it requires alot of work to create DLC for their base game, but the pricing for each DLC is overinflated if you ask me. The bugs and glitches don't make it any more appealing to boot.Furtheremore, if you post any negative thoughts or comments regarding their game or DLC, they will delete your posts and ban you PERMANENTLY from their forums.

Unless you have extreme patience or are a train enthusiast, you'd get bored very quickly sitting at your computer for hours on end trying to complete missions which usually take more than an hour to complete. Not to mention- the price! I am so glad I got this game while it was only $7; it is definitley not worth the $40 they are asking for it, when you consider the fact that you do not get a large amount of missions with the game, and that you will have a HUGE hole in your pocket if you decide to go ahead and get all of the DLC- more than $3000!

												Its a quite fun game if you dont feel like doing anything but there are simply not enough routes incuded with the standard package (which I bought) or with the Steam edition. For this reason (and the ones stated below) I can't reccomend the game. If you really want to buy the game, wait till its on sale. Plus the over £2,000 of DLC is just insane.There are many reviews saying that the game has bugs, and it has many of them; engine + break sounds on DB Ice train sound seriously unrealistic (they're not smooth, they go in incriments), the Hamburg to Hannover route ends abruptly, the thing that shows if you're going to tip goes from middle to side really fast if you go past the orange zone and the people walk  incrediby unrealistically, or are just seriously hungover and have serious knee problems.td;lr of below: This game doesnt feel like a simulator or like you're driving a heavy train, is missing tons of features, is really buggy and feels more like an arcade game.There are many other problems such as not most of the inside of the train isnt controllable which dissapoints me (I like pressing random buttons and watching the warning screens go mental), the route builder is just unintuitive, menu's are complicated, there is no loading menu procentage (however this is minor compared to the rest of the problems), no weather effects when out of cabin view, train textures go really bad once you go out of the cabin view, animation glitches (one of them is the blinds on the DB train merge through the roof) and world textures sometimes are awkward because they dont graduate from other ones.I also feel that the physics engine is not there, the speed settings seem to have max speeds they can go (no engine torque simulation from my experience), the derailment looks awkward. It quite simply doesnt feel like you're driving a heavy train (brakes are instant and its really quick to throttle up).The point system is a good idea but too mean (I mean, speeds randomly changing from 60>40>60 and you're getting penalised for the sudden, unshown change) and the drive quality penalty makes no sense as it doesnt feel like you're going too harshly around the corners.The world doesnt seem too real either; the sounds are off. When I'm in a city I expect to hear cars, when I'm in the countryside I expect to hear birds and wind blowing and its just not there. On the subject of weather, the droplets (even though done nicely with the dropping animation) are square and seem to ignore wind and the ""smearing"" effect of the wind and nothing looks wet.Overall out of the 14h played it was fun to the extent of pressing the A and D keys and occasionally the Q key when the British highspeed train (class 395) starts beeping like something's about to blow up. If you're looking for a game which feels ""arcadey"" and not doing much this is the game for you.Edit 1: Corrected some grammar/spelling errors.			"

												Train Simulator offers realism, but often without showing you what you need to do, making scenarios a vague case of trial and error even after having completed every training scenario. So many times I've bumped into a ""mistake"" that undid 15 minutes or more gameplay. Even a successfully completed scenario can result as unsuccessful. Where gameplay should be intuitive and rewarding after 4 hours, by poor design the experience leaves you in the dark and frustrated even 8 hours in. While I have enjoyed this sometimes relaxing game, it's too rough around the edges to be consistently enjoyable enough for me to be happy with it overall. The learning curve isn't worth the needlessly difficult climb to figure out what you need to do unaided, just so you can sit at a station for several minutes waiting for a red light to turn green and wonder what the next problem will be. The trains are cool and seem accurate, but the gameplay has room for improvement.			"

												It's kind of a love-hate-relationship. On the one hand it very likely is the worst simulator in history and not a good game either. It suffers from lots of bugs - huge ones in a simulator like wrong acceleration values of a simulated train resulting in rocket train behaviour or plain wrong diesel tank volume because the devs messed up the liters-gallons-conversion to smaller ones like switches being flipped upside down etc - and super low quality assets like textures with a 90s look an resoution and bad modelling like a round switch not beeing round but an octagon. Also the developer rarely EVER updates the simulated stock so when a DLC has a bug it will stay that way. Another HUGE issue is the sound department as most sound assets are laughably bad. Like heavy freight wagons often having no sound at all. Seeing them glide by like hover cars will make you cry and laugh at the same time.On the other hand DLC from thrid parties (like Reppos GP20, like the Constallation from Smokebox, like the Class 90 from Armstrong Powerhouse, ...) is brilliant with proper sound, proper realism and proper attention to detail and good quality assets. Driving one of those on a nice route (Stevens Pass for example) that is a labor of love from a third party developer and not the usual rushed and buggy junk is incredibly fun.Overall I cannot reccomend this game. While there are combinations that shine (Smokebox Constellation over Marias Pass or Class 90 along the West Coast Main Line from Keith Ross or the Meshtools Jinty on the Western Lines of Scotland), the majority of content ist ... sadly though ... junk. Badly buggy with worse sound and low quality textures and modelling. While you will get a nice collection of worthy content you will also collect a huge amount of content straight of RSCs trashbin.And it's not even about the price of DLC as ther is quite some DLC that is worth the full price like the already mentioned stuff and other 3rd party content. It's the attitude with which RSC treats you and this sim. They don't give a damn, they release buggy DLC over and over and over again. They are not interested in improving. They are not listening or updating their own stuff, they just want to sell you new stuff.While the core might be a nice but badly aging platform for third party developers that actually care, the affiliation with the main developer RSC poisons this whole sim. So one can only reccomend to stay far far away.			"

PROS:- Convincing simulation: In cab controls (lots of dials/switches/buttons), conducting each train feels different and unique enough to be a new experience- Built-in scenario/map creator- Difficulty scalable from practical free roam to very strict failure- Trains are modeled nicely, pretty to look at- Variety of camera controls- Tutorials (can even learn a lot about how trains function IRL)- Tons of DLC to add variety (this is a PRO assuming that money is not an obstacle)CONS:- Base game feels bare and stripped of content, DLC almost required to keep interest- Sound is unpolished/unfinished: trains virtually silent, very little ambient/cabin sound (no immersion via audio at all)- Graphics specifically pertaining to scenery are awful (trains look great, but you're going to spend hours staring at fugly low quality scenery)- Performance: even on a high end machine, you can count on regular FPS drops and chattering of all sorts- Game play (almost by nature) is very repetitive, with long periods of do-nothing.  After ~20 hours, I'm done with it.- Technical difficulty galore... occasionally patches will break the game and leave it unplayable for months on end.- Very little to no developer/community relationship and communicationGOOD BUY?I regret buying this game even at the sale price at the time.  If you absolutely love trains, I would still wait for a deep deep sale.RECOMMENDATION SUMMARYI can't recommend because the cons outweigh the pros by a fairly large margin.  The core of the game is great fun, but where the idea is nice, the execution and details completely fall through.  Adding salt to the wound:  terrible community relations, technical support (most of my emails/tweets/communication went completely unanswered - still have pending support request unresolved from a half year ago).  Even though the game has its fun moments, it's fraught with holes, and is not good value.			"

												First off, I really enjoy the game. The game itself is enjoyable, controlling the speeds, directions, hooking up cars, switching tracks, etc. It really is enjoyable. I bought the Holiday Express pack during the sale for only $3.00. Well worth three dollars. I'm glad I didn't pay the full twenty. There were only a handful of scenarios which took no time to complete. Plus, being the Holiday pack, I only got the Holiday train, despite Steam now insisting I own the full version. Here's the first problem.To have anything else to do, I have to be willing to spend $20 to $30 to unlock more trains and locations. If they are as basic as the Holiday set, total ripoff. And since the total to purchase all of the DLC is over $3000, I can pretty much guess the small amount of content in each pack. Shame too.If this game would include a more broad scope and not be so limiting in the initial purchase, I could see playing this for quite some time. Unfortunately, there really isn't enough to do. And if you are thinking ""Workshop mods"", forget it. Most of them require a DLC pack of some sort, especially seeing as how I somehow don't have access to the default sets, despite Steam's insistance that I own the base game. EDIT: I was able to acquire the full version from a 3rd party for only $20. It added a few more engines and three routes. While fun, the only real claim to any sort of ""time investment"" is that each of the scenarios take anywhere between 45 minutes to over two hours to complete. There still really isn't a whole lot of diversity without paying for each individual DLC. It came with an 80% coupon for a select number of DLC, so I will probably pick one to buy for only a few dollars.. Beyond that, I can't ever see justifying the asking price of the DLC.			"

But since the update to Train Simulator 2013 and now TS - 2014, the playstyle has been dumbed down to a point where I feel using the word ""simulator"" in the same paragraph should be considered a felony! The physics would be comical if the title didn't try to present itself as being ""realistic."" Unfortunately I find myself describing them as ""WTF?"" A single sd40-2 puling a 70 car coal drag up a 5% grade at 40mph with no hesitation or stalling? While at the same time a 4-8-8-4 Big Boy struggles with 40 boxcars on level terrain? Riiiiggghhhtt!!! The sounds for most locomotives, expecially North American models are completely inaccurate, although this may be nitpicking considering there are way worse problems such as over-simplified train controls and buggy scenarios. Long heavy freight trains are also ridiculously quiet, not the thundering beasts that we generally associate them to be. Developer attention was spent on rain and snow effects on the windshields and making the cab rock back and forth instead of making sure it behaved and operated like, you know, a TRAIN!! The one thing this ""simulator"" does do right is graphics. For the most part it is very visually appealing and overall a ""pretty"" game. But for people looking for a serious railroad ""simulator"" consider looking elswhere. (Run 8) This title is for those who want their railroading simulation spoon-fed to them!			"

												I find this game to be good at first, a nice and easy game to get into. After getting past the tutorial, I wanted to drive a steam train. I could not find any. All of the ""16 Stunningly accurate locomotives"" are either eletric or desiel. If the devs wanted more money for their product, im fine with GOOD QUALITY DLC. but its not fine for this over priced remark of nearly $20.00 per train/route, I feel that they are not trying to make it so that you only own what you really want; you pay for 1 engine and you stick to it, im really sad that there isn't even a basic steam engine at all! I would look into other alternatives before investing into this game that has the same principals as the ""Angry Birds"" with very expensive packs that will drain your wallet like mad. I am sad that I did not see the reviews before buying this.			"

												Train Simulator offers realism, but often without showing you what you need to do, making scenarios a vague case of trial and error even after having completed every training scenario. So many times I've bumped into a ""mistake"" that undid 15 minutes or more gameplay. Even a successfully completed scenario can result as unsuccessful. Where gameplay should be intuitive and rewarding after 4 hours, by poor design the experience leaves you in the dark and frustrated even 8 hours in. While I have enjoyed this sometimes relaxing game, it's too rough around the edges to be consistently enjoyable enough for me to be happy with it overall. The learning curve isn't worth the needlessly difficult climb to figure out what you need to do unaided, just so you can sit at a station for several minutes waiting for a red light to turn green and wonder what the next problem will be. The trains are cool and seem accurate, but the gameplay has room for improvement.			"

												Admittedly, the huge amount of paid dlc put me off at first. And this game really is just about driving trains, performing some tasks and not messing up. I do however like trains, and so far I've enjoyed myself learning to drive them. The dlc is something I choose to see as collecting a model train set. In that sense, comparing it to dlc of an average game where more gives you often a fuller experience, does not work.If you are considering this game you likely are looking to just experience driving trains, drive through some nice scenery, enjoy controlling something that requires some proper timing. This game offers that properly in my opinion.Moreso than with other games your purchase will depend on how you regard the pricing scheme. You will likely want some new routes or trains to play with after a while. Do you consider the large offering of paid routes and trains as essentials that should have been (much) cheaper? Then perhaps better stay away. Do you consider this a hobby that will likely require or at least warrent future investments (which you can afford and feel reasonable enough, possibly during sales), then this is indeed a good simulator of what it claims to be in my opinion.

												Not a great game. Crashes frequently, extremely hard to build scenarios...AI trains must be told every little minute detail or they get confused and block everything. Most frustrating are the ""unknown errors"" that pop up from time to time. Very helpful. If AI trains/dispatching was fixed, I think this might be a great game. I have a cheesy iPad Trainz simulator that manages to do this well - you tell trains to go from A to B and the computer makes it happen, even if they have to side for one another.Train SImulator 2014 isn't a game you ""play"". It's a game you spend long hours programming and modelling. My advice? Get a model railroad. It will be easier.  "

												Buggy, Errors when trying to run routes, Missing routes and trains that are suppose to be included.  Developer said to contact steam.  Steam said to contact developer.  Steam then stated they would look into it further and never got back to me.  Also, graphics are not good.  Some reviews said the graphics were good, but they were comparing other train sims.  Compared to modern graphics engines, not good at all.  Also, TS seems like Free to Play, but they are charging.  The content is slim because they want you to buy way high priced trains and routes.

												It's difficult to review this... In itself it doesn't look bad. The tutorials could have been better - you're now doing the same things over and over for each type of train.My main problem is that the game doesn't include much: a cargo route in Germany, a cargo route in the US and a passenger steamtrain riviera route.There's enough available - but at those prices hardly anybody buys it. I think if they halved their prices they would sell a lot more (and I guess their profit will be higher). There are some routes I've got my eye on, but I'll only buy them in a sale with at least 50% off.So due to the prices and lack of content in the base game it's a negative...2016-12-22: Well, they've got a very nice Premium version... but unfortunately it's not a bundle so people that own various pieces of DLC get a nice discount as well!

												It just isn't a finished game. There are plenty of other reviews that go into detail. This is one of those cases where it seems like the dev team all went into different rooms to make the game, then when they were done, they just pasted it all together without refining it very much. All they've done for updates since 2012 is just small optimizations and UI improvements. There are a lot of things that Microsoft Train Simulator 2001 did so much better. That just shouldn't be the case. It's slowly creeping towards being the game it should be. Maybe it'll get there, maybe it won't. Until it gets there, save your money for something else.			"

												The game has potential. It can be fun, if you're into realistic train simulation. The trips can be boring, but if you want realism, you have it.Many of the cool trains need to be bought separately at really high prices (like EUR 19.99). I felt cheated.But the biggest frustration is with the game performance. It's *extremely* slow. According to Fraps, it runs at 7 FPS on my computer, which is able to do much more complex games just fine - including Titanfall. When another train appears in the screen, FPS drops even further. I tried tuning down a few settings but it's still quite bad. It's awful.			"

												The use of DLCs in the game is completely overrated! The price is extremely high and every DLC cost a lot and sometimes even comes with bugs or errors.I honestly enjoy driving the train and that was what lead me to buy the game but I can't see why any one would waste that much money on a game where you have to pay that much for every single DLC. You also only get a very limited scenario list, routes and trains in the main package that you fast get throuh.With that said the comminity and workshop does have a lot of content which is worth mentioning.

*** AS OF September 23, 2015 ***I loaded up TS 2016, browsed through the menus, didn't see any new locos or rollingstock, no new routes, and said ""Nope."" Nothin new, and I knew that they didn't fix any of the bugs because people are still complaining about them, so why waste my time? They may have a new menu look, but that doesn't change the:broken engine, unstable scenarios, buggy world editor, pricey everything, etc.So I didn't bother wasting an additional second of my life and penny of my hard earned cash to upgrade to a more buggy simulator. Now mind you, the time you see for the past two weeks is technically 2016, but without all the upgrades, I did not buy the new one. They keep adding more stuff while not fixing the things we loyal customers have been complaining about for the past 2 years.I really hope that when they release the new Unreal engine that it will be better but I'm not holding my breath. It's a shame really DTG, you can make a beautiful simulator if you all would just listen and APPLY the things we experienced railfans have been talking about! I really hope a Dev will read and reply with regards to this review. No hard feelings DTG, just some tough love. If you all wish to find out more details of what's wrong, go fishing on here! You can turn this around! Please don't think I'm angry, but I'm just a little disappointed of how things are turning out, not only in the game, but in the communitiy as a whole. With respect,-JustinMy rating: 5/10 Engine is old and slow, game has low quality for its price tag, hardly any gameplay fixes; it's more of a pre-release simulator now than a full game/simulator.

												RSC now DTG their product TS2014 , while looking slick with nice Hd graphic's & other tricks, this product is not a Simulation.The history of this game date's all the way back to Microsoft Train Simulator & Kuju Entertainment, when MS dropped the project Kuju Entertainment returned with the simulation Called Rail works 1 & 2 .At this point RSC brought the game rights from Kuju Entertainment & took over the project re-naming it Train Simulator they also carried over all the bugs effecting the Sim too.The product moved onto the Steam platform to make it much simpler to update the game year in year out, so TS2012/13/& 14 are just evolutions & not a new product,Many of the same bugs have been carried over with each update, also each update had led a  nightmare of broken add-on's that have stopped working of simply fail to show up in the menu both from 3rd parties & DTG DLC too.Most of the update have seen the the game go from been a more Sim based product to a arcade feel game.Add to that the fact that DTG Support as a well documented history of been poor at best, there forums are not much better.There is also the endless stream of what would call over price DLC most of which just add's to the list of errors & bug's already effecting the gameI would steer clear of this product If you are looking for a real Train Simulation & not just a over priced digital Train set at best.If you are into simultions you will be let down by this one for sure.

												This game is not as good as the rest of the train simulator series. I have to say this is the most disappointing of all, mostly because of the lousy interface but also because of the lack of trains and routes you start with. The DLC is too expensive and you do not get steam trains included with your first trains. I would not recommend this game to anyone unless you are prepared to spend lots of money on DLC routes and trains.On the plus sides the graphics have improved as well as the in-game physics, but what happened to the train simulator I once loved. Bought this game for my brother with high hopes they would have included good trains again such as the Flying Scotsman and Orient Express which was once included in the game, but Trains like these can only be obtained via DLC.To sum this game up, Despite the great graphics and physics. It has an awful interface, There are a lack of decent trains and comes with very few routes unless acquired through costly DLC.			"

												The only remotely ""good"" things are the graphics and sounds, nothing else including game play, physics, editor and AI makes up for this.It's all a ""cash Cow"" Scheme to catch the gullible people out.The entire time I spent my 45 hours on, was just driving missions on my favourite route, once they were done with there was nothing left to do, so I left for its cousin, Open Rails.This was the biggest waste of money I have ever had to deal with.Oh yeah, did I forget to mention, the graphics are all to do with the model's detail and the quality of the sound recordings of real trains and thus, should NOT be associated with the actual game.The editor is clunky and it's really hard to make any decent railway layout with it since the limitations are so strict (curve radii limitations) and with no tutorials to back it up (other then ones on obscure websites), it makes it hard to come to terms with the environment, when there's no ability to import DEM (Digitally Elevated Maps) or grey scale height maps (surely they would be important enough to be able to import, so you wouldn't be wasting your time creating custom landscapes using tools which should be only used for polishing off the finished map).In terms of AI, it seems very, very limited, even in terms of trainz 2006's capabilities.In trainz railway simulator 2006, you could use triggers and rules to append orders onto trains / trigger events and all of that lovely stuff to create more in-depth game play, whereas in rail works, it's purely an A-B method, there's no dynamics in the orders what so ever which could give real potential to how AI could be used like in trainz railway simulator 2006. (yes, I just did compare a game created in 2014 with a game created 8 years ago, although, technically, it got implemented in TRS2004, passenger service pack).The passenger movements are all nice, but it's not that big of a deal, compared to what I've listed here, which would be core game elements.Derailing within tunnels... Yeah, your train gets thrusted upwards... Great job at making trains fly.Payware content, there simply is too much of it, I mean $2K on steam, it seems a little excessive.			"

												This game is great when you spend a fortune of money for all the DLC. But come on, this game looks unfinished.PROS:Graphics Quality: Stunning, better than other train simulators I came across.Amount of DLC: There is a lot to complete your collection, but there are gripes with this (see below), but overall there is a variety.Workshop: The Community pays so much attention into detail in their scenarios, some of them even replicate a real life service.CONS:DLC Prices: Probably my biggest gripe out of everything. Seriously, we have to pay £1000+ to get all routes and trains. Well a lot of the routes are good, but it comes to the trains. The recycled sounds, train physics. The DLC contains little effort for such a high price.DLC Layout: You get less than 1/4 of the DLC when you buy the base game which means you have to spend a fortune for all DLC. All other games I played have their DLC in a bundle (Yes I know some DLC is bundled, I mean like there should be bundles for parts of countries (London and South East England, South West England, Anglia, Midlands etc.) Settings Control: You can't tune settings whilst in a scenario which means you have to exit the scenario to change settings. Come on, no other game has this.Bugs: Some of the older routes have bugs that have persisted into present time and have never been fixed.Simulation Accuracy: The train physics aren't very realistic, to slow/fast breaking and slow/fast acceleration, the class 466 included in the Sheerness Branch Extension route is the worst of all. Come on, stop rushing on your DLC and take your time to get the simulation accuracy excellent, in which I have to say, third-party developer Waggonz is the best of all. Also a lot of the trains don't have functioning destination displays (unless you go into Scenario Editor and change the destiination) and fully functioning headlights (You only get Day Head/Marker Lights and Tail Lights) and I know DTG have recently started this.Train Sounds: A lot of the sounds of the trains are recycled from other trains and don't sound like the real thing. Please take the time to perform a recording session so you can record the exact sounds just like what Armstrong Powerhouse is doing.OVERALL: A fairly good game, if only DTG wouldn't price so much for literally low-quality DLC and actually make it a proper, realistic simulator rather than do things enough to get a train moving.Do I recommend it?: Only in a sale of at least 40% off.Rating: 6/10			"

												First of all, please note I would only recommend to an avid train enthusiast but not to an individual that knows nothing about trains. The base game itself is quite positive for those looking to have a realistic driving experience (3rd or 1st person), but the reason i advise non-train buffs to not purchase it is because of the amount of facts and figures you will come across and the fact that if you are not into it, then the DLCs are useless. The total DLC cost is well over a £3000 which makes it an incredibly over-priced game for what it is; a simulator. For £3000 you could buy a real train. Although, being an enthusiast myself, it is excellent to have a wide range of locomotives, routes and skin packs to be able to customize your fleet. A real con is where they sell you a train for £11.99 and call it new even though it has only been re-skined. Of course you do not have to buy every single DLC, but for instance I have spent over £150 on DLCs alone, way too much for a simulator. A good feature of this game is the create your own route feature. This is very complex but once you have learnt the basics, an excellent way to plan out a model railway. There are also modes such as free-roam (self-explanatory), scenario based, career scenario based and quick drive. Quick drive was added in quite a recent update and is one of my preferred modes; you are able to select any locomotive on any route, setting the time and day etc... Comparibly the scenarioes are excellent and with the addition of the workshop are seemingly endless. Overall, not a great game but don't allow the 200 and something hours tell you otherwise; please note, this was a big waste of my life and I do not want it to be yours. This game (even though I stated it was good for enthusiasts etc...) makes dept a real issue and if you're stupid enough to add all of the DLCs to the cart then you might as well get another bank account. I may play it an awful lot, but honestly the outdated graphics may be the best for a train simulator, but the development company to take over this game hasn't evolved since the 1998. The trains do look excellent, but the AI are all the same in effect only retextured to the time period or the characters gender. I'd say a 4/10 would be being pleasant to the developers but it isn't a good choice for Christmas. I would plead you not to purchase an absorbing 2009/10 based sim that hasn't been updated (as in the bugs fixed or graphice improved) since its release.			"

												This game isn't horrible, but its not worth $10 let alone $80. I would value it at 5 bucks because you get about 3 maps and a miniscule amount of trains. If you want anything more, you will have to buy it for 5 or more dollars. The graphics are not great, and there isn't much to do after you leave a station. It would be much better if you had breakdowns or more happening. I can see why this game was 80% off, becuase its a bit of a scam.			"

												Personally, I love trains, it was amazing and all, but then the 2016 update came.Let's see, back in 2014-15, the total cost of all DLC was $1,365.89 USD, now, it's $3,096.48 (During the sale)and let's start with the positive stuff:I keep my old DLC.Now, the negative stuff:""Better UI"" my ♥♥♥Graphical tweaks? NoSean Bean? He was removed.Wait time to load the game? 45-56 f*cking minuteshonestly it's more laggy, and I don't see the perpose of saying alot of new things were added besides DLC, as there morally is nothing new added, but more of alot of stuff Removed.And also basically the steam workshop is for people who have the money to own every single DLC this game can offer.Not to mention the loading screen for levels have buttons that are mainly unclickable because the game freezes constantly while loading.Do I recommend this game? Well from 2014 and the years before that, Yes. 2015 and onward? Heck no. Dovetail, I truely loved this game before you started to do little tweaks like removing the intro and changing the splash screen, but I want to see some actual additions besides running off of DLC. Games aren't meant for mainly DLC, it makes it seem like nothing will be added without having to fork some money over. So, if you guys want to buy this game, be my guest, it is nice, but you will see alot of things that aren't in the game like it is in the trailer or screenshots.			"

												Ok, just don't buy this game. It sucks on every aspect. It's not worth your time. You'll be judged by everyone. It's horrible, I run this game at 20 fps with all graphics turned up with a dual gtx 780i... If you can see this, leave this page and never come back!Out of the 10 hours I have played the game, I simply cannot find ANYTHING that is beneficial. Dovetail got everything wrong... here's a few I saw:GRAPHICS: The graphics engine sucks, I have a high-end gaming PC, with 2 GPU's, and I can't get over 60 fps, I swear... I don't know if it's me, because I cannot find a solution on the internet. Also, I have noticed countless bugs, the background and the environment look ugly, and there is barely any effort in any of the level design, it's plain,  and boring .PEOPLE: The Ai for the people is worse. Way worse. People in the game FADE in an out of the trains, they don't bother to walk in and out, they go through walls, walk off platforms, and some of the models (including the driver) give me nightmares. They are creepy as f***SUPPORT: The support for the game is bad enough, the facebook page is spammed with it, and according to the comments, they have had to remove and download the 6 GB of space this game takes up, and nothing works for most people. I have had countless crashes when launching, nothing worked, but 2 weeks ago it started randomly working again, and i don't think there was any kind of patch. I also had a review before this, and the delevopers replied:""To clarify the features of TS2015:-Amazing trains and locations to drive-A stunning carrer mode-An easy-to-use development kit""This, I can say is bull. You have barely any trains and locations at the start, the carrer mode is boring, and I dont know how to operate the flipping DK! And I'm a 3-D modeller!!THE DLC, OMG THE DLC: When you spend $40 on a game, surely you should get everything the game offers you? Nope. This game gives you 6 trains and 3 lines off the bat... WITH DLC ABOUT $20 EACH!!![/b] Appauling. If you want everything, you'll have to spend about $20,000 for the lot... Noteven worth it if you are a quarillionaire, since none of them even work... This is the worst part about it.[/list]In Short...Get off this page, don't even think about buying it... I'm saving you money... Be Grateful!! "

												I bought the original TS2012 back in 2011 (the retail version from Amazon) and I was a really great train fan. It came with the original content and I liked it until it started to cause viruses to my PC. Thing is, RailSimulator (Now owned Dovetail Games) was glad to update to a free version to the new TS but, they should at least update to the current new stock. It costs $5000 in total for all DLC and usually a DLC route costs $30 and a DLC train costs $20 which is to overpriced. Therefore, I dont recommend this game.			"

												Disappointed, I am. Downloaded this game and wish I hadn't. I remember seeing the turbo loco many moons back, and got close to excited seeing that it and the DD40X were now available for TS2016. So, I got it. Sad. There's NO turbo loco. The game's just called ""Train Simulator"", no year given, though STeam sold it to me as TS2016.    Oh, and it's consistently crashing on me, even afterun- and re-installing the game three times. You'd do well to wait for them to someday fix this game, make it right, make it worth the money they're askin' for it. TS2014 was a fairly good train sim. TS2016, unfortunately, is a HUGE staep back.

The gameplay is simple, control your train, don't go off the rails, don't have a murderous rampage, and so on. The graphics are outdated, especially the character models. Blech. All achievements pretty much require you to buy DLC, which is unfair. Also, the DLC is really expensive, and there's way too many DLCs. Plz don't buy			"

THE ULTIMATE TS2014 REVIEWThe game does exactly what it says on the tin. And I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not. If you are a huge fan of trains (like a certain character from an overrated TV show) then by all means pick this up and you will probably get many wet dreams over it. But for everyone else who see trains as a rather average transportation method to get you from Point A to Point B, then you won't get much out of this game, hence why I don't play this game.Razey's Score:3/10 "

It's fun, and the wide variety of trains, tracks, and routes has will keep anyone who loves trains entertained for a long time. The key is to pay attention to sales, if you are looking to buy this.

												This is without a doubt the worst supported application on the planet. I am a game developer myself and, while a one man shop, I manage to provide answers and support to my customers. Not everyone is happya, but, hey! I try. The train simulator people have been given years of polite questions and requests for support from me. Even though I have spent more money on the train simulator than an other game I own, I have been either ignored or denigrated by their staff. If you want abuse, by all means, get this game. Any tech support question will get you an automated response which ambiguiously indicates that you both should and should not reply to it. Whatever you reply, you will be ignored. If the staff ever responds to my questions and bug reports, I will retract this review. However, I'm not holding my breath. Spend your game money elsewhere.			"

												Still carrying sfter all this time the same major issues both in the quality of its stock and the pretty poor (at times pathetic) physics. Each update does slowly make some things better but then breaks other things. Just never  buy the DLC at full price.. Im convinced its just a ploy to make the sales seem more attractive but to be honest the sale prices should be the norm for what can often be lillte more than a pretty poor repaint.. And the DLC is the key problem and cause of this simulators new direction .. The new front end and the way the game is marketed have turned it into nothing more than a giant marketplace where all effort is put into producing DLC and little or no effort is placed in fixing issues. Its slowly becoming less of a simulator and more a hornby model railway for you to add shiny trains to.There have been a cpl of improvements. US routes now have much better asset variation  (Weirdly UK ones still tend to look like clones of each other despite the higher asset count, must be the grey and green)..  And whilst TSX has without doubt made this the best looking TS on the market, it does tend to make evreything look strangely plastic and false. The final problem ahs to be the level of support which is frankly non existant.. Not only is all criticsm  removed from the forums  but bug reporting is also deleted with the excuse you must email the poroblems directly to them. When you do this you get a robot response and then nothing ..			"

												I have owned this game on Steam for about four years, I think.  Been awhile anyway.  I have enjoyed it, although every year when they update, the experience has tended to deteriorate as apparent inefficiencies and bugs are introduced.   It's fun if you enjoy train simulators and is probably the best on the market from that perspective.  Yes, there is a lot of DLC, and yes getting it all would cost a small fortune.  This really hasn't affected me a great deal since it is still far cheaper than the model trains and accessories I collect.  There is absolutel no requirement to buy any DLC to enjoy the game as intended.  DLC is just an expansion, much like a new set of tracks and models is an expansion to a model rail display.That said, I do not recommend this game to new players.  As noted, its quality is getting worse.  Support is essentially non-existent.  The community can be toxic.  It's not fun anymore.With the release of 2016, I can no longer play any part of the game except the part where you fill out a marketing survey.  Every route is a blackscreen, and the game eventually gives up and crashes.  I am too tired to fight a battle with ignorant techs and seemingly intentionally unhelpful support people so I can do something I should find relaxing.   That's not relaxing; it's infurating, and I am done.So, uninstall it is, and I'll consider my experiences an expensive lesson in how not to carry on your train hobby once your model set has become too large for your living space.

												The game is playable and can be enjoyable to a person that likes simulators and likes trains. Where this game fails is that the base game is stark with only three runs and just a few routes on those three routes you run out of things to do in a big hurry.To really get into this game you must buy DLC and that is where the stings is. If a person were to buy all DLC it would be $3500.00. Nobody in their right mind is buying all that.The game runs clean and looks good, but I would not recommend it if you want to buy it and put alot of hours on the base game without DLC purchase.(Edit Oct.2014) As of the TS 2015  update the game is not much better and certian scenarios do not load properly. I would hvae thought in all this time they would have figured these problem out but I guess not.

												Train Simulator places itself in a very strange middle ground between game and simulator, and it doesn't seem to come close enough to being either one to please very many people. The user interface is very simple and easy to use, but lacks quite a few details that would make the experience more capable and realistic, in other words closer to the ""simulator"" that it's claiming to be. In-cabin interaction is kept to a bare minimum with many dials, levers and buttons except only the most critical locked away as background decoration.Games are long, but that's to be expected with any simulator. Most casual players will quickly find themselves getting bored however, since the driver's usual job is essentially just a speed regulator. If you can be entertained enough by the sound and look of your engine as it cruises down the track for an hour or so, then you're golden.I've been debating with myself whether or not to bring up the downloadable content, since it's something that's always brought up in other reviews, but I guess I might as well while I'm here.The average price for a new locomotive is $20 USD without sale. It's a famously bad deal and one that's never been addressed or remedied by Dovetail. They only feature so many engines in the game itself because they expect people to pay for their ludacrisly overpriced DLC to compensate. Because of this association, I believe that it comes as a detriment to the game itself.Rail fans and sim fans alike deserve better than what they were given. As someone who's both, I'm disappointed to say the very least.			"

												I once wrote a positive review then I realized that this game is a scam. Why? Because the developers are lack of every aspects of striving for good, because Dovetail probably has no quality management and it's marketing department are made of greedy liars. Let's cut to the chase...+ Oh, there is a train simulator out there and it looks beautiful- The game itself isn't optimized a bit. Don't tell me, that this outdated graphic and simulation has so much appetite, that a GTX 750 VGA, a Phenom X2 CPU and 8Gbyte RAM is not enough! On bigger railway stations even with this configuration the FPS drops measurably. To be honest the FPS drops without any input even on high-end desktops and it is probably because of the sloppy programming and the lack of testing and quality inspections. Did I mention loading time? Oh, you can have a dinner but if you are a smoker, one slim cigarette is guarenteed even with the recommended system specs.- The simulation could be fun until you realize that most of the locos are lack many of the essential controls and most of the switches, buttons are inactive textures serves only for design purposes. Don't tell me that a simple loco has only brakes and throttle, pantograph and headlight switches! - In many cases the HUD's speed limit signs are not in syncron with the actual railroad tracks vica versa. I don't really use the HUD because it's buggy but if you are driving in career mode with enabled scoring system you are f**ed up, because the game sometimes follows the HUD's speed limitation not the actual railroad signs and again vica versa. - In most cases PZB is bugged too. PZB (german train control system) is quite hard to master and this game makes it even harder. And by the way sometimes Sifa doesn't work either.- There are mostly only german, us and british routes available, and it is getting boring. Especially the US routes, those locos are totally inactive ones.- The greed of the company is unmatched in the game industry. They overprice their DLCs and lie about the features and developements. The whole company is based on low-down marketing. They even delete negative comments from their community forums. What they did with the release of the 2016 edition is the most shameful episode in the history of gaming. They even made a 20 minute youtube video about a new menu which basically is a re-colored one. What an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, really! :-DYou shouldn't buy this game unless you are a railfan! Despite all the negatives it can give you some pleasant time but it's absolutely overpriced and doesn't worth even 10 euros.			"

												Lets clear the air right now. I dont like a simulator that is so real it feals like work when you use it. Also I am not now nor have I ever worked on a railroad. I enjoy ts because its just real enough for you to get an idea about how trains work but not so real you could go out, hop in a train and drive it away. The realism level of this program is on the same level of farming simulator. If you are Mr. Ultrarealsimulation Do NOT get this. You will be disappointed. If you are a railfan who enjoys casual train operation you will probably enjoy this. With that said, if you are the casual railfan, The DLC is mind blowingly expensive. You cannot even begin to comprehend how much money you could spend purchasing enough DLC to make this more enjoyable. If you think you  will get the vanilla version and call it good, you are mistaken. The standard version comes with three routes and only a handful of locomotives and no steam engines at all. If you want any more routes or locomotives get your wallet out and dont bother putting it away. Even if you want any of the free crap avaliable at the steam marketplace you will first need to have the necessary DLC and that will cost you dearly. If you are new to the franchise, there is a pretty steep learning curve. It doesnt help that the ingame tutorials suck as well. Support? What Support? I have not had one good experiance with the support team. All I got from the support team was a standard response and no fix to my problem. I emailed them back a second time and they essentially told me, Too bad for you, we wont be fixing anything any time soon.Even with all the issues, I still very much like the game and I do not regret getting it. I wish there were fewer problems with it and I wish it was cheaper to get the DLC. But like they say Deficate in one hand wish in the other see which one gets filled first. That is why I cannot recommend this. There is no intent on fixing known issues and bugs. I am willing to overlook these bugs, but, unless you really like trains, there are too many problems and the staff doesn't care about these problems. On top of all that, the thing is stupidly expensive. You would think for such an expensive product, there would be fewer bugs but that is not the case. Its a shame though because this title has so much potential.EDIT: 10/14Got the new update. I now use TS 2015. What the folks at TS did to update the simulator was to make my PAID FOR content vanish like a fart in the wind. DO NOT BUY. Instead of fixing problems they released a new version and now there goes several of my hard earned bones. This is a title with much potential but the developer keeps getting in the way of what could be a wonderful simulation game.			"

												Sadly, I have to agree with all the negative reviews all over the web about this game.What potentially, is a great concept, being able to drive a train in several countries, and also being able to build what is essentially your own train set layout, is sadly let down by all the bugs in the game, that have been there for years.The developers, Dovetail Games (DTG), seem either not capable, or too lazy to solve these bugs that frankly spoil the enjoyment of the game.They also delete all negative comments in the forums too, which is not a good sign. Thankfully they cannot touch this review!I can see that this ignorant blinkered attitude from the developers will end up with them going out of business before long.If you want to keep your hair, steer clear of this game.500+ hours on this game and Im nearly bald!

												I had high expectations for this game when I first purchased it, but it seems those expectations were never met.The gameplay and graphics seemed better than what I had experienced playing older versions of Trainz as well as the variety of scenarios and equipment. However, Trainz runs fine on most regular PCs and they don't make you pay ridiculous amounts of money for more routes and content to add to the game. The DLC for this game is expensive for what it is and when you buy the base game you're not given many routes or equipment thus forcing you to buy the proprietary Dovetail DLC from their store or from Steam. The dynamic lighting feature is tied directly to locomotive headlights that actually produce light, so if you turn it off you get the wonderful sensation of driving a train without being able to see what's ahead of you. The game also has ridiculous system requirements in order for it to run properly. The sensitivity of the scenario scoring is also quite ridiculous as well as some of the ways that the in-game physics work. I still play this game because I payed good money for the base game as well as the DLC, but I have mixed feelings playing it as well as paying any more money for their expensive DLC. If anything I find playing the other steam games to be better value for game play than this or even just any of my other hobbies compared to this game. Don't buy this game unless you have a powerful computer and are willing to spend tons of money on actually buying enough content to fully enjoy the game. If anything it'd be better to try and find a different train simulator to play other than this one.			"

												This game is fun but it has TONS of FLAWS! It even has FATAL FLAWS! This makes the game WORST!Here are the examples.1. Overpriced DLCThe most expensive price for route DLC is $39.99. The most expensive loco DLC is $29.99. I could by a game cheaper than it's most expensive DLC. The most expensive route DLC shoud be only $15.00. The most expensive loco DLC should be $6.50.2. DLC SystemAlso on the Holiday Express it says go 100 MPH but the speed sign says 25,30,45 when the 100 MPH limit does not go away. And they care more about DLC then bugs.3. Impossible To DoLets say I want to make a custom loco. I have to use RW_Tools. There is no loco editor in the game or the Railworks folder. Plus RW_Tools cost money. If I want to use any wagon or locos in the quick drive train creator, It only lets me do certain locos and wagons.4. BugsThe game will create dump files randomly. Not just my computer but a gaming computer has these problems as well. I played this game on a gaming computer before and it still creates dump files. My Isle Of Wight DLC has some bugs. When I play on of the scenarios the scenario crashes.5. UnpredictableLet's say I want to drive a train. Sometimes wheel slips happens unexpectedly while i'm driving a train.6. Requires gaming computer.I don't have a gaming computer, here is my computer hardware information.Intel(R) Pentium(R) CPU B950 @ 2.10GHz 2 Core4GB RAM7.Worst Then EAI did not think there could be a company worst then EA. Well there is, it's name is dovetail, they created railworks and we all know how bad it is. Some of us.8. A message to the game developersI just want to say this ""Why are you making people not want to play this game."" With your overpriced DLC and lack of bug fixing it is making the people not want to buy TS2014 but would rather buy Trainz, A-Train 8. You need to fix the price of the DLC and fix the bugs on the game. You do not want this game to have more bugs than a beehive LITERALLY! Plus you might want to bring back that Amtrack G-Trax DLC.(Update) Thank you for putting the P42 adoon back on steam. Please fix the game!9. Something good about the gameThey put pack the P42 DLC back!			"

												I had Train Simulator a few years ago and loved it. I saw it in the summer sale with a bunch of DLC at a great prince thought to myself ""great deal here"", so i bought it. Now I'm regretting it a little. It has its moments where it's really good, but lots of flaws. First off, the vast amount of DLC is amazing, I can't knock the amount of DLC available i even bought a good few packages in addition to the summer sale stuff i got. Customer service ""stinks"" though! Recently the game just refuses to load. Gets as far as ""Dovetail games"" splash screen then crashes. I Opened a support ticket thought ""oh no problem will get back to me in a day or two....."" That was 4, maybe more days ago, still no answer. Still no working game. I uninstalled it, reinstalled it. It Worked got an hour or two out of it. Closed it to go out. Come home started it up doesn't work again. Same Problem.   I agree with a lot of other comments for devs. Stop throwing DLC out or rehashing some existing with different liveries and make patches. There are so many buttons that do not work. Please sort it out! It can't be a simulator if half the stuff doesnt work. Also undocking the HUD would be great as well or at least a lot more customisable layouts. Also answer your support tickets or even at least read them! Gameplay wise its ok, controls are easy to learn etc but still majority of the buttons in the cab don't work. Also reduce the cost of DLC some of it is so overpriced and you only get 1 maybe 2 scenerios out of it. Also the driving is a little too perfect.... What happened to keeping drivers alert? No emergency cord pulls, nothing running out onto the tracks, random broken down trains. You know realism day to day things that could happen. The only thing keeping drivers alert is the fact the EWS screams when you go through amber lights. I would reccomend this, but not with the current level of customer service. That needs drastic improvement.			"

												PROS:- good game if you are a train enthusiast.- intro video is neat- i really cant say much. just too much wrong with this gameCONS:- game is very unpolished. things like the narration dialog boxes feel cheap and the additional hud controls seem like they can be so much better.- train horns suck. you can hear the looping, which is dead obvious on certain engines, and it doesnt even play back as you intend most of the time.- zoom mechanism is very shoddy when in 3rd person. if you 'ram' the camera down into the car behind the engine in focus, it'll push the camera location out and away. yet when you scroll, it basically crops and zooms the visible area of the camera without actually moving it TO the engine in focus.- - not only 3rd person, but it really needs to be improved in general. it seems too constricted to pre-set areas. especially when going through tunnels and such.- the headlights seem nearly ineffective. like the only thing it's doing is giving the engine a lit up look.- and my biggest complaint: so much expensive DLC yet every one i've tried has an issue with it. things like a train coming at you head on whenever you get to a certain point, with no way to avoid it or complete the scenario. or improperly set timings. or random unmarked speed zones which slaughter your points, forcing you to restart if you want to make gold. or any metal for that matter.- objectives seem unclear or confusing at times- just general bugs, inconsistencies, problems, unpolish.CONCLUSION:dont buy this game unless you mind the bugs, unpolish, and are willing to research good packs that dont have any issues.OTHER THOUGHTS: most companies release software (not just games) on a 2 step cycle: new features, then bug fixes. they push out new features one update, then fix all the bugs the next. rinse and repeat. this company fails to do so. they're more worried about pushing out content as fast as possible than they are about giving us a quality game. its a shame this is the best train sim that's out there. sure, they updated to *better* menus and looks a few times. but its still confusing to navigate. it took me forever to find the community content section within the game, and i wouldnt be able to remember off hand from not playing it for a while.BEST SOLUTION: redo the whole damn game. and dont come out with any more DLC until you do. and work on fixing and testing the DLC (yeah, its a lot. which is why you shouldve been doing this in the first place). game test a lot and think ""how can i make this better?"" ""would i personally play and enjoy this?"" ""would this be easy for everyone? or just me?""PS: i dont mean for this to sound negative. i genuinely do want this game to get better. but if they keep going their same path, it never will and itll just get worse and worse.

												The amount of DLC, poor controls, and poor scenario explanation first time through make this simulation bad. All of the flight simulators easily put this to shame. Shuttering graphics, lack of community modding ability, and a manual that doesn't really get to the information are just sad. Of note, I was a conductor on UP for 3 years. I thought this would be a fun knock back to the past, but nope. I regret buying this on discount.			"

												Trainsimulator 2014 is a simulator in the ""driver's ed"" sense; there is no crashing, no disobeying the rules, and you are penalized for going slightly over the speed limit.  Worse, the controls are weak; the throttle snaps to various large-increment amounts forcing you to babysit your speed on real-time journies - some exceeding an hour in length.  The graphics are reasonably pretty and there are various facilities to make your own assets, but ultimately, this is no game, it's a substitute for steel and resin model trains.  Except you can crash those, if you like.			"

												When you buy into the TS franchise what you're really getting is a game engine, a platform, and a pretty average one at that when you consider the graphics and stability. It's not a bad engine (pun intended) but it's nothing to write home about either. This really isn't a proper game until you start buying the addons and DLC, and a quick browse of the obscene prices will leave most new customers feeling a bit nauscious. Is it worth the investment? No. There are better alternatives in the market that don't try to milk you for every penny.			"

												I grabbed this ages ago on hefty Steam discounts... And, that's honestly where the value is.+ 2015 version has great UI+ Fun to drive trains+ Interesting tutorials+ lots of workshop content+ started with 2013 edition, free upgrade to 2015+ some free DLC (known as Classic Routes in the workshop)+ career system seems interesting so far- some tutorials need better explanations (ie: when breaking, explaining what wheel slippage is and why it happens would be nice.. or the right time to start slowing down when a speed limit is changed, etc)- even with beefy spec'ed machine I still lagged out in certain areas- graphics could be plenty better or at least better polish- riddled with bugs- insane base price- insane DLC pricesMy positive and negative bullet points basically sum it all up. It's a neat game, and there's a lot of great stuff here. But is it worth $60CAD? Heck no, not compared to so many other titles out there. Why is that? Because for AAA prices, I don't want to see ""ID Not Found"" when trying to create my profile. I don't want to see lag or framerate drops on my high-spec'ed machine every time I pass through a town - and all the other little bugs. This is further worsened by the DLC prices - when they are priced the same as full-version titles, and I can read about how they have the same craftsmanship (aka riddled with bugs), I'm just not going to take the chance at getting burned. And that is disapointing, because I like sinking my teeth in detailed sims; and I'm not afraid of opening my wallet and investing considerable sums into a game to support it... But when the title is riddled with bugs, the content (such as the tutorials) need further ironing out and so on, you cannot justify these prices - no matter how niche-market the title is.I guess I can conclude this all by saying that in the end, I am enjoying it. A) because I did get the base copy and some DLC for cheap, and B) because my base copy keeps getting updated for free; so it's hard to really feel ripped off. So I am enjoying it - but I'm disappointed because I feel like my replay value is going to be capped until I can get some more DLC for cheap; because I won't be paying their regular price that's for sure. I wish I could say maybe on the reccomendation... but it has to come down to this: until they drop their base prices for the game and the dlc to something more fitting the quality of the game you're getting right now, my reccomendation has to be no.tl;dr; Great Steam Sale buy if it's dirt cheap (60-70% off or more I'd say). Game is nice, but buggy. Insane DLC prices will likely hurt replay value.. but I'm still enjoying it (since I did get it cheap ages ago) so far.			"

DLC's are very expensive, which kind of irritates me a little bit. I would not recommend this game because it's an unfinished game, and $39.99 wouldn't be a bad price if it had less bugs and it didn't feel as unfinished, but with a few patches, polish on the map's, I think this game will turn out great.

												This game could be so much fun. Instead, the user interface is clunky, the camera control is very limited and makes you feel locked down, and the game comes down to just one thing: watching the tracks go by, without much interaction.In my mind, I want to be an engineer who controls the train, can check for news on delays, weather, last minute changes, all while trying to get the train where it needs to be on time. I was looking forward to changing off the back end of the train cars, as they would be going to a different location. I was hoping to have interaction with the train crew notifying me about trouble with cars, requiring me to pull over at a non-scheduled station stop. I don't want to just pick my engine and cars, I want to make it matter which engine and cars I pick, because maybe Amtrak only uses specific cars. Maybe the track I'm traveling on is the only track open due to construction, and there's another train coming. Will I crash? Will I cause hundreds of people to have a very bad day? I'll never know!This game so far is ironically like a train wreck. Good luck getting that to happen in the game, though.			"

												I would recommend this game to people if there wasen't over $3K in DLC that came with it. Seriously? $3K+? should all be under $1 for each one. So for the price of the game and then the cost to have a little more fun I'm not going to recommend this game to others. Unless you have $3K+ to blow on a game, then yes go for it. Otherwise, don't bother			"

												The best time to buy this game is during the huge Steam sales that happens once in-awhile. The prices are not worth the computer freezing and unchallenging scenarios provided. Asking for help from support is an exercise in futility as they have an apparent lack of reading comprehension when they do respond.With that said, when the game is playable with scenarios from the community, it can be enjoyable.

												The Train Simulator franchise is amazing all together, the detailed trains, real life routes... I could go on.But if you start out by buying the Train Simulator 2014 Standard Pack, you will recieve 3 routes. (1 ONLY Works on Quick Drive, 1 ONLY works on Quick Drive and Standard, but there is only 1 route that is usable through all modes, the game brings you into a custom train mode, this can be fun but it can also be boring, you pick your favourite train, and you see a carridge you would like on the end, would it work? No! This mode consists with Coupling Errors and it can be a pain!Overall I would not recommend this because this game is hinting for you to buy the DLC, yes DLC can be fun but £2013 worth of DLC? Wow, thats just greedy.			"

												A nice and shiny ""simulator"" from the initial perspective, it really isn't ""simulation"" quality. For a gist of all the problems, just take a look at all the other reviews. However, what really bothered me the absolute most was the lack of built-in content and the absolutely ridiculously priced DLC (it's like EA was in charge of this). Want to drive a steam? Too bad, $20 (which is what the entire initial game should be priced at for the amount of built-in content). If you want a crapload of built-in content for a good price, go check out Trainz; although its engine is outdated, the next version is due for massive overhaul (sorry if I sound like I'm marketing, just wanting to suggest an alternative to check out).

												Train Simulator is representative of a franchise that seeks to offer a semi-realistic representation of what it would be like if you were a conductor. The thing is, there isn't really a game here. There is very little to keep you interested for more than a few minutes unless you're playing the game ironically for some sort of media-review or livestream event.There is very little to guide you ingame as to what you're supposed to do and simply getting a game going in career mode is relatively unintuitive. The game tries to push paid DLC at you at every turn (charging extraordinary amounts of cash for things that should have been in the game from the get-go) often times disrupting the obvious methods by which you actually initiate a game session.If you can get this for really cheap (we're talking under 10 dollars) it might be worth checking out purely for the irony (and if you're planning on playing it ironically to an audience that values your suffering at the helm of ridiculous/broken games).

												I would really love to be able to give this the thumbs up.....and yet I can't. The potential is certainly there; in fact, it's not that far from being a good game. But at the end of the day you are just met with frustration.The graphics, considering that this game is 75% about the visual experience, are nothing special though that is hardly surprising given the age of the graphics engine. The physics....well, not knowing what driving a steam engine would really feel like I cannot say that it makes me think I am. But despite these deficiencies I find it strangely compelling to drive a commuter train and there is a real sense of achievement when you have kept it to time.Then, however, comes the frustrating part. The latest annual update made a whole mess of the game; an unwieldy and counter-intuitive menu system, scenarios which now no longer work, graphical glitches galour and achievements which can now no longer, well, be achieved. And a company which basically does not listen to its customer base but prefers to bury its head in the sand.A new version with a brand new graphics engine is apparently in the pipeline which will then become the flagship. We are promised that support for this version will continue but I have to ask myself.....given DTG's track record is that really likely given that profits seem to be the be all and end all with customer service rather well down the list?

The behavior of the train cars when they supposed to fall off from the track is ridiculous. The game is an eviscerated version of TS2014: dead end menu points remained in this ""game"" from where i can exit only with ALT&F4. The product is full of advertisements in video and image format which is strange and annoying from a paid game. From this money i could have bought a die cast toy train for him.

												A very realistic train simulator.But youn CAN'T Redifine the keyboard at all. I wanted to have the brake controls on the left, the AWS cancellation on theright with the throttle and horn controls there as well. I wanted to alter the keys to be close as possible to the HST cab layout.The horn is not correct for uk trains, I wanted to map it to the cursor controls on my keyboard to be able to sound it correctly as per rule book instructions. Eg Some times you need to blow both tones, others a long one horn blast is needed. Has a loud and soft setting as well for both horns.Im not recomending this game only because you cant redefine the keys on the keyboard. No ready to start signalfrom the guard on the buzzer. train horn not correct.			"

												Train Simulator is an AMAZING game. Its my favourite game of all time! I thought it would be amazing! But it dosent work. First it was really laggy, they never fix any bugs, it shows saved to temp dump file every 20 mins or so. Long routes may take longer than 5 mins to load and you can only drive about 5 to 50 miles before on error occurs. Their is not a huge collection of addons which cost over £2000 so far! I bought it in November and so far I have got no where and over the last few weeks i cant even load up the menu before it crashes. Did i mention it has viruses? No? Also their are no instuction for anything at all. Ive been depending on amateurs from google and youtube to get my tutorials no offense. I would of sold it months ago if i haden't bought any DLC addons. Did you know the 5 mile route in Isle Of White is £20. This company iss stupid and never listens to your complaining about bugs. Did they say that theirs applications hidden away in the game files which you need to download and change the options to make it work, NOT ME!!! They just make games and never update or fix,but they just expect you to play it?! If your new to train simulator or steam dont bother, go somewhere else because these are a bunch of stupid idiot immature ametuer non game designing self centered losers! Thanks for reading			"

												Train simulator 2016 has been released a few months ago and so it is time to give it a proper reviewFirst things first, this review will not be about prices, I can't give a rats ♥♥♥ about the price of either the game or the DLC. This game is mainly sold on Steam as is the official DLC and Steam has enough sales each year that the price of a game or DLC means diddlysquat. You find the prices to high, wait a few weeks and chances are they drop 50 to 80% for a few days. You are never more than 3 months away from a good deal.The goodThe current incarnation of Train Simulator is Train Simulator 2016. Personally I think it is one of the best yearly updates I have seen for those that bought the new edition. It has some very nice content coming with it, the new menu look is great, the new search works finally like a search should work and the content I played so far is of the better quality. My personal favorite in this years edition is the Union Pacific Gas Turbine also known as the GTEL. The new DB BR155 is a nice German engine as well and the new Riviera in the fifties route with its 5 Steam engines is one of the better route add ons I have seen in a long time. Ok, Sherman Hill and Cologne to Koblenz are reruns but if you didn't already own them they are two good additions for your collection. the Steam edition also packs the Norfolk Southern Coal District and the SD60M. The last one was added a bit later to the pack but everyone that bought the game got the engine regardless.Also good is the TS rewards that are new this year. If you updated/upgraded to TS2016 you got a pop in after first launch where you could sign up for a newsletter which also signed you up for these rewards. Officially the first rewards are for TS2016 related content but the first reward was given to everyone that signed up even if they had the free update and it was a rather nice yellow boxcar. as extra bonus they added a 20% off coupon for the game for those that had not bought the new addition. The boxcar looks nice and imo stands out from the normal rolling stock you see but I couldn't resist making a reskin for it (as well as for the GTEL) and making a bit of fun with the yellow theme it has. You can find the reskins at http://www.wolfdenmedia.nl/download/the-minion-pacific-full/The new support system. Not really a TS2016 addition as it is in place for a few months now but my recent dealings with this new system and the people have been... satisfactory. Ok it took you long enough to actually post the correct info on tailsimulator.com and the Steam support topics but I think it is an improvement over the email system you hadThe community:  Simply an amazing bunch of people. You will find them on Steam and on several ""fan sites"" like railworksamerica, UKTS, Railsim.de and many other country related sites. they are providing the players with first line support, reskins, fixes, mods etc. Do visit the sites, get involved, have funThe badYes, the bad. Let's start with the fact DTG managed to ruin the update once again especially for those that did the free update. First there was no loading screen which made many players think their game had frozen and/or just didn't work anymore and when a hotfix was released it resulted in people not even being able to start the game at all. This somehow affected the free update only so I think personally that it had something to do with the fact that the new menu is now a DLC pack just like the academy for example. Yes it is part of the game but at the same time it is not. I think it is a wrong move by DTG, you want a new menu look, fine (it looks great) but release it for everyone as part of the core and not as a paid feature. It is ridiculous and doesn't make sense at allBugs ... it wouldn't be a DTG release if it didn't have at least a few bugs. The new drivers assist function for Steam engines for example does not work like it should. I have tried it and the tips it gives do not make any sense. It resulted several times in me running out of water, it told me to give more on the reverser and followed that up (after you followed the advice)  with less reverser, and more, and less, and so on. It basically made me nuts and ditch the use as quick as I could while having the idea it was at least tried out properly by me to give an opinion on it. Mind you, the driver assist only works (for now) on the new Riviera in the fifties Steam engines. I consider this a work in progress for DTG and it should not have been added yetRailfan mode....... really DTG? you dare to call that a ""new feature"" ? ok, I give you that you added an option in the editor to set points along the track for this railfanning but common, this is for the rest just a career scenario without a player train. It can be fun for a few times but a new feature?  maybe you guys should check the workshop and see how many of your talented players have created very nice railfan scenarios without the need of a ""railfan"" marker. Take with that, that the Sherman Hill, Sherman Hill  railfan scenario is broken, not bugged... broken and I rest my case, what a useless addition that isThe UglyYou thought I was done? HAH no no my friends, there is ""the ugly"" as well and boy oh boy it is uglyBigBoy: You decided in your ""wisdom"" to repack the bigboy (and the challenger) in the Ap file compression format. In itself not a bad idea, it makes for less 'clutter"" on your system although reskinners and modders are less thrilled that they have again another ap to unpack thus adding to the size of their installs but.... YOU FORGOT TO PACK THE SOUNDS.... and... you completely miscoded a bin file that has the references to said sound files as well (a fix can be found at http://www.wolfdenmedia.nl/download/big-boy-sounds/ , you are most welcome) Which numskull has been responsible for that? how on earth can you forget a part of the setup of an engine. Worst thing though is the fact that there is still NO OFFICIAL PATCH, excuse me? it took me half a night and I am not even a game developer to get it fixed (again, you are welcome, see the link I posted, grab it, pack it and make the people happy, you are even allowed to take credit if you wish)BNSF: Do I have to go there? hell yes I have to go there. HOW has it been able to come to this, HOW could you not see this coming. You were ordered by BNSF about a year ago to remove all BNSF content and what do you do? you remove all content that have BNSF in the name, leave the rest in place, don't inform your players of what is happening and think you are done. Then suddenly BNSF comes telling you they ordered you to remove BNSF content all together, you remove WITHOUT AGAIN INFORMING YOUR PLAYERS this content which by the way contains two very important routes. Refuse to replace those routes, refuse to replace the engines that are NOT BNSF in the other removed packs, basically flip the finger to your non US player base and when I take action and rally the community you play the innocent and one of your devs even sends me an angry mail on how I dare to talk about DTG, a certain site and ""question his integrity""? Well, actually I didn't question his integrity but your response to me actually proves what I said on ""that site"". YOU are free to respond if you like although I don't think you will. I will not reveal your name as this is not my style. However my comments remain the same, your company simply has been screwed if not blackmailed in this, Trainz and run8 are proof of this as they clearly show the ""official BNSF and DTG response"" is a load of bullpoo.  review to long, read the whole thing at http://www.wolfdenmedia.nl/howling-down-the-track-a-ts-and-dtg-review/ "

												Now this game, Oh god this game, is the biggest disapointment in my life. ( even more than Total war: Rome II)Lets start with DLC, 3000$+ worth! So the base game is 30$ (I believe) and it comes with 3-4 trains and one route, I was lucky  enough to have bought A bundle pack worth 70$ that was on sale for 50% off, wich added 5-6 more trtains and 2 routes, oh joy :( In comparison with Trainz (2006) was 40$ at release and came with 400 trains and 40+ routes, sooo yea. Now graphics, these graphics are the best in train simulation, but they dont have any ""Low"" options, so hat I can play it with more than JUST 8 FRICKIN FPS! it is stupid! and my computer specs are pretty high!Graphics: 5ghz AMD RADEON 5000RAM: 8GBHARDRIVE: 1TBso yea.GameplayNow the gameplay is very, VERY, slow. So unlike trainz you dont have to switch points manually and you cant control multiple trains at once. The routes themselves on this game (atleast the ones I have (London, Germany and NY)) are very boring, they a completely flat and straight, so they are pretty much chanlengless. THe physcs are unrealistic and the HUD is AWFUL!So I would not recomend this AT ALL.I have scored it this wayDLC FREE: 1/10GRAPHICS: 7/10GAMEPLAY: 3/10Over all 11/30DO NOT BUY IT			"

Its like buying a used game each time you want something more. Its competitor, might not have the same amazing graphics or sounds and cabin realistic, but atleast there a tons of engines and rolling stock that are for free. And if you want quality you pay for it and oh boy its worthed. But for thoese with little money, they can still enjoy a ton of features. Also the controls are not as complicated as in this sim. The competitor have more flexible stuff and is able to modification stuff easily. This sim took me a while to figure it out how it all worked out, and i was disapointed i coulnd do a ""free roam"" i had really to assign myself a point A to Point B route and thats all. All the sim part is great but the features of this games are bad and need some tweaking. Also paying for anything you want added is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t for a game that is still filled with bugs.5/10 overall, 9/10 for graphics 9/10 for simulation 3/10 for features paying for any new locs or routes 0/10			"

												Train Simulator 2014 is the best train simulator out of all the other i have play so far, such as trainz. It is much more realistic than all of the other train simulator out there, but the problem is that there is so much bug and glitches that need to be attend to. Some of the bug issue is when starting the engine. The engine won't turn off when you press the key. Another issue is the wiper won't shut off, basically once you hit the shortcut key it won't turn off. You have to then go to the control screen in order to shut it off. The biggest glitches that i find is that for some reason the train derail on its own and also froze my whole computer which is really horrible because i have to restart my whole computer again. Please attend to this as soon as possible. Once you attend to these problem, more people would likely give back the 5 star rating. Also is it possible for you to implement a multiplayer option where other people such as your friends or family member can play with you on the same map. Please fix this simulator, i really enjoy seeing all the incredible and amazing route and rolling stock that the company is releasing to the public. Thanks so much again for taking your time to read this.			"

If your someone who likes to create their own routes and drive them i would not buy this game its route creation is far too complicated and takes too much time to build anything as it is too fidddly. I commonly played the Trainz franchise which i found much simpler to use. I decided to try it out as i heard the graphics were better. Arguably they are however the game play is sluggish.The DLCs are too expensive for what they are. I can't see how anyone would buy them. If your looking for a simulator simply for driving the trains this is for you. As it does run quite smooth in comparison to Trainz. The surveyor however is too complicated.To summarise if you want a simulator simply for driving than this is for you. But the time it takes to set up a route is horrific it takes far too long.			"

												Its a good simulator . Its just there is't enough trains that come with the game and in order to get more you have to buy them as DLC from steam and a single locomotive costs about 19.99 and thats just for a locomotive and routes cost about 40.00 $ . Not that im slamming the game beacuse the DLC but the game itself is really good . when you are in cab mode the cab sways like on a real train and when you crash you fly off the tracks and when you applie the brakes it hisses and its almost like driving a real train but without having to leave your home but if you want to create your own routes thats a differnt story . The route editor is really hard to use and really fustrating . If you want more locomotives rolling stock or a easier route editor go with Trainz 2012			"

												Expensive and does not work.I have bought it as Train Simulator 2012 and it worked fine.I was very disappointed when I realized that the amount of tracks delivered with the CD is so small.Now with the latest update TS 2014 is not working any longer. 2 thumbs down.			"

												Not even close to the real thing.Edit: Thought I'd elaborate a little since I wasn't too pleased when I played the game. The game is very pretty, and the trains look very nice. However, the physics are way off, trains lose speed at an extreme rate as soon as you lay off the throttle, and anyone who's ever driven a train know's that is not what happens. Also, even though most many trains today use electronic break systems that can initiate all breaks simultaneously, all freight trains and also passenger trains that are pulled by locomotives still use air powered break systems. These do NOT react with lightning speed as it does in this game.These two issues are to me game breaking and totally pulls me out of the immersion that the game would otherwise have. If the development team could focus on making the actual driving of the trains more realistic, and by extension fun, they could have a great game that I would probably immensly enjoy. Who knows, maybe then I'd actually buy some of all those million DLC's they keep throwing at us.			"

												In the state that this game has been in for years, I could not recommend this to any body.They introduce more bugs with every ""Update"" of the main game and never fix the old ones. Most of them are game breaking, as in you CAN NOT complete the scenario.I have spent a few hunder on this game due to the DLC, which are outragously over priced. As with the main game, they have no quality control. They keep releasing buggy DLC / Expansion one after another, knowing people will pay the over inflated prices.I have put out numerous requests to the developers to fix thier game, everything has gone unheard per thier operating policy.An example of a game breaking bug that has been plaguing the base game and expansions for years is the AI collision bug. A scenario made by the developers can not be completed due to this. What happens is that you'll be cruising along the track and always at the same portion of your progression an AI train will get into a collision with something. There are work arounds by removing the train yourself by editing mission. Why would I pay to edit my own mission when I paid to have to not to make my own mission. This bug has been in the base game and majority of expansions, even the newer ones for YEARS!Other things like dynamic brakes and air brakes not working properly are just some of the things that have never been fixed. Poor signage a long tracks, the signate not reporting the track speed in game(Sign/Signals will tell you speed you are support to go and the game will tell you a different speed, causing you to go 'over-speed' on routes. When playing career mode it makes it really difficult to make stops on time and maintain a high score as the speeding fees will eat away at your score). I have owned this game since it was called Rail Works 2.As you can note, I have invested a very significant of time and money to this game. I have not been able to put up any longer with the persistant state of neglect and extremely poor customer service.I can not in good heart recommend this game to anybody. It is a time and money sink that will do nothing but frustrate you to no end. Poor Optimization & Poor Quality Control. The frustration would not be bad if it came from this game actually being hard to play. With so money important things missing from maps and so many bugs it is just entirely unplayable. "

												This is one bad game, stupidly expensive, buggy as hell. For the price this thing would cost you the graphics are terrible. If you were to download all the availble content it would cost you thousands.Example if you fancy driving the Flying Scotsman it would cost you about £12-£15, and so far the trains seem to be locked to the map they come in. You cant even use them in Free mode.I should have 5 USA desiel engines, ICE, a UK high speed train and a uk commuter train. However I only seem to be able to use the 5 usa desiels in free mode on the one map.I only paid £6 for this game and I still feel like I have been ripped off.			"

												For how much they charge for this game and its extra content, its a joke. The graphics are multible generations behind and render for close to the veiwer that the imersion of this simulator it compleatly lost becaues they already had some of the worst audio systems in simulation gaming. What makes it wven worse is that on top of this even the vanila game runs extreamly poorly. For a locomotives that you pay often upwards of 20$+ for the cab is bare bones and only the basics are contolable. I have played DCS, a flight combat sim that has fully functional plane cokpits along with all of there wepon systems and flight modles done with a high degree of accuracy, and they cost the same. I can not undderstand how Dovetail can charge this much for what is compleatly lacking in qality and functionality when other studios that are much smaller acomplish far more for often the same or lower price point. I would not recomend any games developed by the laziest developers in simulation gaming.			"

												This is by far one of the most glitch ridden games I have ever played. The graphics seem 10 years old, and everything looks cartoonish. The game gives you nothing to start off with, and most of the available trains and routes it offers are DLCs. With a 40% discount, each locomotive you buy is still $12.00 US. It's insane considering the poor quality of the content. I wanted a train simulator where I could move heavy freight through american mountains... not 3 car milk trains in england. Save your money.

												Disclaimer: I so badly want to give this game a recommedation but I just can't right now, but I am willing to change that if things get better. I bought a boxed copy of TS2013 in 2013 for like $12 on sale, at Target or Wal-Mart, and have spent more than I'd like to admit in DLC overtime. It's been good, but things arent getting better. I do like playing, it just there are a lot of areas that would make it leaps and bounds better. I will Continue to play this game and buy its dlc(on sale) because I do enjoy it and I am a sucker.At the time of writing 12-19-2015 I have basicly no access to content that is currently advertised and that comes with ts2016, which I find quite appaling. The only route I do have is Sherman Hill, but It came with my boxed copy. I use the word route intentionally, because thats just I only have the route, not the trains advertised, namely the UP GTEL. which is new and as far as I can tell can only be obtained by buying the Sherman Hill Route, which I already have.Every year they ""upgrade"" my base game. Which has effectivly added nothing to my game. they have changed the UI and Splashscreen every year, with ts2015 I was really happy with the intro video, its got Sean Bean <sidenote>how is that pronounced its it bean or baun?</sidenote> voicing it if you know who he is.But no, with this latest ""upgrade"" I got some crap video rubbing it into my face all this content I dont get with the base game. Oh and dont expect the graphics to look like that, It's never going to happen.(Since I bought this I have made some improvement to my computer, mainly better graphics card. all of which has made little or no change in the frame rate of this game, which currently runs at about 15-20, with very frequent lag spikes. I have seen massive improvements in graphics and framerates in other games such as Skyrim, Euro Truck Sim2, Kerbal Space Program)Quite often there is an almost utter lack of attention to detail in everything. For instance in the Locomotives, no two trains are held to the same standard of quality. blurry interiors, horid sound quality, poor lighting effects, near complete lack of interior control many trains have no interior lighting, makes night driving not fun at all. Most have no control over exterior lights I.e. running lights, although on some trains step lighiting, number lights etc. (both of which you really never have control because a complete lack thereof) Effectivly there is three light settings On(FWD), Reversing, which should show red light on the front of the Locomotive, but for all intensive purposes this is an off setting, and then off, no lights anywhere.I'd say 80% of the locomotive I have don't have a bell.Old content(and customers) get left behind and abandoned in this game. With every ""update"" there's more bugs, more crashes, and longer loading times. Old content never gets updated, fixed, redone, just left to rust like an old locomotive. Just look at me heretofore mention ""Sherman Hill"" story.  It seems to me the only people they care about, are people who havent given them money yet.My Biggest grip is the Editor I start with the consist(Locomotive and cars) editor, Crashes 75% of the time, if you can get it to load, its not bad.<Parental Advisory>The Scenario Editor, holy ♥♥♥♥. Acutually Un-holy ♥♥♥♥, because thats what it is an unholy abomination in the eyes of whom ever you worship. It is so incredibly hard and frustrating to use or even understand. It uses some terrible GUI system that makes no sense and often just doesnt work, unless you do it precisely a certain way with less than a .0001% margin of error. Nothing has label, unless you hover over it for like 5 seconds. I want to know what DTG uses to make the routes, because there is no way in hell that is what they use to pump out their DLC. I lose my sanity and swear profusely at my screen everytime I try to use it.</Parental Advisory>Oh and fyi, the listed system minimums lie.I might add more to this later, but I'm just so frustrated right now writing this up, I need to take a break.Again I hope that one day I can redact all this and write a positive review, because of my love for trains and simulator games, I really hope that day comes and soon.

												Purchased years ago this game falsely updates it name yearly to appear current but it is an old game. Train Simulator 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 offers very limited gameplay for the price. A handful of the least interesting trains imaginable and even fewer tracks combined with poor physics make for a lacking experience. Worst of all the game is loaded with the longest most overpriced DLC list in history. At well over $6,000 while on sale this game and all it DLC is nothing but a cash grab with no substance.

												Not BAD, but no-way would I reccomend this to a friend. This isn't a game, this is the foundations of a game. The basic routes are just boring, and to get any sort of entertainment from this game you need to fork out more and more money for locomotives / scenarios. What happened to the era of giving someone a game, and not part of a game on purchase?Ontop of that, I'm having some pretty damn awful performance issues. I get frame tearing despite capping the frame rate. Oh, there's also no V-Sync option built into the games settings, WTF? After capping 60FPS in the Catalyst Control Center, my frames still tear. I have a pretty decent system, 3rd gen i5 CPU, R9 280X GPU, 16GB RAM, SSD, etc.. Yet this games also likes to lag all over the place every now and then. The sad news is that this is the best that Train Simulators get. If you don't mind putting up with all ^those problems, and you don't mind spending the cash, go for it. But it's got problems.... A LOT OF PROBLEMS.			"

												Getting the handle on this game is a tough journey, harder than Euro Truck simulator in my opinion. But this game is truely a simulator alright! Lots of knobs, buttons, and levers to push, pull, and press! And no 2 trains handle the same adding diversity so no 2 jobs are the same!But however, the framerate is unacceptable, even with medium graphics settings powered by a Core i5 6600k and a GTX 1070. its in the low 20s. And screen tearing which boggles my mind on how that's even possible with the Framerate i get... The thousands of dollars of DLC they sell still cant motivate them to otimize their game.Which brings me to another point... OMFG THE PRICE OF THE DLC!!!! $40 for a train and a mission!?!?!?!? $20 for a damn train set!?!?!  What in the blazes makes it worth so much?!?!? Euro truck Simulator doesn't have this much DLC and NEVER have they charged for a new truck!!! I can't support such money hungery devs, nor can any middle class gamer afford this game...			"

												There are more bugs in this game than there were in Starship Troopers. And of course where you expect bugs you start to assume they are there, making even unbugged decisions in the game unnecessarily irritating. I really want to love this game, they do so much well, but the fact that they do not prioritise dealing with bugs in content they have already released and press on releasing even more buggy content means that I have to give this game a big thumbs down and an even bigger thumbs down to Dovetail Games in general.ProsThe game looks good, not super awesome, but good.The sound is very good, and this really draws you in.They have done a good job gamifying some aspects of the simulation experience, making them more interesting and presenting a gamer a challenge.ConsOh my god the bugs.....The scenarios are not presented intuitivelyThere are not enough scenarios for some of the more popular trainsOR they are there, but you need expensive DLC to play themThe DLC is very expensive!If they did this game even slightly better I think they would be on a winner, but it feels like Dovetail Games is run very poorly.

												I purchased Holiday Express to see if I could run TS 2014 and it worked very well, not one issue. I purchased TS 2014 Steam edition with Pacific Surf-liner route. At first the tutorial would crash after starting, with only 2gb (Windows 7 32bit, Quad core) of ram I could see the game would use it all and then crash. I upgraded to 4gb of ram and the game worked for awhile, tutorials, scenarios. Pacific Surf-liner will run for about 15 minutes and crash with either a dump message or a vertex message. I have the game running as low as it possibly can but the issue persists. After searching I have found dozens of people like me who have this experience with little to no help given. Solutions are all over the place from 3gb ram switch for windows to reinstalling everything from .net to flash player. Its rare that I feel cheated by a steam game but when 99% of my library works without a crash and this game generates them within 5 minutes I feel like I deserve a refund.Please DO NOT ever buy this game or anything made by these people, its a mess that will keep you up nights trying to figure out why the 1 hour long scenario crashes every 15 minutes. I wasted 17+ dollars but you don't have to.Afterthoughts: After running the game in a window at 1024x768 (previous was 1440x900) it ran on Low detail with very little fuss. I have completed quite a few scenarios and even bought 2 more DLCs before the sale expired (4.49 each, 75% off). I would still not recommend this to people BUT and its a big BUT, if you have a nice gaming rig, a real love of trains and a descent amount of patience you can squeeze some fun from it but for the average person, you have been warned.

												This game version of the game had alot of going for it. The new engine are good, and the new version of the riviera line is amazing. However the effort but into the new game mods are terrible. Rain Fan mod is basiclly just a train spotting scenario. Its not a new way to play as they promised. Hell we already had these in the game you can find them on the work shop, having to rebuy the game to get the user interface is a disgraceful practice. DTG should be shavefull of what they have done to the loyal fanbase. We expect to have to pay to get the new content like engines ect.... We have never and should never be charged for changes to the core game like the menu system. If you want my full review follow the link

												I dont understand why all of the scenarios have so many bugs. Its as if whoever is writing these programs take no pride in what they do. If you drive the Acela or any of the other engines on the Eastern Coast of U.S, you will find it impossible to get a career score. You will run into a speed limit that is not posted. Out of nowhere your speed limit is reduced dramtically without warning. This is disgraceful for software that costs money. Where are the updates?

												It's an alright train sim, detail is debatable, some dlc's have good detail, some terrible, the big problem i have though is that there isnt much in the game by standard, you HAVE to buy dlc to get anyhting else, and the dlc isnt cheap either, even then i would say to not bother with the dlc from Dovetail, as there is no guarantee that it will be of a good quality, If you want to acturley have a decent amount of content I would highly reccomend addons by Just Trains and the amazing Armstrong Powerhouse.

												I had this game once.I don't use it anymore.Do you want to know why? Well, first of all, I can see that this game was obviously not made for those with such sub-par hardware, but at least it WORKED before the 2017 update (back in 2016) until this new horrendous update that nearly brought no changes, just like the 2016 version, just stopped working. I've owned this game since 2013, and last year was the last I had played it.I would have recommended this delightful game, because this is only a problem on my side. However, once you buy the game, of course each update is free, but you receive NONE of the new content (as far as I've seen) and your existing version nearly stays exactly the same, until you buy the 'premium' version of the upgrade.

												Go play Euro Truck Simulator 2. Why? Because you can actually play that without getting errors and lag spikes all the time and not to mention the DLC for this I mean ETS2 needs the money from their DLCs so they can continue to develop their game but TS2015 has far to much DLC to say that. Also go up and click ""see all"" for the DLC and look at the total price, over $4000! Look at ETS2 and it is only about $40. Don't want a truck simulator? Well all I can say is good luck.EDIT: I've come back to this game after about a year or so and now it does in fact run. I don't know why it all of a sudden works but it does. I still can't however reccomend this game, with its extremely overpriced DLC's and still prevalent lag spikes. I reccomend Open Rail as a good alternative, despite its inferior graphics the game is supremely better and has a much better community with better content at usually better prices.EDIT 2: Yet another year after.

												Boring and overpriced - plain and simple. It's a good thing I bought this for $10 on special, because I enjoyed the game for around an hour, before realising that the basic game you're given, is really only worth $10. Sure you can tell they've tried to make the few routes they provide with the Steam edition visually appealing, and it seems like an authentic experience (I don't know much about driving trains, I'm not a professonal), but if sitting, staring at your screen for an hour, waiting for your train (from the minuscule selection you're provided to start with) to exceed the speed limit a little bit and then pulling a lever slightly is authentic, frankly I don't really care because this ""game"" is not necessary - I hate to be harsh, but perhaps if the dlc wasn't so expensive, I wouldn't care as much. I love trains, but this just isn't compelling.			"

												My son loves playing this game but there are just so many bugs. New iterations of the game (2012 -> 2013 -> 2014) brings features rather than bug fixes. For months this game couldn't even start.Just bought the Edinburgh -> Glasgow DLC in a steam sale (otherwise DLC is simply far too expensive) and he drove from Edinburgh all the way to Glasgow Queen Street and just as he reached the end of the route the game crashed, UI elements all messed up and screen finally turned black.Not fun - very disappointed.The company should use their newfound millions to fix game breaking bugs first, as a priority.

												This game is a big pile of ♥♥♥♥. Do not, i repeat, do NOT buy this game. Dont fill the pockets of uber greedy devs that are more bothered about selling overpriced crappy DLC than actually updating the game in any way shape or form. £15 for a new loco in which only maybe 3 or 4 buttons and switches work in the cockpit... £25 for a route with 4 or 5 sceanrios and look like they have been made by someone as a school project, entire car parks float in some cases complete with cars, lightposts etc.. it is totally unacceptable.All dovetail do every single year is give us the same game with a new title on the boxart. This game is TS2015, there is no difference whatsoever other than '2016' in the title. Bugs, there are lots. They do the occasional hotfix, which just seems to break even more stuff (including my entire game that no longer loads up due to thier latest 'hotfix). The wooden 3d models used for people are actually hilariously bad too, it feels like i am looking at something from 2002.The graphics are garbage. I'm not even sure the textures would of been acceptable even 10 years ago. Everything about this game is dated and neglected. The engine is terrible by todays standards, even on decent rigs it can perform pretty poorly.Save your money, until dovetail get their act together and give us a game worthy of the title '2016'Edit: 2017 seems to be more of the same.

												Go buy Trainz 12 from N3V instead. You will be glad you did. This simulator looks good. Ill give it that. But my praise ends there. Once you look at the extremely pricey content, the lack of easily usable scenario creators, and iron fist control, you realize that they should be paying you to use this game. Lets start at the beginning, This simulator is not cheap, $20 for two locomotives and a set of passenger cars, that is absolutely free for trainz users. In fact, a peruse through the store finds that there is no free content besides user made scenarios that use the content that isnt free... you get the point. Its obvious that the creators did not want you building scenarios, because the process is daunting and more frustrating than the videos above make it sound. Mainly because you are unable to use any content not specifically slated for use on that route. For example, you wish to use a P42 and Phase IV superliners (that you paid $20 for) on Donner Pass to model the California Zephyr. Well, those P42's (While completely common on Donner) are only accessible on the $40 Marias Pass route, so you can forget about a Zephyr. Unless of course you wish to fight the scenario creator and go in via quick drive yada yada yada... The point? Dont buy this game. Seriously, dont.			"

												I've owned this game for a few years now.Sadly, it is going downhill fast. Numerous bugs, which have been present for ages, are not being sorted.The worst is the terrible stutter, that seems to be prevalent, on any resolution!I've got a GTX 970 and an overclocked i5 4670K processor and it runs poorly. I can run in Nvidia DSR at 1517p and it runs at over 100 frames per second, then bang! Every few seconds it stutters and the frame rate drops into single figures.Extremely frustrating and makes the game unplayable.Incidentally it does the same thing at 1080p and is still unplayable.Such a pity that this company only seem interested in fleecing their loyal fan base with ever increasing amounts of dlc.What's the point of buying dlc if the core game is so poorly optimised?If Dovetail can get it sorted then it's worth buying, until it is, avoid like the plague and if you've still bought it, DO NOT buy any extra dlc!4/10			"

												This game is great if you like trains. Really, you can't go wrong with this game if you like trains! You will have to pay for the routes and trains you want but it is a good thing because it means you can customise your collection! You do get a lot of scenarios with the base game which are all good and they are worth the £24 I paid.Pros:-Good graphics-Train design-Routes-Scenarios-The community-Sounds-RealismCons:-Loading times-Optimization isn't great-Sometimes doesn't tell you when speed limit is dropping-Takes too many points off for speeding (only applies to you if you like getting maximum points so be aware of speeding)Overall, I would give the game an 8/10 because it is a train simulator. I see all these reviews about the price of DLC but they never review the actual game. Don't let the negative reviews put you off, the base game is fantastic and gives you a train simulator. The DLC is there if you want to expand your experience!			"

												I recommend this game because its a fun way (though not overly challenging) to drive trains of various types with more or less great realism. I think if you give the game a chance and u like trains, it will give you enough hours of fun. What I do not recommend about it and why it gets a thumbs down: The career mode scenarios are punishing mistakes too harshly and quickly.Moreover the prices of the DLCs are ridiculous, to say the least. Given the content delivered, paying almost 30 euros for a route and 15 euros for 1 (!) Loco is really a joke. If the devs want to make this game more attractive to people they seriously need to consider dramatically lowering the prices (ever noticed that the total TS experience will cost u almost 3000 euros??). I waited for some packs to be combined or to get on sale, because otherwise you just throw money out the window.Also I think compared to Trainz and MTS the variety of train networks and routes is a joke, too. Britain (of course) is overrepresented, and then you have Germany and some west and east coast US routes. Would be nice to see French, Italian, Dutch and other European country's rail networks & Loco's.It's fun, but dont get any high expectations. And dont spend too much money on the DLC's. They are like 3 times as expensive as they should be. "

												Terrible headlight effects, sloppy throttle control, mediocre built-in content, vast oceans of expensive DLC worth thousands of times the amount the core game costs, and atrocious train handling physics. Who wouldn't want to buy the same game again every year under a slightly newer name? GOATEDIT: I have been informed you buy the game one time and the developers throw in the newer-named title each year for you. Unfortunately that doesn't say much as the appearance, interface, content quality, and overall gameplay of the simulator hasn't changed since it was originally sold as Kuju's ""Rail Simulator."" Still not worth it- save your money for up and coming TSW.			"

												I had this game since I had bought the Big Picture Pack of Train Simulator 2013. It is not a bad game as many people would disagree because the price of DLC but you don't need all that DLC to play this. It is cheaper than buying a real model railroad set which is more expensive than the DLCs in this game. Some of the DLCs may sound terrible or the physics messed up. The controls are the same as MSTS (Microsoft Train Simulator) which is why I like this game.Most of the DLC prices like for example that the locos would cost you a good $20 like the P42DC, Acela Express, and the Union Pacific Big Boy. Routes would cost you a good $40 like the Weardale & Teesdale Network, North Jersey Coast Line, Marias Pass, and Soldier Summit. There's a lot of DLCs to choose from that you may want to get like Steam engines, maybe you want to drive some freight American trains, or a drive a UK passenger train. The DLCs are mostly focused on UK, Germany, and USA but there's third party DLC on Steam that there's routes outside those 3 countries you could get. Steam hosts sales for this game from time to time so you could wait to buy a add-on if you're on budget and buying the DLCs like in bundles would help too.PROS:Routes and locos are made from there actual aspects.Lots of add-ons to choose from.Good Visuals for an Old Game EngineSupports TrackIR and RailDriverHelpful CommunityA lot of things to do such as Rail Fanning, operate a Switcher, Freight Train, or a Passenger Train.CONS:Lack of Bug FixingContent with a lot of bugs, missing speed limits on the HUD on certain routes.Needs more advanced features while operating a loco.The DLC's are overpicedYou could get into a #rekt stiulation where your loco can derail, game will end if on a passenger train and then you get thrown a game over message stating that the doors are still open after the loading is done, or running out of water on a steam loco when in a good amount.Most DLCs would only come with a few scenarios but there's scenarios you can download from the workshop to explore more of the particular route or loco.

												(note: this is a review of Train Simulator 2014 / 2015; from a few hours with Train Simulator 2016 it seems extremely similar, mostly cosmetic changes)Although it's far from perfect, it's probably the best (most realistic) train simulator on the market. (other simulators are mostly glorified model railroad simulators)It seems to be derived from the Train Simulator that was sold by Microsoft in 2000.Good points:- various trains, routes and scenarios. High-speed, main line, commuter, freight, electric, steam, diesel, you name it.- you get a very good feeling of what driving a real train is like. Accelerating, respecting signals, braking, switching and handling minor incidents to stay on schedule.- adequate physics, graphics and sounds. Okay this is not up to par with some bleeding edge fantasy games, but frankly, who cares for that on a train simulator?- nice snow, rain, sunset, night, etc- realistic signaling on most routes. The software seems to allow a fairly good realism. Not all routes take advantage of that.-  The London - High Speed Line has a very nice depicting of the French TVM (cab) signalling.Bad points:- scenario quality and difficulty are very inconsistent between routes, even within the DTG routes.  For example the ECML route scenarios are realistic and playable (once you have understood the AWS speed checks at 20 mph on warning signal) with adequate spare time to make up for delays, whereas on the München-Garmish route you have to be at max speed all the time, and it's not always enough to be on time. On the Donner Pass scenario, I still haven't understood how to be on time, considering that being at full throttle the whole time doesn't seem to suffice.  Same for braking distances when you encounter a closed block signal: distances are realistic on the ECML route, whereas you just can't possibly brake fast enough on some closed signals in the scenarios of the München-Garmish route. So you have to redo the scenario from that point, braking before seeing the signal, which kills the whole experience.- you can only handle careers for 1 person. Too bad for families.- the save/resume system is primitive and doesn't save the whole cab state, some throttle or brake positions can be lost in the process. You can only save 1 point at a time per scenario. There is no way to find the list of saved games, you have to look for that scenario by scenario.- the French translation is awfully bad. So unbearable I'm hoping I would be able to revert to the English version, but it doesn't seem possible.- DLCs are waaay, way, way too expensive. Don't buy them, unless you're dying for a specific route or rolling stock. Only buy them in a pack with the game (such as the Steam Edition series) and/or wait for bargain Steam sales which happen about once a year. That way you get a pretty good value for your money.- the in-game keyboard help is incomplete.- the ETA system sometimes gives weird results (ETA in the past...). The documentation gives no detail on what computation it is supposed to show (based on max line speed? Current speed?)- the track display at the bottom of the screen is aged and buggy on some routes (some speed limits are incorrectly shown). The line speeds & ramps & map, etc should be part of the documentation, or accessible from a menu, like in the real world, not limited to the next 2 miles of track on the bottom-of-screen display.- documentation is lacking. It does a minimal job of presenting the game, routes, signalling rules and rolling stock. Many things you'll have to learn by trial-and-error (especially on scenarios). It is to be found online, when it exists. Supposedly the game provides direct access to it for the DLCs you have installed, but it doesn't seem to work. Plus, it would be nice if it was made available during play, but isn't.- can't reuse old MSTS 2000 routes and rolling stock. This is sad as there were tons of free routes in all countries.- not many routes other than UK/US/DE. See above, MSTS 2000 had tons of these.- no multi-player / online mode. In 2015. Really sad. Lots of fun to be had.- being able to play as a signalman would be fun, too (see multiplayer above :)			"

												TS 2014 does have some good parts to it.  You get to, at least to some degree, experience driving a train.  The game has pretty decent realism, in the sense that it knows that as more and more rolling stock are coupled, the train gets heavier, longer to stop, slower to speed up, etc.  But I don't think the good parts outweigh the negatives.  For starters, the prices of the add-ons are outrageous.  And it's a total bait and switch, you buy a route, and ooops, you need to go buy a locomotive.  And you aren't buying quality add-ons either.  I think it's fair to say that between all the add-ons that I have purchased, there are not any 2 that deliver the same quality in terms of programming.  All have some bugs, some many bugs.  I have experienced bugs pretty much every time I open the game.  The last drive I just played, I was well under speed limit, on a straight track, and the train just all of a sudden derailed.  Of course, I was about 80% done with the 3 hour drive, and naturally the scenario just ended, so lost all that time.  That's what really sucks is you think you got a drive good, and wham, a big flaw hits, and you are looking at game over.  Anyway, for the money they charge for this game, and all the add-ons, they NEED to really invest into a QA department and not just pocket the profits.  This game could really rock if they actually paid more attention to detail.			"

DLC appears to be a big deal for the game, the equivalant to an Andriod or I-phone game that lures  you in with offers of being ""free"" but in order to have any fun you have to purchace their microtransactions.  I haven't tried the workshop yet but that's the only saving grace I can think of to offset the lack of inital content.

The help pages were rediculously hard to find. It is also rather hard to find the button to play with the FOUR items it gives you. Almost all of the ""play"" buttons led you to the store, where everything is REDICULOUSLY expensive (avg. $20 for a track and $15 for a new train). If I had the chance to do it again, I would just put my money into something more worthwhile. Seriously. Save your $40 and go buy yourself a copy of Black Ops 2. It'll bring you much more joy than this.			"

												Stuningly accurate? Not really, but nice enough.Buggy:  Doing a perfect run on goods to market - arrived at the final destination a few seconds early, but at the end screen i score 0!. The list of reasons why the score is lowered is empty.Buggy: Running a long mission with diesel locos. At a point there is a collission - but my train did not collide - reading what other users have posted, i found out that probably some other trains collide.Strange events that ruin play is usually seen in the beta stage. So in some ways this simulator is still beta.			"

												DO NOT BUY! If it hadn't been 85% off during the summer sale I would really really bite my behind for buying this game. 41,99 With a bunch of really small add-ons is a steep price as it is. For this money you get 4 trains on basically 3 routes.  Every other train is starting from 10 € up to 30 €! For ONE train!!!! Are the developers insane? The gameplay is ok but I've played better (openbve which is completey free and open source so a bunch of trains and tracks also FREE) Game crashes occasionally too. The so-called ""career-mode"" is basically just giving you xp and badges. You can't unlock anything or have any other incentive for progressing in rank. The loading screen is advertising for the in-game store. Who wants ads after paying so much for a game?Overall this is a way overpriced game with horribly few features.DO NOT BUY!!!!!			"

												I purchased the game through a distibutor on the internet because Steam is not selling direct to the country I live. That means you pay to much and don't have the benefits others have.  You can not purchase addons etc. Now I purchased a new pc and like to reinstall it but Steam is not answering or responding on my request for a ticket to install it again.  I copied the game  but there are  missing a lot of files, scenarios and nothing works properly  For me the relation with Steam has ended,  Addons are not working at all.Purchased games from Microsoft like FSX gave a perfect support and is easy to download again.Thanks a lot, I have a worthless game at the moment and no reply or response from Valve, Steam or TS2014.

												This game is very nice but there are good and bad things! + Good graphics + realistic - Too many bugs - Not much content ( Only 3-4 trains and tracks) - Too expensive ( I bought it for 6,99€ ) Normal price 34,99€- Bad support - Too expensive DLC's  ( Omg 4000€ for all. You are kidding me?)TS 2016 is normally a wonderful game, but the bigproblem is the DLC politics. Why so expensive? Now i have not a DLC. I play with the normal content, but its boring.I dont recommend this game!!!Dovetail Games, please do anything!! Make the DLC price cheaper!Thank you! 2/10			"

												It's a pretty good game but it's a damn rip off. This game is more for the UK people then USA. The game comes with over price DLC that sometimes is a waste. Some of the DLC is worth it but mostly it's not but I still play it. I'm about to go on a little rant....Route and DLC:Some of the routes and DLC is worth buying but its too much. Routes prices goes up to 40 dollars and the DLC goes to $20. Routes like Stevens Pass, Marias Pass, Sherman Hill, Horseshoe curve, and etc are worth buying but some makes you wish you didn't buy it. Some of the DLC's for TS14 looks nice but WRONG SOUNDS!!!!!! I bought the BNSF ES44DC (Over priced for a engine that came from Marias pass) for the Pacific Surliners route (I don't know why they didn't add it to the route itself) and it was complete wrong. I later went on Youtube and heard the REAL sound of it. I was glade a friend told me about a mod website to download the horns. The SD40-2 engine and horn is wrong too. BEFORE BUYING THE DLC, WAIT UNTIL A REVIEW FOR IT COMES OUT!Bugs: I seen a few bugs like the head light not shining or the crossing gates goes up when your train still over a crossing but I'm mostly at the front of the train.I would tell you more but I don't want TS14 creater to look too bad even know they do.If your a USA fan that want this game here is a few good link you can get enginesand routes TS14 people haven't made yet and re-paints and other stuff for free.http://railworksamerica.com/http://www.trainsim.com/http://s1.zetaboards.com/DigiRails_Forums/index/Some of the re-paint you might want needs the DLC.

												Possibly, one of the worst games I've ever purchased. I've played this game on and off for a few years and I enjoyed it to begin with. But Dovetails games are now trying to money grab from their loyal customers, they are more concerned about DLCs than they are about making a decent game. The graphics are sub par and a lot more could be done to make it run on more systems. Purchase this game if you wish, but think carefully before you do because there are far better lesser known gems than this!			"

												Basically the same game like 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 version of the game. No big difference at all. Sadly, the game still has enormous amounts of bugs and glitches that the developer of the game dont give a damn about. Instead, they keep pushing out new DLCs all the time and not improving existing trains or the game itself. Gameplay stability is as realible as peugeot-engines. Playing this game is like driving a car on just the rims. Something is missing, but Dovetail Games dont feel like fix it. The costs to buy new DLCs is very high (13,99 EURO) for a train and even more for maps. Addons are often half-made and very buggy and is sometimes broken. Even though DLCs are very expensive, their quality, especially train sound is very bad and you can hear some sounds looping and do not sound realistic. When an AI train passes you, the sound suddenly starts from nowhere and dissapers, without fading. Further on, Train Simulator features an editor that makes it possible for a player to make your own scenarios, but it do ALWAYS crash and all the work goes by by. Reversed Awesomness. I will not recommend this game to anyone because all the bugs and the terrible physics and sounds makes this game very boring to play, BUT if the developer starts to fix bugs and starts to push out proper updates, then this game may have potential.

												Well the 2015 update has just been released and I must say it's a huge improvement in literally no areas at all. When a game has Facebook intergration but no ability to rebind controlls you know you're onto a winner. Much less a simulator. In fact so little has changed I'll leave my old review below.Previous 2014 review: Why is it that this new version only allows an Xbox controller as an alternative controll device? I have a three lever throttle quadrant whuch would be perfect for this game, yet I cant configure any controlls. Is It really that hard to impliment rebinding of controlls? No it isn't. Call youselves a simulator?It's also full of nagging advertisemnts to buy payware addons. Sorry but I'm not going to pay €29.99 for one train and a half hour route, I didnt even pay anything like that for the whole game.			"

												This game is both good and bad. I came from playing TRAINZ 2010 and Trainz 2004. I bought this game partly for the Missions but mainly for my own Route/layout creation. Which is why I Don't recomend this game for building. If you want to operate it should be perfect. Some fairly light fixes from DEVs will improve or completelty fix some missions.<<This game is bound more closely to your CPU in my opinion.>>The Good;-Runs good on a GTX 1050Ti. -Detailed locomotives , wagons and stations-Long realistic runs (perhaps abit too realistic as you'll see)-Capped mininum of 15 fps in Cities - Uncapped Avg 30fps Rural - Setting; Medium 1080p (see below for my specs)The Bad;-Runs are realistic but in a extreme way; if you do 1 mph/kph over the limit points will be deducted. As a son of a railroader, the in world situationwould allow room for some play in this speed over the limit (~5mph) This allows for time to be made up if lost elsewhere. This also means that if you don't start moving your train on time it will only get farther and farther behind schedule; with no way to make it up. -The DIY route creation is a bit of a joke. It feels like they threw it in with little thought of the user interface. You'll have to navigate through different save screens to filp between placing rolling stock and track. Track laying is ridgid but in order to make it tighter you have to open up pannels in game to change that. (abit annoying)-DIY Route rolling stock is VERY limited; I bought the German pack it had; 3 different locos, 4-7 different passenger wagons and only ONE type of frieght wagon (in various paint jobs) is available for you to play with!!! At least throw the other 2 types of frieght wagons I saw in the missions. -Some track , assets, switches and rolling stock didn't load in the missions! I couldn't even play one mission because the switch stands and the Cargo wagons I needed to couple to didn't load.<<UPDATE>> 1/21/17 (later in the day)I experimented and noticed all of the rolling stock in DIY Routes is scrambled between the different routes youre required to copy from! Mann. to Karl. Route has more frieght wagons but lacks some passenger cars and the BR 218... Even the ICE 3 (the additional DLC ) is hidden within this route copy!! The game will be much better if they;X-Include 2 more types of frieght wagons free of charge (since it was in the mission)-Improve the scoring system In particular the speed limit penalty-Create a better, more fluid UI for DIY routes.... PLEASE!!-Improve loading of route assets, rolling stock. -Create a route creation tutorial-Put ALL of the Rollingstock and assets on one convient page!!!-Add a more obvious search bar for DIY Thanks for reading :)I'm so lost in this game... :'(Specs;CPU: AMD 860KGPU: EVGA 1050TiRAM: 8GB128 SSD Kingston			"

Best train simulator around, but my god, what a low bar that is.++ In-house route editor is nice+ Sound effects are quite good on some trains~ Workshop only works with add-on content packs (which costs €5/piece)- Poor optimisation on all systems- Route editor has no explanation whatsoever- Textures are terrible- Re-used assets while DLC costs a bloody fortune- DLC prices-- Extreme long-lasting loading screens-- Random crashes without warning (dump-errors?)-- Patches are rarely fixing anything before making more bugs-- Content of each year must be bought seperatlyFinal conclusionA: Must-have, fantastic game with little to no flawsB: Buy it in a sale, great game if you can get it for a discountC: Okay game, buy it in a sale if you like what you seeD: Not worth a buy, too many loose ends, bugs or terrible gameplayE: Technical mess, do not buy, buyer beware "

												Initial concept was great,the lack of further development in the game engine itself to bring it up to standards of 2014 lets this down in a big way,not to mention the constant $$$$$$ that this game requires.To clear things up pretty quickly,It's not a simulator,and should have never had that word in the title it's just confusing and insulting to simulator fans,it's a game with the emphasis on arcade.RSC,RSDL,DOVETAIL whatever they are calling themselves thesedays really need to get a grip,you might have the 10 year olds fooled,but not the old timers,a few raindrops and shadows IS NOT cutting edge these days,just take a few moments and visit SIMHQ,there are other sims that offer allot more in terms of visulas ect.How many years ago is it since the first conception of Rail Simulator?your still packaging the same old trees and vegetation from 7 years ago,that in itself is just unforgiving,not to mention users have to complete routes by adding occlusion themselves,to me this is just as sloppy as you can get.DLC OVERPRICED,SUBSTANDARD models and sounds,often requires another purchase of a soundpack per loco,so if you paid 10 pounds for a loco - BE PREPAIRED for ADDITIONAL COST.INGAME ADVERTISING...more pressure to buy,it's worse than YOUTUBE it's in your face 24/7It's kind of sad and pathetic when the new kid on the block are headlight flares,how about fixing someof the bugs instead of letting the community do it for you,faster than you!So in the 30 years Ive been simming,from the 48k spectrum 1984 to present day running a 4Ghz beast,this title is probably the biggest letdown/disappointment experianced over those years.TOTAL COST OF DLC --------- £2,159.43 ----------Tads rating on the sim-meter   1/10 - and thats being generous!

												I read so many NO to recommend votes for TS2014 here on Steam and while I bought this game way back in the RailWorks day, for 75% off and have received the update to 2014, I so wanted to love this game.And I do like this game, as much as it is possible to like it.Unfortunately, despite my trying very hard, it takes a lot of overlooking it’s blatantly badly produced software – and I am talking about the latest TS2014, not some previous incarnation.There are so many game breaking bugs in this game that do not appear to ever have been addressed.I only own the base content for this game and it is so full of bugs that leave you no option but to completely quit your efforts and start again in the hope that you don’t encounter those issues the next time you try to complete any given scenario.The game is also very badly optimised. No other title on my computer makes my fans spin up to the torrent of noise that this game achieves only minutes after first launch.As for the near €2500 worth of DLC, I have never purchased any. I’m just not that brave or stupid. I have read lots of issues still remain in the DLC also which has been reported by the real hardcore fans and the impression is that there is no plan to fix.Had I not read any such bad DLC reviews, I still would not purchase, for the base game is enough to warn me off.Such a shame, I would like to really get into this title, but it just doesn’t seem to be worth all the aggravation and lack of support.Buy or don’t – well, I’m not recommending…			"

												I figured it was on sale, so what the heck.  The game as a simulator itself is good, but I would not recommend the game at the current price it is.  You absolutely need to buy the DLC's in order to enjoy the game to download the routes you want, and they are very expensive, and their sale prices aren't even that good.  The stock game itself is definitely lacking, and you will quickly get tired of stock routes.All in all, this is definitely a souless train simulator, as it is simply a cash cow for the developers of this game.  They created a base game which was already expensive, and force you to pay just as much for a single add-on that you may want.  In some trains, the sounds are simply reused and the prices are still the same as others.Dont be fooled by the pretty visuals of this game, I dont recommend it, even if it was on sale.			"

												I have been playing this game since the first rail simulator game in 2007 the game has been good but there is so many bugs that have never been fixed. Even though the game graphics looks ok the AI part of the game isn't that good.I like building routes in this game which can be hard at first which gets easier and then you start finding the bugs game crashes when you do some complecated junctions etc. Then after building your route you decided i know i will run two trains one user controlled and the other AI. After setting up where your AI train is going to go (on a double track railway) your Ai train decides i can pass that point because the user train is in the way but the train is on the other track and another strange bug. Other things like track floating in mid air sounds on some trains are not good i could go on with a list of bugs. Also on common bug where most you would have seen red lights at a railway crossing the cars sometime drive stright through. The one thing i don't like is they never really fixed the game it was just change the name of the simulator and of course change the company name but made no diffrence.Above all that some parts of the game is intresting and there is some routes which you have to pay extra round about £25 a route comes with scenery trains. Trains anything from £6 up to £12 The game is good apart really from certain bugs a few years ago yes i would have recommended this game to a friend but there so many new things out now next gen console's and games which is better to spend your money on lots of people would disagree with my comment which is fine but you might enjoy the game or you might not.Update after relase of trs 2015Since trs2015 has come out well no bugs have been fixed its just a change of name new weather effects and UI change and thats it still the same basic game as 2012 2014 and 2015 nothing has changed. As for routes they are a bit short some are broken which i have had to fix in the editor the only routes i would say are long and worth it are the GARL routes and western lines of Scotland all other routes are far to short			"

												what a big rip off this game is you buy the game with licence and steam owns the game it does not install on your computer.then there is a issue with graphics card because it is not installed on your computer nividia graphics card does not know you have the game.then there is the other issue that if you want to dowload extra's for game you have to pay a lot of money for them,this is not fair at all.if you buy microsoft train simulator the dlc is free as with microsoft flight simulator come on steam whats going on even if you have to sell dlc then be more fair with ur pricing it has put me off from buying steam games foreverbecause you dont own the game.

												Absolute waste of money.  I had bought this game in hopes that it would be, at the very least, a decent simulation of driving a train.  My initial go at this title had me learning operations and how to do what I needed to do, simple enough.  Once I was confident enough to take on my first job, I was constantly experiencing bugs, some of which caused me to fail missions or simply not complete them.  Considering that this game simply iterates upon itself, I was baffled by how small bugs like this continue to persist.  What's worse is the extremely spotty performance you'll get even on good hardware.  The only possible thing I could think of is that the game engine remains unoptimized, considering the graphics are pretty dated and mostly lackluster by current standards.The DLC is also equally insane.  If you don't like the base game, why on earth would you invest more money into it?  Dovetail seems to have a track record of putting out sub-par experience simulators with a seemingly endless amount of DLC, many of which are priced at the same mark of the game itself.  I understand that the DLC is simply for routes or areas you'd like to traverse so you can choose specifically what you want.  However, it bugs me that Dovetail seem to focus their resources on building new DLC rather than fixing their game or optimizing it.  I really wanted to like this game  but after 10 hours of frustration dealing with mission breaking bugs and unoptimized performance, I had enough.			"

												I want to start by saying that I love playing with trains, coming from a model railroading background and TS2014 Steam Edition is my first Train Simulator / Railworks product. Previously, I had played a version of Trainz (maybe 2006'ish?). I do not have the benefit of knowing this product previously or having previous ""included"" content that may have come with TS 2012 or 2013 or whatever. My review reflects (for all purposes) a brand-new user of Train Simulator.My overall feeling towards this product is: Half-♥♥♥♥♥. There are just too many bugs, including impossible scenario timetables, career scenarios that require you to buy even more DLC content, and a marked lack of tutorials. The test track and whatever tutorials came with previous versions of TS is no longer included with TS 2014, so the tutorial only shows a couple of quick ICE 2 (German high speed train) driving tutorials only. There are a handful more tutorials, but they are not listed under tutorials, they are listed under the normal drive scenarios. How difficult would it have been to have tutorials show up under ""tutorials?"" I don't know, but it's that kind of general carelessness that mars an otherwise visually beautiful product.I have experienced scenarios with impossible timetables, stuck brakes, stuck signals, and the piece-de-resistance (for me): the Northbound Celle Intermodal Career Scenario (Hamburg to Hanover Rail Line). In that one, you have to wait some 20 minutes (!) at a signal (no, it's not stuck, it's just crappy scenario design), which will totally -- through no fault of your own, mind you -- blow your timetable to shreds. You will finally arrive at your destination some twenty or so minutes late and complete the scenario successfully...except for a teeny-tiny deduction of -17284 EXP (in my case) for tardiness. That's -17284 EXP on a scenartio that probably gives 1000 EXP if you're perfect at it. I've massed a couple of -7000 penalties in previous Donner Pass scenarios (almost all of which have broken timetables, BTW), but this was the first time that a scenario forced me to take a huge penalty so blatantly.I also don't understand why there is a discrepancy between the career, drive, and free roam scenarios. You'd think that if everything is made up for career, putting that scenario in the drive or free roam section wouldn't be much of an issue, yet entire routes that are in the career scenarios are missing from  the drive scenarios and, in my case, free roam only came with a handful of Donner Pass scenarios. No London Faversham, no Hamburg to Hannover unless I made the scenarios myself, which to the uninitiated such as I looks terribly complicated.I did purchase an additional rail route: the Pacific Surfliner Los Angeles to San Diego route, because it is my ""local"" route (I live in Southern California). Now, there is a gorgeous route with playable scenarios and nary a major bug that I could find. Why, oh why, couldn't the rest of what came in the Steam edition be like Pacific Surfliner? That was massively enjoyable.This game has so much promise and I will continue to muck around with it (I will even sink more money into it when a couple of routes that peaked my interest go on sale), but I cannot in good conscience otherwise recommend TS2014 in its present state. Unfortunately, from what I gather, Train Simulator has always had these kinds of bugs and apparently no one seems to be fixing them, just too busy producing more DLC, I guess.			"

												So, the people who have supported this game by purchasing it early in development, making it the game it is today, don't get the new content? However, to lure people in they give the new content to the new buyers? So when they say ""Free updates"" it doesn't mean a thing. You effectively have to buy every update for £29.99 if you want the new content.Also, the DLC is ridiculously overpriced. Around £25 for a new route and a further £15 for 1 new loco. I added all DLC to my cart and it is over £3000. I used to love this game, but now I've realised that DTL are greedy money grabbers, I've gone off it. Also, it is badly optimised. Thanks for showing your long lasting supporters how much you appreciate us DTL.			"

												Realize you're signing up for a yearly sub on this game.  They tell you, that you're getting a free upgrade, but in reality that simply makes your game stop working with much of the old content you originally had.  They don't get fixed, instead they end up selling a new DLC version of the stuff you already bought, leaving the old stuff broken, forcing you to buy it, or have a crippled game.They could have simply put up a new version of their game, and left me with my old version, instead of simply crippling the game I use to have, in hopes they can scam more money out of me.

												I do love this game.  However, once you finish the few scenarios that come with the box, it gets pretty dull.  The DLC is out of my price range.  You can create your own routes (and I have worked on this for months and still can't get the buggy signals to work in TS2015) but don't be disappointed when you can't finish it due to bugs that remain unaddressed by the company.  Really a shame as this would be a fun game if not so aggravating and way over-priced.  Next time I'll look elsewhere for a train sim.			"

												I really like trains. Reeealy, reeeealy like trains. That is most certainly the reason this game just squeaks in a thumbs up from me. The base game is pretty good, and I come back and binge from time to time. People say this game is unstable, but i have had few issues with it. Maybe I have the godsent computer, but it runs fine for me. The graphics are... eeh, it doesn't really bother me, but i think it's time for a real upgrade. Now onto the DLC. I really like the DLC but MY GOD IT'S OVERPRICED. I don't think a single person thinks the price is acceptable, most positive reviews tend to skirt around the issue. It does have a redeeming factor, though: the sales. If you really like trains and are interested in a particular route, I say only ever get the route at a 50% sale. If you weren't really interested, only 75% or more. As for the locos, unless heavily discounted, stay away.  It really is not worth it.Trust me, if there was a 'meh' or 'depends' button I would click it, and if this wasn't the only real high-class train sim out there I woudn't hesitate to give it a thumbs down. I only recomend this game to people who can look at all the negative reviews and still consider it.*EDIT* The pioneers expansion that adds 5 routes for the price of one is exactly the kind of sale I reccomend, and it is the only sale i would see as acceptable. If you already have the game, I reccomend you look into it.			"

												I'm going to help squash some of the negativity that wanders the reviews. First off, for those who think it's boring, you don't get the point of a simulator. This is to SIMULATE running a full size train over many miles, taking in to account weather, tonnage, horsepower, braking power, grade percantage, speed, and timing. If that isn't your thing, don't buy it. You want to just run trains? Go buy TANE. Yes I'm aware there are many DLC, you have to take into account that some of these have been around since the beginning of the simulator when it was still Railworks, so as time moves on, the content has improved over the years. Plus there is a variety of locomotives and routes, the object isn't to buy them all, just buy what interests you. For me, it's US railroading, 40's to 50's. Plus there are many free engines and cars, just have to look depending on what you are looking for. Of course there are bugs, I don't know of a single game or simulator that doesn't have any bugs. Just report what you find. People report having FPS issues: Simple, upgrade your computer. Before you whine about ""shouldn't need to upgrade a computer to run a program,"" tell me then what the definition of ""progress"" and ""technology advancement."" My computer runs the game on highest settings with no issues. I've been running train simulators since 2001 with the release of MSTS, then spent many years with the Trainz franchise from 03 to 12, then went to Railworks from there to now. During that time I've seen many advancements in the train sim world, I work on a real railroad and nothing else can compare overall like Train Simulator 2017* *Yes I know TSW will be released this year, however with no backwards compatability, I doubt I'll make the change anytime soon.

												The Steam edition of Train Simulator 2015  is well worth buying, especially when on sale as you can get it as cheap as 80% off.  Each year since its release in June  2009  the game has been upgraded for free (so far); it started life as a game called Rail simulator, but was released on Steam with a name change to Railworks and later became Train Simulator.     If you're a train enthusiast, you'll want to expand the  game  by adding  more dlc; I highly recommend you wait until sales are on to get  most dlc for at least 50% off  or more.  You don't need every dlc to enjoy this game.  It would cost an absolute fortune if you were to buy all or most of the dlc  available, even  when you take account of all the   dlc being on sale; however , to  those of us who enjoy this sort of game, its well worth it.  It is the best  train simulator  available at this time and has been since its release back in 2009. (I don't know what the original Rail Simulator was like).  If you aren't bothered as much about the graphics then the Trainz series is probably the way to go as you get  loads more rolling stock, engines and   different  area's to explore in the  basic package. plus there's only about 10 dlc  available for the game.    I backed the latest version of Trainz via Kickstarter as I thought they were going to make  a much better looking  game this time, but I was wrong.  Engine cab details are appalling compared to the almost life like cabs you find in Train simulator 2015, plus you can use most of the controls  using your mouse, or touch screen. Also you have two ways you can drive your  trains in Train Simulator, either   using the quick drive controls, or  using the actual  controls in the train.  Trainz as far as I can remember doesn't include that option.  Since this game was added to the workshop, there are  masses of extra content available for free. Not all of it will be usable unless you have the appropriate dlc, but you'll still find loads for  the basic  Steam version of the game.Check out a few videos HERE, HERE, HERE, and HERE. Not the best videos, but I wanted to post  videos without adverts.			"

												GAME IS BASICALLY DOVETAIL'S ADVERTISEMENT FOR THEIR DLC'S...I bought this game because I thought what I was getting was a 30 dollar game for half price...if this was ever a 30 dollar game then I pity those that paid that....this game is hardly worth 15...in fact considering this game solely exists to try to get you to buy all their other DLC's it should be free.  I think the simulation is not half bad in of itself, but its designed from the get-go to be a DLC money bait while masquerading as a standalone game with enough content to keep you occupied for more than a day. There are many DLC money bait games, but they don't also insult your intelligence by pretending not to be. Take for example the Digital Combat Simulator. You get a very good plane and a whole campaign to start, FOR FREE. I played at least a hundred hours on that free base game before dropping money on anything else of theirs, and by then I fully felt they deserved everything I paid and more. Take another example...War Thunder... You can play all of that FOREVER FREE, with the option of fast tracking your leveling up or buying a premium plane with some moolah. THOSE are how honest content baiting work, and should work, in my opinion. You know upfront that since the base game is free, they are going to be enticing you to pay for further content. But at least it's honest. Since what I paid for is supposed to be a 30 dollar game, I really expected much more. I do like the game, but I'm one of those people that hate to give money to people that I feel wronged me, so I will not pay any more money for anything Dovetail. This experience also convinced me to stick with my MicroSoft flight simulator instead of the Dovetail reiteration....PS (Edit) I also would like to point out that the front ""cover"" of the game features 2 trains, the American diesel locomotive on the left plus the steam locomotive in the middle, that is not included in the base game at all and is only (presumably) available as a paid DLC.

												this game is fun but I have 4 issues with it train wise not game wise , other than that it runs perfectly  :-  My first issue is the fact that there is a lack effort to combat the many glitches this game encounters , just by adding a new name and textures dosen't mean that the game has improoved it just makes it worse .-My second issue is about the fact there arn't any undergroun , subway , metro and japanese maglev routes after all it is a train simulator thus meaning it should have many of these challenging high speed routes . until they add these routes and trains then what are we fans like me gonna look forward to the next upcoming year , cos when i play this game it feels like ' train sim 13 ' not 14 .- My third issue is about the lengths of the route and the route itself  30 or 50 miles ain't gonna cut it especially when we fans are limited to 3 countries 6 or seven would be perfect . the routes should be at most 400miles long and have some sort of danger like fallen powerlines or a train derailment or a tree in the middle to keep us train drivers on edge and some sort of music or sound to keep those newbies awake, afterall it makes the development team more money to develop and us fans entertained .my fourth and final issue is about the AI , this game has the worst AI ever . its clunky and unrealistic and don't show a visual image when they board a train you can spin , fly , walk and even chang camera and you won't see the AI board your train , its just the same people on the same train . other simulators and games show off their AI boarding busses boaring planes and other vehicles and they look extremely detailed and don't all walk like pimps with that wierd limp . It is very sad that a simulator of this nature and popularity lacks in these small but very notable problems would have thought by now it would look AMAZING with numerous routes that are at least 0 to 400miles long			"

They are not even close to the quality of the new ones. New DLC's cost same as single popular game on steam, this is unacceptable. This is an add-on and should be price as much. Bugs, bugs, bugs and more bugs... there is no support or what so ever.

												Some times game developers do not think about their customer and this game is an example of it. Game is good and have all the features that we can expect from a train sim but developers are charging way more than it deserves. They are selling each DLC at a price of an ordinary game. I have never seen such an aggressive pricing scheme in a game. Before TS 2013, majority of tracks were included in the base game (as done in many Train Sim games) but from TS 2013 they are selling each route as DLC at a hefty price. I also noticed that even during Steam Sales DLC prices do not get much lower as compared to the base game. This is their cheap trick to lure innocent gamers into buying their game. As a game developer your first priority should be your customer's satisfaction but here it looks like their's priority is money. The game which was selling at $50-60 (TS 2012) is now selling at $1500-1700 (including all routes and content).			"

												An ok game as a newbie to Train simulator its an alright game. Not the best simulator that i've played like MSFS and ETS2 but it is fairly fun. It would be better if some parts of the gameplay was improved like creating senarios etc also improving the scenery. But the main bug I have is prices. I got it on the steam deal this week but normally being 25 pound it seems like an ok price. But soon after playing the sim for a bit you do get a bit bored with the three routes and few trains given. Then you look on the store to see what other routes and trains and the prices aren't good. I mean really 25 pound for a route?? its as much as the game. Definately not good. Also what everyone seems to be saying it's the same as 2013 but with XP. Not pleased but as I have it now I have to deal with it. But apart from those problems it is ok and I think can have potential.			"

												this game is fun but I have 4 issues with it train wise not game wise , other than that it runs perfectly  :-  My first issue is the fact that there is a lack effort to combat the many glitches this game encounters , just by adding a new name and textures dosen't mean that the game has improoved it just makes it worse .-My second issue is about the fact there arn't any undergroun , subway , metro and japanese maglev routes after all it is a train simulator thus meaning it should have many of these challenging high speed routes . until they add these routes and trains then what are we fans like me gonna look forward to the next upcoming year , cos when i play this game it feels like ' train sim 13 ' not 14 .- My third issue is about the lengths of the route and the route itself  30 or 50 miles ain't gonna cut it especially when we fans are limited to 3 countries 6 or seven would be perfect . the routes should be at most 400miles long and have some sort of danger like fallen powerlines or a train derailment or a tree in the middle to keep us train drivers on edge and some sort of music or sound to keep those newbies awake, afterall it makes the development team more money to develop and us fans entertained .my fourth and final issue is about the AI , this game has the worst AI ever . its clunky and unrealistic and don't show a visual image when they board a train you can spin , fly , walk and even chang camera and you won't see the AI board your train , its just the same people on the same train . other simulators and games show off their AI boarding busses boaring planes and other vehicles and they look extremely detailed and don't all walk like pimps with that wierd limp . It is very sad that a simulator of this nature and popularity lacks in these small but very notable problems would have thought by now it would look AMAZING with numerous routes that are at least 0 to 400miles long			"

												After playing this for five years, I can't recommend it.So, upon my first runs on the sim, I was instantly hooked. Hell, I didn't even CARE at the time how much it was for a route. I remember being hyped for the TS2014 Update (at the time I had no idea what would become of TS). So around December 2013 (from what I can remember), RSC Rebranded as DTG, and around that point, The sim began it's ever so slowly fall. At first, I didn't notice, I was too busy having fun while reading over the other players problems via the forums (i'm no longer subscribed to them as they got annoying). Around mid May 2014, I finally started to note some issues, and finally decided to give in to a negative review. The review, did NOT last very long, as when TS2015 came out, I was instantly happy to see a Class 801 (which nowadays serves no purpose, YET) and the upgraded Acela (which has NOW been discontinued for some stupid reasons regarding it not being up to standards). This was the point I had met some friends who knew and had to deal with the current issues with the sim, something I started experincing around December 2014.When TS2016 was announced, I was nevertheless, expecting just a update, untill I found out you had to pay for it......... I ended up dropping $38 bucks to get it to work (as my TS kept crashing when the free TS2016 update came). Other than that, it was just a rehash of TS2015. The same goes for the TS2017 update.  Now, enough of this nonsense, let me just cut to the chase.One problem that REALLY annoys me is the costant dump files (when the game has crashed). Another problem is the  amount of money for DLC, some of which are just bad. I think i've spent over 1000 bucks on this game for bad DLC. DTG keep messing stuff up, like reusing Class 455 sounds on newer trains. Even with the newer DLC my friends have lag issues, one of mine can't even get his game working anymore, and had to go back to Run8.If you think that's not bad, wait till you meet the TS Community. Back in the day it was just 3rd party devs, but now we have the reskinners and the freeware devs. I'm not going into detail here on how much of an issue this is becomming (I'm looking at Just Trains and All those people who reskins of the same train to make theirs better [No offense to Superalbs, who's reskins are good]) To sum it all up, make sure you have a super computer, and try to have around $100-200 durring the steam sales, which is the best time to purchase DLC.Overall, it's a 0/17. I still enjoy driving trains, but I can't recommend it due to all the flaws, which may never be fixed, as DTG are most certianly going to put all their work into TSW around 2018...			"

Custom game setup is also not avaible until you buy a addon, which all in all means it gets boring real fast. Now you can make a custom route, but you can't add missions to it. Only drive from A to B. You can't even build your own maps, only edit the ones that comes with the game. Now I've been playing Train sims before, but this one SUCKS! DON'T BUY IT!			"

												I used to play MSTS and I've played TS2015 before I bought this sim, comparing to MISTS, TS has better graphics(lol), advanced trains and awesome routes, I give 8/10 for the following reasons:-Enhanced graphic engine-Realistic control-Expensive DLCs(including trains and routes)-Just a small upgrade of TS2015The moment I opened TS2016 I was like ""Did I open TS2015?"" It is true TS2016 does not have significant improvement comparing to TS2015, I recommend it to those who love trains but haven't tried TS series before, for those who possess TS2015,don't buy it unless it is on sale(LOL).

												The scenario editor is rediculously hard to understand. Doing the simplest actions required hours or fiddling around to find which button does which. Even making a free roam session has to be created off the scenario editor which can take hours if it is your first time. Another thing is the price. The amount of DLCs and the cost of the game itself is robbery. Lucky I got it on sale for less than half price. Nothing much has changed over the few years since the first edition came out except the price. Most models and interior use the same textures as the one in RailWorks 1.			"

												I would be able to recommend this game if we had a time machine and could travel back to 2012, which was before the company now known as Dovetail Games removed the majority of content and made it all DLC exclusive. As a result you will have to fork out massive amounts of cash in order to get your moneys worth of the full asking price of $54.99 USD. The basic game without any DLC comes as barebones as possible and you will almost definitely be looking at which DLC you fancy within an hour or two, and of course having you to spend much more than the already ridiculous base price of $54.99 USD.Aside from the DLC issue, there are two other blatant problems that have not been addressed by the developer. The first is the unrealistic acceleration and braking, which makes this simulator feel much more like an arcade game. The second issue is that you will be left asking where your money's worth is going with the numerous DLC you will undoubtly purchase since the developers rarely patch or update any routes or locomotives that have bugs. You will see cars driving in the air for example, alongside the road.Since I've bought over 50 different DLC routes and locomotive packs my copy of the game actually has a decent amount of content, but since I've had to spend tenfold on this game as I have on any other; it is simply impossible to recommend it. That said, having spent hundreds of hours on this game I can say that it is enjoyable if you have an interest in trains or trainspotting.			"

Most of the dlcs have one or two things in them and are excessively overpriced, probably worse tha EA has ever done, and that says a lot.Overall I would say this is a fun game, however, only get it when it is on offer like i did and god help you if you buy more than 10 of those dlcs (unless they are on offer)overall i would give this game a 5/10.However it doesn't i'm going to stop playing it, even though i have hardly any hours on it "

												Firstly, If all you can find in a few minutes of scrolling are negative reviews, you gotta know something's up.This game has very little actually going for it the way I see it. The stock game which I only purchased because it was 85% off, is very lacking, containing only three semi-decent routes and about a dozen different Locomotives. And while that may keep you busy for hours, I imagine most railfans, the audience I'm fairly certain this game is meant to appeal to, will not be satisfied. Driving a few select european trains and a few North American Diesels of the same road gets old relatively quickly. There aren't even any steam locomotives in the stock game, which is funny considering the game does clearly have steam locomotive functionality. Unfortunately for railfans, if they do get suckered into buying the game, they have to fork out another 10-25 dollars for additional content via DLC. And when I say 10-25 dollars, that isn't a package of items. It's like 15 dollars for a single locomotive. Like what gives? If you bought every DLC for this game I'm certain you would spend well over a thousand dollars. Content and lack thereof aside, the Game itself is disgustingly overpriced. I bought it for $8.24. That was 85% off. The normal retail price of this game is $55. Unless you've got money growing out of your ears, that and the cost of additional content is enough to make anyone grimmace. Another issue I have is that the game's sound effects are rather mediocre, the horns in particular. The engine sounds are at least half decent but none of the sound effects are very clean and  the levels are all wrong.Now, let's be clear, it still is one of the nicer looking rail sims out there, at least in my experience. The lighting is very decent and the textures, at least for Locomotives and rollingstock, are definitely what I would expect out of a modern game. The interface is fairly easy to use and relatively clean as well, and though I've heard otherwise, the actual physics simulation doesn't feel half bad. That being said, while I'd call myself a railfan, I'm certainly not an expert in the way of train physics.In the end, the measure of a game's worth relies upon how satisfying it is versus the price you pay, and in the case of TS 2014, It just isn't worth buying. Even at 85% markdown on the base game and 50%-60% on DLCs.			"

												I tend to be a very avid fan of Simulator games in general.  However game really needs some interface work.  Nothing is clear and the very basics of the game are not explained in the tutorial.  It is like the creators are expecting that you have played all the previous work they have build and just know how to run.  This is the first game that I have purchased from steam where I feel I have wasted money.  Even with the summer sale going right now it still isn't worth the money that I put towards this.  After following the tutorial number 1, I failed it 3 times because apparently I wasn't stopping in the right spot even though I am right in the zone that the tutorial is telling me to stop.			"

If you want more content, you have to pay, and by that I mean A LOT. Each train costs 8$+, not to mention the tracks. If you somehow want to own all the DLCs it adds up to  ~3000$ (1 680,74$ while on sale).

If it offered more of a variety of things to do, there would be considerably more replay value.The editor is fairly powerful, though comes with absolutely no tutorial, whatsoever.Workshop is full of additional scenarios that people have made, but you are likely missing the majority of the DLC needed to play them. Much of the older DLC is no longer fully compatible with the game and there seems to be little effort to resolve this conflict.In the end, do I regret spending money on this product? No. But I wish the company was more up-front about what is included in DLC and that they put more effort in to exploring various types of work to be done by rail service. As well as included literature or tutorials for the editor (as  the official content is sorely lacking in scenarios. You are essentially purchasing assets, with DLC)			"

												I enjoyed this game a couple of years ago, before they started force-updating it.It barely works since, in fact since the latest update i hadn't been able to get it running at all, i'd have preferred the choice to stay with 2012 or 2013 myself.No customer service, they keep wiping the entire Steam forum about the game to stop people seeing complaints, and the whole thing is a cash cow more than a game now.Avoid.

												Actually, this isn't a ""simulator"" if you think of a real simulator e.g. XPlane series. I thought and hoped that there will be an improvement in realism in this year release, but all I saw was the same old buggy game with bad PC Optimization, bad AA (I'm using max SSAO and FXAA, which in lots of other game give great result). If you're looking for a real Train Sim, I don't know what other game suggest to you but certainly not this one maybe Pro Train Perfect. Anyway, buy it if you don't know how to spend 34,99€ I'm very disappointed. Worst thing ever is that the main game (without any DLC) has poor trainset, the other DLC scenario cost almost like the real game. I'm looking forward for another TrainSim, this one ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off :)			"

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!! BTW , my system specs are: intel core i7, 975@ 3.33 Ghz, ram- 24.0 GB, windows 10 64 bit, nvidia Gtx 970. i may not have the most powerful system around, but my pc is not what i would call a slouch either! i repeat: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL THESE CLOWNS OPTIMIZE IT TO RUN THE WAY IT IS SUPPOSED TO!!! disgusted!!!!!!!! am removing from my pc immediately!

												As a train fan this game is OK, it aint the best sim in the world but this game has beuatiful graphics on highest settings (u need a beefy computer for this) WIDE selection of DLC but... like others say its overpriced and i 100% agree. DTG, plz for ts 2016 lower the DLC prices. Another problem is that there are far to many bugs. For example: when i use the consist builder it somtimes glitches when i flip the trains and i have to rebuild the whole thing again which is fustrating. If you like relaxing, driving, sims then this is a game for you like me! But be warned, there is a whole handful of bugs that DTG really need to fix. DTG, i hope you got somthing special for us in ts 2016, i really hope so.			"

												Game defects:1. 'Traing room' aka Academy isn't accurate at all - they'll show you how to start the train but they won't show you for ex. how PZB works - safety system in DB. So you need to find in the web some tutorial... Or try to analyse long and dificult manual - in German of course!2. Save and load game, You can do this directly in scenario but wyhen you load game PZB systam freaks out, suddenly emergency brake and -99999 points... Bye, bye... Restart, 15 mins of loading screen again...3. Optimalization. Hmmm, As far as I am concerned it doesn't exist in this game... As I saw it's made on a fast. Even if you have good PC, you can note that FPS will jump dramatically and graphics won't throws you off your feet.4. DLC - expensive as hell and what do you get, a few routes, one train... A lot of cool games costs less than one DLC for TS2016...5. Achievements - impossible to get without DLC.6. Game loading. It takes hmmm way too long! Reason - during loading time, their commercials are showing up(DLCs), and you're staring and staring to this, and probably you'll buy some of them. Nice strategy!Advantages:1. Interesting scenarios.2. Good projection of all 'rail stuff'.			"

												Not recommended at all.  Apparently the developers of this game have released everyone who worked for them in a quality control, or beta testing capacity.This ""update"" known as TS2015, is one of the biggest jokes I've ever seen.  With all the problems being experienced by pretty much 90% of the users who have posted here and there, it makes you wonder if any testing at all was performed on this mess before it was released.And I'm certain that no tester would have signed off on this crap meu layout that we are stuck with now.  This is totally rediculous and totally uacceptable.  It's time for Dovetail to stop shoving out one DLC after another and start fixing some of this content that's already released.Spare me this crap about how they  "" are aware of the issues and are working on it""  these problems should have been fixed before this ""update"" ever saw the light of day.And finally all you little fanboys who blindly defend everything that Dovetail does know what you can do do with yourselves.  If you'd for 5 minutes wake up and stop defending this junk they are releaseing some of the problems might actually get fixed.			"

												This game claims to be the ultimate train table train simulator.  By this I mean it advertises itself as being the ultimate digital model railroad software.Sadly, it is not.It fails to be a decent simulator, it fails to be a decent layout builder game, and it fails to be a decent game in general.In real life, if you build a layout, you can at least know, when you buy new rolling stock, if it's the right scale and the correct gauge, you can run it on your layout.Not so in Train Simulator.  There's a convoluted path to putting your new rolling stock on to the train table.""But you're discounting free ride mode.""  No, I'm not, because there's nothing immersive about driving a single train through a dead world with no other train but yours in it.  That's just dull and lifeless.One of the so-called advantages this game offers is the ability ""to build a virtual layout.""  Unfortunately, that's not as easy as they make it out to be, either.Cities In Motion 2, Train Fever, and Euro Truck Simulator 2 have much easier, more intuitive ""world builder"" tools than this game does.  And this is bad because:  Train Fever only generates random maps for you to play on; Cities In Motion 2 really isn't a builder game, either; and Euro Truck Simulator 2 not only has to be reconfigured to access the map building tools, but is not sold on the strength of a user's ability to create new worlds!As far as simulation?  While Train Fever currently lacks many simulation features, it still far superior in the simulation department than this game is - in spite of any ability to drive the vehicles - merely because they make the world feel ""alive.""  The same holds true with Cities In Motion 2, what with it's chronic traffic problems and what not.  And the Euro Truck Simulator 2 simulation is actually more forgiving than the simulation in this game.We can all agree, for instance, in real life, driving a train past a red signal is generally bad.  But there are conditions under which - even without dispatcher approval! - most railroads won't really object.  Specifically:  If you're not actually blocking other tracks!  Specifically, if one stops a foot or two too late in this game, it's enough to end the scenario.  I'm pretty sure real railroads don't work like that!In Euro Truck Simulator 2, you can sort of get away with things that would force a real life driver off the road, but it's a compromise, since alot of times, the world feels much less predictable (although it's really more predictable, once you learn it) than real life.Which brings me to general game play.I bought a Cab Forward for this game.  Beautiful model.  Beautiful locomotive.  But I can only drive it in two redneck-themed scenarios?  I can't challenge the Cajon Pass with such a beautiful machine - at least, not easily?  Wasn't the point of allowing me to buy this to give me more content to enjoy?  I have ""The Empire Builder,"" which any rail fan recognizes as pretty much the standard configuration of any long distance Amtrak train.  Why can't I run that through something in the Cajon Pass without great difficulty?  Why is it easier to enjoy the new content in ETS2, Train Fever, and Cities In Motion 2 than in Train Simulator?In short, this game just plain fails.It has huge potential, but all that promise leads to horrible disappointment.I can not recommend this game.

												I completely agree with you there 'over_nine_thousand', I bought the 2012 version of the game anod now it is currentyl at the 2014. What I find most annoying is the pricing of DLC and the game itself. Sure £40 is to be expected of a new game but to repeat that same charge EVERY year just so you can use the next version, don't you think they should perhaps give you a discount if you already own a version of the game, instead of making us pay another £40 just to unlock the new stuff where someone new gets everything (I don't know that fully but I have not tested this). The DLC... wow... I mean really. It is now the 2014 Summer Sales and Steam does a VERY good job at luring us in with these reductions on up to 80%! I was hoping then to maybe go to this game and buy a cheeky Locomotive Add-on with what money I have left over in my Steam Wallet. Oh but wait! Even at prices of up to 60 and 75% off on the DLC, they STILL come out at £7?! What even is that? For DLC I would expect either pennies for the cost of whats in the DLC or at that price, more from the DLC.I will only keep playing the game till I have racked up enough hours I think to have recieved my moneys worth but in other words I am really dissapointed with this game.Another point. Yes this game does do very well to amaze us with the graphics of their locomotives... but that is it. If you go into Free-Roam camera view and stray more than 5 metres away from the track, you will find a terribly under textured enviornment that is plain and boring. The same goes for towns, cars and anything else that is not a train. I would expect much more from a simulator as I do not just expect the experience of the train very good but everything around it to make the mise-en-scene.			"

												I'm sorry but this game is utter garbage, and it's NOT worth the money !! -Short version: The game looks ok, feels more like an arcade that a simulator (which i kind of like), has a nice concept, but is completely unoptimised! It crashes randomly, has major lag spikes and overall feels like an unfinished product rushed for a release. The devs need to make either a major update to it, or make sure TS2015 isn't anything like this game is (which I doubt, considering what I constantly read about this game) -Long version:I bought the game on the summer sale, since I had kept an eye on it for quite some time, and even though I have ~60h of playtime at the time of writing this, I actually have more that 200h of playtime but not on my steam account. Anyway, I bought it mainly because of the editor - the whole google maps overlay, the SRTM terrain data you can use and the tools the editor has alow to make incredibly accurate routes with overall very good detail. That is if the game didn't crash randomly so often. I have lost hours of content due to it not being saved and the game crashing. To counter this I started saving my route every 20-40minutes, but today, after the 4th or 5th crash for the day of the game all my layout's track had disappeared, which made me absolutely mad. Hours of my work was gone! Now, before someone says I'm doing a ""rage review"" or something I want to say that that was just the tip of the iceberg, which made me write this. The game is completely unstable and unoptimised and the lag spikes I get are even more often than the crashes. Yes, I could have done a backup file, but that is no excuse for a game to be this broken!! Also making your own assets is frustrating and requires you to read A LOT on the forums or other websites just so you have a basic idea of what to do.And I'm not even go on the topic for the unjustified price of the game or it's DLC...

In order to get more trains you have to buy them, and its like $20.00 trains.  like it only gives you about 12 ish trains to work with most of them look and operate the same. and about three locations.  Not even one steam train, nope you gotta buy it, and that goes the same for locations, you have to buy them.  another thing is the level creator...  It is very confusing and I don't think it comes with much... I'm guessing you have to buy that too.  In my eyes it came to me as a rip off.  No rating comment.			"

In order to get more trains you have to buy them, and its like $20.00 trains.  like it only gives you about 12 ish trains to work with most of them look and operate the same. and about three locations.  Not even one steam train, nope you gotta buy it, and that goes the same for locations, you have to buy them.  another thing is the level creator...  It is very confusing and I don't think it comes with much... I'm guessing you have to buy that too.  In my eyes it came to me as a rip off.  No rating comment.			"

												I really like the graphics and some of the locomotives but.....In one of the updates it made several of their expensive DLC not work.  They refused to udpate those items and tried to resell it to us as ""new"" for the same high prices.The updates can not be rolled back and I cannot find a way to stop themThe updates have many many many bugsUser interface in game is good but before that is quite usless and upsettingStat tracking is quite stupid and can be lost.

												Career scoring doesn't work, scenarios are all ultra-laggy regardless of map size, GUI not user-friendly at all, can't change keybinds, RM 20,000 worth of expansion packs yet the core game itself is programmed worse than Big Rigs... What's the point of performing any driving tasks if my competitive driving stats are not even recorded? Based on other reviews, this game was perfect... until last year's super-patch, now it's total bull@#$%.			"

I expected so much moreI was chasing this game for over a year. When I finally got it I was so happy. But then the horror started. Took ICE-T for a spin and I noticed it's way more bugged than it was in TS 2012. I switched to High-Speed train in UK. It was very good ride, finished scenario with Silver star. Tried another one, scenario is bugged. Thinking it's one time thing, i restarted game and tried again, same thing happened. Checking forum I saw that it's known bug but nobody is fixing it. Eventually I got stuck with only one scenery I like. At last I deleted game. Two days ago, after few months, I installed it again. I immediately remembered why I uninstalled it in the first place. I was more flexible this time, I gave chance sceneries that didn't amuse me at the begining. I took one route in Germany with DB train. Out of sudden -1800 penalty points for speeding! And limit wasn't even marked. It allowed me to go 140 and invisible limit was 60. Tried another one with Acela Express, train derailed due to intersection changed while I was passing. This is absurd. Don't buy it. I regret it.Perfect description of Dovetail Games thinking:https://i.imgflip.com/o6ykl.jpg "

												This simulator has a route that I have taken countless times in real life. They did a great job recreating not only the route but the surrounding area. I traveled the streets to look around and took a screen shot of a house. The houses look like the houses do in that area in real life. With that level opf detail in places that have nothing to do with the train or simulating it, you can imagine the quality of the actual tracks, station, loco, passanger cars, people on the platform, lights, sounds etc. The immersion is good enough for me that I no longer want to build a model of that route. I can ride that route at will. That revelation led me to wanting more routes and trains as opposed to model railways taking up space I should not be using in my house. I recommend this to anyone who has seen a train track and wondered where it ended. If that route is in Train Simulator 2017 or it's Add Ons, You will find out where that track goes and more. I also recommend this to those who would like to make their own scenery to drive the train through. From steam trains to mag-levs, the choice is yours.			"

												I have mixed opinions about this game. First off, it isn't really a game, but a simulator. Even then the quality of simulation varies from locomotive to locomotive (will talk about this later) One thing that a lot of people here mention and what has been picked up by some tech ""journalists"" is that there are a couple of thousand dollars worth of DLC. At first glance, this seems insane, and it is. If you are buying all of the DLC's you are insane. What I and others believe the intention of the thousands in DLC is for users like you and me to select routes and locomotives that we like. For example, you might want to simulate the North West of England during the early 80's, and it's possible to do that. Others may want to simulate the modern day North East of the united states and it's possible to do that. If all of the DLC's were included in the base game, it would be a $2,000+ game that's over 100 GB and people would say it's too expensive and too bloated. In concept, I believe this system of fine tuning your experience is fine, and works out for everyone. If you paid attention, I used in concept instead of in practice. I've had Train Simulator since before it was even called Train Simulator and was called Railworks. In that time, it hasn't really changed that much. There have been some improvements here and there, but nothing game changing. With the DLC's though, its a different story. Once a DLC is made, that's it. It's never updated. Ever. I personally don't have them, but there are reviews of some locomotives today from people who've had the DLC since it was relaeased two years ago complaining about bugs that it's had since day 1. Another problem is the consistency of the quality. You'll find that some locomotives are super realistic, with many of the buttons and controls actually doing something like guard buzzers and windows opening, the modelling being super accurate along with the sounds. Then you'll have ones that have throttle, brake, reverser, horn and light control being on, off, or red and that's it. The models will be OK, and the graphics will be photorealistc, in the sense that someone has taken a photo of a gauge cluster in poor light and from far away, and then cut and pasted that photo on to the model. I think the real kick is that in a year or two, Dovetail will be releasing a new Train Simulator on a new engine and they will be opening up to hopefully increase the variety of DLC's			"

												Finally re-downloaded this monster after a couple years. The first time I gave up on it because it was so user unfriendly and after the initial ""I'M DRIVING A TRAIN"" feeling, it got boring and confusing. I was really glad to see that... I hav eno idea if anything's changed. Cause it crashed badly right out the gate. I have a reasonably powerful computer, i5, gtx970, 8gb ram. But I guess that's not enough. Or something. I feel bad that I wasted my money on this a few years ago. Even now. On the upside though, I've somehow managed to play 102 hours of this game. Today. Junk.			"

												Ok I have to be honest about this, there is really nothing to this game without add ons, it is a game with a lot of potential that is just a huge let down and I really do not recommend it unless you find it dirt cheap in a steam sale.I do quite like simulators and the engine for this isn't by any means bad, its actually quite fun and engaging but it doesn't take long after purchase to realise how limited the base game is, the only way you will get an extensive amount of gameplay from this is by buying the add-ons, this feels like a free to play title with optional paid extras. The publishers of this should frankly be ashamed, they took what could have been a great title and ruined it with absolute greed, the thought process is pretty clear, people pay large amounts for real train models for train sets, they'll pay for virtual ones, it frankly doesn't work like that, they cut off the casual market with this strategy and with the enthusiast market they may as well as just go and spend their hard earned money on a real train set because I see no reason to pay such rediculously high prices for a game add-on, you're not paying for another game here, you're paying relatively large amounts for a 3-D model of a train in a computer game and they just are not worth it			"

												This game has so much potential but unfortunatly the developers failed to hear the rail fain suggestions.  When I went to play it for the first time the screen went black and I got an error.  Ok, this isn't a problem and I'm sure they already know about it and do a patch on it.  Well the next day it worked for me and so far it's working fine.  Which is good but they fall short on other things.  For an example the in game tutorials to teach one how to drive a train and learn everything else that goes into driving the train.  I have been noticing a lot of the tutorials seem to cut short and don't even give you a chance to finish doing the last step and it automatically congrats you and ends it.  They could easilly add train chatter into the game making it even more realistic.  Like you're heading into a yard and need to find which track the yardman wants you to dump off your cars instead of just having text or when you ask permission to let you through you could have a voice asking permission instead of having silence.  The graphics are nice and the details and the physics of each train and their variables are good.  They have major potential and I hope the developers do listen to the fans because the game does have strong potential.  But so far it seems that the developers are really missing the point with the rail fans and if they continue to not listen it'll be like shooting themselves in their own foot.  Also, to me right now the price tag for this game isn't worth it.			"

												Very disappointed in Train Simulator 2015 since Windows 10 was installed on my computer.  Cannot play the game at all.  Contacted TS 2015 support and was told the problem was being worked on.  Game will not load.  On inital screen when it gets to--TS2015-V52.2A Updating Scenario Database--everything freezes up and cannot do anything.   By using control-alt-delete to get to task manager I get a message--Saved dump file to 'C:TempDump\TS2015-V52.2A.dmp' .   After that get a message that Rail Works exe.  has stopped working and will close program.Things worked fine until Windows 10 was installed so have to be suspicious of that system. In any case, at this point could not recommend the game to anyone until DoveTail comes up with a solution to this problem.			"

I made a ♥♥♥♥-brained review before, now I'm being serious.Also rewritten the review, read again then consider changing your rating...This review is made as an example and may not be considered a review. Comments are much welcome as to point out any errors or to state opinion.This game would've been great...I would've said, ""This game has potential..."" but no. Too cliche, and this game will never get better.This game can be put as ""half-baked"" or that it's almost there.What this game should be like...SCS's Euro Truck Sim 2. The game has a decent amount of content already. Most of it's DLC is really cheap, and are visual, like paint jobs and acessories. You can find free counterparts of DLC on the workshop including extras like trucks, trailers, visuals (HUD elements, bloom removal, FX, etc.), buildngs, economy, and logos.For comparison, the Workshop items in this game requires atleast 2 DLC each, and are limited to the cliche scenarios (drive this, look at traffic, then some text to spice it up or potentially give a story, and thats the usual) and if you're lucky, a basic route.Another one:There is a franchise called ""Trainz"" where the content are in MILLIONS and many of them are FREE. While you get none in updates, you can chose to download all you want. How they make money? Charge for the games themselves (like most games do), and provide a paid subscription service to boost DL speeds. They also include third-party paid content as official DLC. Many which you get free in certain version (similar to this game). Compare this to DTG. There a very few third-party free items, and DTG hasn't released official free content (not including the yearly versions). You might get some free reskins (of DLC trains) and a rocket train (you derail alot).ConclusionMany reasons why this game is bad.1/10 almost there.			"

												I am not one who normally writes a review. I recently grabbed MSTS from the shelf it has sat on for over 10 years. I bought it and never used it. I found it to be fun and an enjoyable break from sim racing. My wife wanted to get Train Simulator 2014 for me so I would have something that worked better and could add content to easier.What a mistake this has been. One of the tutorial missions/ task running the 395 high speed train I have never gotten it to work. I ALWAYS fail at the end. I even got a video from YouTube and the guy that posted it said that he usally fails that task as well. He also said that TS 2014 was VERY buggy. I had heard that before purchasing as well but chalked it up to the usual gripping that I found so often in forums. I should have listened. The problem with the 395 train was just the beginning.I tried, and just completed a career job, and not only failed it didn't really give me any possibility of not failing. The train coming down from Donner Pass would just take off even though I'm on the brakes. The dynamic brakes don't work. Go ahead and apply them, you will only speed up. They did it in MSTS and they do it here as well.The bottom line is this. Unless you just have to have this title, OR you just HAVE to run a train simulator save your money and go and get a different game. I was going to add in quite a bit of extras during the Steam Summer Sale that is going on now until June 30, 2014, that will not be happening now. I guess I'll just take the money and go and get some more stuff for FSX or more sim racing equipment. There is a lot of gear from Fanatec that I wanted to get.			"

Griping about being charged for the full update after receiving all of those gifts just is not my style, so I'll wait patiently for this small purchasing glitch to be resolved. If memory served, something similar happened with the 2013 to 2014 update and that only took a small bit of time to remedy. Meanwhile, I have plenty of new things to explore. Thanks, RSC!			"

												Very poor, DoveTail. Very poor. Allow me to tell you what you've done-You've reskinned the sim from last year. Hell, even the release date is 2009. I have a high-end gaming PC that runs any other game perfectly, but your monstrosity pretty much made my PC die. Now time to repair that thanks to your probably 2 lines of code, saying If PC_working = true, kill PC.If PC_working = false, kill PC again.I make a game better than this if I tried. $3000+ worth of worthLESS DLC, I should have never bought this.

												Let me start by saying a I love this game, and have no real problems with the core gameplay.However, the developers are the reason why this game sucks so much... They are lazy, and cut corners where ever they can.- Unfinished routes released as ""DLC""- Locos with missing textures/sounds released as ""DLC""- Insanely overpriced DLC.. Costs £15.99 for an ICE train... Which is ridiculous- Bugs in the game that have been in since the days of rail simulator...I feel sorry for people who buy the fullpriced DLC and strongly suggest you don't, because it's simply going to fund these lazy f*cks who call themselves developers....Sort your ♥♥♥♥♥ out			"

												Hello,This game have a nice idea, but implementation - just a pile of something very unappealing. Problems:1. Game load. It is ultimately slow. About 1 minute to load save/track (for comparison: on my system it takes about 6-7 seconds to load Skyrim save in the worst case).2. You can't have more than one save at a time. Yes, really, just one save point. Forgot about possibility to play short 20 min race when long 2h is ongoing.3. Image quality. I've played TS at 2008. Really, nothing changed. Same boring non-interesting picture. Skyrim at the High+ settings at the same hardware just flights. TS at Medium became sluggish. And looks like game from year 2000.4. Tons of errors. Did you see this ""max speed is 60"" sign? Don't believe, really it's 40 and have you speed penalty, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! Do you see this green semaphore? It's red, really. So, have automatic emergency brake + penalties, of course. Also train can stuck at station at any random moment, and you will be unable to move. Only one workaround - load saved game (1 minute to load and only one save point, you remember).5. Track builder. Worst ever seen. Developers should pray to the picture of Chris Sawyer 3 times a day, before, in the middle and after work, may be it helps.6. Actually, it's not a game. It's a store. Game trying to force you to buy a some DLC at the any screen, any moment of the time. Very annoying. I want to play. I do not want to buy this forsaken ""Latest offer""! As a consequence, very poor initial set of tracks and vehicles. Wanna play a steam loco? Welcome to DLC. Wanna play ""This nice track from game review""? Welcome to DLC again. And price tags... mmm... from 13 and up to more than 20 euros per single vehicleor single track? Easily.Conclusion:Just a junk game. Wasted time, money and bytes of your hard drive. It feels like developers just want to gain as much money as possible from this game, but they do not want to make good game at all.Have a nice day,--P.S. May be my review is too offensive, but I'm really disappointed. My expectations was too high for this game.			"

												Certain aspects of scenarios are very frustrating. There seems no leeway for the smallest error and there is much I still dont understand. I rarely drive a route without getting a failed to stop at station error when I can see nothing wrong with the postiton I stop in the station. I gather from forums this message will appear if you are late arriving - failure to stop is hardly a helpful message if this is the case. Why not give a more accurate message and certainly dont fail the whole mission because of it.This issues affects all levels of scenarios. Some more meaningful feedback is needed otherwise I shall eventually lose patience with this game. I want to enjoy the game but find a close to 100% scenario failure rate just plain annoying.I couldn't recommend it as it currently functions			"

												This game is absolutely amazing. The five minute loading screens are such a great aspect because it allows you to become moist and wet for the trains. And when the trains arrive, it's like the pope rose from the grave and gave everyone high-fives. The gameplay is absolutely amazing, the simple mode is a little easy, so Expert is where this game really shines. The expert mode uses three levers, movement, direction, and brake and it also comes with an amazing usage of nine camera angles. That's right, NINE CAMERA ANGLES. WHERE DO THEY EVEN HAVE TIME TO PROGRAM ALL THESE ANGLES?! The anti-piracy script put into the game during the loading screens is honestly needed, a game such as this needs to be protected from those nasty pirates that try to ruin game businesses with their cheap ways. Waiting three extra minutes per loading screen for a two minute gameplay is a small price to pay to make sure the pirates don't steal an amazing game such as this.

												I found this game good at first. It's very expensive to play though and doesn't support mods like most of your simulator games. They have literally milked every penny they could. The DLC costs over £1000 in total and the routes are £25 on average. I could make most of these journeys on a real train for that. With the 2016 update, we were promised stunning visuals, a completely remarkable game... but it never happened. I literally can't see a difference. I don't think I will be putting anymore money into this game. It seems to be a lost cause now. Reading through reviews, it's pretty obvious.  "

												I highly recommand you to not get this game, because after the 2016 update they now tell you that to get more of the fun such as steam trains and other addons you have to pay around $30 to get the full game. That is not worth it at all because other trainz, like trainz 2006 or such has more of options of steam, desiel, electric trains and you dont have to pay extra from them. Now many would say you dont have to buy the DLCS since it update for ""free"", well sure that is true but what diffrence does it make when nothing much changes because from the start of 2013 on this game, no steam and till now, no steam and not much diffrent maps. This is supported by OfficialNerdCubed in his recent video of this game. He mentioned that one of that maps havent changed since 2011, and it surely isnt like that today, so he had to go buy some DLCS just to make it more monder. What is the point of buying this game, when it doesn't give new things just for free. There are many and I mean many DLCS, but if they just keep it the same like no new engines or maps even updating them for free, it just gets dull. What I mean by it is that there a fourmula to every game and adding new things with new ways to play. Such as Fallout 4, it had a few new things such as crafting and building homes and etc, when you see TS.2017 not much of a changed. This is one or maybe more of the many reasons why this game is hated alot. And the Workshop isnt so great either you have to buy a certain model for the workshop item to work. Other trainz just let you download it free on any website that makes trains and you dont have to buy anything extra or such. And the map making in this game is just part of the problum in this game, maybe even half of it. Like i said downloading custom maps in workshops dosent do any good if you dont buy the maps for it in the game. Trainz new era is something I haven't got yet but I bet you its alot more better than this game.  Now I would changed my thoughts if it just let the game have the new things in it and not just put it as a addon you have to pay. This game really give up and started to be a cash grab simulator, a single train like at tank engine shouldn't be 25 or 30 dollars. It really put this game to shame like no other, its sad enough that it cant have the same feel of what is like in the older trainz games. Sure maybe they run out of ideas and dont know what to do, or give up completly, but thats no way to just end a wonderful franchise it had in the past. And the one thing I will be sure of that this game won't get a single penny out of me, but if time goes on and if something great might happen to this game then ill rethink about it. Till then im leaving this game to the unstalled ones. And I highly recommend you guys to get trainz new era or go back to the old trainz games, and try it out and see what I was talking about. Sure it might have lower graphis or not great realizim, but its better to play a game thats about 30 or 40 dollars than paying a thousand dollars for many DLCS in this game. Lets hope things will get better and if not, then no hope trying to give this game another run.			"

If so, you will like this title!Unfortunately I got this to be all nostaligic and try and put around in a steam engine, seeing that although not included in the base title, that several Steam engine based Workshop items exist. However, you DO need those DLCs to for the workshop items. Unfortunately when I looked, they didn't seem to include any mention of requiring those in the workshop.

												Great Train Driving simulator. It's a lot of fun until you need some new routes or a particular train. So little comes with the game and there is so much DLC, each train and route costs you heaps of $$$. Oh sure you can get some of it from players who have already made some routes and you can make your own but what I take offence at is the sheer amount of stuff you can purchase that should come with such a game. Such as 10 or 15 locomotives and 100 plus routes, just in the basic pack! I feel ripped off! Don't get this game unless you want to fork out a fortune on extra DLC at a hefty cost!			"

												As soon as i installed this game i was immediately taken back to desktop and asked if i wanted to install a bunch of very suspect 3rd party programs where ""skip"" is english for ""install anyway"" togglemark is one, search protect is another. as i type im trying to remove Freesoft fst_au_87. these are greyware bordering on malware as one was offering ""free remote assistance"" yeah sure like need more holes in windows security. I have a good antivirus program but as these are bundles with legit content they just did whatever they wanted and installed.  untill they fix this, do not even consider buying this.			"

												If you are one of those guys who wants to make his own route then do yourself a favor, never, EVER, buy this game. This game crashed 3 times on me while making 1 real route and 2 fictional routes. In my case I lost over 230+ hours of work.Also a point of issue is the fact that this game loads more then you ever wish for. You need to have a lot of free time to just play this game. From the mainscreen to the track you selected to drive will cost you at least 1,5 to 2 minutes (if not more).And lets talk about the standard content of the game. What you get with the game are 3 routes and 5 trains, a bit unfair for the price you paid ain't it? Which brings me to the DLC's. To get all the DLC's for this game, you can pay over $2000, &$^&%$&^#%@#$*(& INSANE.Don't support these ^*%$&*^$^%#$@%^&holes who let you pay top dollar for a game with so much bugs. Bug Simulator 2014 was a better name for this game.			"

												I have mixed feelings for this game. I want to be in love with it,but I just can't no matter how hard I try. Although the game looks amazing and the selection of trains is rather good,there are just too many things wrong with it. First,all the missions are SUPER picky. You could have a 100% perfect scenario and only make one little mistake,and the game forces you to try again if you want to truly complete it. Also,the train controls are weird and it never seems that your train can hold a constant speed,which makes it difficult to maintain speed limits.But by far the biggest problem with the game is DLC. Oh. My. God. This game is upwards of $60,so you would think you would get an exstensive amount of content included,right? Wrong. You get only a few trains and routes,and you have to pay for everything else. Which would be fine...if it wasn't so damn expensive! Most DLC is priced between $20-40,and the fact that I have to pay that much for one thing after I've already payed quite a bit for the game is absurd. This is the main killing factor for me and it prevents from enjoying Train Simulator as much as I could.Don't get this game. If your looking for a good train simulation game,try the Trainz series. All of them are fun,have loads of content right out of the box,have free community created DLC,and are a one time purchase. Maybe if my problems with the game were resolved,it wouldn't be so bad. But for now,I stand by my opinion strongly.			"

Once you get tired of it, you need to purchase DLC scenarios, which is not worth it either because you often need to purchase the Scenario AND the train..

												I don't expect a train simulator to be a work of visual art, on par with things like Bioshock or Far Cry.The graphics?  Uninspired.The game mechanics?     It's definitely not going to win any awards for fidelity.But when we (my son and I) manage to pick a switch trying to get something moved in a freight yard.... and watch a passing intermodal train fly off the rails as if picked up by an invisible unrendered tornado?    Yeah, we lost it.     The fact that the game engine allowed something to happen like that?     I'm just done.   I can't take the game seriously anymore. This is the first game I regret buying.     I'm sorely tempted to ask for a refund, and list ""The game just sucks"" as the reason, but I know that's insufficient justification for such actions.Even at Steam Sale prices I feel cheated, and I can't see how the developers justify their normal prices for the base game, let alone the DLC.\			"

												I grew up playing Southern Belle on the C64 and I remember when MS Train Simulator was released and I imported it from America to the UK to play it on\close to release date (where it was released in America before the UK).For me the biggest problem with this game is it does not fully support the Raildriver Train Controller and only half the trains I have work properly with it. The company which makes raildriver acknowledges the issues and hopes this game will be better supported in future releases, but also recommends a competing train simulator which does have full native support built in for Raildriver (perhaps thats why native support is not included with this game, which is a huge shame). The company who create Train Simulator just ignore you and the entire rest of the people who buys this game and its add ons it seems.The game is buggy to say the least and some of the official routes are supplied with scenarios that just don't work or were created for earlier versions of Train Simulator and have been broken in later version with no fixes or updates. For example I bought GEML London to Ipswich - two of the supplied scenarios do not include the needed trains to play the route and at some stations passengers are walking inside the platform. Some platforms are not long enough to fit all carriages of 12 car trains and many of the branch lines on the route have not been included. Many of the free scenarios on the workshop require you to purchase other routes and trains, and for buggy and broken content the game DLC is far too overpriced with some routes costing the same as the game costs, and items rarely appear in steam sales. Every so often you will find mis-matched bundles including a route and a train which includes scenarios designed for a different route - A very cheeky way to encourage people to then buy more trains which contain scenarios for the route they have just bought and the route for the train they have just bought.Compared to modern games the engine is beginning to look slightly dated as well, but instead of spending time on improving these (I read somewhere the next version will have big improvements to the skies!) the developer should listen to the community and its players and fix broken scenarios and known bugs. I am sure the game has lost fans and community due to its flaws and them being ignored, which is a shame for everyone.There is another 3rd company creating routes for this game which they are listening to feedback and creating fixes for their products, so I am going to try a few of them.I's buy this in a sale if you like this kind of a simulator, but only pay full price if you really love train simulation and are prepered for the issues.

												I was lucky in that I bought this game when it was owned by Railworks. Back then the game worked very well, or at least I never ran into any issues with the game.Unfortunately TS has had the misfortune of being bought by a company that is all about breaking games and charging people for those broken games. Now, a lot of career scenario's, especially the older ones and the ones that come with the base game, are not possible to complete satisfactorily. Scheduling is unrealistic now so that even if you can control your speed to minute precision, it's impossible not to run later and later as the scenario's progress.If you want a hideous reputation for timekeeping and an occasional speeding penalty because the overlay doesn't accurately display the speed limits, then this is the game for you.If, however, you want a realistic train simulator that you don't have to treat like a real life Formula One on tracks, wait until another Rail Simulator is released, hopefully by a company that has an interest in the railway experience, and take your chance with that.

												Uninstalled it. I used to play this before it was bought by Dovetail. Ever since that has happened the game is less a sim and more a game. Where the goal is to get get points, and give dovetail (since actual devs get very little) money in order to get a train or a route. This has turned from a Sim into a black whole for money.As an a side I never sunk money into an add-on because I felt the base was really solid. But now that it is owned by dovetail add ons seems to be what they are forcing on you. Last a side all dovetail games (that is what they are not sims) have a unproffessional intro video, trying to convert the masses into something which used to be a niche product. This is not always a bad thing, until you compromise quality of the game for user simplicity (and UI features). Off I go to go Fly (x-plane) or Drive (user pick) in a proper sim.			"

The main reason I can't recommend this game, though, is because of the DLC.  Oh, the DLC.  I'm writing this during the 2014 Steam Summer Sale, when the game is on special, so all the DLC is deeply discounted.  To buy it all would still cost you $1698.  This isn't the only game to attempt to milk the players through DLC, of course, but it surely must be the most egregious.			"

There are many bugs such as flying trains when you connect cars or it can happen randomly too (imagine a mile long train suddenly taking to the sky for no reason , its a real sight) , UI issues and random black screens .  There is some play ability to it if you be extra cautious while playing  train sim and not use very many options but eventually your train will go airborne for no reason.Dont forget they are also trying to scam you by paying for half the game you should have had in the first place by calling them DLCs.... i think if i want to play a train sim ill go back to train simulator 2004 or so at least that one didnt have bugs and had more reliable company that didnt try to screw its userbase.

												Intreresting but very hard game.The game needs an 'easy mode' that is more forgiving for more casual players: more lenient for timed  scenarios, advisor during play, more tollerant to collisions, allow saves during career mode scenarios, etc.The game punishes you hard for small mistakes, which is really frustrating; for example during career mode it's easy to screw a scenario right at the end after an hour of play. Also the timed missions are really hard and on the edge.Edit: the amount of DLC and their price is a complete rip-off.			"

												Not worth it. You get very few scenarios when you purchase the game. Once you get tired of it, you need to purchase DLC scenarios, which is not worth it either because you often need to purchase the Scenario AND the train.. After they updated it to 2016 version, I felt really backstabbed I at least didn't get the new scenarios which came with the 2016 version, which looked really cool. If I want them I need to re-purchase the game!? What? Nah, it's not worth it. This is a typical Dovetail game: It's not a game unless you waste a lot of money on DLCs you probably won't play for very long.			"

												I started playing this years ago and it was fine. Today i started it up again and of course there is a new intro video. I must've missed a few yearly update of intro videos because this one looks so fine and impressive BUT it's stuttering like mad! Intro video stuttering? C'mon, i don't remember having problems with intro videos in any game that meets the minimum system requirements.Like i said, had no performance problems before. It seems to be a common problem now. Many people reported having the same issue and they have rigs many levels better than mine. I can only assume that all the updates are caused by either poor optimization or that the minimum specs have been raised or that the game engine is not suitable for large scale world maps.Wish i can opt for not receiving updates and roll-back to previous versions. As the state of stuttering now stands, i'm wary of spending any more time in this game. Sorry guys, i cannot recommend this game despite being the only game i know that offers free lifetime updates. Coupled with the fact that it's a DLC fest at high prices with inconsistent quality, i honestly cannot recommend this game to anyone except for elitist gamers and i doubt even they are free from stuttering issues.4/10 buy at your own risk.Addendum: I had thought of buying the Premium Upgrade DLC pack, that item is now removed from the cart.Update March 31 2017Guess what? Turns out the the intro video is only a 129 Mb ogv file found in the data\video sub-folder. OMG i thought it was a humongous 3-5 GB file with 50,000 kbps bit rate! VLC player is able to play it without any stuttering whatsoever. I had also thought that the game rendered the intro video in real-time with in-game engine and assets. Must be some kinda new conspiracy to scare potential buyers or some kinda prank?Anyway i went into the Tutorial again and it was smooth, no stuttering. So i'm buying the premium upgrade DLC pack after all and changing my recommendation to erm Maybe. Even though there might still be stuttering later in career mode or in some maps, i'm gonna take the risk because there's no problem so far in the Tutorial gameplay.Oh BTW, Quicktime is no longer supported by Apple as it's already built-in to Windows 7 and above and most modern browsers. It also has security vulnerabilities which prompted Mozilla to disable it in their Firefox browser. QT is not needed to play the intro video and re-installing it doesn't alleviate the stuttering issue so i dunno what's wrong with the game; probably inefficient code.Still not recommended though based on numerous reports by other users. Perhaps 6Gb GPU in SLI mode is required to eliminate stuttering and there's still the issue or DLC fest which can cost above $3k in total. Heck with that amount i could upgrade to a gaming desktop!!! and buy Star Citizen to boot. OK jokes aside, seems like the developers are trying to build the entire world rail network with all the DLCs.I'm bumping it up one notch to 5/10. Probably need a monster PC to get best results out of this game. No sorry it's not a game it's serious business.			"

												In theory, this is a great game but in practice, it falls flat on its face. Performance is terrible. When you're able to actually play the game, the graphics have to be turned down so low it's ridiculous. All the developers do is add more content, they never address any of the issues. Tech support is non-existent. Don't get roped into this money pit.			"

												Unless it's on sale, don't get it. I've played it for going on 5 years now, and within the past 2 years, the quality of the game has gone down drastically. Pros - - When it actually works, the scenarios can be quite fun and challenging. - Community is quite friendly and helpful- Abundance of freeware available if you know where to look for it- SOME of the payware is worth shelling out 20 bucks over. (See ""Cons"" section)Neutral points - - Can run well if given 4 gigs to run on, but unless you're a hard core gamer, chances are you ONLY have 4 gigs to work with Cons -- Low FPS - Lags out whenever the graphic detail is turned up any higher than ""lowest""- Graphical Details - Expanding on the FPS problem, the graphics aren't THAT good whenever you do have it set on the highest settings. Loading times are almost an hour as well- Expensive DLC - There's over $3000 worth of DLC in the store, most of it older than dirt, which would usually be under ""TS Classics"". A single locomotive model will usually run you about $20. Unless it's in the ""TS Pro"" range, do not get it unless it's on sale, and even at that, only if you REALLY want it. The routes may sometimes be worth it, but even then, look at the individual reviews before you even really contemplate buying it.- Horrible customer service - Outright ignored crash reports to the point where I was ready to throw my computer out the window and yell profanities at it. (Last time I did this was with No Man's Sky. My PlayStation still has to have weekly therapy sessions.)'- Game crashing - 99.9% of the time, it crashes to the point where I either: 1 - I have to restart my PC, or 2 - Wait for it to unfreeze and close it manually.Overall - .5/10 - DTG: Fix the bleeding game, and you'll make me and tons of people more happy. I don't have high hopes for Train Sim World with this game being in the state that it's in, or, even getting this game fixed, in all honesty. I also cast my vote for this game winning the ""DLC costs more than a car award"".			"

												DLC content pricing is out of control.  With the March madness sale and most everything at 50% of you could still spend almost 3000 dollars to get it all.  Really Dovetail.  I will not buy anymore Dovetail products until they get a clue on what people are willing to spend and get rid of their greed.   I am not sure there is any other developer or game out there that would cost so much to get all of the content. "

												Dostoevsky, in his grand work 'The Brothers Karamazov,' had a scene where a man comes out of a pub and fills his cart with drunkards.  His poor horse, who cannot lift the weight of the people, collapses.  The drunkard owner goes on to flog his horse to death, much to the entertainment of the drunken publicans on the cart.  They cheer him on as he whips, beats and curses the dying animal until it collapses and dies, straining to the bitter end. It is a difficult, unpleasant, indeed horrific scene to read.  But it is as nowhere near as shocking as watching Dovetail flog this dead horse.  This poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ should have been put down years ago, but it keeps coming back from the dead, uglier and more pathetic then ever.  Year on year Dovetail squats down and pinches off the same old turd, almost apologetically, shamefaced with cap-in-hand.  Each year it charges the same exorbitant price for its ropey addons.  The difference between Dostoevsky was that, despite the 'Brothers Karamazov' being a work of fiction, there was an element of real-world grit to it.  You could almost believe it was real.  There's nothing convincing or realistic about Train Simulator 2016,Its probably time to put a bullet in the skull of this poor animal.  Let it die in peace.			"

It was the 2016 update that broke it bad nuff for my dlc's to not completely function as they once had. I now have textures that will not show up, some trains are not even drivable. As well some scenarios can not be completed with out failing.If you want to drive trains and don't care about how real it is or if you can complete the scenarios or not. This maybe for you. If you dont mind spending a ton of money on the game. I have over a grand in this game atm and wish all parts of it would work, but it does not.It really feels like Dovetail dosn't care so long as they get paid.As for me, I will be looking into getting a train sim called Run8.

												I've had this game for a while now, only really playing on the odd occasion when I have an hour to waste. I can't really recommend it, the dlc tracks and trains are priced way too high (even when on sale in my opinion) for what they are worth. Most of them ( and I have quite a lot) feature some kind bug or glitch that ruins the experience, ie incorrect speed limits, unreachable ETA's. And the graphics all still look like something from the late 90'sThe shunting is awful, and leaves you with no margin for error. One false click on the wrong carriage and its game over.			"

												Summing it up, yes, I do reccomend it. But now for the details. First of all, these American trains are made by a British company. I have noticed that by the work they have done both trains, they have seemed to do more detailing on the British trains. With the American trains, about 65%-70% of the sounds are recycled. They put the wrong horns on the wrong train types. Example, a K5L on a P32AC-DM. Their prices are highway robbery. $40.00 for a 31 mile route! On some trains, the braking systems take 1 minute and 32 seconds (Yes, I have timed it) to release which make a painful experience. I have also found that you will get multiple game crashes in less than 30 minutes. Now graphics wise, you have to have a beast of a computer to handle this at the high settings!			"

If you are a die hard sim fan you are better served with Run 8 or Open Rails to quench your realism taste buds but if you like good eye candy with some sim functionality that behaves more like a virtual model railroad then your in for a treat.My biggest complaint is how long ""bugs"" take to be addressed,  some engines still do not have proper sound effects and yes cars cross the tracks when the gates are down...and routes are as pricey as the game itself, best to get them when Steam has a sale going on....

												I'd rather leave a mixed review, but my advice is that you shouldn't pay full price for this game or its DLC, wait until it comes out on sale. The DLC tends to be quite glitchy and low quality, considering you could pay £20+ for some of the DLCs. The game itself runs OK, although it does drop frames even when graphics settings are turned down (that's with a GTX 960 2GB card) but that is probably due to my setup.So, bottom line is if you have to buy it, wait for the price to come down in a sale. If you do buy it, you'll be downloading DLC within about a week, since there's not very much to play in the base game. If you're considering getting all the DLC, you probably consider spending the money on becoming a real train driver, it would cost about the same!			"

												I have been using Train Simulator back since the original was release by Microsoft.  Many reviewers have voiced various complaints concerning physics, various content (sounds) and DLC costs.  I can understand purists with the dynamics and sounds, which I can take issue with as well, but with DLC, that is an individual choice. The basic game gives us different Country systems to try, and the DLC adds to that enjoyment. However, no one says you have to purchase EVERYTHING. I am from the US and only purchase items that interest me, mostly American units and routes , although a couple of others that look interesting. Folks from other countries I would imagine do the same, so the argument the the DLC is outrageously expensive is subjective to those that want everything in thier collection. The only concession is the reskinning charges which should be minimal or provided as an update to already purchased items.I am not so much a hard core player as a casual player, so with that being said, I do like Train Simulator enough to upgrade my computer when necessary. I found no faults with casual railroading, and since space limited me to not have a model railroad, this is the next bext thing, and better in some areas.Train Simulator is enjoyable and a great pasttime,  if you enjoy railroading. Thanks to the Dovetail folks for providing a very pleasant way to spend some hours.			"

												Even though it has its minor problems once in awhile it has brought me hundreds and hundreds of hours of pure entertainment in the contrary. Having no other experience with other train simulators I’d still have to say this is well built when it comes to doing tasks in a scenario, enjoying a quick drive with your choice of train and its consist or even creating your own routes and scenarios and sharing it with the respectable community. Also when it comes to some of the DLCs they might be overpriced but this is a hobby, if you want more the options are there so you spend as you please. Plus sales are a thing and if a DLC is a rip off then it can still be refunded so I don't see the problem.People tell me it’s just a waste of money and then they go spend much more than I have on their favorite game/hobby that I would deem a waste so their point is a bit invalid. But they can think what they want because riding the rails is what matters to me.			"

Train Simnulator 2015 is somewhere in the middle between hi level of simulation of Run8 (also polish ""Maszyna"" project) and - much more popular in Poland - Trainz (only that popular because there are some polish addons made by community). It has nice graphics even for todays standards. There are many DLC's one can choose from, and many freeware stuff to download from the internets! Of course it isn't perfect!

It is not fair to charge per single DLC, as they are basic, at that price. I stress that not long ago at all we had modding communitys making anything and everything at a incredibly reasonable monthly subscriptions, this was dial-up days. A lot was on par with what this game is selling as DLCs. Its a locked eco system. And when they do update the game engine or finally write one worth the price tag all of these DLCs will be worthless. The developers have you by the balls, and mark my words unless they intend to just rebrand this forever, your £10 per train route whatever is going to be worthless and you will need to start again.

												Game is fun for a little while.  However, the DLCs are just too expensive.  Paying $30-40 for content that should have came with the game is ridiculous and the worst case of ""milking"" the customer I have seen.  They also make you pay $20 for each engine/locomotive. I wish the prices were at least half of what they are charging.  Until then, I have to put this game back on the shelf and play Euro Truck Simulator 2.Also, I wish there was a Multiplayer mode, like Euro Truck Simulator Multiplayer, for Trains.  It would make the game much more engaging to have to monitor other trains so that you don't have a train wreck.Due to the price for DLCs, which are really required to play this game more than a week, I have to give this game a thumbs down.

												I loved the game before it was taken over by DTG. Now it seems lazy and thrown together messily. The biggest problem I'm having, is, when trying to edit the awful default sounds the dlc comes with, I noticed that now instead of all the audio and railvehicles folders, there just an adobe bluepring, and an AP file. Thats's it. Nothing else. I can't edit any DLC by DTG. Why. Am I the only one with this problem?			"

												I really tried... I really tried du have a good experience with this game. Being an experienced Trainz Simulator 2012 player, I quickly saw how flawed the physics engine in this game was. There is sooooooo many things that don't work, frankly. sometimes I have passengers on my platform, sometimes not. The objects, house, trees, etc. doesn't even snap to the ground so you have to put evey single object you place down to the ground, and then if you decide to morph the terrain, you have to arrange the objects AGAIN! ... sigh... When I lay tracks down they are completely fixed. It is almost impossible to join two sets of track with eachother, and why are the tracks not flexible? Only God knows why... Furthermore the palette is rubbish, how am I to paint realistically when the brush paints in big squares so the ground looks all jagged up. One thing, you can only place turnouts on completely straight track, which makes the route making even more tidious, bordering to impossible. Where in the world today are there not turnouts on curved track??? This game advocates 2016 in it's title but it functions worse than the 2012 equivalent. The ONLY good thing to come out of this game is the beautiful locomotives. In the end you sit there and think if only you could move the trains to another game so you actually could have some decent play time. That's how bad this game is.I am so disappointed. I had high hopes for the game, but my expectations where shattered.I don't recommend buying this game			"

												As much as I like simulators and I really do, this one has to be one of the worst simulators of the year. Basically all the DLC in this game should have been included in the base game. I mean seriously, $4,783.79 of useless maps and train skins. DLC are supposed to usually add new gameplay or at least a new feature other than just skins and maps. Also, some maps are similar to other maps but with weather effects. That's all some of the DLC in this game adds! If I was going to describe this game with three words it would be this, DLC Simulator 2015. If you are sane in any way you wouldn't buy this game at all. You would keep your money and buy another game like Block n' Load or Huniepop or something else that actually has good gameplay and that is acutally fun.			"

												Ok, so I just recently purchased this game after watching the Youtuber DaSquirrelsNuts play this and at that time it looked absolutely brilliant.  Excited, I quickly purchased, installed and started playing. Initially, it was all well, until the next morning, after rebooting my computer the checkmarks for my career was missing. The points and XP were still there, so does the badge you collect as you drive more trains, but with the missing checkmarks, it's hard to keep track of which scenario you've had and hadn't done yet! So I skimped over that small blunder, assuring myself that it's an unimportant non gameplay intruding problem, and oh boy was I wrong. So on the second day, as I was playing in career mode in a Class 801 (Scenario: The 801 at 8:01), the game started out fine, but my nightmare began once I've reached a red light in Welwyn Garden City Down Fast (opening up the maps indicated an unpowered Class 365 on the tracks). So I waited, and waited (all while spamming the TAB key to request permission to pass) until roughly 30 minutes of waiting before I got the permission to pass. So I told myself, all should be fine now, and I was wrong, again!. Due to this massive delay with the red lights, the timeliness penalty I had was approximately -109000 (can't quite remember the exact figure). Again I told myself, maybe there shall be a big sum of bonus points near the end to neutralize this blunder, so I pushed ahead.  So as the train was thundering to it's final stop, the lights were all green with a breathtaking scenery to sooth my rage, all is once more well in the world of TS2015. Until suddenly, right on my tracks, slowy emerging from the foggy snowy weather was a stationary Class 365.  As I was sitting there, the train approaching it's inevitable end, I pondered, WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH THIS GAME!!!! There was no warning from the lights nor the AWS system! The lights were all green for goodness' sake! Get this game at your own risk honestly, I do have the save file for the 801 mission stated in this review if you think I was pulling you leg. Dovetail, GET YOUR S**T TOGETHER!!!!			"

We bless the heavens for this gift from the greatest developers of all time thank the lord in every way shape and possible the mere story of Train simulator 2013 left me in tears, the kind of tears that i havent had in years. Childhood memorys came fllooding in as if i was being filled like a baloon of emotions as the amazing controls and handling of everything really gave me the feel to live on my life and dream of happy things. This game gives you everything you will ever need in your life i swear on my mothers grave that i would buy this game and i will do it a thousand times to make her memorys live on with this amazing work of art. As if each character was put into a pot of interesting and amazing, we will never have such a cloud of hope like this again in hundreds of years. We all should sit down when were at dinner and just say to ourselfes or our loved ones ""Wow this was just the greatest thing ever we are so gratefull"" righting this right now i am crying as i pour my heart out tears run down my cheeks. There is nothing more to say about this orcistra of wonder and glee. I will remmember this game as long as i live without a doubt anyone who ever sees this will be as happy as i was and the memory of these amazing devolopers who made this spine chilling adventure of the mind and soul will bring hope for the newer developers, so a spirit as great as this can live on like a whisk in the wind. But just like everyone of us we are just mear specs in the mighty ocean graced upon by the creators of this classic in every write. I will say these gracefull words to my children one day about Train Simulator 2013. So the memory will live on and i can see the wonder again in all theyre faces once more as if i was the young lad living out my days in this mystery of joy, so in the end train simulator 2013 we salute you in every write meaning of the word every single person, and animal shall thank this game for all it has done for us and all it has shown to stay true to yourself and others say the mighty words of train simulator 2013 i cannot say more about this masterpiece of single sputters of electriconic works of arts. So i bid the world adue as i cast myself in front of a locamotive because knowing that there is people in this world without this game i shall not live a single breath again that they too cannot witness this work of glory, so i say goodbye to the world. 3/10			"

Then you look at the BASE GAME, the FIRST THING LISTED IN THE DESCRIPTION!!!  Train Simulator on it's own is supposed to include 4 different routes, says so in the Steam description.  TS2017 INCLUDES LGV MARSEILLE - AVIGNON, NORTH JERSEY COAST LINE, HAMBURG - LUBECK RAILWAY, SOUTH WALES COSTAL.  And on the next line states ""Train Simulator 2017 Standard Edition includes four fantastic real-world routes:"" etc, etc.  Where are my other 3 routes?  The non-US routes are nowhere to be found.  So I have to choose UK or US at time of purchase?  That isn't right!!  Have I been ripped off?  Yes, I believe so.  $6000+ in DLC?  You have got to be kidding.

												I like to drive trains. Most of TS is ok. It's close to reality. Except for one thing. When I drive for example North London there are no trains what so ever on the other lines. I presume that London isn't a Ghost Town without any traffic at all. I can understand that it is a problem to make traffic from other lines in a scenario especially if the user doesn't have that particular route. When one arrives in Stratford for example there are no traffic at all. I believe thats not the case in real life. There are much to be developed in existing routes. Maybe Dovetail Games should focus more to make these mor professional instead of developing new routes? Thank you.			"

												English(Deutsch weiter unten):Train Simulator aka Railworks - the name doesn´t matter, the program is out for some years and still hasn´t become better, but even worse.Where to begin with?At first there would be the power hunger for just average graphics. My PC is not the issue - with i7 6700K, 16GB RAM, R390X and SSD drive it is strong enough to handle newer games.However Railworks makes it necessary to reduce the graphics by a large amount so that it even looks more mediocre than before. And it is still plagued by ugly aliasing.Maybe the game works better on Nvidia GPUs - but then it is just impudence as AMD is an equal competitor to Nvidia.But graphics is not everything.No, the program is also a joke in other aspects. Some versions ago they added this ridiculous shaking of the cab which you can´t turn off - this is NOT realistic and would make any real train derail. Guys, it is a train on rails, not a plane!Then there is the steering of the program. Using the keyboard feels unresponsive and mouse steering is just mere moving of the cursor. Yawn.Also the scenarios aren´t good. You only get a very basic set of them and they aren´t exciting. And especially the german routes are the same old stuff already released years ago for the MSTS, but then much better.The activities are also nonsense and badly scripted, so not enjoyable at all.The carrier mode is just a joke, who cares about a score for driving a train?The rolling stock is also of bad quality. We got diesel locomotives that sound like a lawn mower and the class 143 sounds even worse than the oldest one for MSTS - like some air conditioning.Railworks wants to follow in the steps of the Microsoft Train Simulator, but it will never reach that goal.It will never have this large base of routes and rolling stock as the classic.Also because of the outrageous pricing. 13,99 € for a single locomotive(!) or nearly 30 bucks for a route with small size are rip-off.In MSTS times you paid 19,99 € for a route and it was much bigger than these for Railworks.No wonder that there aren´t any good developing companies like German Railroads interested in making content for this.You can buy a TGV route with 30 minutes of riding time - laughable. There is another TGV route with nearly 3 hours travel time available for free(!) for MSTS/Open Rails.Overall this game and it´s content aren´t even worth buying it when on sale.I rather recommend(especially for people interested in german routes): Get some addons for the MSTS and Open Rails(freeware) as modern MSTS version, then you have better graphics, performance and much more fun as this half-hearted collection of mediocre undersized routes and lackluster rolling stock with it´s bad controls and performance including the noddy-shaky cab view. And if you want more realism get the freeware Loksim 3D or the more expensive but even more detailed Zusi.----------------------------Deutsch:Train Simulator aka Railworks - egal welcher Name, das Programm dümpelt schon seit Jahren vor sich dahin und wird nicht besser, eher schlechter.Womit fange ich an?Da wäre erstmal der enorme Leistungsbedarf für allenfalls mittelmäßige Grafik. An meinem PC liegt es nicht - der ist mit i7 6700K, 16GB RAM und einer R390X nebst SSDs durchaus stark genug für anspruchsvollere Titel, die ansonsten ja auch gut laufen.Nur Railworks erfordert die Reduzierung der Details um ein beträchtliches Maß, damit es überhaupt erträglich läuft. Dennoch ist die Grafik von häßlichen Aliasing-Artefakten geplagt.Ob es eventuell daran liegt, daß das Programm eher Nvidia-affin ist? Wenn ja, ist das eine unfaire Benachteiligung von Käufern von AMD-Grafikkarten, schließlich ja ein gleichberechtigter Wettbewerber.Aber Grafik ist nicht alles.Nein, das Programm ist im Großen und Ganzen auch so unbrauchbar und macht keinen Spaß.Vor einigen Versionen hat man z.B. das lächerliche Führerstandsruckeln eingefügt - wir sitzen hier aber nicht in einem Flugzeug! Das Ganze ist unrealistisch und unpassend. Bei dem Gewackel würde ja jedes Fahrzeug entgleisen.Dann wäre da noch die Steuerung. Tastatur ist viel zu schwammig, Maussteuerung reduziert das Ganze auf Hin- und Hergeschiebe von den immer gleichen Schaltflächen. Gähn.Auch die Szenarien überzeugen nicht. Standardmäßig enthalten sind nur wenige Strecken, davon sowieso einige der Marke Asbach uralt, die schon zu MSTS-Zeiten umgesetzt wurden - und schon damals deutlich besser.Die vorhandenen Aufgaben sind ebenso Quarks - schlecht geskriptet und alles andere als vergnüglich.Der Karrieremodus ist derbe unnötig, wozu sollte man Punkte für das Fahren eines Zuges bekommen?Das Rollmaterial ist ein Witz, die Dieselloks hören sich an wie ein Rasenmähertraktor und wann es endlich mal eine 143 mit anständigem Sound in der virtuellen Eisenbahnwelt unabhängig vom Programm gibt, steht wohl auch in den Sternen. Die von Railworks hört sich auch nur an wie eine Klimaanlage auf mittlerer Stufe.Railworks möchte quasi in die Fußstapfen des MSTS treten, was jedoch nicht mal im Ansatz gelingt.Das Programm wird nie den Umfang und die Spielbarkeit des Klassikers erreichen.Dazu trägt auch die dreiste Preispolitik bei. Man läßt sich ja jeden Kleinkram vergolden, eine einzelne Lok für 13,99 € ist echt unverschämt und daß Addons in der Regel sowieso knapp 30 Tacken kosten, ebenso. Das kann man nur als pure Abzocke bezeichnen.Früher für den MSTS waren eher 19,99 € pro Addon die Regel, und dafür bekam man in der Regel auch wirklich was geboten.Es wundert nicht, daß sich z.B. Qualitätshersteller wie German Railroads bislang gar nicht für Railworks haben blicken lassen.Wenn ich sehe, daß man hier eine TGV-Strecke vom Umfang von einer halben Stunde kaufen kann - lachhaft. Für den MSTS gibt es eine andere und sehr gut gemachte TGV-Strecke mit ca. 3 Stunden Fahrzeug als Freeware(!).Der ganze angebotene Krempel ist es nicht mal im Sale wert, gekauft zu werden.Es gibt jedenfalls deutlich bessere Alternativen zu Railworks. Holt euch lieber die MSTS-Addons für wenig Geld und Open Rails(kostenlos) als moderne MSTS-Alternative, das ist grafisch dann auch im moderneren Look und macht deutlich mehr Spaß als diese halbgare Ansammlung von mageren Strecken, schlechtem Rollmaterial mitsamt miserabler Steuerung und Wackeldackel-Führerstand. Und wer realistische Zugsicherungssysteme will, findet mit Loksim 3D(kostenlos) und Zusi(anspruchsvoller und kostet auch was) auch bessere Alternativen.			"

I had problems getting it to load and finally had to delete everything in order to get it to work. Dovetail help desk. What a joke! In order to get it fixed I had to go to the internet and see what other folks were doing to get their programs to work. All they did was to give me the run around.

			Ever wanted to be a light rail train engineer? I haven't, but maybe you have wanted to. If you have this game was made for you.		

I'm barely certain this is really a game.  It's overpriced for what you're getting and DLC is outrageously priced.  It's for people who like playing with model trains but can't afford model trains... but you'll barely be able to afford this 'game.'			"

												While it is by far the best train simulator, that isn't saying much. For the price you pay, you would expect TS to be the DCS of trains but it's not. Realism is of little concern to the developers and it shows in their marketing strategy which places accessibility over all else.			"

												Game is too frustrating! The progress map doesn't always match to the game play and for no reason at all the game throws on my emergency brakes and causing me to suffer needlessly expensive timeliness fines. You could play it in non career mode but there are not as many scenarios so they force you to buy some at very expensive prices. I got the feeling that I was being forced into buying more routes and locomotives, but based on the bad experiences I was having with the free ones I have no faith that the bought ones were going to perform any better! What is it with these Euro games?			"

												The game can be fun to play, especially to try and understand how boring some parts of driving a train can be, and then realising why trains crash on occasion - if I had to sit there doing that all day, then I think even I would speed round corners; just for the hell of it.  And there is an element of skill involved in the game that takes some learning, for which you need to take time and put in the effort.  Overall, I enjoyed the small amount of gameplay that I have put in, but cannot recomend the game fully because it is incomplete - to have a usable game, and really progress as a driver, you have to have the relevant tracks, and maybe even the trains.  However to get these, you have to pay extortionate amounts of money through extra purchases, and then, BUYER BEWARE, you purchase some items that, in the small print, has a section that says you need another line to be able to play the line that you just purchased !!! Yes, I fell into this trap, paid £12, or thereabouts, for an 8 mile section of track that I wanted to try - only to find out that I need the £25 main section to be able to play it - this despite the fact that I have a retail version of the game - but that retail pack does not include that specific section of mainline - SO BE WARNED, THE GAME CAN ACTUALLY BE FUN, BIT ITS THE EXTRA CHARGES, REQUIRED TO GET A REAL GAME PLAY GOING, THAT WILL PUT YOU OFF.

It's a complete ripoff because if you want to get more you have to pay 15-25$ for EACH scenario and 5-10$ for EACH locomotive.

												This game is not worth the money.  If you don't want to spend extra money on DLC, then you can only use the three, very limited maps.  Also, the cover is misleading, because the Acela Express is DLC, not in the standard game.			"

												Fun just like all the TS's BUT for 40$ you get 4 scenarios and 5 locomotives. It's a complete ripoff because if you want to get more you have to pay 15-25$ for EACH scenario and 5-10$ for EACH locomotive. Also, the track editor is much, much more confusing than the older ones like 2009 so I recommend just getting 2009 or something since you get more than a demo for 40 dollars.			"

												I would say do not get it off steam you need to find an external site. Downloading from steam will come with alot of error messaging as well.The game is fantastic though it was just the downloading part. If anybody is having trouble with this send me a friend request and i can help but only if the error message starts with ( :c ) and ends with ( V42.5b ).			"

												ok... first. this game isn't aful, but it isn't good... but why?played some times this and after 11h i just quit. it is boring. nothing content. you need go to just get from a pont to b point and u don't get nothing new stuff. other thing what i hate in this game is DLC and they are expencive. about 5-30€, almost this game price. there is only couple of missions, when u purchase the game. so there isn't that much to do. graphics are ok and driving too but it isn't just worth it... bought this because i like simulation games and they can be really good and really bad, and this isn't in my top list. good:-graphics-real physics-good animations-workshopbad:-addons-need to be good computer to run this.-getting boring after couple of hours-need more content-no multiplayer-bugs-price so it is worth the 30€? NO! there isn't almost nothing new to do. couple good missions but after this u need to buy more routes and trains.6\10			"

												Bad if u like to drive in a ghost world. It's gettin bored after a while. Only in scenarios you wil see some trains passing but quick drive is really ghost drive. And all those wierd placements of stations and objects will not help you to enjoy. Some scenarios are not playable because there is no rails. I was a fan but it's starting to be a nightmare. The support is also bad. Buy it when it's cheap don't spend so much money for it. Don't let you fool with scenery it's fake quick made ..and some parts are really ghosty with the same objects and people who do all the same. Some walk on the rails instead on the station platform or cars are flying in the air or ground same with people and objects some objects like a ballons has mark poles bahhhhhh. Not a way to enjoy the scenery when u drive much tracks.			"
