												UPDATE::: The devs have seen it fit to immediately ban me from their discusson board after this review was posted. For that I warn folks who have issues to be careful speaking up. Seems this Dev likes their dirty tricks when they don't want their filthy laundry aired out.This is my final review edit. After enough time with four kings, I have decided they have completely lost touch with the fanbase who supported them from day one. Just as they did on playstion home for six long years.Im going to be honest here, I'm not liking the way things are going. I thought after they had their time with playstation home, we'd see changes that showed they learned their lesson last time from customer feedback. I remember a time when DL had a casino on ps home, it was an avitar social world with literally hundreds of mini games and places to chat and play. Game themed rooms and more. They also had a casino there and they did the same thing with chips there. The games there were PLAUGED with bugs and cheaters, very little was done. However they had no issue releasing an apartment for over 50 dollars that came with the same games you already had access to in their casino and they REFUSED to change the pricing even with such negative feedback. Oh and might I add, the people who were stupid enough to buy it lost those items anyway when ps home closed it's doors this past march.People lost thousands of chips with no rembursement, and the tournaments were a joke. You had to pay 4.99 for a tournament bracelet with no guarantee of any reward. Just a pat on the back for those who didnt make the cut, while they pocketed their real money.I was much happier with this game during EA. Now? Theyre making the game completely un fun by catering to the new players they want to spend money. Bingo nerfs are beyond terrible.Im now seated at a progressive game with over 25 players. The pot would usually be over 100k. It isn't even breaking 40k right now...and rp payouts are the same as the main floor games.The people who bought in during early access are being pushed away to cater to the casual player with a spending problem. I have taken a break from four kings and returned today to see if the nerfs were truly as bad as they say, I'm unhappy to report they are far worse than what players are complaining about. I remember sitting at bingo for hours, and not having this back of luck either. One could say it comes and it goes, but this is just ridiculous. I was quick to respond to a gent who made a post on how this game is not only exploiting potential gambling addicts, but nothing more than a cash grab. I really would like to recall that person's username, so I can apologize and say they might be right.Because the players who bought into this game and made is possible for it to even make it out of early access are being disregarded. If this is what developers plan to do to people who buy into their games in order to support a title, I am swearing off EA games entirely. Because this seems to be a NASTY habit with devs on here. They bend over backwards during EA, but after they get your money all bets are off.			"

												I honestly downloaded this casino with low expectations. Especially after I started the game, entered my info and was expected to get a confirmation email that I had to use to verify myself. I never got it. So I tried logging into the casino anyway, and got in!So I created my avatar, got my initial set of quests, which involved going into the various parts of the casino to get free coins, which I did to humor the developers attempt at a psuedo-tutorial. Got my money and proceeded to try out the various casino games.The slot games were pretty good. I won reasonably enough but it was still a slow bleed of coins. Which I actually liked. It wasn't like Facebook slots where you lose everything in an hour, nor was it so generous that they were practically just free ATM machines. You won enough to keep playing, even some nice big wins and bonus games, and yet lost enough to keep it real.I then went to play some bingo. The buy-in was a bit pricey, but it was well designed and fun to play as well. Being a semi-senior citizen myself I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was at a good reasonable pace that I could keep up with four cards yet at a good enough pace to keep you daubing those numbers.Even though they have multi-player blackjack and poker rooms, I played some video poker and blackjack to get the feel of things there. The video blackjack was novel in that you played all 5 player slots against the dealer, and it was quite fun doing it that way. This was the ony time that I actually felt that the game was actually working against the players in that in playing around 30 hands the dealer never busted once, even when its face card was a 5 or 6, but I still won enough to play a good amount of time without feeling too cheated since I was playing 5 hands to its 1.Next I went to the video poker Jacks or Better machine which I personally felt was the one type of game where you can truly see how stacked the games are against players....and I was shocked....I don't even like video poker, but I ended up playing it for the next two hours. The odds were truly nearly perfect. I was even able to make a few inside straights, a handful of flushes on two card draws, and even keeping pairs of low cards was a reasonable and winnable strategy. It was a thing of beauty. An honest, true to the odds video poker game. When I looked up and it was after midnight on a work night and I had played two hours on a casino game that I truly hated I was sold.This is a good attempt at casino games, where their offerings are, at this point and time, honest and true to the odds, and actually pretty darn fun to play. I was truly shocked.The real money shop is very reasonably priced, even better than Facebook casino's and its very liberal about giving you free coins as you play.All in all I had a good time and was truly shocked that I did, and that I want to play again and try out other games. And I want to play more video poker...which I can't believe I'm actually saying....So yeah...Four Kings Casino is truly in a world of its own compared to other casino-type games out there, and if you're in the least bit interested in it then it's definitely worth downloading and checking out for yourself.

												Considering this game costs nothing. Unlike other Free Casino/Poker games, this one doesn't press you for real-world cash to actually play the game. Which instantly impressed me. You're able to spend your initial starting cash however you please, with a variety of different casino games on offer, all with reasonable in-game costs and payouts. It has a generous system of earnings, giving you free credits every 15 minutes and an objectives system that allows you to earn extra in-game cash for completing various tasks in the games and around the virtual casino.With all this in mind, and the overall quality of the game-world, balance and mechanics. For a FREE game, I'm incredibly impressed with it. It has the addicting nature of online gambing without the home-destroying nature of online gambling... unless you stop going to work because you sink all of your time into this game, but still thoroughly enjoyable if you're into casino games but don't want to spend your real world money on anything other than a sense of fashion for your casino avatar, I'd highly suggest giving this a go.

												This is not your typical casino slot game, where you are playing all by yourself.  This is an MMORPG that happens to be set in a casino.  LIke regular casino slot games, it is expected that you will lose your chips, and be expected to buy more.  The Devs have created a nice variety of games, and are working to add more.  However, the major draw for this game is the player interaction.Now, like any MMORPG, you're going to have your bad apples, the players who just want to cause trouble.  But, on the whole, the players are a good group, and it is fun to interact with people from around the world.You also have the fun of creating your avatar, and buying various clothing options.  There are items available for real money, and also items available for RP - the reward points you earn when you win in the casino.Just don't expect the game to be something it's not, and expect to spend money on chips if you play a lot, and enjoy the aspects of the game that are truly exceptional.  Hope to see you there.			"

								If you were a fan of Playstation Home's casino and poker, this game has the style and social aspect carried over to the PC.

												The game deserved better than a ""Mixed"" overall.    It's a 3D casino game with a bit of character customization. You can walk around, talk to other players, and lose all of your chips in a single hand of blackjack because you decided to hit on 17. It's good at what it does, and it's a shame that there aren't more games on Steam like this. WIth that out of the way, there are in fact, microtransactions, bugs, and space issues. All of these issues though, are not nearly as bad as people make them out to be. You never HAVE to buy chips in order to play. You are generously given chips frequently. Every 15 minutes you get 250. Logging in for the first time grants you 1000, and 500 for each subsequent day you log in. And finally, doing daily and weekly tasks, gives you chips. Trust me, you should have plenty of enough chips to start playing anything except for maybe Poker.   As for bugs, I personally have only encountered one. It's slightly annoying to join a table, only to freeze and be unable to do anything. That being said, that was literally only the first day of me playing. I haven't had that problem at all since. People complaining about ""Dealers dealing to nonexistent people"" are probably just having internet troubles. Now, the only REAL issue, is the lack of tables. There's tons of slot machines and plenty of seats in Bingo, but there's a huge issue with Blackjack and Poker tables being full constantly. I fully recommend this game for people that don't want to spend money on actually going to the Casino. It's a casual casino experience, and it's great at being that.			"

												This is an early access game masquerading as a full release. The free price tag is no excuse when they are charging microtransactions that allow you to purchase chips with real money, and then the game will glitch and force you to leave those chips abandoned on the table. This happened to me four times in two hours. At least when a real casino takes your money, you know what the odds are before you sit at the table. Four Kings is like a casino where the lights go out every half-hour, and when they come back on your money's gone regardless of what the cards say.			"

Devs are awesome and reimburse your loss very fast.Ive put about 40 hours into the game so far and have reached VIP1.The highest amount of cash on hand was about 1.6 mil, I currently have 1 million even.I recommend this game to anyone that enjoys the casino!

												*Edit - I removed the con about Bingo because it seems they have been working on it constantly for the better. *Yay*Alright, so I figure ill just say this is by far one of the better free casino style games i've played. So with that being said, ill give you all a Pros/Cons list.PROS1- *AMAZING COMMUNITY* - the devs are vocal with the community and are actually in game talking with players, I had a great conversation with one not long before posting this, which made me decide to actually post this review. This alone should be enough for you to at least check out this community.2- Assortment of games - Games from Video Poker, blackjack, Keno, Slots and various table games.  Pretty much you'll find the most common table games 3- Atmosphere - The piano music playing casually in the background while playing Baccarat. Or when you walk by the bar and see some players having a casual chat about their luck. This game completely nails the feeling if being inside a casino.Cons - honestly not really things which ruin the game or make it bad, just small quality of life things which can honestly be patched in over time. *shortly before this posting the bingo room had a patch already fixing one of my biggest gripes*1- Running animation - good lord the run cycle on player models.... I just feel they need to be redone completely. There's some various tiny things with the player model and items, but its so minor I don't feel the need to bring it up. Overall feeling about the game?? I highly suggest anyone thats interested in playing an accurate casino style game download and try playing. You have nothing to loose except your chips if you're not lucky!!  Like no joke, its free and amazing for what it is. 9/10			"

												I was very skeptical before I installed this, but turns out that I enjoy this game a lot. I've learned how to play craps (steam might censor that) from this game and the next time I go to our local casino I can actually play it with my buddy. This game features the following games;Baccarat (VIP room)Big Six WheelBlackjackBingoCrapsJacks or BetterKenoPokerRouletteSlots (4 Kinds)Video BlackjackVideo PokerWarAfter creating your character, you are placed inside a casino with 4 wings that branch off the main 2 floor lobby. If you get lost, you are provided with a map that allows for fast travel. The game starts you off with 20,000 chips and has verious ways to earn free chips should you find your self down on your luck. The game keeps track of stats for each game you play. There's a leader board for each game and global score that resets each month. There are daily and weekly tasks that grant additional chips. Also there's a lot of avatar customization that I won't get into.

												I love to play poker and blackjack but I hate to lose money, this game allows me to achieve the rush of winning big but without the risk of losing real money. I thought that I would play this game for a few hours and be done with it but I've already put upwards of 50 hours into this game and have had fun doing so. The fact that you are playing real people and are able to chat and communicate with them during the game is something that other poker games are unable to match due to the high pace of them. I like the pace of this game, it adds an element of reality that is much needed in poker/blackjack video games. Also, its FREE! Still have not paid a single cent.			"

												This is probably the most fun I've had with a free game in a while. There are lot's of games to choose from. An immersion element definitely exists. The developers definitely made the experience feel authentic. The gameplay is smooth, and if you play with friends, this game will provide you hours of entertainment. Whether you're a casual player or competetive, there's something for everyone.If you don't want to waste your chips, there are plenty of opportunities for free games, not to mention you get 250 free chips every 15 minutes. Some of the negative reviews I have read did not represent the game properly. Download the game, grab a couple buddies and find out for yourself. It's a free game. Try it out, I definitely recommend it.  "

												THIS game is s__. Jacks or better pay out is not correct. + it has worse odds than a vegas casino.All of the slots and by all i mean the 1 slot they have is as boring as it is slow and painful to watch and play. The holdem is ok if you like playing kids that go all in every turn. Black Jack must have 15 decks that all go the dealers way.Didn't try the bingo and don't care toGood luck on getting into the Vip room.Over all i give this game a 2.5/10 it's another take as much money for chips as you can from people for a unpolished and most likely never to be finished casino game.

Early Access Review
								If you are a true gambling person, you'll love this game.  If  like me you were looking for a fun  way to pretend to  gamble then  do not buy this game because once out of Early Access it could end up costing you a lot of money if you continue to play the game.  During Early Access you can earn small amounts of chips  (usually  25 chips at a time) for doing   several things like visiting certain area's of the casino, plus you can earn the same number of  chips  for every 15 minutes you spend in game.  When you  enter the Casino after purchasing the game you  are given 1000 chips.  My first love is  slots, so  I casually ran over to the slots and   after 10 spins  I'd spent  virtually all of my chips.   Thankfully, during the  Early Acess phase you can get more chips for   very little money; i.e.  there are several selections ranging from 500 chips to 40 000 chips each one of which  costs you $0.01 to purchase. This amount is deducted from your Steam wallet.   Once early access is over these will undoubtably change and cost much more.  Sadly, like any gambling den, the odds are always stacked against you.  After the 10 turns on the  slots, with virtually no chips left  and not wanting to wait around for  almost an hour before I could get  a couple  more spins, I left, then rejoined the following day because I was under the impression that during Early Access we would be given   1000 chips every  day, but this was not the case (I purchased the  basic game plus the cheaper of the dlc's, (costing me a total of just over £16).  I don't know whether   you can or will be able to convert  any winnings  to  real money, but even if you were, it's only a  lucky few that would ever manage to get any real money back.Personally I'm really disappointed with this game.  I was  hoping to be able to play a wide range of different slot machines,  but there was little  variety to be found, plus until I decided to buy the  highest  slection of chips I only had enough for two spins and  four goes on the roulette table (which has a minimum bet of 10 chips). Part way through my second visit there was a server reboot.  I was given literally a  minute's warning in which I was asked to log off.  As I was part way through a gamble  when this occured I wasn't    pleased. Despite it being in Early Access, so by definition  not a completed game, I can't recommend this game to anyone but   hardened gamblers.			"

												Ok, where to start.The idea of running around a casino and jumping into different games is awesome. You get the feeling that you're in a casino. Here is the downside. There is a 30 sec wait time before each room. If you're lucky to get into a game, GREAT! Once you're in there (poker mainly) the interface is sooo bad its hard to talk with people and play. Very bad interface.All in all, good idea with poor execution.			"

												Finally, a well designed walk around casino for PC. Remember Ceasars Palace? That was a good game made 15 years ago and there hasn't been something similar until now. The Four Kings is a huge casino and you can walk up to any table/machine and play it. 10/10You start with 10k chips and can purchase 400k for $20. If you're smart, that 400k will last an extremely long time even with max bets. For a free game, the 10k can last you a long time. That's a pretty incredible deal. Don't like it? Stop playing, or decide to spend $20 for the largest package of chips. The avatars are cheap and you can earn quite a few perks at the poker and blackjack tables for free. $20 out of the gate is very fair.There's tons of selection of games. Multiplayer makes this game awesome. You can sit down at a blackjack, craps, poker, roulette, war and money wheel and even bingo with real people. First person table view is excellent. Tired of playing? Go for a walk and sit down on a couch, eat some lunch, and come back. There's also a VIP area and many shops to buy things for your avatar. Call your friends up and play poker together with other people online.Yes, this game requires major computer resources as people are saying, so if you can't handle it turn them to low in the settings.

												I'll be completely honest, I'm not a gambling man. Or atleast I wasnt. For a free game this is amazing. It doesn't feel pay to win I've spent 0.99 cents on this game only because I've had it in my steam wallet for so much time. I've thought about spending money just because the prices are so worth it. But once again its not neccessary I have 200,000 chips right now I've earned by myself.Now for the gameplay, it's a really cool game that has a nice look to it. Some of the character animations are a bit wonky but as far as the card dealing, and slots its fine. This game does have a bit of optimization issues I think mainly are caused by the lighting engine(which looks great) as I have a GTX 970 GE and an i5-3570k and only get around 40 frames when walking around but at tables and slots its 60.Honestly I downloaded this game because my friend got me to do it with him as kind of a troll this is going to suck game but I actually have really enjoyed it.

								This game is probably one of the easiest games I've found to just hop on for an hour or so a day and just have some fun.The game is fairly well optimised after one of the latest patches, the game is now most certainly where it needs to be in terms of performace. The gameplay is so reliable and enjoyable, the only downside as many have said is the slots. Slots is the easiest game to sink money and time into and the current machine is rather lackluster. I'm aware a new machine is on it's way and that's what I'm most excited for.There is some issues with the games UI still and quite a few issues regarding the VIP system and everything relating that is rather confusing and not very well explained.The customisation of the characters is very strong and enjoyable, there is a lot of options regarding your style and the currency to buy items is a little hard to get however it's very rewarding when you finally get the item you have wanted.My biggest gripe is the VIP system and that is runs on a server based clock and if you manage to get VIP one day before the end of the month you get it for only that one day, then when the reset rolls around it clocks you back to normal status. Even if you purchased one of the dlc packs for a month of VIP it resets you to normal status when the monthly reset happens - so if you purchase it at a bad time you could only get 5 days of VIP or however long untill the month changes.This is a game I have been waiting for, and for a very long time. I am so glad it has finally come and it is so enjoyable. The updates are frequent however often not many new features as there is a lot of work to be done on the backend of the game and the new games etc take a very long time to produce. The payouts are balance, the game is fun, and the servers are fast.A great game in my opinion and I'm glad I bought into the beta before it went F2P because I got so much out of it. A must buy for any gambling enthusiast or card guys.  "

												It's simply a great game.I honestly don't really know why the reviews are 'Mixed' at the moments.The only way you can not like this game is that you either can't handle losing, you hate unfinished games or you somehow burn your money on this game. IF you are a person like that, than please don't start playing this game.I fell in love with this game. I love gambling games and especially the ones that don't force me to use real money and games that contain an entire casino in one game. The Four Kings does all of that and more.It is indeed possible to spend real money on this game and I have noticed that a lot of reviews are about this game being addictive and forcing you to spend real money. I am very much addicted to this game and love to play it, but this game does not make you spend real money. In most games you constantly get pop-ups with sales, deals et cetera. In this game, if you're willing to spend money on it, you'll actually have to search for a bit to find where to buy the chips. I like the way the developers have kind of hidden it so it didn't become tempting to do at all.It's a casino. It's gambling. Of course, you can lose and it will always feel like you lose more than you win. If you are a person that can't handle that than just don't play this game. Whatever you do, don't blame this game for the way your personality doesn't match with it. I've done some translating for this game and I know how hard the people behind this game are still working their asses off to improve it. I've played this game since the first day it was available and I still can't believe how fast it improved in a little more than a year. It was really crappy at the start and had a lot of bugs which are nearly all fixed. More slot games have been added and I've also seen they are working on a bowling alley which I personally can't wait for to see in the game.This game is far from perfect, but I fell in love with it and am able to accept and ignore the flaws it has.I can definitely not recommend this game for everyone out there since I know there are some people on this planet that really really can't handle losing. Fortunately I haven't seen much of these people within the community and I'd personally love to keep it that way and probably a lot of players with me.If you're reading this and you haven't tried the game yet. Just do it. Try it, and if it's not your thing just quit and come back after a few months. Your view will have changed and you'll appreciate it more than before.You'll meet a bunch of new people, it's fun to play with friends and above all: it's free.Try it out. You won't regret.			"

												If you're looking for a decent casino game which is fun, stable and playable with friends, keep looking, because this is not the game you're looking for.The game is not stable at all, I felt like I was testing an unreleased game. Out of thin air crashs, freezing game tables, countless lost chips due to casino's errors, took away the tad bit joy it created.Shall I mention that the BJ dealer is cheating like %80 of the time? Let me. This one time, I am playing table limit, my hand is 20, dealer's upcard is 3. OK, losing is something possible and acceptible, even in this situation, but what is 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 5 = 21? How's that even possible? Every single time I hit on 12-13 I bust, when dealer hits, it's a 21.I've been playing BJ and frequenting casinos more than seven years, and believe me, I've never seen a shameless blatantly cheating BJ like this.Video BJ is weird though, I presume devs forgot to fix that machine, nearly %60 of the time dealer busts.Video Poker? Scam of the century. Lot less profitable than real casinos.It's a game after all, one should get free chips to sustain a cashroll, or enough to create a base when outta chips. (which is a strong probability with cheating machines)  All you get is 1000 from daily if you've log in on consecutive days, 250 free chips every 15 minutes, or various amounts from daily tasks (average 800 chips daily).Oops, then what you gonna do? Can't even borrow from friends! ""You should buy chips"", they say. Dude, if I want to pay for chips, I'd be at a real casino, not here. And what happens if I gain more chips? Nothing. I can't even give away my chips, which is totally nonsense.But give the guys some credit. The whole concept of casino is about sucking money, and here you see casino combined with f2p, it tries to suck even more. Way to go, devs. Overall, decent graphics, nice variety of games, cheating AI, scamming devs, borderline braindead community.Stay away from this game as far as you can.			"

								This game is great! It provides a fun way to pass the time playing all of your favorite casino games. If you don't understand how to play some casino games it provides detailed instructions at the table. I played it for the first week it came out and have found myself striving to compete with friends to top the leader boards. They have very fun cosmetic items that you can obtain by playing casino games and some based on your performance. It's great that it provides a feel like you are playing with friends on almost any game you are playing with global & local chat.			"

								Great Casino game! This game is great for casino enthusiasts! If you like Poker, Slots, Blackjack, Roulette, Bingo, Craps, or social gaming, you will love this venue! Built with the PSN Home Casino player in mind, the developers have taken care to build a game that encourages multiplayer growth. Although still in Early Access, this game has so much to offer! You can customize your Avatar on the fly and there are many options for clothing and accessories! This is the first PC game I have seen with so many options for social casino play. The Developers are quick to answer any questions and attend to bug reports very well! They even have a dance club! Albeit the graphics are a bit dated, they suit well to the environment and the international crowd is very entertaining! I look forward to big things happening with this game!			"

								My First impression of this game was wow....i can finally go to a casino and not actually lose my moneyBut seriously, the game still very new and in early access, this game has great potential, yes one could argue its kinda blocky and clunky and slow to load things in some instance, but hopefully the dev's stick to their game and this can actually be a thing.Pros:Plenty of games to play Already has leaderboards for the variety of games Really makes you feel you are actually thereCons:Can be a little slow in loadingRandom disconnects for no reason are common No ambience music while your at the tables (would be nice devs)I know its been mentioned but a few different styles of slots and other machinesThings that would make this better (my opinion)Different Styles for machinesAmbience music while at the tablesMaybe some dealers and attendees for the machines (helps make it not appear so empty and lifeless)Will Update over time, but all in all I am enjoying this and hope this becomes something special			"

								It's hard not to recommend a ""Free To Play"" game, though I would like to see more options available to the player all-around.  For example, all of the video blackjack machines seemed to have the same minimum bid requirement...it would have been nice to see nickel, quarter and dollar machines to give players a bit more longevity with their chips.  On the bright side, there are plenty of ways to earn free chips (daily quests, spinning a daily wheel, visiting the chip machine every so often, etc.).  There was barely anyone on when I played, though the gentleman I ran into was nice enough...hopefully the folks who will potentially populate the server will be equally as warm.  It has potential, but there's room for improvement (hence why the game is currently in the Early Access program, no doubt).

												Can't test out poker mechanics without paying. Because the single free table is always full. And you have to play a game of grab the seat first to get in.Someone didn't think this thing through. Why would we pay for poker before we can get a feel for how they built it?Until more are added I would stay away. Unless you just want slots or something. Plenty of those to go around.			"

								I bought the ""DLC"" All-In-pass for EUR 33.29. A version with Alpha-State...I’m with VIP2 (VIP3 about 50%).But why are specified features are not available or not working correctly?Sorry, but that is not acceptable!VIP Guest Pass doesn’t work. I should actually have 13 VIP Guest Passes, but I can’t give this any user. (You are out of Guest Passes) α • β • γ Badges ... But where are the VIP badges? (specified features)VIP2 - 10% Bonus: Where is it?""/userlist"" feature doesn’t work.UI Home / Profile Game-states are not up to date real time (RP, Rank, VIP%). Only after Login again.UI Settings / Bbug reports: just for games, but not for other errors?UI, uiiih, oha. I use a keyboard, a mouse and a gamepad: This is not acceptable condition!Please improve the readability of chat bubbles, chat log and user ID.Why can’t interact with any user if he is game-in? (This also applies to report a user.)In the VIP area are clearly too few tables !!!Nightclub: Dancing without music?Overall still a few approaches for a social community game.Another problem: Game-In and Steam-Rewards ...The casino games themselves: Overall, these look very realistic. The waiting time until the next ""Bet"" is often very long. It is boring if more players at the table.But the longer you play a game, and the more variants you test, the more you realize that is manipulated here. Especially with Big6 and Blackjack, it is obvious that there are neither “random” nor “happiness” at work.""Free Daily Poker"" Tasks: User can not be fulfilled because 6 Users must participate in the game the task. (This also applies BINGO: Waiting for 3 other players)Games: What comes after level 40?It occurs to me positive that the entire DL team is a lot of effort to develop a great game and also to eliminate errors quickly. As you take the daily failed Login attempts in purchasing.As far as my first review here ...I hope you are open to my suggestions.It will. Keep it up! "

I was able to play for all of 10 minutes before I was out and ""forced"" to buy chips for cash. ♥♥♥♥ THAT. Uninstall, 0/10 would not play again.

												I would say this is one of the best free casino games I've played. I've been playing it a lot (on ps4 so I can play with my friend, which is why my hours are low on steam), and you don't ever have to spend any real money on it, you can win plenty of money yourself, I have over 200k ingame cash on the ps4 version from mostly poker and bingo games and I never spent a real-life dime on this game. I'm not even that great at poker. Pros:-Solid gameplay-You can earn lots of ingame money with skill and a little luck without paying real money-Devs push out frequent updates-Opportunities to regain cash when broke like free poker and free bingo games (plus they slowly give you 250 credits every so-often)-Full controller support-Chill music-Customizable avatars with emotes so I can be a creepy old man and dance on the bingo stageCons:-Community reminds me of PS Home in the sense that youve mostly got silent players, people who are trolling for fun (which I'm fine with c:), and those small groups that usually consist of mostly girls and maybe one guy who all have no sense of humor, have been playing this game forever, and are rude to anyone they don't know. This game is a lot more fun if you bring some friends.-Makes me feel like a senior citizen and I'm not sure how I feel about that.-Animations and character models sit on the line of laughably bad and just actually bad-User interface (mostly start menu and avatar customization menus/shop menus) are incredibly ugly and shop menus are barely functional at times (this doesnt matter if you don't care about clothes)If you want to play poker/bingo/blackjack/roulette/etc with internet friends on a semi-frequent basis, and you don't want to play a browser game, this is a good free option.

								If you are a gambling person, you will love this game. I spoke with one of the developers today and I can truly say they are putting in their best efforts to improve this game. An update is being installed as I type. I entered the casino and I must say, everything is quite self-explanatory. After playing a few spins on the roulette table I ran into a member of the dev-team and had a nice conversation. I have been looking for a game like this for AAAGES. But two weeks ago I searched yet again for a decent casino game on steam, and only a bit later, this comes out. It is truly amazing and heading in the good direction.Yes, there may be bugs and things may not be as ""smooth"" as one would like, but keep in mind that this game is still in development. I bought the all-in package and I am glad I did. I wonder if it will be ever possible to turn your 'earnings' into real money, since you can buy additional chips in the game with real currency. Anyway this game is really a must-have if you love gambling. This is the first time I have ever written a decent review on a steam game. On a game in general, I think. But let me tell you once again: It. Is. Worth. It. The variety of games to play is good. There's blackjack, single-deck 21, craps, keno, hold 'em poker, roulette, PuntoBanco/Baccarat, slot machines and some kind of ""Wheel of fortune"". There is also a VIP-area which allows you to play at tables with higher stakes, which makes it possible to either win more - or loose more - being able to change your bet more to your liking. You can also sit on a bench and do some emotes while talking, this adds to the real-life atmosphere. I will keep a close eye on the development of this game!>went to blackjack table> bet $1.000>Double down at 16>5>2110/10 would double down again on high numbers.			"

												Easily one of the best social gambling games Ive ever played. You create a character, roam around a casino and play various casino games such as Roulette, Slots, Blackjack, Poker, and so on. You unlock items for your character as you play games and reach milestones and get achievements. There is zero pay 2 win aspects to the game. Its free, you have the choice to buy chips, but you arent forced to. Not only are you not forced to buy chips, you get free chips every 15 minutes plus free chips from doing daily/weekly activities which vary from playing 5 hands of Blackjack to just simply changing your outfit.All in all this is an extremely fun and addicting game and the fact that its free2play is a huge bonus. This game does not deserve the negative reviews it has recieved so do not listen to the reviews. Download the game for yourself and give it a try. Better yet, grab a couple friends and gamble together!			"

								Some of you coming from the PS3 may remember the casino from PSHome made by Digital Leisure as the biggest rip off on there. The games that were horribly in the favor of the house. It was a fun place to hang out, but spend any real money and watch it go quick. That isn't the case with 4 Kings. They seem to have more realistic odds so the games are more fun to play. You aren't loosing to the dealer every hand. At this point there are still bugs to work out, but it's a good place to hang out,  play with friends, and make some new ones.To the home users hope to see you there. You can get this game free if you haven't already by visiting the DL site, and sending your psn info from the casino there.			"

								This is, without a doubt, the best early access game I've ever bought. If you're familiar with the PS3 Home casino, or even if you're not, you'll love this game.I took a risk buying this, as I don't usually expect much from early access, but this really surprised me. From the couple of hours of playing this, I've experienced stable, smooth, solid gameplay. I've tried all games in the casino, and they all work without a single hitch. If it didn't even say it was early access, I wouldn't have even known that it was.Good points:- Has a nice atmosphere, really feels like a nice place to hang out- Gameplay is smooth- Control/movement is great- Blackjack- The community who play regularly are really niceImprovement suggestions:- Avatar customisation is lacking- Lack of people to talk to (will improve with popularity hopefully!)- Lack of people to play Poker with- Chat/messaging system is a slightly buggyIf you're looking for a great casino game, this is the one. You can have a great casino experience for a few dollars. It's definitely worth buying now and investing for the future - I see great things ahead! Awesome job devs!			"

												This game has some great potential!  Even though it's just in beta I find myself logging in every day already.  The daily tasks keep me coming back for sure, and weekly ones are even better for when I get in the mood to grind some machines!  A few things that could be awesome to add are - Blind counters for poker tables - A menu you are able to bring up after you have ""tiered up"" to see what you just did and earned - Pay charts for slots  (I'm not sure if that would be possible at this point in time because the payouts seem a bit... wrong) - Interactive items in your condo - Being able to change shades of make up individually instead of having a few basics sets (lips, eyes, blush, etc) - Login screen/Loading screens having different music then the lobby music - An option to change the color of your dauber in bingo Overall, it's a very fun game!  I absolutely love the emotes and the mini games are such a blast.  The music is great too!			"

												Okay, it's like you're in the casino. Alot of games including blackjack , poker, bingo , craps , roulette and slots. You have your own avatar which you use to walk around and transision yourself into lobbies of the respective games mentioned above.Apparently , the only ""endgame"" as in a real life casino is to win big. But in this game , the chips you win e.g poker , i was in a table and by slowly eliminating the other 4 players ( due to their arrogance )I won everyone ( you can see my screenshots ) ended up with 150k + chips poker ingame. ( we all started with 50k )When i exited i had 20k chips on me while before entering i had 6-7k and gave 5k to enter the game. No clue how the chip thing works but still.Also , only way to spend your hard earned chips is by buying clothes. But not with the chips. With another currency i'm still unfamiliar with.Graphics are mehLag is fineYou get lost in the games!Players started cursing at one another!It's free , worth trying out if you like casino games.			"

												 Digital Leisure and i go back a while.  About 2 years or more to be more exact.  So, back then, and even earlier, there was this thing called Playstation Home, and it was a place where you could play games, watch videos on new game/movie releases, meet people, socialize, and do other things as well.  It was an amazing place and the best part was just how you could be what you wanted to be, although some times it did have a price tag on it, and have fun.  One of the many companies I remembered was DL.   They were well known for having their Casino hub, and a lot of people liked them for it.   Now, back then, I was able to play as well, and although I spent more money than I would like to admit, I did have fun and once you got to a certain tier/level, you never had to worry about losing too much money because you just had to play smart and not be an idiot.Well that was nice and all but PSH was shutdown because Sony wasn't making enough money or something and all that money we spent, went bye bye.   Now, back to the present.  We have this Casino game, back up and free to play, and it has the same feel as the other casino did.   So my review is biased slightly because I really loved it back then and am happy to see it now.   Due to that, I will keep the review part, short and brief.Pros:Has many different gambling games and slotsNice way to customize your avatar in terms fo looksrewards for winning things or achieving thingsways to earn free chips so you can still playMuch much cheaper prices for chips than when it was on PSHVisuals are pretty butCon:Visuals are pretty, but if you put on max or near max, then you will lag, badly.  Its just not that well optimzied but who cares, its all about the gambling, not the visualsEasy to lose money fast if you don't know what you are doingOverall, this is very much like how Home was but with a few changes that make it nice.   And yes you can still dance in front of people and be a weirdo.			"

												What really can be reviewed here by me is the account creation screen (works fine) and half-working loading screen. Completely functional loading screen would not freeze at 75% and leave you hanging.The loading that doesn't even allow you to play the game doesn't really give me any other option than thumbs down. When it's fixed, I might try it again and (maybe) change my rating.			"

												Oh, I have such a love/hate relationship with this game. lolTHE UPSIDE: In terms of playability, it is probably the best casino simulator out there. The graphics look great, the games are a blast, and they start you off generously, while also occasionally giving you chips here and there based on little side tasks you can complete, so that you're never completely out of chips. The games list consists of Bingo, Craps, Blackjack, Poker, Roulette, War, Big Wheel, Keno, Slots, and even Bowling!There is a social club, though I never really see anyone in there. You can chat with others, customize a personal avatar, and win points to buy more customizable options for them (clothes, accessories, etc). Not many people actually chat when I'm there (usually late evenings), but when you do strike up a conversation, usually while getting ready for a poker game, I've found some really nice people there.THE DOWNSIDE:Cash. Cash Cash Cash. Like most free to play games, there are options to buy chips (and even some extra accessories you can't buy with points). Now, the prices are actually not unreasonable. As of this review, 99 cents gets you 5,000 chips. $4.99 will get you 50,000 chips. I guess it's just my issue with spending real money in order to try and win fake money, and that you can lose your fake money really quickly if you're not careful, just like real gambling. Granted, if you lose 50,000 chips, you've lost $5 (and it might be a good, cheap lesson for those of you who gamble this way in real life), it's just there's no way to recoup that in any real way.So I guess that's more of a personal drawback. Some folks don't mind paying a couple of bucks here and there, and in all honesty, if you can spare $5 every so often I guess it's not that big of a deal. I mean, there are games where you pay $5 and $10 for extra minutes of game time, or extra power-ups that disappear in a handful of moves, so maybe there's more to it than I'm relaying here.FINAL THOUGHT:This game is a lot of fun. The games feel authentic, the atmosphere makes you feel like you're in Vegas, and to be honest there aren't many options left for those of us who like to gamble without spending real piles of money. All in all, I do recommend this game.			"

												A very legit Casino game. Mostly it's great for testing any gambling theories out, before going to a real casino and trying with real money.  This game doesn't require you to spend any real money AT ALL. and it has pretty much EVERY casino game out there.  If you run out of money you (can) buy more, or you can just wait a little bit, do some side mission type thing, or wait until tomorrow to get some more play money.  So this developer makes real money of actual desperate gamblers that spend real cash in order to top leader boards or buy cool clothes or whatever. But if you just want to try certain strategies before using real money on them, this is the perfect game for that!			"

												There is many good things about The Four Kings Casino.  This has been a very enjoyable game,  however, I feel there are some things needed to improve it.  A monitor needs to be in place in the bingo room.  There are many who ac tually do not understand and do not read the rules.  The V.I.Pl status is very lonely.  No people in the room.  There needs to be something that attracts us more then increase in money in winnings as well as in games.			"

Because the developpers and his team are working their as.ses off to be present in their community and are not trying to rob your money. People get mad about Blackjack and losts of chips, but if gambling was just about winning then what would be the point?This game has a vast selection of casino games. And since its an early access we can expect more to come.Give this game a try you wont regret it! after all its free :) .			"

												I loved gambling games on console with my real-life broseppis' back in the day. Caesar's Palace & Golden Gaytime Nugget on PS1.I played this at my last clan marathon & I was overwhelmed with how nice this game is. I made good coin on the Chocolate wheel, tables & Keno. I encountered no bugs, no problems, no errors.. Character creation is super dank. Art style is super dank too. I bumped into 100 people online, tables were full. The game was a joy to play.I hit the 'Follow' button on all the games I own. This gives you notifications about updates, news & patches etc.. I installed this game close to the release date. I'm absolutely astounded by the dedication of these Devs. They've persisted through a great deal of negative reviews & since inception they eat, sleep, breathe, repeat this game. They have released new patches almost every day now for weeks.This is free.. there is no pay2win element. Grab a friend, make an account.. go play.10/10 would Fedora tip again.			"

												I came into this game with big hopes. I love the whole casino thing and was hoping I'd finally find a game with decent graphics that would last. What I found was a game developed in unity and open to so much cheating that it isn't really worth it. Mix that in with people spamming obscene, racist rants, trolls calling false bingo's every number and staff and dev's who seem not to care the least bit. This hurts because I really wanted this to be a good game, but sadly it's just not. If you are looking for a fun casino experience with devs who moderate chat, and care about their game I'd suggest http://www.casinorpg.com. While not as pretty as The Four Kings, the community, and game play is years ahead.

While there are a few things i would like to see improved that list is a very short one That is only helped by the developers who take the time to adress bug reports and apply the fixes required to make the game better and not only do they fix them they are in there testing the game along with us.

												While there are many friendly people on the network, the suspicion that the odds have been stacked in the house's favor makes the game an overall unenjoyable experience.Playing over 10 hours of blackjack following standard basic strategy outlined by wizardofodds.com, my average losses were roughly 50,000 chips an hour. This puts the house edge of blackjack at over 10%, which in no variation of game rules is reasonable. Sitting at any table game will cause nothing but frustration for you, or the players beside you. It's no surprise that the only game played by the regulars is poker, which is played against other players, not the house.If you choose to play this game, play it for the social experience, not for the excitement that a fair casino offers. There will not be enough enjoyment to justify the time, energy, and money you dump into the game.While I have enough chips in my account to bleed out for the next six months, I have instead decided to uninstall this game in favor of more fruitful pursuits. Social experience: 9/10Gambling experience 2/10			"

Early Access Review
								Four Kings Casino is probably the best simulated casino style multiplayer game to date. Most typical casino games are present and the play style is that of an mmo with customizable avatars ect allowing you to navigate the realistic virtual casino setting and join the different games as you choose. Gameplay is very similar to the Digital Leisure casino that was part of playstation home, for those that played that, only graphically better. Bugs have been minimal over the several hours I've played so far and the game is pretty polished for the first few days of early access beta. I would definitely recommend this game for casual players who enjoy both casino style gaming and social mmo type game mechanics. My only caveat is that this game is not strictly a free to play game, but after its offical launch will be a microtransaction model wherein you have the option of  purchasing additional casino chips to augment or replenish your current holdings. As with any game of this nature the inherent cost will depend on what you decide to spend, so amongst those gamers who inexplicably expect to enjoy playing polished multiplayer games without having to financially support them I'm sure there will be complaining.

												The game is a combination of Second Life and a common Casino Game. I like the idea and I think the developers' execution is well done. Using a laptop with HD3000 chip, I cannot rate the graphics.Plus:- The diversity of casino games is very good and even better than the average casino-only games.- The socializing is eased as a HUD is implemented similar to MMORPGs with some default mimics (Dance, Say Hello, Wave the hand, ...).- Easy start with start chips and the support through chip income with daily quests. If you do not want to spend hours on gambling, than I think it should be enough.Neutral:- The execution time of the casino table games is poor. It is onlz neutral, as the developer have to ensure that all players are on the same level all the times. But in a real live casino, the execution is mind blowing contrary to this game.- The party room seems unecessary, as there is never one in it. On first sight, this room also does not provide any benefit or interesting spot.- 3 Minutes to wait when all players are there to start a round of Bingo? That's far too high!Minus:Basically the casino consists of 5 rooms (hopefully I counted correctly). However, each room is only accessible via a loading screen. I think this concept is too much outdated to give here any possibilty for an excuse. The casino is not the Venetian and I think the level should be loadable within one go.			"

												Been playing this for a handful of months now. You should have no problem being able to gamble and hang with friends without buying chips if you know how to play the games.  Also if you don't over bet based on the amount of chips you have.  It has 3 different slot games, Video Poker, Video BJ, multiple deck BJ and single handed BJ (in VIP lounge), Texas Hold em, Keno, War, Roulette, Craps, Bingo, Big 6 Wheel, and Baccarat. The game has events on the weekends (same 4 that repeat), daily tasks (quests if you will), and weekly tasks.  The leaderboards reset every 3 months (considered seasons) and I believe there are rewards at the end of each season depending on where you rank in each game and global. On the downside, there are gliches which is to be expected.  They patch probably once a month, sometimes twice.  There are people that shouldn't be on the game much less within the social/online community like anywhere. Easily can be blocked though.  If you enjoy messing around with gambling then you would probably enjoy this game.			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Gambling game.Interface/Menu/Settings. You need to make an account for this game in order to play. This game is totally for free, however you are able to buy stuff with money.You can play window mode or fullscreen.There is alot of resolution sizes.The sound and music volume has a slidebar.You are able to change controls.You can play this game with a xbox controller. With vibration toggle mode.About the game.You play with a 3D Character which you are able to customize. You can even unlock new clothes and tools. You can change Gender/Clothes/effects at any time you wish.The game can only be played in online mode. You are able to level up in activities. For whatever reason it is.You are able to compete other players in some gambling modes.You are able to add ""Timestamp"" in the chat window.You can use emotes.There are alot of different Gambling modes in the game.Casino slot machinesBingo (My favourite)BlackjackPokerRouletteWarAnd some other activities.However sometimes it feels that the game is a little too unfair and makes you lose many or multiple times.On the other hand, Casino's never were fair even in real life.Every 15 minutes you will get 250 chips for free, however these will not stack (which means you have to collect them). You will also NOT receive the free chips if you are offline. You will only get them if you are online in the game.You are able to complete tasks to get some more Chips or even clothes.  There are daily and weekly tasks.Other things.There are leaderboards for certain Casino games.There are alot of immature people or people that are offensive and swearing.Alot of people do not want to sit next or close to someone else. They prefer to sit in the middle, or having 1 sit next to them empty or they sit entirely alone.The game is sort of addictive, Not because it's a ""Gambling"" Game. But more it's easy to play and easy pick and leave game. Time goes fast too.Game is Pay to lose. Literally, You lose more then win. You pay real life money to get chips and you spend them in the casino to lose again without making a profit. -------------------I Give this game a 6/10			"

												I found the over all game to be very worth while and would reccommend it to anyone. However, their are still a few minor glitches that should be addressed. some of the Poker tables are a little laggy at times and will occassionally freeze up upon starting. The Bingo caller will occassionally freeze upon start up as well. This being said i find the game to be excellent. I would suggest a little more avatar customization. Tattoo's different body styles, asian features for those who want their avatars to be a trurer representation of themselves. I realize this review seems a little negative but the things i have mentioned are either suggestions or bug fixes they are probably already trying to address. Like i said i would reccommend this game to anyone .Dalumo			"

												Super fun!  I love this game.  The real downside is that you either wait forever to get chips or you pay actual money to keep playing with chips, IF you don't want to wait.  It would be better to at least let us buy a full version of the game and then let us get more money to trickle in faster and still keep the payment model they have for anyone else.			"

												The game itself is nice.  I enjoy the real casino vibe it carries.  Almost all of the social aspects of the game fall totally flat.  Like your complimentary apartment, and the dance club.  There are zero reasons to go there.  I walked around the apartment and you can't do anything except sit on things.  I didn't even notice any customizable aspects to it.  Pros. Real Casino simulator in how you walk around and play the games.  Seems like most of the games simulate real life fairly well based on my experience with those games.  Poker is always agaisnt players so it is the ""fairest"", although it falls victim to all fake money poker games out there.Cons.Blackjack.  Holy crap... the blackjack. This game however is totally broken.  The dealer draws to 20 and 21 an INSANE amount of times.  It regularly draws to 20 and 21 with 5 and 6 showing.  The worst cards it can get.  The dealer also ends up with 20+ so often that you simply can't win even a 30 minute sitdown of basic BJ play.  I have played basic BJ rules, and in real life you can expect losing streaks of up to around 6 hands in a row.  More then that gets mathmatically inplausable, although 7 or even 8 could technically happen if you played for long periods of time.  This game however has gone on multiple 10+ hand losing streaks.  I have seen three 10 hand losing streaks in the last 2 days alone and Iv only dared play it a handful of times.  These happen in less then 20 minutes of playing.  The odds of this happening should be impossible, but it happens regularly.  10 unwinnable hands in a row when you play basic BJ.   I always play solo at the table to exclude any player errors.  Do NOT play BJ in this game.  Unless you are only going to play 3 or 4 hands and pray for a win.  But for real long term tight play, its useless.			"

												All the fun of a real casino but with no risk!Play from a multitude of games and chat with other people whilst doing so. You can play games for free like poker or pay the in game money, of which it gives you a nice steady flow. There are some people that try to ruin it but thankfully the spam filter is great and hilarious the first time you see it. For free, a good game with plenty of things to occupy your time even if you've naver gambled in your life.			"

So far I have had the game for only 2 DAYS, 2 DAYS!!!!!!............and i have lost over 20000 chips from glitches. I foolishly decided to purchase some more chips with real money just to enjoy another game of poker, but OF COURSE the table froze and everyone lost 5000 chips, all 6 players. I see the game has only been released since june the 1st, but yeah, the game devs are definitely going to want this fixed like yesterday or this game will be useless. Now, let me say this. These table glitch / freeze are the only issue i have with the game, other then that, the game is great. I'm forced to leave a negative review because of these very frequent very frustrating crashes that steal my chips, WHEN I WAS WINNING THE POKER Game. This turns a very fun game into a frustrating anger fueler. lol, seriously tho, fix the f-ing game. "

This game from what I can see is being updated and fixing bugs as they come up.  One user said he lost chips because of a glitch and the game stopped working, this happen to me, I reported the bug and my chips were refunded within hours of the report.  Another whine was that it would caused fatal errors, I'm not a computer genius but I always find that these errors are to a certain extent caused by the user's computer I have been playing every day for an hour or so and never had any sort of error.

												I've had this game for a day now, and it's a great simulation of a casino. It is in early access, but it's currently a great game in and of itself. Personally, I have really enjoyed the video poker and blackjack. Bingo and poker are relatively high-stakes (compared to the funds that I have in-game at the moment), but it seems like I will be able to play both games soon after accumulating more chips. One thing though- I can't find any baccarat tables. It says in the game description that you can play baccarat, so they have either not incorporated it into the game as of yet, or it is in the VIP Lounge, which I cannot enter right now. Another excellent feature is that even though you may have been ""gambling"" for hours, your character never loses his confident stride.10/10 would frolick in casinos again			"

								Four Kings Casino is the re-incarnation of the PS Home casino on PC (for now). A PS4 version is planned for the future. I must admit I was skeptical at first. Partly because I am not much of a gambler. But I wanted to be able to give our readers at yourpshome.net an insight as to what it was all about. Guess what? I got sucked in :) First of all, I was surprised at just how far this project has come along. I expected a very tiny begining and was amazed the first time I signed on that a whole casino was in front of me complete with a VIP room and a Club to party in. Now a nice ""hotel room"" (personal space) has been added which means the groundwork has been laid for future expansion. I orinally intended to just use the ""free"" or ""beta"" version, but it only took one visit to make me want to upgrade to an ""All-In"" pass. Well worth it. So even if you are not a die-hard gambler, you might still want to check this out. This isn't a Home replacement but its the best I've seen so far. Check it out. Who knows what the future holds?			"

												This is a great game, it's new, but well supervised, monitored and maintained.  Thus far, they are diligently working on bugs, exploits, security issues and games... kudos to them for doing such a brilliant job!!!  If you want something relaxed and not chaotic, this is your game.  Lots of people to meet, lots to do or not do, dependent upon your preferences.  Like all games, there will be idiots.... they've made it simple to ignore them and they are dealing with them on a daily basis ... there are becoming fewer and fewer idiots to ruin your fun!  Give it a go, you have nothing to lose..... I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.			"

												This game is in its early stages. I'm sure with a couple of patches we'll see this as a fully functional game.As an avid casino player having played, Reel Deal Vegas/Live (when it was open), Casino RPG, and Facebook casino games I can tell you that this is one of the best casino games out there. The navigation takes a bit of getting use to and clicking (E) to interact with tables and the video machines is cumbersome but still enjoy it nonetheless a very beautiful casino. I love the fact that there's alot of detail that went into there table games and the fact that this casino has an actual bingo room. You can even sit on the chairs provided and have a hotel room which you can access.I'm hoping in the future they have more to customize such as changing or upgrading your room, etc. Of course more slots and more variety of table games. its def on the right path thoughthe only heartburn I have with it is the microtransactions, I feel they could go the subscription route but thats just me.

												Great time waster. I really didn't expect to have much fun with this game and thought it was going to be really geared towards spending your money. The devs made it incredibly easy to enjoy this game without spending a dime. You get free chips regularly, every 15 minutes or so, there's multiple free daily things to get chips (poker, slots) and some of the jackpots you can hit pay out tons. If you are inclined to spend money on this game it's incredibly cheap, I was actually surprised at how little they charge for chips, cosmetic items are really the only thing with a mention worthy price tag. Devs are on regularly and actively listening to feedback and bug reports. It also has a really large community for being out for a whole two days. I can only see this becoming more enjoyable.If you enjoy gambling but you're a cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, this game is for you.			"

												Wasn't expecting much out of this, but was pleasantly surprised.If you enjoy the casino game experience, you'll probably love this.  I'm not much on that type of thing, and even I found it pretty damned endearing.Basically it's a multiplayer lounge with a bunch of casino games going on.  Pretty awesome.  Decent character customization and plenty of unlocks to keep you wanting to gamble up some more in-game money :)  Check it out if you're into Casino games, or just bored.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. I'm a big fan of casino games in general. I don't gamble much in real life, but it's nice to be able to have fun with little expense. Unfortunately, this game didn't really fit the bill.  From a social aspect, it's fine. Most of the people are nice. The rest of the game though, is severely lacking.  Poker has the same problem it has anywhere else. It's free. People still make boneheaded calls and go all-in with nothing.  The bigger problem is that the only tournament you can play is with 6 people at one table. You start with $50k which would be fine if the blinds didn't go up extremely fast. It makes trying to play a realistic game of poker virtually impossible, as very soon after starting you're pretty much pot committed once you bet anything.Blackjack is probably the best part of the game though, especially after the last update, it literally feels like the dealer is getting 20 or 21 every other hand. Still, there is money to be made if you know how to play.That brings me to the worst part of the game, table machines. Slots, keno, video blackjack and video poker are money suckers with what seems like much lower payout percentages than even Vegas. I literally sat there for 30-45 minutes without a single bonus round. Forget trying to bet anything higher than the minimum because you will soon be out of money.  There are only three types of slot machines which gets old really fast especially when none of them pay.  Keno has a minimum bet of $100 and video blackjack has a minimum of $200. With poor payouts, again you will be out of money quickly.  The game also has war, roulette, big wheel, craps and bingo which are all pretty standard.  Again, especially with war, it seems like the more money bet, the lower percentage of times you're going to win.You have daily tasks to do, receiving $200 for each of the 6. Unfortunately, most of the time you will be spending more than that to complete the tasks. There are weekly tasks, mostly revolving around getting a certain amount of XP. An example of the problem with this is me spending 45 minutes playing a $400 per spin slot machine, losing 40k and gaining a whopping 200xp. That would have been great if the weekly task wasn't 1,000 XP with a few thousand reward for doing so.  There is a VIP section for high rollers but I honestly don't know how people get to be high rollers unless they have spent real money or gotten extremely lucky. Again, I really wanted to like the game. Unforunately, there is better poker to be had on any online site and the rest of the game is just no fun with the extremely low payouts.  If you're just in it for the social aspect and don't mind betting small, go for it. Otherwise, I'd stick with other products.			"

												I constantly feel like the blackjack tables are stuck in a cheating loop. On 5 seperate occassions, I've seen the dealer get a king of hearts and a king of spades, 10 times in a row. I recorded some of its hands to see what they were like, its starting hand was never below 15 and somehow (despite only having a 13% chance to do so) it would consistently pull a 5 or a 6 to get a 20 or 21. The dealer in Four Kings gets a 20+ more than half of the time after 30 hands and most of those are a starting pair of 10 value cards.  The chances of these things happening aren't impossible, but for my first example, you would literally be more likely to pick an atom in your house at random and then accidently pick it again. And this somehow happened 5 times, if that's not cheating then I must have a luck of about 1 or 2 because I have lost over 100k chips to the blackjack tables.			"

												I throughly enjoy this game. that being saidI disagree with whatever programming that is used for single player blackjack. What doesn't make since is that shoe play seems to favor the player more than single deck play, which is extraordinarily false in real life. There is no way to be sure the dealer is not simply rearranging the cards at any time to convenience the dealer and screw the player.Dealer dealt 20 or 21 greater than 50% of the time. Most of your double downs will be dealt a tiny card. Basic strategy is of little use since you will almost always be dealt a 10 with a 12-16 pat hand.One other thing I noticed. If you bet the smallest amount, you tend to win more than 50% of the time. If you start betting big, you will lose more than 80% of the time. Again, if you bet big, the computer can simply program the deck however it sees fit to win all the time. The programming of this game will just deal the dealer a 21 whenever the player trys to bet large. I've seen the dealer be dealt at least 5 times in a row before. Would never ever happen in real life to the dealer. Because no one would play.Additionally, at least 30-40% of the time, the dealer will draw to perfectly match your hand or beat your hand by one. while frusterating and not a big deal, it ONLY occcurs when you sway from the basica strategy while trying to mess up the card order so the dealer doesn't auto matically hit to a 21. Ex: you're dealt a 13 against a dealer up 6. Basica strategy says to stand, however when hitting you will always either be dealt a 10, or if you are dealt a small card, let's say a 4 (to a total of 17) - the dealer will either have an Ace in the hole (17 to push) or will draw perfectly to 18 (not 19-21, only to 1 above your pat hand).Don't spend really money on this game. It encourages the developers to try and take it even more so by instilling these unfair game mechanics.			"

												It's fun if you give it some time and play the games a fair bit. Bingo is easyly the most played game, while the nightclub is a joke of a room no music no simulated drinking or ablity to buy a person a drink as a gift no reason to go there. The other games are fun (Blackjack being my fav!)  but the slots all 3 <--  -_-  of them need a lot of work there simly cheap looking crap they look nothing like the Vegas quality of flashy fun and the art on them is browser flash game quality at it's worst. The casino it's self isn't my style for a casino but it does the job, I would add the ablity to pick a theme for the casino set by the player like how a skin mod on L4D2 works only the player who picked it sees it that way you could theme more to your style. The clothing shops are lacking and the RP points are kinda silly sense a cash shop feature is in one of the most lacking shops already they should have it where you spend real money on the clothing outside of the free stuff you win of course. Overall i'd say that for a free game it's not bad but needs a lot of work to be anything worth remembering. Sense this game is theonly one of it's kind on steam let alone online that i personaly know about i'd say it's a 6 out of 10 good to unwind but nothing to be impressed with long term.			"

												This game is fun, very realistic, its gambling what is more to say. If you like having a free entertainment try this game, just wish you could give funds between friends. You can pay for chips but its not needed since you get 250chips free every 15minutes. Fun game to play with friends. Costs nothing			"

												The game allows you fair enough opportunities at the chance of free chips, as long as you play smart and conservative you'll never feel as though your forced to pay real money for them. I wish more developers realized this as games like this one depend on a active population. Still at times the population seems lacking in both the Bingo and Poker rooms. Bingo where the amount of people playing the game effects the jackpot and Poker where you have to sit at a table and wait for others to join. However this maybe different in the VIP section, as I write this I have not made it that far. As Casino games go I feel that this is a decent one. It comes with a few bells and whistles with tournaments, leader baords and character customization.			"

												I've been enjoying Four Kings. It reminds me of Second Life or Sony Home - with that kind of last decade feel - but fun nonetheless.The machines are quite lacking in graphics, interface, and variety. Your average Facebook slots are light years better. Daily quests are mildly fun to complete. Avatar customization is average but okay. The table games and bingo are the most fun, with the social aspect and decent interfaces.I like this kind of game - and I wish someday there's a modern version that doesn't feel like I'm back in 2005.

Pros:- Great graphics for casino game- Pretty much every game is here- Great music. Music could ruin the experience, but they have great selections. - Great avatar customizations a la Sims games- Can chill in your spacious hotel room- can hang out and dance in the nightclub. - Meet people Cons:- can get laggy in main lobby, but not a big deal at all. Looking forward to doing a deep dive this weekend with some drinks! Hope people get behind this game. With good fan support, and if number of online players grow, this will better than it already is. I am digging it!  "

												I did not enjoy this game at all. It´s slow, with long idle waits at the table before the game starts and the games are tedious to play, with bad gameplay interface. I know my computer is not fast but I play lots of games that look much better and have a lot more going on that play well, this seems like a badly optimised game that moves like treacle. Too much emphasis on the social aspect which slows the games down as well. And the player accessories are annoying to look at after a while. Swirling cards and stars moving around them all the time... pfff, not my thing. Your milage may vary but I did not like it at all.			"

												Editing my review of this game completely as things have changed a lot since I wrote my first review and second edit.The game is a lot less buggy than it was. It still sometimes kicks people from the table or game but it's leaps and bounds better than it was. All and all this is my favourite online poker playing game so I would recommend this to anyone who wants to play poker but don't want to pay money for it. (I also like to gamble with black jack, but poker is why I keep coming back to this game). The avatar simulation, in-game chat and community is also very nice and adds to the realism of it all. Different clothing for the avatar is also a pretty fun touch to the experience. I'd give this game 9.5/10			"

												OK time to review this game. I'll give it an nine point one. Fun bingo games that overall pay the best. I'm a pretty fair craps player. I play passline with odds and the come with odds but I swear craps kicks my♥♥♥♥♥ I can't figure this out. I'll Have to go back with a system I guess and try again. Overall the game is a blast and it is cool to walk up to a chick and ask her to dance. Most of the time they don't know how to react. Just don't harrass them, please.Machine play is pretty normal give and take, I still have not hit a straight!  Good fun and you can spend a few bucks without breaking the bank. Lots of table games that are fun. If you can coerce an invite to the Vip club it gives you a 24 hour pass. That brings with it a Baccarat game and some serious minimums on the other table games. High rollers only (or you can just hang out and see how the other half lives) lol!Have a little fun, don't get your undies in a bunch. It's just clean fun.Hope Digital continues to improve the solid product that they have.P.S. If you bingo, a must have is the $4.95 Auto Marker. You can kick back and watch the numbers come in all marked for you. On the longer games you can wander off, have a smoke, vacuum the living room, etc. come back and presto... all of your cards are marked! Way cool. And I'm not a shill for the Devs. Just tryin' to help! Please don't think I'm trying to sell♥♥♥♥♥♥ You get the marker you'll love itPPS I hit a straight tonite! celebration time.PPPS I won on bingo 50000 last nite and 26000 today. Am I on fire or what?

												The game isnt bad. I give it 8/10. The Poker is Texas Hold 'Em but the blinds go up so fast and so much that its hard to play a strategic game. You have to spend 5k to get on the table and have to count on dumb luck. Other than that is is a great game. The Blackjack is good, Craps, War everything is fine i just hate the blinds in Poker. You get 250 dollars every 15 minutes so if you lose all of your money you dont have to pay for more you can get the free 250 and make some money playing War or Blackjack or something and hopefully go play a better game.

												I have so far extremely enjoyed my experience on this game. I think it deserves higher then a mixed review by far. The game has had some issues with bugs like bingo games freezing and black jack not working, but the devs seem like they are working very hard to fix these issues as fast as possible. And I should also mention that both times i had chips stolen from me from a game bug, I REPORTED the bug and GOT my chips back...so quit whining about losing chips to bugs if your not gonna report it. They have bug and optimizing updates what seems like almost everyday, which only has been improving the experience overall.  The community so far has also been mostly positive while playing. I have only encountered a few jerks so far but most people are on to have fun with everyone. As far as people saying you have to buy chips to get anywhere, they clearly havnt put the time into learning how the games work. Once you learn how machines and tables play with rules and mechanics, it is super easy to make money. I give this game so far a 9/10 if you like casino like games and hanging with people. Did somebody say conga line???			"

												This game is like a love or hate relationship. Its really fun playing different casino games. BUT! it depends on how you spend the complimentary $10,000 the game gives you in the begining. If you lose it all in the first couple games you play, then you hate the game, and end up whinning about it in your review. If you playt smart and know how to play the games, then your fine, and you will either 1: lose and keep your money at the same rate, and never really go any higher or lower than $10,000. 2: you lose a little, and make a♥♥♥♥♥♥load, and you work your way up to higher and higher money levels. I have been up to $16,000 and my friend went up to $30,000 with in minutes.I suggest this game for people who can play casino games, and know basic math, so that you dont lose all your money.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a good game; the beta bonuses are cool and give you a great chance to play around with the software. This game also has some cool clothing options. There should be more options for players when no other players are available. No one like to sit at an empty table for 20 mins waiting for people to join. Some of the payouts don't seem to be distributed correctly, especially the Slots. I do like the daily tasks, it gives you something fun to do while you enjoy the games. Overall, the game looks good, has some great giveaways and freebies, seems to be a great social mechanism, but t he game play for each individual game needs some work. The games look like real casino games, but, unfortunately they don't play like real casino games enough.			"

												This here is a true story.- This one time, I walk into a danceclub. Saw some people doing something in a private booth.- Apparently a striptease going on. Join with a guy character to give a lapdance to some dude.- Suddenly turns into a gangbang.- One girl in pay2win clothing invites me and some dutch guy in her room for some fun time.- Funtime happens numerious times before getting to the room, but we get there eventually.- Many, MANY chat ♥♥♥♥♥♥s and ballrubs later we get kicked out.- Tomorrow, get a friend invite from some random dude.- Accept, start chatting with him, apparently the girl told him about me.- Figure out he is the sexparty hostess' bf. He asks how I know her.- ""Ummmm...""- Tell him about the yesterday sexparty.- Flips, threatens to punch me via the chat system.- Next time I run into that girl, she quickly leaves and unfriends me.- Never hear from either of them again.1nightstand/10 would get twisted in a sudden love triangle again.Oh, and you can play bingo too.

												If you like gambling you can't really go wrong trying this game. This is a fine start to a possibly great casino game.  I spend most of my time at the Blackjack table, Poker table, or the random daily quest games.- Pros:Fun.People are nice that I have met.Cosmetics are purchasable with earnable credits in-game.A free game of poker everyday.- Cons:Chips are slow to aquire if you are out.The UI is a bit lacking and sometimes hard to deal with.Cosmetic selection could be larger and models/graphics could be better. (But thats nit-picking)Poker room is far to small, has very fast blind structure, only sit-n-go, one buy-in bracket, and no other games but Texas Holdem.			"

												This game has the following:Many different kinds of gambling, including Roullette, Poker, and Blackjack (and more).You can wander around! There are rooms you can find on-foot, or you can use your phone.Customization includes one basic body type, for both genders...but height is a slider. I want slimmer people. That said, there are many customization options. Weight is not one of them.Did I mention Gambling?! You get paid just for being there!Do you like Casinos? Well...download this FREE game! Then you'll have one! Kinda...I recommend this game mostly because I won my 1st table. I found a free table, sucked terribly, went to a $5,000 table, and I saw people come over from the Free Table...whooped all of them, and played many more fullfilling poker games. The Game is Real.

												From one of the old 'big dogs' of Playstation Home, Four Kings is a solid casino title, with a lot to offer, but a fair few minor flaws.  I haven't tested every single title, but after spending a chunk of time on several, I can say the following:Pros:A good set of titles that all function well; poker is of course only as good as the players you get, but all the basic functionality and pomp is here, combined with the daily tasks and tier increases that made PS Home attractive for folks like me.  It is, in essence, a wide array of gambling options with level ups and leveling bonuses.  That's kind of awesome.Regular influx of chips.  Playing for free long-term is entirely possible due to getting a decent chunk of chips for free from a number of resources (daily super slots, daily/weekly tasks for more chips, 250 chips every 15 minutes in game), which keeps the title from feeling locked off to any reasonable extent.Looks great.  Not Skyrim-with-a-million-graphics-mods great, but there's obviously been a lot of work to make the Four Kings look interesting, like the kind of place you could go for a vacation.ConsLack of counter of autoplay.  This is a minor quibble but it does frustrate.  I like to play the machine game 'Instant Keno', and it's a bit annoying that when I select the autoplay option that until it gets to the final play, I have no visual indicator how many runs I have left.Wasted space.  I love the nightclub and the apartment!  They look great, and again bring me back to what I liked about Playstation Home.  Except, they have no purpose at present.  The nightclub has the same music as the rest of the game.  The DJ booth, the bars, all have no interactivity.  The apartment is arguably worse, in that while it looks lovely, there's no way to interact with anything in this allegedly personal space, not even the televisions that look for all the world like they SHOULD be interactive.  I don't want these spaces excized, mind you; it helps to separate the title from generic casino titles in a similar vein, but all of the above needs SOME measure of interaction.  Mini-games, additional places to spend chips/RP/etc, looping videos, new music, I don't care what.  But for it to be lacking all of that makes it little more than window dressing.Limited spending options.  At present, chips let you play games, winning gives you RP, which can be used to buy a SMALL handful of avatar items, and if you earn X amount in a single month, you get VIP access for a month.  And... that's it.  Can't upgrade your apartment, avatar options are super limited, no special entertainment options for expending RP, etc, etc.  I hope this changes, as there's a lot of room here for enhancement of the overall experience beyond the casino games (which, again, work great and are decently diverse).Overall, the game is a recommend.  Yes, it has flaws, and I hope to see the title expand a LOT.  But what is there right now is a complete gambling title with solid gameplay in a good environment with countless options for snagging more chips for free and getting your fix on for the day.  And for an entry price of free, it's hard not to say give it a shot.			"

												This game is great for a newly released title. There are a few bugs like blackjack and poker tables freezing but for the most part this game works great. The FPS on high end computers seems to be lower than low end PC's for some reason but the developers have said they are working on that.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is everything it promises. A classy casino with traditional casino games, a VIP lounge, hotel rooms, poker tables, with more planned.Pros___-Realistic games, from periodically shuffling the deck in blackjack, to the betting ranges and free spins with a massive amount of lines to hit on within the slot machines, the games have a nice, realistic feel to them.-Population is currently rising, making this community driven game even more fun.-Awkward Dancing .Cons___-Currently, the variety for slots and machine games is limited. The devs DO, however, have intentions to implement more slot machine varieties as well as other games.-Some interface issues. Poker in particular has some issues which makes the game less smooth to play, such as all-in not showing the amount all-in'd for.The devs are dedicated, and often hang out in the game talking to the players. I got to talk with one of the developers about the future of the game, and there's a couple of things to look forward to.- The Event Room. The future of this room will hold random events, and potentially be used to play games not currently in the casino.- Free to play access. While playing in development is fun, and will translate into in-casino rewards upon release, this game will eventually be free to play. You can hop on with some buddies and hit the virtual casino for a night.This game is what it promises ; A multiplayer casino with realistic games to play with friends.  "

Early Access Review
								An interesting hybrid between an MMO and a Facebook casino game, Four Kings adds a social element that is missing from those games. Reminds me a bit of the long since cancelled This is Vegas but multiplayer. In this state, there is a lot of variety in the different types of casino games, even if they suffer from the major population issue mentioned below. But at least it isn't just limited to a few of them. Best part is that you don't have multiple spam messages all along your Facebook wall from your parents trying to get chips from you.Game runs fine on my machine at least and save for one period where I had issues loading the character customizer, everything is fine on a technical standpoint.The only thing holding the game back is its lack of players, which due to the social nature of the game seriously harms the game even in this Early Access state. Hopefully once it launches people will give it a look. Maybe if Digital Leisure adds crafting and zombies, people will play it. :)Some suggestions to the developer for release and beyond:Figure out some reason for people to use the nightclub, whether its a drink-serving minigame to earn chips or something else worthwile. Seems useless at this point in time. Same with the Hotel Room. I'd love a GTA style TV where you watch pre-made shows but that's way too expensive for this kind of indie development studio. A possible area for user-generated content perhaps?More slot and video blackjack variations.Poker and Blackjack tournaments.			"

												The Four Kings Casino And SlotsNot the worst free casino game I've ever played. F2P with chips and vanity items for sale with real money. Free 250 chips every 15 minutes. Mediocre customization compared to 80% of games on the market. The deciding factor for me was that although I get 250 chips every 15 minutes, buy-ins and minimum bets are much too high. 50 chips for a hand of war, 5000 chips for a sit and go 6 man poker game (besides the once-a-day freebie poker table), 200 per hand of video poker? I also couldn't find the payout table for the slot machine but that might just be a PEBKAC error. They really need to add about 3 floors to their casino with different stake levels on each floor. Currently not a recommendation but if they make the stakes lower so you can choose to play for fun and socializing instead of topping leaderboards I might change it.			"

												I thought The Four Kings Casino and Slots was gunna be corny and most likely not fun, I was surprised to discover that The Four Kings Casino and Slots is acutally a really fun and addictive Casino sim. I would almost just call it a gambling sim but with the fact that you have a customizable character, a ranking system, and a decent social atmosphere makes this game more like a trip to a Casino IRL (without the akwardness of real life strangers haha) I reccomend this game for anyone who is into gambling/social games. I would like to point out that you start off with more than enough chips in the begining and their are alot of ways to earn free chips and if you're smart with your gambling you should b able to maintain a decent amount of chips until you win big (which will happen) I recommend The Four Kings Casino and Slots. *7.5/10			"

												This game reminds me of Playstation Home.  The look and feel of it are very familiar.  All in all though, it is just a game for them to milk gamblers without them having to travel.  Can't knock it as it is free to play and you can actually play for free if you are good at the games but when your money runs out all you can do is wait or buy more.  I'll be playing this every now and then when I get bored but there isn't much else to do outside of gambling.			"

												The payouts on Craps are not quite right. The biggest improvement would be to play cross platforms from the Playstation to Steam and vice versa. Otherwise this is a GREAT game! Very addictice, fun, and good community of players. There is always something to do, and something to unlock. As an achievement and unlockables junkie, this is awesome.  "

												I really like the daily and weekly challenges. I think there needs to be RP during poker, sometimes can play a whole game, come in 3rd and no RP.  Also it is hard to keep your money and gain any ground, maybe need more RP for things.			"

												I played my first casino console game on the first xbox 10 years ago. Was a really fun one til this came along.  Never new they would actually make one for steam where you can interact with other players and have that real life casino experience with in game credits.  This game sucked me in and also made friends along the way.  If you like poker, blackjack 21, slots and other casino games this is the place for you.			"

												I've been playing this game since the reviews on steam were ""Mixed"". I am very happy to see they have been upgraded to ""mostly positive"". This game delivers what it promises at a price that cannot be beat. I understand in the beginning there may have been technical issues, and its true the graphics may not be fully optomized, however this seems to have been resolved.  The games in the casino are fair. If you see reviews indicating the dealers are crooked, or the games are rigged: ignore them. They are written by ignorant players who are unaware that ALL games in a casino are slanted to the houses favor. The casino offers many games of chance, some with better odds than others. The blackjack is extremely liberal with a house edge of around .3%. Single Deck Blackjack is available in the VIP lounge which actually has a NEGATIVE house edge. The only real negative i can admit to is the fact that it is free to play and that attracts some pretty childish trolls. You can block them. I like to berate them. I find added enjoyment there, but you may find frustration.Oh, and if your table freezes while you have chips on the table, just report it. You will typically get a refund the next day.9/10 , would like to see more games, but very satisfied with what is available.			"

												Being a casino employee myself, I would have to say that this is as close as it will get to the real thing (minus the free chips every 15min, and the occasional hidden chips, and the daily free Big Slot spin). The odds against the player are there, but that's simply how casinos in general work. But the House Edge in this game is really neglegable when compared to an actual casino. I am really enjoying myself with this game, besides, this allows me to play the games that I can't in real life!			"

												PC Specs (If you care):~Alienware 15 R2 LaptopIntel Core i7 6700HQ CPU @ 2.6 ghz Turbo Boosted at 3.5 ghz, 4 Cores, 8 Logical Processors8gbs RAMNvidia Geforce GTX 970MWindows 10 Home~The Four Kings Casino and Slots is what the title says it is, a casino. It's a third person online casino where you can make friends, customize your character and  play casino games like slots, blackjack, and poker. It has a chips system and everything for you to be immersed into the game and feel as if it's a real casino. Let's get right down to the aspects of the game and how they work really well with it.~Pros:-Great Graphics-Alot of Casino Games to Chose From-Multiplayer -Nice CommunityCons:-Buggy-Insane FPS Drops (Occasionally)-Unfair Dealers (More Below)~Clearing up the Microtransactions:    You might automatically turn this game down because you've heard about microtransactions. Whatever you do, don't do that thing that I just said. You CAN but are not FORCED to buy chips with real money. It is COMPLETELY OPTIONAL and you can get chips from playing the games, waiting 15 minutes for your free 200 chips, getting your daily chips, doing your daily or weekly tasks. I just listed off 4 ways you can get chips do you realise how UNNESSASARY buying chips is. If you complain abut the buying of chips just stop it.~Unfair Dealers:    I've heard many people talk about the unfair dealers and I too have experienced it. In Blackjack when you're playing the dealer will seem very unfair at times. Lets say me and the dealer are against each other and I get a 12 and I hit, I'll automatically get a 22. Lets do this again, I get a 4 the dealer has a 17, I hit and get 7 he hits and gets 21. Where's the equality? This happens alot of times and I lost 2,000 chips to this happening many times in a row. It seems as if when you play with more people the dealer becomes more fair though.~Games:-Many different types of slots-Bingo-Blackjack-Poker-Video Blackjack-Jacks or Better-KenoOverall this game has some great potential and I'm glad that this is a thing. I highly recommend it to anybody who likes casino games alot.7/10			"

												I went into this game expecting total♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but it's actually surprisingly fun. Especially with friends.You get to customize a character, you have your own hotel room, the environments are beautiful, and the games are pretty damn entertaining. I expected to have microtransactions shoved down my throat at every turn, but the starting money is generous and unless you really suck at gambling, it's hard to lose those starting funds (free chips every 15 minutes, free bingo games, chips lying around the casino, and dailies/monthies help earn anything lost back as well). Only other transactions were minor and completely optional, mostly cosmetic.I don't have many complaints, honestly. I hope to see this game grow and improve, as there's plenty of ways they can expand the experience. I might actually put money into the game purely to support the model they have going. Keep up the good work, guys.In short: 10/10 would make friends ragequit by beating their♥♥♥♥♥at bingo again.			"

												A free game with paid optional content but you don't really need to pay since you get free chips every 1/2 an hour, free chips for doing tasks and if even free chips to use just floating around the rooms. Good PointsPretty much entirely free to play and no need to pay anything.The game or games are fun. All poker games are here: blackjack, poker, bingo, craps, bowling (coming soon), war and even virtual games like slots. You can play with others or use a virtual game to play alone. The 6 rooms are very big and spacious (7 if you have vip) and you can customise your character for free; with a few options as paid only.VIP is like membership you can buy, but if you're good at the game you can earn it for free by pure skill. Your progress will be shown in the menus. Talking about them, it can be a bit fiddly to use but easy enough to understand, the options, social, character customisation and features are all here.Bad PointsOnly BAD POINTS are sometimes the menu's can glitch out when playing a game. Doesn't affect the game at all and you can play without any problem; the most common problem is bingo as it doesn't show the pattern you're doing, but the in-game world shows it on the screens and you can look around in any game so not a huge problem; just annoying.OverallNot a bad game, it's gambling sure but unlike most it doesn't force you to pay anything and you can have fun playing for free. If you want to pay you can but it's not required to play. They did an amazing job creating the games and worlds; each game looks unique and I keep finding myself coming back for more! The best part, I'm not loosing any real money betting! Hooray!			"

												Very addicting if you like casino games, and not a bad interface even if all you want to do is play poker with other players. The game is often populated with lots of players, and being able to control an avatar character in the community is highly enjoyable.December 2016 expanded edit:I still love this game, and it's nice to chill out in. It's really worth a try, especially if you like Poker and Blackjack. There is an active playerbase, a friend system, and always people running around the Casino to interact with.Card decks in this game are simulated realistically. If you use perfect strategy in multi-deck blackjack (or share info with your sneaky friends in VIP single-deck), you can effectively count cards like is possible in real life, minus the pit boss kicking you out of the casino. You can even watch other people playing and sit down at the table when you think the deck is ""hot"", but be careful because if someone else gets up the dealer will shuffle!What people don't realize, and why many reviews are negative, is that losing streaks are naturally much more common than people think. Things will happen like the dealer gets blackjack 2 or 3 times in a row and people will yell RIGGED!!! But if you play enough it is bound to happen in every game. People focus on the negatives, and when they win big they bet more and lose it quicker than they won it. All games have a house edge you won't win against in the long run, unless you count cards masterfully or play vs other players in Poker.I've gone broke dozens of times. When you go broke, every 15 minutes you can collect a little money from change machines. When waiting for this time to pass, the best thing to do is bother other players by humping them with your ""awkward dance"". The best players to do this to are the ones that have fallen asleep idling next to the change machines waiting for free money. You can also play bingo for free about once an hour, and poker once a day at a separate table for free money. There is also a little free daily money on top of this. It sounds easy, but earning a lot is a challenge.Once you have successfully clawed your way out of the loser salt mines, there is $5000 poker, and the elite ""VIP"" status can play $25000-entry poker. To reach VIP status, you have to earn enough ""Rep"" in one month. ""Rep"" is experience points you get from winning. You can use rep to unlock fancy clothes, effects, dances, pets, emotes, etc. VIP status gets you into the back room of high stakes tables, poker, and even fancier items! This way even though the house has an edge over you in probability, you can still progress in the game and can always dream of having a good enough run to make VIP. Other VIP's can give you temporary passes to get in as well.You can resurrect your empty bank account by paying real money if you want a quick escape from the salt mines, but it is not necessary. As a free-player I hit VIP the first month I tried, mostly through Poker wins. The Rep you earn can buy most of the vanity items you want if you don't mind waiting, and humping is free anyway.			"

												I think the concept of this casino is spot on! Unfortunately, there were not a lot of people there when I visited.  The graphics are cool, but I would like to see more animation at the tables and not seeing the dealers was a big drawback to me.  The same with the craps game where I would like to see movement between players and interaction with dealers similar to a real casino.  My overall rating is positive and to be able to play for free is very cool.  Thanks for the experience!			"

												Loads of casino games including slots machines and video games. Also includes the main ones like poker, blackjack and Bingo (lotto) You can pay for chips but not needed as you get daily log in bonus and free spins on the wheel at the enterance. (0.69 GBP for 5000 chips if you wanted to buy them)Good game if you just want to play virtual casino games for virtual money.			"

												I recomend this game right out the gate for those of you who really enjoy poker. The community in this game is what makes it really addicting to play at the tables and enjoy convorsation while you play, and after a bit, the VIP lounge that you'll eventually graduate to gives it an exciting edge. As for the other games, it's all up to personal preference, I personally love roullette, but they have just about everything you'd want. You'll gain RP that will allow you to purchase cool and often comedic duds for your character. It is a solid buy, and as long as you aren't frivilous with your chips, you'll likely think so too. Especially, since, you know, it's free.			"

												only tried it for the bowling. worst bowling game i've ever played. as in, no physics at all, no angled aiming of the ball at all and no spin and the ball frequently squeezes itself between the pins, the 5 and 6 pins especially. this easily sets bowling video games back twenty years. wii bowling is a thousand times more advanced than this BS bowling.performance is extremely poor. considering how bland the graphics are that makes it all the worse. looks like the sims 3 but cripples even mighty graphics chips. reminds me of Fallen Earth. lol strange graphics glitches too, http://steamcommunity.com/id/DOOMJESUS/screenshot/80342665810947984 that blob is supposed to be a person sitting in a stoolchair.

Early Access Review
								For early access I am very impressed. If you like casinos/casino games this is well done. The social interaction factor is a great addition. I can't wait to see what the future holds for this game. However, I am a bit concerned about the requirement in the VIP status section that states ""minimum 30 day membership."" For those of us who had enough faith in you to buy in as early access founders are you intending to charge a monthly membership fee? Considering your all in pass was almost as much as GTA V I think you would be making a critical error to charge founding members a monthly fee. Biting the hand that fed you could cause a rather nasty backlash. Example being what happened when Steam decided to allow charging a fee for Elder Scrolls V Skyrim mods. That really kicked the hornets’ nest and they quickly rescinded. Think about it gentlemen.			"

												Let me first start by saying this game has a lot of potential and looks rather fun for the casual, and fulfilling for the needless end of gambling. i did not however try any of the other games other than blackjack, war, and then went to the poker room. the blackjack is run of the mill standard blackjack with fairly even odds from what i saw....So then i saw the poker room...I thought maybe this would be a place for underground poker adventures... First i would like to comment on the blinds for hold-em. The double every few minutes. so within ten minutes the blinds are at a staggering 4k-8k, which does not sound too bad untill you figure that you only start with 50k. With the blinds doubleing again in just moments you are putting more than 16k just to see the flop. These games are set up to be over very quickly. it turned out no matter how well you play texas hold-em, where everyone seldomly gets better than a pair. Once i had a three of a kind only to lose to someone with the same three of a kind and a high card. the reason i am now quiting is my final hand at the second texas hold-em ""game"".  I went all in pre-flop with a pocket pair of threes only to lose to the very same player mentioned earlier that had an ace of spades and a three of spades. the flop procedded as follows; a nine of spades, five of spades, and a jack of clubs. the turn happened to be a nine of clubs. the river was a five of diamonds. needless to say she won with a high card again. the poker is absolute BULLSH!T. basically what i am saying is the game is probably good, but play texas hold-em on any other game and it might be better for skilled players and less with luck.

												Brilliant game if you want a secondlife type avatar and want to lose all your steam wallet balance, game starts you with 10k you will easily lose this, then you can get 150 coins every 15 mins, you will see people running around with pet avatars and boards saying the high payments people are winning however its clearly either made up or their making a fortune out of people who pay to play, the steam achievements seem more achievable if you have lots of money to fund your steam wallet, the higher stake you play in slots seem to decrease your chance of getting bonus round or free spins, in my case i was playing max at 2.750 spins and got 8 free spins and won 2000 coins which was less than my original wager.Purchasing chip packages just eats through your funds and well i went from having 50k chips to winning 30k chips but rather than it adding it to my balance my balance stayed the same and then on the 2nd time it happened i thought about reporting it but who would believe you the games have no transaction id and unless your recording your gameplay it's your word against theirs, even more so when you relise that once you pump your cash into the game there's no reverse option you can only put funds in they don't pay funds out to your steam balance or give you anything you can sell on the marketplace to re-coop your real cash spent.My advice avoid unless you like those facebook games that are usually free but have tons of microtransactions where you'll find yourself no better off than gambling for real!update 27/2/16The one thing that concerns me most about this game is it's setup, real casinos machines have minium payout requirements by law however since this game doesn't allow you to cashout any money you put in from your real bank account they do not have to provide any minium payout percentage per play.I could play the steam slots game at 3k a spin get 15 bonus spins and win 2k, plus every ""big win"" shows up even if i win double my wager, i do notice that the bonus rounds are more common when you play at 25 chips a spin.Besides having now real loyality as the VIP system is a bit of a joke so far ive spent £43 on this game thats pretty much over a million in game currency, everytime i buy currency and spend it on slots for example my balance just plummets you never seem to break even just gradually loss not even a raise on your gamble so to speak, so far considering how much i've spent of my real life cash im only on 86% to Vip lv1 and that just opens more games for me with higher stakes no good if i'm already losing.Yes you can get 250 free chips for free every 15 minutes but here's my next issues, min bet requirements, craps min 100, video poker 200 per play, poker 5k per game, bingo 5k per game, blackjack 100, keno 100/200, most of the games seem taylored around the 5k mark and for simply someone relaying on free chips this wouldn't be thesable even the daily taks require alot of spending for 200 chips per marked off task.I know i recently started a thread on refunds as so far ive lost approx 200k of chips due to technical issues however not been refunded this would sound far fetched for some users but when they look at my chip buy in history its only a little drop compared to what ive been spending, i think i seriously need to back off spending real life cash i can't afford it considering gambling for real would cost around the same the only difference is you can withdraw your cash plus they offer real loyality schemes which don't require you to spend more money once you get the loyality requirements.I think with the current loyality structure + achievements for steam you would have to be playing for years or spend thousands of your own money in rl just to achieve them compared to other social steam games which cost £5 to buy and have severs too, i'm not sure if steam even properly converts the players real life spend to reflect how much money is being pumped in but £42.99 is €54.55 or $60 or $80.59 CAD			"

												I've been reading some of the reviews lately and I honestly don't understand why a lot of people dislike this game. I understand that there can be some compatibility issues within the game, and a list of bugs (especially when it's in early access) but honestly, the whole atmosphere/environment in this game is great.Obviously, if you're not into games a casino would feature (like poker, blackjack, 6wheel, slots etc) then you'll probably not like this game. But with the features included in this game, such as the limited freeroam offered within a virtual-type casino is quite unique and it gives some quality to the game. This game reminds me of the good old playstation home, it's really nice. I've already invited a handful of friends to play the game with me and they've also enjoyed it. So far, the players within the community are all quite mature and are really enjoying the game. Although I would like to see if there is some kind of forum or website where you can hand out some suggestions or help in regards to playing the game. If by any chance, someone does have a link, I would appreciate if someone would send me the link.Anyways, great game guys, I recommend it!			"

												The game is still going through a rough patch where you can run into some seriously game-breaking bugs, but they are quick to shut down areas of the casino that are effected and then patch it within a day. That being said, they WILL reimburse any chips that you lost to bugs if you send in a ticket, contrary to what many other reviews have claimed.But aside from the bugs, the game is really quite solid. Most of the time all the games and machines work perfectly fine, and the variety is good. They also run tournaments periodically for when you're feeling a bit more competitive.So what's the bad then? Since the game is free, they'll try to coax you into buying chips with real money. Now, you're never forced into a situation where buying chips is the only way to continue playing, but if you go broke often it will definitely test your patience. In order to get free chips, you can do both daily and weekly tasks that reward you with chips. After that, you get one Super Slot spin per day. And if you're really desperate, you can collect free chips from an ATM every 15 minutes. But beyond that the game is reasonably generous. When you win chips, you also slowly build up premium currency. You can win your way into the VIP lounge by playing enough, and many of the cosmetics can be attained by earning achievments.The social elements of the game feel somewhat forced but that's true of most MMO-styled games.Overall, if you like casino games, you can't go wrong giving this a try.

Try it out now while it's free if you are interested in casino simulators.  The games all function well and there are customization options for your character as well as a club with a dance floor for socializing.  This game has been unique and fun.			"

Really its biggest draw back at the moment is that there just are not enough people playing. There definitely needs to be more people in game.   It could also use with some more variation in the casino games/ themes. while there are a good variety of games to play, each game is copy pasted in every room in the casino. We could definitely use more than one type of slot machine, ect.  I cant think of any other real negatives. its definitely worth a try.			"

												It is exactly like playstation home with gambling 100% free to play are you can buy chips. you get 250 every 15 minutes and missions to get more chips so kinda hard to run out. The game is kinda buggy do to it being first day but highly recommend this game to people who like to gamble. They seriously have everything in this game			"

												This game is not only buggy and feels unfinished buy on top of all of that, there seems to be a persistent problem with people having accounts suspended... multiple people i know have had accounts suspended as well as myself with no descriptions of why this has occured, I will update this review when I hear back from tech support. As of now avoid this unfinished game...			"

												I think this is a great relaxing game if you are the ""gambling"" type of person. You get free chips every 15 minutes, so it's hard to not stay at 0 chips for a while unless you just like max betting every time you get free chips lol, the Super slots also gives you I think it was a minimum of 250 chips per day, plus you get daily chips for just logging on consecutive days...I've played *almost* two hours so far from this review and I can say just playing, talking to random people on blackjack, bingo, etc, is really fun and relaxing,			"

												Not a bad game to mess around on for a few hours. It's similar to Facebook gambling games where you can buy chips for real money. You can win by just playing, so it's not too bad. All-in-all I enjoy playing it because I love poker and other casino games.			"

												EDIT******** So I played roughly 10-15 hours per day and nearly got VIP then my account got BANNEDfor NO REASON whatso ever when I asked admins why they said ""You broke terms of use"" didnt tell me why or how I broke them and when I asked if they could tell me what part of terms of use I had broken they said ""contact support"" in other words we dont care, go away. Unless you want to put tens of hours into a game then get banned for literally NO REASON and get spoken to dirt, go for it.This was recommened, not anymore AVOID this game.Also the game seems to be run by teenagers.****Played this game for a few hours now and  I love it, had a few server issues when I first joined but not had none since. This game is underrated in my opinion and must be tried even if you're a avid gambler, i've had tons of fun on this game and it gets intense with big bets even though its play chips.			"

												Blackjack is just a joke in this game. I started at 47g then i got up to 62g won like crazy. Then the game starts the full on rigging mode. I lost 9. NINE!!! double downs (9 * 2 = 18grand) with 18 or 19 in my hand because the dealer pulls out oh miracle 21 time after time.Before you say ""well durr casinos rigg their games, too."" Well maybe. But you can not rig a real card deck because people would notice. You can however rig a virtual deck and just let the dealer draw what he needs 100% of the time.This game is rigged hard and screws you in a rather unsubtle way.			"

Early Access Review
								Very basic sim with very little excitement.  Might be better with consistent players, but probably not much.  All the games are very generic, without any of the themes or personality that make casinos fun.The poker room is pretty disappointing, and I don't see any sign in the early access notes of there being plans for any sort of major overhaul here. It's not at all like an actual casino poker room, and seems like it's been designed by someone who doesn't know much about poker. There is no cash games, only sit-and-go style tournaments with extremely fast blind levels that tend to turn the game into an all-in festival within minutes. There is no variety in games. The tables don't even have enough seats for a typical casino poker game. The poker setup seems geared toward getting games over with as quickly as possible.			"

												Well seeing all these reviews calling the game bad, I would like to try to clarify things. This game is NOT for casual casino players. You can very easily loose your money if you are not careful and it is not easy to get back. This game is also not made for people craving slot machines. Play one of the countless others. This game is for casino games, and very skilled players. For what is is intended for, it is amazing!

												BEWARE!If you're thinking of spending oney in this game STOP and think for a second.... For every cent you spend on this, it could have been money you would have used to buy a new game, or that game you've been wanting for ages...No matter how much it may be tempting, DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT give these vultures your money, it gives no reward except for wasting time and a whole lot of frustration when it sucks it out of you!I stupidly got sucked into the hype and spent a few hundred dollars, it was almost hard to walk away due to the thought of having spent that money, but the money is gone, so I uninstalled this rubbish...Not to mention the kids that they allow to play this, which become just as frustrating as the game itself!As far as I'm concerned, due to no way of knowing the age of players, this promotes gambling to children!

So if you are bored and want to play something to pass the time then this is the game for you.			"

												5/5 Stars. It is a great game free or not. There is a nice social aspect and a wide variety of games for people to play. I also enjoy how the game tells you the rules of the games. The daily and weekly tasks are a great way to earn extra coins and keeps you learning new things about the game. They have cool events like a real casino. Once when I was playing, they had a free bingo game. Definately entertaining if you like casino games or slot machines.			"

												My first review was a little harsh, cause I didn't really give the game enough time. I've played it a few more times since, and I have to say its not bad for a newly release game.However, I have ran into a few issues while trying to join table. The game will tell me that I have joined the table chat, and then I am stuck standing next to the table. Once I try to leave the table the game tells me that I have chips in play, and that if I leave I will lose those chips. That is the only real issue I have ran into as far as game play goes.I've seen some reviews that have people complaining about the micro transactions, but compared to most games, I would say that they are very fair.Would like to see some diversity in the future as far as the slot machines, table limits, and daily prizes.For being a newly released game, I would say that overall it has some true potential, and it's FREE! Can't really beat that.			"

												Just a few thoughts...Table Card Games: Good - as usual, a computer-controlled Dealer is always suspect due to the number of 'lucky' hands at just the wrong time for the Human players.Slots: Tight most of the time; stingy Bonus payouts.  These Slots could be *much* better if Players could have some interactive control over the spinning wheels.  A One-Click option to set the wheels slowing into a final landing for that spin. And/Or a Two-Click option that stops the wheels immediately.  Practice, intuition and a fast, well-chosen click would add a much-needed interactive element to these slots.  Also; change out the slot 'themes' from time to time.Other Machine Games: Okay - higher non-VIP wager limits wouldn't hurt.  Add some newer games, progressive pots, etc.Poker and Bingo are the best games here for 'avatar-to-avatar' interaction; the Poses, Emotes and other in-game actions are fun, but lag-time often ruins the timing.  Be nice if we could group a few movements together as a Macro, coupled with some pre-written text, for a 'custom-crafted' greeting.  Add BreakDancing for competitions between Ava's and some other Dance forms.Clothing, Appearance, Objects: all fun and a nice touch for the overall appearance and ambience.  Keyboard and Mouse IF are good, too.  Low stress on the fingers over extended periods.Overall: A good representaion of a Casino & Nightclub with earned VIP perks, a fun place to hang with some friends and gamble, chat and socialize.  There are stores for purchasing clothes and some wild effects, animal and critter companions, and a place where you can buy a trip with your friends to a Space Station. Lotsa gaming there, I hear.Worth your time for some light entertainment, cards and gambling.  And a free Hotel room, too.They're calling another Progressive Bingo game right now; big bucks on this one - gotta run!~Max			"

												NIce concept--games are fairly easy to get into and out of once you get the hang of the UI.  Decent options to gain free chips for completing various tasks (and you get 250 chips every 15 minutes just for being in game)--you can also buy chips fairly inexpensively if you like as well.Only thing I wish they would add are cash games in the poker room instead of the turbo sit-and-go tournament format--since I really enjoy playing poker in real casinos this would add a lot to the game for me.No real bugs for me yet and it's free to play, so go ahead and give this game a try.

												I'll definitely recommend this to anyone who's a fan of the casino ... or at least the games you play in it.From slot machines to video poker and blackjack, to real tables of poker, blackjack, and even bingo, this game has a lot of games to play.Of course, this game does have microtransactions where you can purchase chips for yourself or your friends, plus microtransactions for some clothing items in the shops (should you like to customize your character), but it's not too bad.  I think this game pulled it off without a hitch in that regard.Unfortunately, this game is a little buggy, even out of early access.  So far, I've filed three bug reports regarding minor things in the game, but it's nothing that'll ruin your experience, and the developers update the game very quick, so you have to respect that!TL;DR: Play at the casino without using your own money = no bankruptcy.

												I give this game 3/5 stars. i would give it 4 but i encoutered a few bugs at a couple of tables that prevents you from playing. especially in tournament suitations on the poker games. speaking of poker games. There needs to be a few more tables lined up in poker since its a very popular game as well. all in all. better than what i expected from The four kings. the players are somewhat nice and the games are timewasting. wish there was a neutral option in steam though.

												Fantastic game, started out buggy, but it has a full staff of devs putting out daily updates. Its easy to run with lots of customization to performance for an optimal experience. Lots of games to play, including casino favorites: Black Jack and Poker! The casino is good looking, but does have FPS issues in certain areas, however this doesn't affect the gameplay. Lots of ways to customize your character/avatar, and express yourself with in game earnings. Highly reccommend this game if you're a fan of ""Sims"", gambling or card games, or are looking for a simple social experience. Lots of ways to enjoy this game.			"

												Terrible experience. Went to the poker room and got into a tournament where the blinds go so fast you're quickly at a table with 4 bigs each. I started going all in with >50% hands when I was vs the blinds, and this guy starts saying ""F*** off"" and ""lol noob"". I answered back saying ""I'm just playing 4BB poker,"" then some busybody starts telling me I'm ""causing drama"" and ""being rude"". I responded saying ""This guy told me to f*** off, and I'm being rude? I'm just responding to him."" ""Last warning"". If you want to gamble with trolls and be policed by friends of the trolls, go for it. Otherwise, stick with Zynga or one of the US-facing poker sites. The other gambling was underwhelming too. This is a sad community from what I saw. Skip it.			"

												Saw this and went ooo free game I might can play with my mother.  Maybe I can even buy chips off and on and send them to spoil her.Oh wow they even have a nice avatar creation system.  <3Nope, from that point on it went bad.  Put it on the fastest setting figuring it would help with the lag, it didn't.  A lot of my time on this was me waiting for it to load.The games cost SO much to play and the system to earn morn chips I'm pretty sure you have to be in game and collect them every so many minutes.  Which if lucky those will allow you to play one more of the cheaper games.Crashed on me twice when I was trying to load the blackjack room alone.Oh and the amusing point I went to show mom how to make an avatar, on her comp the avatar's face is black, not as in skin color but totally blacked out.  So she doesn't even get to try out the best feature this game seems to have.  And before I forget you have to sign up for it with an e-mail and password . . . most free games that do this I don't even try, I wouldn't have done this one even if it wasn't in hopes that it would be one I could play and spend quality time with my mom.

												I'm not sure why there are so many positive reviews for this game, because I gave it way more of a chance than I would normally for such a lackluster game.  The graphics are taxing on my hardware, despite them being at their lowest.  (for reference I can run Planetside 2 at 35FPS with this rig.)  That is beside the point though.  There is a game here, where you can go almost anywhere you'd go in a normal casino, and you get 250 free chips every 15 minutes.  The theory is solid, but the execution is inevitably boring.Walking around with 400,000 chips from my slot jackpot, I found that there was absolutely no way to splurge my money.  I played literally every game in the casino 20 or so times and still couldn't throw away my money.  That's not a bad thing, but normally in my situation, a player would be having major fun.  I think it's the fact that there is NOTHING to spend chips on aside from the crappy games that take forever to even get going.  Once I got into the VIP area, I figured all of this would be different... but the VIP area is just the same as the non-VIP area with 2 different games and the same level of boredom.  I would say the rating system kept me going, but there was no actual pride to be had with it... yeah I'm tier 12 at poker.. what do I get?  Nothing.  Tier 25?  Nothing.  Lets not delude the fact that even if there were a prize, there would be nothing to do with itIn summary, the game is a borefest with a casino skin.  If you like sitting around pretending to play poker and blackjack, then this game might be for you.  But if you are a normal human being who enjoys mental stimulation... Steer clear of this waste of time.			"

												I had a dance party in the bingo room......with a group that looked very similar to Nsyncand there's poker too!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay, for reals, this game is good! I have never found any gamebreaking bugs anywhere or I have never been forced to pay at any point (heck, the only things I've found that you need to pay for were the cosmetics.)Pros:Decent explaination of how to play the various games.Emphasis on the SOCIAL aspects of the games. Note the bingo room dance party.Virtually nonexistant microtransactions. You can buy clothes that do nothing if you would like to support the dev.The game throws more free money at you than a rapper in Scrooge McDuck's money bin. No joke, one of the tasks says ""Get your free daily credits -> Get 250 free credits"" They give you money FOR GETTING MONEYCons:Its nigh impossible to join a poker table. There's so many people trying to play the ""Daily Free Poker"" that it looks like a rugby gameI know this is nitpicking but I wish there was rave music in the Nightclub but thats just my opinion, take it with a grain of salt.

												I was really enjoying the game for the first 30 or so hours since I was gaining lots of chips while going back and forth between all the games, but it went all down hill when I rushed to get VIP status to write about it on my site and lost all of my chips in the process. I'm actually kind of glad I did lose all of my chips since I was able to find out how terrible the game is when you're out of chips. Even with VIP status, which doubles all of the free chips that I can earn, I just can't earn chips anymore from playing games. This was my experience when I had a lot of good luck early on in the game, imagine what it would be like to constantly lose with the chips that you begin the game with and run out not even an hour into playing. I might have even considered spending some money on a cosmetic or two, but there is no way I'd do that when the game can become boring in an instant. It doesn't help when the daily free slots has bugged out on me and not giving me any chips, even when I match three in a row. This is also the first free game that I have tried where you can't even PLAY it without having chips, unless you just want to play free poker 24/7. That would be like playing a free shooter game where it limits how many matches you can play, and losing matches decreases the amount of times you can play, until finally you are forced to buy more matches.I would change it so the free chips that you earn over time gives you a small amount even if you aren't online, even 10% of their normal value would be enough to help people off the floor. This could even earn you too many over a long period, so a chip cap should also be in place.			"

												Alright, i think the time has come to write a review for this game. I started playing the game on 4th or 5th of june and Steam says that the game ran for over 432 hours. I didn't actually play for all these hours, but i still played A LOT. I have played this game for about 25 days, which means that it ran for 17+ hours on average every day. With that amount of time you can safely say that i am a hardcore gamer and enjoyed it most of the time. I also recently became a volunteer as a translator for Digital Leisure, which is the company that created this game. For a long time i was not sure if i give this game a positive or a negative review, but after the Blackjack tournament that happened last weekend i finally made my decision, but more to this later.Four Kings Casino and Slots is a casino simulation. A virtual casino where you create an avatar and play popular casino games like Blackjack, Slots, Craps, Video Poker and others. In every game, except Poker, there is a house edge like in a real casino. So, if you like gambling and losing your chips most of the time then this game could get you somewhat addicted. The game was fully released out of early access on june the 1st with many bugs, errors and easy ways for people to cheat. Especially within about the first 1-2 weeks the game was plagued by cheaters and bugs. They definitely released this game too early and after almost a month now it still feels like you are playing a beta/early access version. I still don't understand why they did that. It is free to play, so how are they making their money? First there is a shop where you can buy cosmetic items like clothes for your avatar and then you can buy chips with real money. As a new player you get 10k chips to play with, which sounds good at the beginning, but it is not a lot. You can lose them quickly if you are not careful enough. Especially for Poker players it can be painful, because the buy-in at a Poker table is 5k. So, if you lose two Poker games then you are already broke. There are some ways how you can get free chips and i will list them for you:-Every 15 minutes you can pick up 250 free chips at the chip station.-Once per day you can play at the free Poker table and only the winner can get 5k. There is only 1 free Poker table in the room, so you will have to wait and sometimes be fast, because there are many players waiting. -Every now and then there is also a free Bingo game and depending on the number of players you can win some chips. With the maximum of 40 players it is 10k if i remember correctly, but good luck winning one of these.-5 daily tasks where you get 200 chips for completing each one of them and an additional 600 if you complete them all. Most of them are very easy like using an emote, playing at the free Poker table or dancing in the nightclub.-5 weekly tasks. You get 2k for completing each one of them and right now i don't remember how much you can get when you complete them all. Some of them are ridiculous like earning 1000 RP at Keno or Slots. Don't even try if you don't have many chips. I mentioned RP and this is like a second currency in the game that allows you to buy items in the shops like clothes. You mostly earn RP by winning chips and if you earn enough within a month you can get vip status for a month, which gives you some benefits. You earn RP depending on how many chips you bet/win. There are leaderboards for every game and there is a global leaderboard that are based on the RP you earn. Players who buy chips for money have a big advantage to get to the top of the leaderboards - they are kind of pay to win since these players can max bet all the time and don't have to worry about losing the chips. There were many errors and bugs. Some of them have been more or less fixed and some games have been improved, but there are still enough that it's annoying to some degree. If you run a casino then functionality is the most important thing. In Four Kings Casino and Slots you can lose chips to bugs and this is kind of ridiculous, because there are people who pay money for their chips. Tables can glitch and become unplayable, players get kicked off tables, game crashes, disconnects and people lose some chips when things like that happen. It also happened to me that one time i didn't receive the chips for completing the daily tasks. You can request chip refunds through the bug report system in the game and most of the time they will give you back your lost chips, but not always. It happened at least twice to me that i can definitely remember where they just didn't refund the chips that i lost although i made these bug reports. Again, especially painful for the players who spent money for their chips. Within the first 2 or 3 weeks the game often felt like a chip refund simulator and not a casino simulation. It is better now, but you can still lose chips to bugs, make a chip refund request through the bug report tool and not receive the chips that you lost. I would not recommend spending money in that game unless you really don't care. If you go to a real casino they don't just kick you off the table for no reason and keep your chips. So, there was a Blackjack tournament last weekend and i saved up enough chips to play. First, Digital Leisure posted wrong information about the tournament on the Steam discussion board where they always post their information about the tournaments. For example, they wrote that the tournament would be split into segments of 2 hours each and there was also a overall leaderboard. In reality these segments were just 1 hour each. After 3 or 4 hours of the tournament running they restarted the server to make some fixes. Great timing, isn't it? Unfortunately and to my anger these ""fixes"" still didn't help to prevent some bugs happening. For example, if you played to the end of a 1 hour segment and let the extra time fully run out your score did not count, but if you stood up a few seconds earlier your score did count. They didn't tell us anything about that before. On the second day of the tournament i had to experience it myself where i made a score that was enough for overall 3rd place, but it didn't count because the timer fully ran out. I had a pretty high score already at 3rd place, but this one was only good enough for place 5 at the end. It also happened to other players and we made a post about it on the discussion board. A Digital Leisure employee responded in that thread and said that we should make screenshots next time. Are you kidding me? It was not our fault, it was a fault on their side. He also said that the score of ALL players in this thread would be corrected and they did, but not with mine. There was a player who had a higher score than i previously had and he posted after me. He got his score corrected, but i didn't get my score corrected. When i mentioned that they forgot me he only said that it wouldn't affect MY payout and still didn't correct my score. What a joke since before that he posted that the payouts would also be corrected by the team. At the end i only ended up at rank 5 instead of rank 3 on the overall tournament leaderboard. Their game bug cost me 2 places and a better payout. On the final day of the tournament i had 2 really, really good runs that had great potential to make the best score and reach rank 1 in the whole tournament. In one of these runs i had it for sure. My luck and my earnings were crazy this time. I was almost alone in a room sitting at an empty table to play as many hands as possible. I knew it. I saw my score, i saw the time that i had left and suddenly in the middle of these 2 runs the game disconnected me. Very strange that it exactly happened in these 2 runs. I knew what i was doing. I won about 10+ of 48 of the 1 hour tournament segments and made some 2nd and 3rd places. I barely slept this weekend, tried so hard and didn't make it to #1, because of game errors. Unbelievable and ridiculous.			"

This game say to use a different email adress. not all people have two email accounts! sometimes you get kids who want to play, and probably only have partial acsess to his dad's or moms account. and if it doesnt send the email, there out of luck. they cant play. i would only reccomend this game if you have more then one email account.

The time spent was to collect data log (by running different beta versions) to send to the dev after I sent and email on the issue. No follow up since last friday and I can't recommend a game which I can't play even after spending so much time and with feedbacks to the dev.Longer version:Check the comments, seems like steam doesn't allow me to post a lengthy write up...

Since Bingo is 3500 coins PER GAME, you will be hanging around for hours just to play.  Pretty much a game of microtransactions.			"

												I've played this game since its Early Access release and it's had some potential since then. I can't contune with my review because after it's offical release, the game has become nothing but a laggy mess. You're sure to lose your chips if this happens whilst you're on a table. Even for free (or paid for in my case, and I stil maintain it never mentioned it was going to be free once it hit 1.0 during it's first days of release on Early Access), it is a game breaking flaw.

												This game has real potential, and a real place in the market seeing as it is the only multiplayer poker game on steam (something we really need).And while the graphics are pretty, and the idea of the hub world where you can find all the different types of poker is fun, the game is just too shoddy in the technical side of things to be recommended.Yes, it is in early access and will improve as time goes on, that does not mean a game can be released in a such a♥♥♥♥♥♥state.It constantly freezes, players will disappear, it will crash unexpectedly (causing me to lose a lot of chips), and has an atrocious frame rate.Its not too good from a gameplay perspective, as nearly everyone is playing Blackjack or Texas Hold 'em so you can find barely anyone to play other games with, such as roulette. And when you do want to play Blackjack or Texas Hold 'em, all the tables are taken up!Overall, the game has real promise, but in its current state, only touch this pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥with a stick longer than it takes for you to find an empty blackjack table!

Early Access Review
								edit 6/10/2015: This is after the official free-to-play launch (no longer in early access): The game is a total mess. Chips are WAY overpriced, there's only two poker tables total (!!!), the poker blinds go up super fast, rampant bugs, people losing chips they paid real money for (the devs are doing refunds but still- it shouldn't happen at all). The devs need to switch away from their income coming from chip sales, and more towards the cosmetics or something. The payment model as it is is NOT going to work. There is a solid game here, but it needs changes. Play some for free if you want, but I wouldn't suggest investing at this point. Changing my review to a 'no'. Sorry devs, but it's a mess right now.Everything below is only left for posterity, you can ignore it as it is completely outdated info_______________________edit 5/12/2015: Apparently the game has gone free now, just a few days after I purchased it. Bad timing on my part aside: The game now has a decent population going, and there's definitely no reason to not recommend picking it up, since it's free! Very solid game- the only real complaint I have is that poker blinds go up waaay too fast, but the devs have said they're looking into it._______________________________Since it is simply ""YES"" or ""NO"", I'm going ""YES"" here. But that's not really how I feel about it. There is a great, functional core here. But the game is empty. Very empty. In two hours I've seen a total of 5 other players, all but one of them were just at a slot machine and unresponsive to greetings. At some point, once there's some sort of population, I think this will be a great game. Right now I don't really see a reason to reccommend buying it.			"

												This used to be a fun and enjoyable game. It must have been, I have just over 500 hours in it. I met a lot of good people here, enjoyed playing poker and slots the most. Now I have at least four times more people on my block list than friends list. As I write this I am in the VIP room on Saturday night and none else is here, at all. The game used to have a reason to want to level up in VIP ranking, to get more free chips. VIP 3 received 1000 chips every 15 minutes, now the devs took that away and everyone gets 250. I see no reason to want to keep playing to level up for no apparent reason after all the time I spent reaching nobility. This is my opinion, but it also seems that payoffs have been drastically reduced. My wife and everyone I talked to in the game believe the same. All I know is I I used to have almost a million chips, now I have les than 10 K, and not from extreme bets. The devs seem to be doing everything possible to get people to spend money in the game. That is understandable as the game is free, at least on pc. With no incentive to want to increase level, less and less friends in the game and less chance of winning in games, I see no reason to stay in the game, much less spend money in it. As I said, this was an enjoyable way to spend time, now I'm bored of it and noone staying in it. btw, there is nothing in clothing or pets I want to buy either. So now I have decided to uninstall a game I used to enjoy a lot. Make up your own mind about the game, but I think the devs destroyed it in a money grab.Oh, did I mention the glitches, which are getting worse and not better? Nothing is as frustrating as being in a poker or even bingo game and getting booted out of it in the middle. The devs are good at refunding chips when it happens, but the idea of gambling in a casino is the chance to win money, not get your money back. You can wait 10 or more minutes for a bingo game to actually start, instead of the usual 2, if too many people didnt walk out of the game by then, leaving less than the required 3 to play. Or when you are about to win the table in poker and suddenly find yourself standing outside the table and your chips are gone, as well as your chance of winning. There are just too many reasons for me to not want to play the game anymore and not nearly enough reasons for me to want to stay in it.			"

												The Four Kings Casino and Slots seems like a great virtual casino. But as a Mac user I'm afraid I need to give this the thumbs down on the current version. I've had issues with this game as long as I've had it. But I kept trying it every now and then. From the beginning I could only make my account and log in, and then the game kept freezing at the first loading screen. Today I managed to get past the first loading screen, but it took much longer than it should have. I didn't time it, but I'm guessing it was somewhere around 3 minutes of loading screen ... Should not be needed as I have a very high end Mac, and I don't have issues loading other games. When I for the first time did manage to get past the first loading screen I got to play the game for about 45-50 minutes before it crashed again. When trying to boot the game again I got past the first loading screen, but as I tried to enter the bingo hall the game crashed again. And now I'm writing this review. Hopefully they'll fix the Mac build in the near future. But for now, it's not worth your time to play this on a Mac. At least it's not worth it on my Mac.			"

												From the ashes of Playstation Home comes The Four Kings Casino and Slots.When Home's closure was announced near the end of 2014 its 3rd party Devs, one of which was Digital Leisure, freaked out and quickly started up new projects since their easy cash stream was about to go bye-bye. Digital Leisure opted to turn their Paradise Springs Casino area into a stand alone game. So they rebuilt it and renamed it The Four Kings Casino and Slots. As an attempt to lure Home users to it they decided to try and emulate Home. Sadly though they decided to emulate Home as it was near the end of its life. So the game is a bit shoddy, users suggestions are ignored most of the time, and they're more interested pushing cash store vanity items that have sod all to do with a casino (like pets and doofy avatar zoning in and out animations).Like Playstaion Home was, this game is something that could be fun but is ruined by the cheap cash grab mentality of the Devs.Cannot recommend.

												the good:multi-player onlineable to walk aroundconceptthe OK:graphicssoundsthe bad:lacking variety of mchines and tablesamount of free chips vs. game play costtries to force you into buying chipsthe price of purchasing chips vs. game play costok, this game has some potential to being fun. but thats only if you invest real money into it. to get enough chips at one time, to give you enough play time to enjoy the game. otherwise, you spend more time waiting for 250 chips to arrive maybe every 15 minutes, and the acassional 250 chips they hide in the casino. now the problem with this is with 250 chips every 15 min. you can play a single hand of video poker at the lowest bet possible. where is the fun in that? it's no place. the lowest bet possible on slots is 8 on only a single machine. which thats not to bad, if, and i mean IF you get lucky. otherwise the 250 chips every 15 min, is gone in less then 5 min. there is a couple free to play poker tables, that usually just get cluttered with people that want to bet all right off the bat. this game is basicly designed to force you to spend real money to win fake money that don't last for nothing. 90% of the games cost way to much, making the game to just be a money sink.cost of playing:video poker (jacks or better only machines)   min bet 200chips-max 1000chipsslots (only 3 different machines)   min bet 8chips-max ???chips (never had enough chips to play a max bet)video blackjack   min bet 100chips-max 1000chipsblackjack table   min bet 50 chips-max ???chipspoker table (texas holdem only)   min bet 100chips-max ???chipsrollett table   min bet 50chips-max ???chipscraps table   minbet 50chips-max ???chipsbingo   min 3000chipsbasicly every thing costs alot of chips compaired to the money you have to spend to make the game worth while playing.  my suggestion is, if you want to invest real money into a casino game, then invest into one that you can win real money on, OR find one for sale that don't involve constantly needing to purchase chips and only has a one time purchase price tag. or go on facebook or windows store and find some free ones that give you enough chips to actually have fun with before your forced to purchase chips.this game wouldn't have a bad review from me if everything was a little more realisticly priced. this game does have potental, and could be tons of fun even with the lack of variety of slots, poker machines, and poker tables.

												Dude this game blows. The limited amount of chips you can bet is ridiculous. Hell I have more fun playing Big Fish Casino on my Iphone, thats how sad it is. I don't recommend this game to anyone because of how limited the games are too. Maybe if there were a variation of slot machines I'd give it at least 3 1/2 stars out of 5, but for now I'd have ot say I'll give it a 1 out of 5 stars, 1 being the fact that they were able to make such a game. -Vajas Out, prr prr			"

												I have played this game quite a bit, and while fun I do think that it suffers from some major issues.First, the games are stacked into the casino's favor WAY more than a normal casino.  I know it sounds like I'm just being idiotic, but I started testing a few things in the game.  First, when playing slots you almost never hit bonuses. Once in 200 spins or so seems to be the average.  If you've ever been to a real casino, you know bonuses are a lot more common.  In fact the payout on the slot machines is ridiculous.  You can expect to lose 75% of the money you put into the slot machine over about 10 spins.  Slots are money losers, I know, but 75% over 10 spins, nine out of ten times? Come on.  Yes you can go on win streaks, but its as though when the game feels you have built up enough using a Martingale system (doubling your bet after you lose), it will make sure you keep losing.  You can go up to max bet and lose, which is normal using that system.  But to continue losing 10 more bets after that?Not convinced?  Blackjack.  I counted the number of cards between yellow cards.  Instead of the standard 6 decks.. there is 4.5.. not 4, not 5.. but 4.5.  So which cards are extra and who gets which? Go ahead, try it.  You can bet 15 times in a row using basic blackjack strat and not win a single round.  Meanwhile the dealer will pull 14, or 16.. and they will get just enough to beat you.Why?  Well, the problem is the whole pay-to-play structure.  While it would take a lengthy amount of time to lose your chips making minimum bets, you will never make VIP.  VIP allows you to play Baccarat (not available on the normal floor), as well as play higher stakes games, and a few other perks. You earn VIP status through earning Reward Points.  You earn Reward Points for winning bets.  The higher the bet, the more reward points you are eligible for.  It takes a lot of grinding.  So couple the fact with you need to win big bets (or play long nonsensical hours (probably 8 hours a day for minimum bets)) with the fact that the game in tilted more in the odds of the casino than a normal casino.. you come to the realization that if you enjoy playing the games enough you need to purchase chips.  I don't mind paying the developer for the game, I understand a developer deserves to get paid for their product.  But atleast make it fair.  If I spend money I want atleast a chance to win.  Either make us pay for the product, or find another way to make revenue.. because it sucks supporting a game by buying more chips, just to lose them on their broken system.  I'd rather not spend more than a set amount on a game without getting some actual content.  Just my opinion.			"

												There are times where it seems fixed and there is no way to win. However, there are other days where you hit jackpot after jackpot. I would not spend a penny on this game, ever. Also the ways they give you to make credits is way to low. You would have to sit in the game for hours just to get enough to play a single game of bingo.			"

												I wish I could post a positive review, but I can't, even though I LOVE playing an MMO Casino game !Let me tell you why :At first, I was so happy to find a game like this one that I even paid real money for ingame chips, not because I really needed it, but because I just wanted to support the devs !The problem is : I played around 10 Poker games, HALF OF GAMES either made my game crash or get disconnected, or even when I'm lucky enough to stay online, the poker does not launch and we are 6 players waiting for a game that never starts ! 5000 chips wasted ! Many times ! This just gets me mad, paying for ingame chips and losing it because of bugs !So, basically I won't support devs anymore until this is solved. I'm not even talking about the lags when running around in the casino !I WILL post a positive review once these terrible bugs are solved !			"

The dealer seems to deal to nonexistent players and gives inconsistent, incorrect views of my own cards* The camera system is incredibly frustrating. It doesn't function like a normal camera in 3rd person mode. What is this, the early 2000s?* Weird walking/running animation. Why do these people move like robots?* Great idea, weak execution.It's free but so is oxygen. Pass on this and just live your life instead.			"

												If you are thinking about joining this game, DONT BOTHER. I repeat, DONT BOTHER. The game is full of rigged tables. And worst thing, the admins are money eating people. They set their slots payout higher during an update, and when people win money, they say people are exploiting on their game and took away all their winnings and minus all their original chips. So technically, as long as you play that game, you lose money. Imagine playing slots and if you didn't hit the 888 bonus, you lose normally. But if you hit 888 bonus, you are exploiting the bug. Either way, you lose in this game. MONEY EATING DEVELOPERS			"

												I got this game expecting a cool casino game. I sat down at a video blackjack and doubled my chips. Eventually though, the dealer would constantly get blackjack, and I was in the negative eventually. I've found it IMPOSSIBLE to win chips on games vs computers (aka blackjack, video poker, war). To get into a human v human game (poker), you need 5000 chips. Every 5 minutes, you get 250. You would have to wait over 3 hours to do it this way because its impossible to win chips without it. Honestly, I will most likely go on this every once in a while to see if I can build up to 5k to play poker. Other than that, this game kinda sucks.It actually is a pay to play game, where you just waste money. Sorry, but I'm not falling for it.			"

												While it currently has zero competition, there are a good number of reasons to avoid playing this game:1. Buggy, sometimes unplayable experiences that result in the loss of chips-in-play2. A considerable lack of variety in machine games3. The VIP room carrot-on-a-stickAllow me to shed some light on number three. There exists in the game a 'VIP' area unlocked for entry when you achieve a certain amount of 'RP' (your secondary form in-game currency used solely for purchasing aesthetic items). The amount of points required to unlock the 'VIP' room is absurd, so naturally I was curious as to what lay behind the golden gates. Could it be higher betting caps for machine games? Different, perhaps better machine game backgrounds than the machines in the pleb lobby? I needed to know. Also I was pretty tired of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ castle slots characters.Took a month to get enough of the damned RP points only to walk in the 'VIP' room and be greeted with the same machines  with the same betting caps. Only difference was I could play Baccarat and a higher cap of Poker. Huge let down.Oh, and everyone was wearing a horse helmet. This games art direction needs a sharp kick in the♥♥♥♥♥ early access or not.			"

												it was interesting to see a casino game that was also an mmo it has a nice feel to it, i was excited to try it out, and then very disapointed in the way it was designed. i was interested in the poker aspect of it, but there were only about 6 tables, period, if they are all full, well tough luck your not playing poker. and only one of them was a free table, needless to say you would have to wait a while for your turn, this mechanic of the game alone is an extremely limiting facter on how much it can even expand.

												If this came out for the N64 I'd be impressed. As it stands it's a buggy money sink. Very few free games, and if you like to gambol it's more entertaining to chill with a live casino rep than anybody in this game - as it seems full of children and trolls. Crashed several times in an hour. Table froze when I finally got on the free poker. A lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥talk from troll kids. Graphics are atrocious. No way that I saw to cash out any kind of winnings.Just a tax on idiots willing to put in money. 1/10			"

												This game should be listed as early access even though they claim its finished.Many bugs will cause you to not gain chips when you win and you must jump through hoops and wait very long periods of time for staff to contact you back.Been playing a few months and still experiencing the same bugs that I have reported from day 1-3. If you dont mind not getting paid out for poker wins you might enjoy this game.  Otherwise just download a slot or video poker app. Its not worth the hassle.			"

												The game gives you 1000 chips to start and 250 chips for every 15min spent ingame and everything costs 100 chips to play, poker costs 5000 just to play, there's no variety of poker games or tables buy ins.The bingo cost 4000.The game needed multiple casinos from low to high rollers so progression is better, as it is right now, it's pointless. The only skill based game where the house doesn't have the odds in their favor is poker and that one can't be played unless you pay for chips or get a lucky streak in the luck based games or afk ingame for hours, but what's the point if you can just play free rolls on poker sites.

												This concept of this game is quite nice and the way everything is set up is good. But for the following reason I will not reccomend this game:The game has still a lot of bugs, it's not uncommon that a game of for example Black Jack  (or any of  the ones I've played) will get ""stuck"" and you'll either have to leave the ""table"" or shut the program down all completely to be able to continue. Both of them result in loss of any bet you might have had at the time, regardless of the outcome of the game. I wouldn't mind this happening once or twice, but like ever 15-30 minutes is way too much.Updates and fixes are being released and I hope this will soon be a thing of the past. But I think they should have taken longer before releasing the game.There is a bug reporting tool, and I have used it. "

												Remember this game is still being develloped. So ill start off with some things that may grind your gears:- The game is not optimised.- Only one music soundtrack- movement of characters is a bit awkward- not so many sounds apart from footsteps and the music.But, the things above will be fixed and will improve. The devs are throwing out updates almost everyday to improve the game. Give it some time and everything will be a lot better.When you first play the game you can have a tough time earning chips. But once you have earned some you can earn chips really fast.The gamemodes like poker, blackjack, roulette,  videopoker etc. Are very fun. Ive spend a lot of my time playing video poker.The devs arent pushing messages around for buying chips with real money, so thats good.I like the game and use it as an escape from playing FPS, and to relax a bit. One thing i would like to see, is that if you spend real money in the game and you earn a lot of chips, that you can transfer them to your steamwallet, or bankaccount, because now you play for nothing.In the current state of the game i would give it an 8.5/10. Im sure the game will improve a lot over time. So dont mind the negative reviews that much!			"

												I'll have to change my review, as this game was released in probably the worst state you could ever expect a game to be released in. Hackers on day one with access to every feature the game had to offer. It's an unfortunately greedy company preying on gambling addictions as you are paying the same price here to play games and not get anything from it as you would any other online casino. It's a legal loophole they're taking advantage of.Imagine a casino where they host daycare, and you have this game. It is taken over by little boys who run around spamming profanity because the filter makes it 'cool'. Expect the same type of people you would find in a game like League of Legends or CSGO. It's not a mature community, it's not a friendly community, and it's definitely not a social community like you might expect. Do not play unless you plan on giving away money to play imaginary casino games. Still overrun by hackers; people can see your cards in poker and there's nothing you can do to find out.			"

												This game had potentional. I really liked this game and it could of been somting great, but like all other negative reviews, the game came out waay to buggy. On top of that, bugged poker games where you lost chips had the option of asking for a refund. I crashed on four games, wrote four tickets.....and yet have to recieve any refund. The devs said refunds would be dealt within 24 hours. It's been 3+ days. Also Blackjack(When you can get a table to work) is nearly unbeatable. I understand that the house has to win most of the times like IRL, but to lose 10 hands in a row? BS. I went through 100k chips without chips without even breaking even. I mean throw us a damn bone at least! I hope the work their♥♥♥♥♥♥out			"

												Alright, let me start my review by stating that I'm going to cover each game that is within the Casino by bracket.  I'm going to be starting with Jacks or Better Video Poker as it will lay the foundation as to why nobody should waste the ten minutes it takes to install this game.Jacks or Better, Video Poker:First, if you get a Jack or better... It's not a push and you do not get your bet back.  Second, if you get a pair below Jack, you do not get credit for the pair.  Third and most importantly, it seems you only get a winning hand on average, once in every ten or so plays and usually that's just a pair or three of a kind.Slots:Okay, first of all the buy ins to play slots are insainly inflated.  You're talking 88-3,000 chips per spin.  When you play any of these brackets, the ""big wins"" or ""jackpots"" are squed.  I got a big win with a 3k buy in and the pot was 9,000 chips.  You would have to be insain to play slots in this game for an extended period of time.Video Blackjack:This is the only game that doesn't seem to be calibrated to destroy you.  The only game inside this casino I do not have  a poor review for... Yet..Keno:My only complaint about this game is that it seems as though your win ratio turns from 1 out of every 9 plays to 1 out of every 3 whenever this game becomes the daily.Big Wheel 6:This game seems to be working in the opposit fassion than it normally should.  Obviously, you should have a statistically higher chance of seeing a 1 or a 2 over any other number correct?  Yet, if you were to sit down and bet 5, 10, 20, J, and $ you would magically come out ahead almost every single time.  Isn't that curious?War:War is supposed to be a game that is literally 50% win ratio.  You're lucky to win 1 out of every 5 hands.  Unless of course, War happens to be the daily.  Then, you are magically coming out ahead always.  Outside of the daily, going to war is supposed to be a stistical 1/8 or so chance.  Yet, in this game.. I've averaged it with about 1/14 or so.  Isn't that curious?  What's crious is it seems to be almost exactly 1/7 when War is the daily. Huh??Baccarat:Just like war, a tie bet should be about 1 out of every 8 chances.  Yet, i've hand counted time and again that 90% of ties seem to occur between 12 and 16 times.  Maybe it's because they don't want someone who's rich enough to spam bet come out ahead?  Hmm?  Curious!Bingo:It seems you have a 25% chance every time you sit down for the table, your mouse, or something involved with the game in general to be buggy.  Outside of this, there seems to be all kinds of kinks and issues with the game that make it unplayable or slacking on a fun scale.  Lets not forget the insain buy ins to play a round of bingo however!  The progressive bingo games which have the biggest pots are 5 grand to buy in.  Most of the time, 20 people are playing.  You're going to lose that money.  Of course, the free buy ins only have about 3 grand for the pot.  True, you can argue that's because nobody is buying in.  But, can we expect the casino to fetch in some chips towards the pot? NOPE!!!Regular blackjack and single deck:Blackjack is one of those games that you should have the statistical advantage over the house simply because the dealer is forced against their will to hit until they reach 17 or higher or bust.  Yet, magically...  It is a mirricle to see the dealer bust in this game.  As a matter of fact, i've clocked blackjack busts to average for me one in every 12 hands.  Usually, some witchcraft occurs where the dealer will hit 7 times and get a perfect 21 more often than not.Roulette:Finally, we are now starting to talk about a Casino game I enjoy to play.  Why do I enjoy this?  Well, I believe myself to be keen with math and statistics.  I also enjoy the game in general and know many play styles.  However, the first thing to point out is that the dimonds on the table are backwords which automatically means more randomization for predictions.  Curious?  Then, there is what I like to call the conservative betting system.  You know?  The system where if you sat there 10 hours straight you'd come out ahead?  Bet on red, closest row, center row leaving you know? 4 blacks, 0-00, and the 8 reds minor loss?  I promise you if you did this system or its mirror, you will go bankrupt and FAST.  Isn't that curious?  Or when you happen to just spam the 50/50 bets and lose far more often than not.  Or you know, betting on seemingly anything and its seemingly elsewhere the ball finds itself no matter what you do?  You could say I'm a conspiricy therist with regards to roulette in this game but maybe some of my comments coming up will change your opinion.Poker:Oh yes, Poker...  There are 52 cards in a deck and four of each card with a different suit.  Nobody will argue this.  What I will however argue, is how I manage to get Queen with an off suit 2 through 7 twice at the same table, every single table I've ever played since I've installed this game.  Curious how that keeps happening, huh?  It's almost statistically impossible.  Yet, it keeps happening.  Craps:  Ah yes, save the best and favorite for last.  The game that the house doesn't have the advantage of.  This also just happens to be the one game that is the reason that I'm now out of chips entirely for the fourth time in a row.  Curious as to how it happened? So am I...  One of my favorite and also simplest bets to do is to simply min bet the come out roll like you should.  When it rolls and you are On, you simply bet three times the come out roll or more on the Don't come Bar, then you bet some chump change on craps, any 7, and 12.  This ensures that you lose a little change but are gurenteed to not lose money.  You roll and if it's on, the chips get moved to that number.  From there, you roll trying to get a 7 before you roll that number.  No matter how many times I do this, magically, I will lose.  I'm not just talking about once, but numorous times in a row for hours on end.  Just yesterday, I depletted 120 grand on this system.  One time in particular, I rolled a 7 to lose when I'm trying to get it ready to win... 9 times in a row... Curious how more things that shouldn't happen occur constanty in this game, huh?Tournoments:Ah yes, I entered the poker tournoment over a weekened two weekends ago.  I placed in this tournoment first with 166 seats.  Guess what the grand prize was for placing first?  14 whole grand.  That's right.  Sounds like it's missing a few zeros in that total?  You're telling me.Player base:Ah yes, the final topic about this game.  I'm right around my one month in marker from starting this game.  Yet, I'm globally ranked 96th as of this specific moment for this season.  I've been informed I'm over a month behind in the rankings and that they will end at the end of this month for season 2.  How come there are only 96 people ahead of me?  Well, you could argue that I'm good at gambling outside of when I hit magical, near impossible lose streaks.  Or, you could be observant and see that the halls are fairly empty most hours of the day.  Why?  Maybe it's because the chances of winning any game at this casino is far less than even one in real life.  Why is that?  Well, you can buy more chips with real life money and it seems to me, they designed this game so you lose chips and are put into a sitation where you have to buy more.  Thank you all for reading my review, post your hate all you want, I will love it.  Find me ingame to hate me more, I'm Hazereaper.  I'm sure you will find me losing at craps, winning tournoments for cents to the dollar.  I still have hope that maybe this game will turn around.  Regardless, the only reason I'm still playing this game is that I enjoy the Casino games but the moment I find better that doen't involve real life money, I'll move on.  Or, when I finally get sick enough to uninstall.			"

												This game is REALLY fun if you have the time to play it. It's not a pay to win! even if you run out of chips there is a super slot you get to roll and you get an amount of chips DAILY! you can get up to 10000 chips EVERY DAY! Even if you want to pay the chips are cheap. 1 dollar USD for 5000 chips is an AMAZING deal. the minimum bet for blackjack is 50 and poker is 5000. bingo is quite expensive but you can still manage the chips if you're good. i have gotten up to 60k with a starter balance of 1000 chips. It's easy and they have fixed ALL of the bugs. come and try it now!			"

												I already buy this game in 6 mar 15 but I played 2 hours and 26 minutes probbaly 30 minutes of it loggin screen and bugs. Funny thing is because of this 26 minutes i cant get my refund. I requested refund once and I think you re not realize about the game 1) Its not on ""My Library"" so i cant play it even if I want( fact i dont want to)2) Game Introducing and gameplay are so diffrent 3) There is no one to play with Even you cant play a game like bingo etc..4) When Bugs came to destroy your humanity like turning screen, cant move etc.. you are not playin it you re just try to fix it5) I was hoped updates gonna make this game better. But I only saw my character turning on middle of casino6) If I cant get refund its okay you can take my money but I will gonna let people know what kind game it isNote to mates: If this problems arrived to you people DO NOT TRY TO FIX IT AFTER THE 2 HOURS OF PLAYTIME YOU'RE DESTROYIN YOUR REFUND CHANCE !!

They only give the player enough money to play one game of poker at the beginning, which means that only 1/6 new players get to play a second game of poker (if they all are to join a paid poker match for their first game, as I did).

												Shame... I really liked the idea of this until I played poker ( The main reason I DL this game ) For a poker player I found the tables very slow and with annoying animations, I also got disconnected whilst in a poker game and kicked off the table.There is no auto fold feature so you lose your chips.  I'm not sure if this happens on the other types of games, if it does thats even more of a blow as I had some fun on them.However I don't think this is a bad game and is a really nice concept except for the pets walking around the casino.         IF more bling could replace them, ie a parking lot and a choice to buy nice cars or gold chains flowing from your neck that would be fun and less odd than seeing animals walking around lol.For now tho I will uninstall and check back in a year.

												Fun for the first hour or two then you're out of money, the odds must be tweaked that way, to you either stop playing or complete random objectives to scrap up a few chips, if you get thos done there are weekly objectives. Basically once you run out of the initial chips all you do is run around for 10-15 minutes, collect 250 chips, lose them in about 3-5 minutes, run around again and repeat that until the day resets. Unless you're buying chips the cam gets old quick, I'd buy chips but not if the adds are skewed to be in your favor briefly then eventually you're out again. Has potential but I wouldn't recommend it.			"

												this game is a great concept, but needs work.  i play full graphics games with an average FPS of 40 - 70..this game, i'm lucky to get 15 FPS!  Main loby is 7 FPS at best...oh BTW...this is with graphics turned down to half accross the board!  I get that they want to make it flashy, but this is a casino game!  There is no real time physics or aim data; not even any real RPG componant, but yet, it is <u>THE</u> sluggesh of any games i have old or new!yes i still play it (the poker room can be fun), but don't stay in the loby unless you want to put everything on low and pretend its minecraft!

												Overall fun concept, however if you have the misfortune to run out of cash the game becomes very not fun.  Basically you get to hang around for 15 minutes doing absolutely nothing waiting for a measely $250 (5 hands of blackjack).  Sure you can Play ""Free poker"" ... ONCE per day.  Or free slots ONCE per day.  At least free bingo comes up about once an hour.  Can't see what would be harm in allowing Anyone with sub 1K chips in free pulls on the Free slot or to play free poker... but I guess they just want you to get frustrated and pay real money for fake money... that or just quit.

												If you came here for a reveiew then you came to the wrong place, if you want a Cheddar cheese & shallot pie with fennel seed pastry recipe i can provide for you. Method. 1. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. First, make the filling. Boil the potatoes in a large pan of salted water for 10-15 mins until a knife is easily inserted but the potatoes still hold their shape.2. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over a low heat. Slowly sweat the shallots and spring onions with a pinch of salt until softened, stirring occasionally, about 10-12 mins. Meanwhile, whisk together the eggs, cream, thyme, cheese and some seasoning. Set aside.3. To make the pastry, melt the butter with 100ml water in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer. Tip the rest of the pastry ingredients and 1 / 2 tsp salt into a large bowl. Make a well in the centre and pour in the butter. Stir with a wooden spoon, then bring together with your hands, kneading lightly for a few mins.4. Grease a large 20-26cm pie dish. On a lightly dusted work surface, roll out two-thirds of the pastry big enough to fill the base and sides of your dish. Use the remaining pastry to roll out a lid.5. Add the potato and shallot mixture to the beaten egg filling, and spoon into your pastry case. Cover with the pastry lid and crimp the edges decoratively.6. Finally, beat the egg yolk with the milk and glaze the pie. Poke a couple of small steam holes in the top, chill for 10 mins, then bake in the oven for 40-45 mins.			"

""SHUT UP AND PUT YOUR MONEY WHERE YOUR MOUTH IS""""That's what you get for waking up in Vegas"", said Katy Perry. She would probably be very pleased with The Four Kings Casino and Slots and its free credit policy! TFK is one of the few simulation titles on Steam worth keeping an eye on. Even if you're not that much into gambling (like myself), you could probably enjoy this casino MMO and its large variety of slot mahcines and table games. Particularly funny with friends if they could also enjoy a casual simulation game sharp enough for a small studio. It's far from AAA standards, but it doesn't aim for that either! The gameplay is as fluid as it has to be (also with the fairly decent partial controller support, featuring the rare XInput on-screen symbols not often seen on partial support of this type) and although the graphics aren't extremely fancy, they don't hurt the eyes. There could perhaps be some improvement on lobby management -- as you can't choose which lobby you want to end up into, causing you and your friends to get lost often, forcing you to use the invitation and the ""join now"" options -- and performance as that's enough to keep this from a perfect score.Pros:  Decent casino simulation with a large variety of games  Acceptable graphics and character models  Social interaction features  Runs fairly well  In sync with your Steam friends list  Fair in-game currency handling with free credits being given every 15-or-so minutes and RP being given as you play games -- making cash purchases optional and fair  The VIP feature can be achieved with gameplay  For a recently released title, an OK amount of cosmetics (here's hoping the developers will add more as the game grows)  Daily and weekly objectives that reward the player with more credits  Active, responsive and respectful development team with fair in-game social policies and presence on the Steam discussions  For a F2P basic simulation title, you'd expect the developers to turn a blind eye to feedback and complaints, but they're actually worried about how the players are experiencing the game and still doing their best to provide a good productCons:  Just ouf of Early Access and still contains a few bugs and performance issues  Almost no resolution options (I don't know if it's because my GPU is AMD, but I only have two resolution options and neither is my monitor's)  Slow loading screens  Game throws you at random lobbies, making it easy to get lost from your friends  FPS capped at 30 (correct me if I'm wrong, please)  Some tutorials might still be a little complicated for laymen especially cos they don't contain images as examples  Lack of NPCs, ruining the idea of being in a casino (I mean, there are no dealer avatars, so the experience is hardly relatable)All in all, TFK is a fairly decent casino simulation that not only has room to grow, but counts with a dedicated development team willing to listen to feedback and improve over it. Grab your friends and get ready for a good relaxing time as you dive into the most economical harmless Vegas ever!			"

I would recomend anyone interested in an online casino to give it a go, but I wouldn't recommend investing into the microtransactions until there's been possitive momentum in their developments.			"

												Disclaimer, I am no professional revieuwer.When I started to play this game, at the time when there was problems, it did not feel like a great atmosphere at all.Its like what you expect from to experience in other type of games not casual games.From my experience, when you build up a reputation within the community, whether good or bad, or both, the scale of this game seem to press on it as a monitor.Everyone at the time of the game I played litterly knew eachother and look at eachother everyday.The feelings from that experience went often through the roof, up to reporting games to devs.The game itself was at the time fun, but also pretty quick repetitive, especially after the first month it began to sink in the only thing to play for is to maintain the VIP level, without a real sense of VIP feel, there was no special rewards or something from a casino experience for being a loyal guest of the casino.Thats why at the time I went to play more for to find bugs, and to try make the game somewhat my home to voice my experience on the forum.That did not went well as unfortuanetly, and I still believe today because of the ingame reputation they did bash my voice in the face with a hammer on the forums.I honestly do not care for it, but it did mark the end for me how far the right of speech reached to voice a mere opinion or ingame issue.For me anything with math on the forum was an issue too, I never finished any school due to medical issues.What does it have to do with the game experience?It demands alot from an individual where as it felt I had no rights to be myself.

												Not bad but the free daily chip allowance you get each day is buttons, barely enough for half a dozen spins on the slots, slots don't pay out much either for what you gamble. This is a money grabber, spend real money for virtual currency, although it would all be gone in no time for like I stated, slots pay out so little in return. It be a good idea to increase the free daily chip allowance if it is to attract alot more players and to keep the free loaders in the game world longer than in it's current state. The daily free poker tables needs unlimited uses, not just limited to 1 use per day. Not good at all for the free loaders and people that are skint, that are looking for something to do and the free chip you get every 15 or so minutes is really taking the micky. (250 chips) Not even a decent spin on the slots for that and receiving around 3 chips on a really good spin on the slots for that much. I realize the creator needs to make a bit of money and to pay for server costs but come on, greatest majority of roulette, poker, blackjack ect tables are chip based in buying into them. What's the point in spending real currency for virtual currency if what you win in virtual currency isn't alot. I rather pay for VIP than earn it. Isn't that how the server costs are paid for as such on most games of this type? Instead of forcing people to buy virtual currency to blow on what little winnings you will get back in return from all the gambling on this thing, I would give this a thumbs down for now. If it got better, I maybe give it a thumbs up.			"

You can't get it back in winnings!There are so few games, if you like Bingo or blackjack, there are better games that deliver a cleaner and more useful interface, otherwise the rest of it is uninspiring, hard to look at and dull to a d. Otherwise in total there are about 12 games, all of them terrible. Poker is the worst since people play like turtles and wait for you to die in your chair so they win by being the last alive. "

Early Access Review
								At first, I was surprised when I clicked to buy Four Kings Casino All-In Pass and found out that this is just a DLC, and for purchase - it want to buy the game itself. Ok. I bought it. Since a VERY LONG time waiting for something similar Reel Deal Slots in Steam. And cause I'm a fan of this genre of games.And I was very disappointed... the presence of early access in no way justifies an EXTREMELY UGLY BLOCKY graphics. Many games of this genre 15 years ago looked much better than this game. Halls, which is nearly the same as each other are no different and artificially stretched by placing the same machine 10 pieces in a row. Only 1 kind of horrible slot machine (seriously???) without interesting bonus and the possibility of doubling (on mobile devices, in F2P games - slots which made on a much more decent level - hundreds). Video poker without the doubling possibility and other games made on the most primitive level without interesting variations. And I doubt very much that at least some of these problems will be fixed with the release.Including a full absence of people in the lobby. I can't even give out my VIP invitations to friends in Steam, cause the VIP-invitation system not working at the moment.Not to mention the fact that my first acquaintance with the game began with an immediate disconnect from server after logging into the system and inability to reconnect quite a long time, resulting to log into the game I was only able the next day.

I shouldnt have to buy chips to play long enough to have funWhen early access is done game is free to play haha sounds like a joke cuz they only give you like 25 chips per 15 mins  and one pull on a really low pay out on a slot machine....If u ever played a casino game you know that doesnt last long  most casino games give you Minimum a few thousandThere max bet limits are also a joke max bet is $400.. Where is the win big These guys are too greedy and that will be there down fall, Games should be fun for all and if there having fun they will want to buy chips but if you have no free chips you might as well go to the real casinoDont let the pictures fool you there are at most 5 people in the casino at a time when i join. its like a ghost town			"

												The developers deducted all of my winnings during an update. Don't download unless you have a bunch of real cash to waste on buying chips, and if you do have that kind of money, go to a real casino.EDIT: Now they even banned me from the forums so I can't discuss this further with the community, so I will say it here.They stole ~250 players chips because one of their games paid out too much, and now they're banning them from the forums for getting upset!They even stole peoples chips who paid cash for them. What a shame, because I'd like to keep playing, but now with no chips, and no certainty to whether or not I'd even get to keep future winnings, I wont be playing any more. Not to mention they're banning people for speaking up. Ridiculous conduct on the behalf of the developers.EDIT:and then this is their response to the players! By DL_Dave, the developer:""Hey Everyone,I understand that everyone who used the exploit in slots is upset that we had to reverse everything. I also understand that people feel that since the game allowed them to take advantage of an exploit they should be able to keep all of the chips. Please understand that the exploit is not how we intended the game to be played. With so many chips stolen by using the exploit it made it unfair for all of the players who were playing fairly. It was unfair to the players who earned their way onto the leaderboards. It was unfair to us for cheating us out of our chips. We are giving you a place to play for free, and our economy is designed to allow us to continue developing content, and providing updates. When there is a surge of chips pouring into the economy, although it may not seem like it because the game is free, that is money lost to us.You certainly have the right to be upset about these events that happened, I'm not taking that away from you, but at least try to understand our side of things as well.Email repsonses are going to take a little bit longer to be responded to as some of the team have taken some time away from the office. We just had Canada Day here so some people have elected to use their holidays to extend their time off. Understandably we've also received a ton of emails due to what has occured. So please be patient as our tunaround time will not be as fast as normal.Now I'm sure you can understand that we will not be refunding chips that were gained from the exploit, BUT if you feel as there were too many chips removed from your holdings then please send us a nice polite and calm email explaining everything and tech support will get back to you as soon as they can.As I feel as this issue has been addressed, I'm going to be putting a lock on this thread, and please note that future topics will be removed.""they considered it cheating them out of their chips? what a joke.so I guess no more discussion on the matter, and this review will probably be deleted somehow.

												Much as I would like to recommend it, I don't.Mainly because the game is somewhat rough, like it's still in its alpha stage.I'm a kamikaze type of gambler. Because I'm a guy with little self-control and this is how I keep the balance(not economical sense). Whenever I'm getting the red-eyed eagerness that gambling gives me, I'll go all-in and convince myself that gambling is only a game and there are way better things in life. Anyway, I was in a blackjack table, I threw all of my chips in, and the game broke, as it breaks a lot. And I lost my chips. Like that. Bummer, eh? But it could've been worse.I have a stable network connection and a rather powerful machine. So it should not be my problem, I suppose.I do see some sparkles, however this is a game released in June, 2015.Might give it another couple of hours.My female character has a really nice looking bum. But I can't recommend this, not for the quality right now.			"

Everything works perfeclty fine up to the point where you click on ""connect"", and the screen freezes, showing a drawing of people playing...As far as I see, on Mac (MacBook Pro 15inch, 2014), it can be defined as everything but a game ! A slideshow, as the drawings are different each time...I'll edit my post if something changes, but for all mac-users, do not buy the game right now, you'll come up with such a great deceptive emotion.

												Holy crap, this sucks. I feel so bad because my friend  got this game for me when it was 10 dollars. Now it's free to play. I feel like a total jerk. Now thats just the start of it. This game has fine simulated gambling, but the load screens are so long that you would be lucky to even play a game. Not only that but the game is so low on FPS. I feel like a total butt to my friend because of what I asked him to do: Buying me a $10 game that sucks, and now its free.			"

The start off chip ammount is so low that you cant even play very long without either being eally lucky or paying real money to buy the chips. This game might be free but its not even worth it to waste your time trying.			"

												It's fun, but it can get a little annoying. It's a basic simulator so all the games work fine, but I cannot seem to find Baccarat in the casino, which is a shame because I really like that game. There's also no way that I've found to turn off the notification when players join and leave the server, that can get really anooying really fast when a lot of people join all at once.			"

												I have 1 hour of game play on this game and I haven't even gotten to play it. There was a problem making a username. It said the username was available but then it would say ""invalid username"". I played with this for a little bit and tried using usernames like ""gfsnhjs6885"" and it still did the same thing. Then, when I finally got it to work, I never received an email. I checked my junk mail and everything and even tried to resend the comfirmation email to my email but it didn't show up. But when I finally got the email (after trying for an hour) it wouldnt let me log in. It would say ""logging in"" and it would say like that for 20  minutes until I would restart the game and it would do the same thing again. I also uninstalled the game twice and it still isn't working. Do not recommend. This was a waste of my time.			"

												This game is trash. If you don't like wandering around a nearly empty casino with nothing to do then you will hate this game. Even if you like casino games they crash and are glitchy constantly. Usually you lose your bets to these glitches and crashes. Some games only half work, like craps, which usually doesn't let you bet properly. Poker is a joke, when it's not crashing it is sooooo slow. No sit-n-go poker either, just tournaments. Some games don't even exist that are in the games menu, like baccarat. Total trash.			"

								If you're looking to play alone in an empty casino, this game is for you! In all seriousness, Four Kings Casino is a interesting title that is very similar to the PS Home Casino. The developers are really nice and interactive. Slot and table games are very fun and fast. Why am I not recommending this game then? Here's why:BJ and roulette completely lack excitement since the betting limit is under 0.5% of your start money. It's really hard to play poker when there's barely anyone online to play with and when there is they won't want to play with you. There's a VIP area which requires you to play approx. 30h/month to gain and maintain your VIP membership unless if you pay for it.This game needs a lot of work still before it's ready for a release. For now: DON'T BUY THIS GAME! Play at a real online casino! Obviously the lack of players isn't the developers fault but there are many issues that they should fix.TL;DR: Nobody is online, betting limits are WAY TOO low. Don't buy this game unless you're dying for a casino game on Steam.			"

												This is a game designed wholely and solely to take your money.  If you play the slots, you lose and are required to buy more, if you play blackjack you lose requiring you buy more chips with real money.  At no point in the few hours I played this game did I win anything at all, however at every turn it asks you to pay for more chip with real money.My advice is if you want to play a gambling game go and find an online casino, at least there your have a small chance of winning real money back rather than just playing losing games here and buying chips with real money that you get nothing from.

This was what I sent them.""My game is acting as if I am holding my left arrow key down yet I have closed the game and re-opened the game twice to no avail. I have opened about 3 games in the elapsed time to see if it was my computer and it is not causing this. Please fix this because I am now an African-American female brunnette(?) not a White blond male. I thank you for your time :)"" Word for Word... Its gone.			"

												the things i dont like about this game.....1.) theres floating coins in mid air to collect if you want them2.) the store shops have very bland names3.) not even a great variety of slot machines4.) you can say whatever you want even if its racism5.) the left shift key makes you walk instead of run6.) there's no voice chat, everyones mouth is zipped shut7.) you just slapped down some boring things and tried to call it good. then you demanded money so we can play more... uhh uhh. the things i did like about this game.....1.) the music is o.k i guess and doesnt need to be changed2.) i liked the stair case fountain3.) the place looked cleanthe things i would want to see in the game.....1.) the ability to drink, and eat, and go to the bathroom2.) a men's and womans bathroom area for just that3.) fancy store names ""be creative""4.) the ability to use voice chat5.) the ability to jump off the balcany if i wanted to, and when i land i want a limp look that would heal over time as a consesquence for jumping6.) more better slot machines. ive played way better casino games than this. double down casino on facebook is what i like, and they know how to offer slot machines7.) if i didnt know, please make the ability to own a house, or a vehical, or whatever			"

												Welcome to a Web-chat based online community. Pros: Fun gambling games. Challenging slope to get from 2k coins to 20k+. The games look great. Winning clothing and achievements is fun. Cons: The main problem with this is game is that it is broken. The casino games lag and you loose the buy in you just worked hard for. I've Dc'D many times on a poker game.The servers are always messing up. For whatever reason, there is one server and it will lag with the casino games. You can walk into walls and be able to stand in one spot for long periods of time..joy.It pushes you to pay for it. I know it's optional, but it reminds you that you can pay for it through various outlets. I put in three dollars and ultimately I got dissapointment. I want more than cosmetics or a small bag of chips/achievement. If I'm going to buy for your game, make it worthwhile. Overall: 2/5Don't play it, don't download it, and whatever you do...don't buy from it. At best, it's a IMVU clone...at worst it's a handmedown game that doesn't work for the majority of it's time. If you'd like to play casino games, do yourself a service and find another one to gamble with.			"

												This game is seriously rigged. Especially in Blackjack. The times the dealer comes out with 20 and 21 from seemingly impossibly dealt cards is just pure CRAP!As for the slots well you might as well throw your money away. There is only 3 types as well and trust me they get really boring. They do not pay hardly anything at all and free spins are a joke and the features are just crappy.

ALSO the prizes are underpaid at the poker tables, 2nd place in a 6 ring 5k poker table will only make me 1,250k profit, that's crap! I spend about 30 mins on a game for that? not worth it really.

												This game is great if you like to be in an virtual casino, but some of the players are not so great. The game can be more fun if you have a friend to explore the game with. So I highly recommend getting this free game if you like social casino games with 3D avatars. Not so good for meeting new friends though.			"

												Actually well good, from what I've played!Casino games can sometimes feel cheap or lacking in substance or just cash grabs but... this one genuinely feels fleshed out and both fun and social to play. The graphics are nice, the environment is nice... everything is nice really. Some of it feels a bit simple like the club just plays the same tune on a loop, but to be fair it's a casino game so we're kind of lucky there's a club at all!Recommended for sure, if you like casino games or social games!

												The game is a good little bit of fun to get the gambler out of you before you go and spend a load in real life. Sure this game isnt like real gambling as it feels there is definitely an element of dynamic balancing where the game will purposely make you do better or worse depending on certain things out of your control. The game does this because it wants you to purchase in game chips as its free to play, but id give it a 6/10, good little bit of fun			"

												For a free casino simulator, this is not too bad. I feel it does not ""try too hard"". The game feels balanced and fleshed out. There are a few bugs, but none that have affected my gameplay experience. It does a good job of being a good time-sink without being oppressive or stressful. Gameplay and game mechanics seem sound and there seems to be no lag. Controls are simple and straight-forward.Would I suggest this game? Sure, if you have the time and/or inclination to play a casino-simulator. It is kind of neat to get to play various casino games without having to commit real money.Things I enjoyed:~ Decent selection of games with a decent interface and help system to back them up.~ Decent free-to-play model. Steady, if minimal, influx of Chips while online from various sources. (Daily/weekly activities. 250c every 15 minutes at Chip kiosks. Etc)~ Music is not unpleasant, albeit a bit repetetive.~ Daily and Weekly tasks to help keep the grind ""fresh"" and mix things up.~ Graphics are not oppressive or excessive. It feels like walking through a casino (though I have not been through many, myself)~ Decent rewards/achievement system, as well as ranking up through winning at games.~ Rankings for the various games.Things that were not so enjoyed:~ First time loading in, there were some hefty graphical issues. Restarting the game after fiddling with the settings remedied this.~ Sometimes the game crashes (or fails to launch) on start-up.			"

												If you enjoy having the odds stacked against you worse then actually going to Las Vegas to play, then this is your game.  The slot games are terrible and you only win on max and that is less then half the time and then you will experience a complete dead zone if your pot is too high and lose it all back.  the game itself is crashing on me almost everytime i go to another zone.  I really wanted to enjoy this game as I loved this concept on PS3 with playstation home, but this game is geared towards the greedy developers cashflow.  you literally have to buy money every other day just to play the games or sit and wait for their petty little 250 dollar chip toss at the coin station.  it's pathetic.  I do not recommend this game if you like poker.  prominence poker is much better.			"

												Since I got it working and was able to sign up I love this game. It is fun and relaxing and a great way to meet new people. You don't have to spend real money at all. They start you with 10 grand in chips so if you bet wisely you won't have to buy more. You get 250 free daily. Video Blackjack is the easiest place to win more chips. You take control of multiple hands so as long as half of them win you don't lose any money. I have always been a roulette fan myself. It is hard to get in on a poker games, the tables are always full. There are also objectives and you can spend your earnings on gear for your avatar. It does freeze and glitch up a few times but it is bareable. I went into the lobby once and was in the floor. Left the game and returned and everything was back to normal. I could play this all day.			"

												It's okay. I have only played Craps, Poker, and War. Craps does NOT work properly by the way. I've noticed the don't come bets, and the come odds bets do not work properly in certain situations. Also, the minimums are very high, I wish there were a few more tables that had a more ""realistic"" minimum, such as 5-10 dollars. Also, the poker tables are all sit and go tournaments. There are no ""cash"" tables, which is something I was kind of looking for. The war game was okay, I usually win a lot from it.Overall 5/10. There aren't any casino games like this, but it could definitely be largely improved. I recommend trying it out to form your own opinion though.			"

Is the avatar customization surprisingly robust for this type of game?  Yes.  Would I recommend it?  Yes.Seriously, it's free.  What do you really have to lose?			"

It's like being in an actual casino without having to pay any fees (if there are any in casinos, I never been into one so I wouldn't know if they had fees or not when entering), all in the comfort of your own home.  Also, you can meet people on this game and play the various casino games with them.  I played this on a console once, so I am adding the time I was on a console wtih the time I am playing it now.  And so far, I think it's really good.  Then again, I haven't been through everything yet so I may review this again.			"

												After “reel deal live” went belly up, I needed a replacement. I have to say I've enjoyed this game immensely, even though my chips generally are below a few thousand. I lost a lot, and gain very little. Some see that as a con. I see it as a “Time to go do something else” message. I'm probably not the game designers focus group. I have no problems walking away without buying a single chip when I lose it all, and this game has plenty of “free chip” perks to keep me coming back. Its the best free to play casino game I've run across yet, and its not a super time sink unless you have an addiction that keeps you buying chips and getting angry when you aren't winning. I love casino games, and enjoy the interaction with people playing with the exception of the troll activity that is fairly easy to ignore. All MMO's have trolls, can't blame it on designers. Its the nature of society.			"

They also have about 4 different generic slot games as well as another 2-4 video slot games from ""Jacks or Better, Video BlackJack, Keno, and many more.You can even play Bingo with a pretty ingaging experience.

												If you're looking for a great casino game this is it. Sure it might not have as much as some others, but it's multiplayer and is the only one I know of where you actually have a character and walk around the casino. Most of the bad reviews are just people complaining about losing, but that's what gambling is all about. You win some you lose some. You get a good amount of chips and as long as you manage your bets responsibly you probably won't run out. After 16 hours, I've only gone under the starting amount a few times, and not even by much. They also have a really comprehensive FAQ and great steam Forum presence/response time.			"

												Since I got it working and was able to sign up I love this game. It is fun and relaxing and a great way to meet new people. You don't have to spend real money at all. They start you with 10 grand in chips so if you bet wisely you won't have to buy more. You get 250 free daily. Video Blackjack is the easiest place to win more chips. You take control of multiple hands so as long as half of them win you don't lose any money. I have always been a roulette fan myself. It is hard to get in on a poker games, the tables are always full. There are also objectives and you can spend your earnings on gear for your avatar. It does freeze and glitch up a few times but it is bareable. I went into the lobby once and was in the floor. Left the game and returned and everything was back to normal. I could play this all day.			"

												It's okay. I have only played Craps, Poker, and War. Craps does NOT work properly by the way. I've noticed the don't come bets, and the come odds bets do not work properly in certain situations. Also, the minimums are very high, I wish there were a few more tables that had a more ""realistic"" minimum, such as 5-10 dollars. Also, the poker tables are all sit and go tournaments. There are no ""cash"" tables, which is something I was kind of looking for. The war game was okay, I usually win a lot from it.Overall 5/10. There aren't any casino games like this, but it could definitely be largely improved. I recommend trying it out to form your own opinion though.			"

												This game is pretty fun. I don't like to gamble and I'm saying this. It gives you enough chips to fool around, and test out some games. If you're good you can turn those chips in to a winning streak, and never spend a real dollar!Every 15 minutes you also get a free stack of chips to play around with, so you can just keep trying your luck for free. I've even been considering putting some real money down and entering big pot poker tournaments.I even have a new strategy for Craps in the real world! (Don't try this unless you plan on losing money at the real casino anyway.)Very fun, very easy, free, socail, and better than anything you can find on things like facebook! "

												The game is a good little bit of fun to get the gambler out of you before you go and spend a load in real life. Sure this game isnt like real gambling as it feels there is definitely an element of dynamic balancing where the game will purposely make you do better or worse depending on certain things out of your control. The game does this because it wants you to purchase in game chips as its free to play, but id give it a 6/10, good little bit of fun			"

Tried to keep re-entering however it would crash every other hand. All other players at the table also had this issue as they were no longer at the table. Went back in about 30 min later and the game is over and I am out 5,000 chips.Terrible game. Uninstalling.			"

												I really love the game, with the atmosphere and the friendliness in here, including a slightly professional way of casino games that could always determine wins and losses without any rigging. But I feel that this game should have more than just a casino. It should probably be The Four Kings Resort, Casino, And Slots. Maybe add more to it and all, say even have restaurants, places to go, trips to go, and all. Perhaps make it a little more touristic. I'm all for this game to upgrade and improve. Keep up the good work, guys.			"

												I really enjoy the choice of games available.  It's nice that other real players are wandering around the Casino.  It seems like there is a cap on the Craps table money wise at 4000.  I could be wrong or not high enough exp. or skill wise to play at a higher table..I just hope the cap doesn't remain 4000.  I would like to eventually make 20000 chip bets..Good game!			"

												I love the idea of this game, love the features of it, its great fun, great socializing. However I have an issues on the main thing that should be adressed, that ist he chips. The chips should be made more simple, 100 to start, then have tables that limit to 5 bet, to max. Dont have a structure but be made small.The main thing that this game needs is a bank chips account, it be nice feature for players to deposit it in a bank vault and withdraw the need for gamble, this brings  a true casino experience and can calculate their bets.The money thing needs to be made more simple. This advice, though may seem like a small meaningless thing, will axcually make a huge difference to indivuals wanting to invest in this game.			"

												This is an excellent casino sim. It does have a few glitches but in the main they do not affect your casino experience. 4 kings offers a variety of games from slots to roulette to poker to craps and blackjack. It will give a casual gambler/gamer hours of fun. The only negative being that if you want to advance your VIP level in the game it is virtually impossible to do so without spending a little bit of real cash to buy a substantial stack of chips. That said, there are many daily quests which are always renewed and mini tournaments offering players another chance to win some chips. All in all a great freebie game!			"

												Four Kings Casino and Slots truly is what it says it is. If you want a place where you can casually socialize with others while playing in a casino filled with different types of games, then this is your game! Customize your avatar and even redeem chips for special effects and rewards.There are trolls from time to time, but that's to expect with any online environment. So, overall, I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes casino games.			"

												A little bit rough around the edges, but overall an amazing piece of work. If casino gaming is your thing, or if you ever just wanted to learn how to play a certain casino game then this game might be your solution.The f2p-model is quite good. You are initially seeded with a fixed amount of chips. By completing various achievements, daily quests, weekly quests, event quests, and of course by winning at games, you add to your total. You also get free chip stipends every 15 minutes spent in game, and hidden chip caches located randomly in the casino will help to augment your war-chest.I've tripled by initial seed by just playing intelligently, and with restraint at games. If you do have to buy chips, the prices are  quite reasonable.The avatar customization adds a real shine to the game. With cosmetics that you win by completing various achievements allows you to deck your toon out nicely.Having lived in Vegas for eight years might have me a little bit biased towards these types of games, but regardless, this game is worth a look.

												Could not load at all was able to register but when i tried to play the game I found that i sat in a ♥♥♥♥ing loading screen for approximately 30 minutes and nothing happened if this issue was resolved then i could legitament about the gameplay of this game. So far this game is trash. As it consists of only a loading screen that doesnt load.			"

												Honestly, This game has come so far, for better and worse. I would recomend this if you're looking to play poker, black jack and other casino like game. Pros: Competitive playCan play with/against people or alone (with some games).Nice looking casino. Cons: Would be cool to see more people around the casino. Every once and awhile the casino god look down apon me and curse me with a bounty of lossesMinor glitches.			"

												The concept of the game is fantastic. Being able to run around and play casino games. However the company producing the game is subpar at best.They actually don't listen to peoples ideas to help them become more stable, instead they throw tantrums and tell people (who have invested both time and money) to go find another ""free"" game. That type of inconciderate behave alone drove me away. There are an extreme amount of in game glitches that never get repaired. An occasional patch (band-aid) at best to mask a flaw in simple game coding. Plus the code, if you look at it, is horrendously disorganized, causing major game glitches and shut downs. These things get blamed on the cheap server they used despite making the big bucks from everyone buying stuff in there.They also call the game a casino game but lately it's changed into a a casino with sublevels - space and beach, which are souly for taking people to and cyber $3xing them. Which in itself is disgusting... have you seen pictures of those of us in there? Yeah, no way Jose!DL doesn't want to adjust their pump and dump logic so there is nothing for long time players aside your friends. It's all about the cash cow of coming in as a noob dumping wads of cash and then leaving game for good.If you lilke s3x, people who think they are God, cheaters, glitchy games, and really odset of rules for poker then this is a game for you! Otherwise just do GP3!			"
