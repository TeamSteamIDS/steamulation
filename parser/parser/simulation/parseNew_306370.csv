												You can't compare a game that came out 4-5 years ago to a game released this year..that's pretty absurd.Anyways, yes, the game is pretty basic in terms of control. It's a simulator based on simulating one thing, controlling the PATH train. There actually is a career mode, but it's not in the sense of career mode most people are used to. It's called 'Shift Duty' in this case. You can play any time-table of which I'd assume was the PATH schedule back in that day with three different types of cars. The camera angles are limited but, hey, it's a simulator, you're suppose to be driving a train, not go ape♥♥♥♥♥♥wanting to view the doors open from the outside, you're suppose to be in the cab; plain and simple.I must admit though, the game is definitely not worth the $19.99 at this day in age. They do have other versions, not sure if released on Steam though, Vol 2 in Berlin and Vol 3 in London I believe. They also have a Vol 4 coming that would feature the (7) line in NYC.By the way, I'm using Windows 8.1 Pro with no issues of crashing like other users are experiencing.Plain and simple, if you want a pure simulator operating a train and just doing that, go for it. If you want to only view the trains from exterior views and have fun watching doors open from the outside, this train simulator may not be for you.Just remember, this game came out in '09. Not '14.

												A cool, older train simulator, for enthusiasts.  Don't compare it to more modern and/or extensible simulators.Pros:-physics-quite good graphics for it's time-easy to learn, hard to master, challenging-realistic schedules and shifts-chance to drive already retired trains-runs on a P4 toaster-fully customizable controlsCons:-freezes sometimes-schrecklichen englischen Sprache-when in schedule mode, if the real train had a 10 minute wait, then you have to wait 10 minutes too. 15-20-30 on NWK, or at night.-not extensible (no custom trains, routes, schedules anything)-the expansion is not sold on Steam			"

												World of Subway's 1 - The Path, is a game which is not for the hardcore train simulation fan's, some may like it, some may not, but in my opinion, it saves a spot in my book. So when you get the game for the very first time, you can see that the menu is very basic and plain, but remember this is a game which came out in 2009, not 2015. When you choose the timetable, the type of train you have selected and the location, the loading time takes about 10-15 seconds, so you dont have to complain about the time it takes to load.Then you come to the one big downside of the the game which really ticked me off, when you get into the subway train for the first time, some of the controls are unbinded on the train itself which is annoying, so your going to have to go to the options menu and bind all the train controls that way.The other thing that people may not like is the graphics, there very Mircosoft Train Simulator like, which doesn't bother me at all and the next downside to the game is the intercom voice when you arrive and depart every station, this can be also very annoying when your trying to drive.The controls on the train are hard to master, but once you know and get used to the brake, reverser and everything else on the train, it can be easier once you do get used to the train controls.So my final verdict is that this is not for hardcore train sim fan's, it's plain, simple, easy and fun, but If you are looking for a challenge, I should recommend World of Subways Vol. 3 - London Underground Circle Line, it has much more of a realistic like physics engine and you can get in and out in the train!  Which is a pretty sweet feature.I recommend World of Subway's 1 - The Path for newcomers to train simulation, remember the controls are hard but you can bind them to whatever key you want on your keyboard, so it can be a bit easy for you.

												This certainly has a charm, and I really like the game. Yes, it's quite old but the graphics are what I expected, but surprisingly good. I love the Manhattan backdrop (pity it isn't HD) but it does give you that immersion driving the train in the open.I was also happy I discovered at least partial XBox360 controller function, admittedly the analogue sticks and triggers don't work, but you can map the trains main functions to the buttons.You will need to assign some of the keyboard commands, such as the announcements and you can switch to the mouse for the added look around, so basically for the price, and functionality and just charm I am happy with this little game.One thing though, it's such a pity you cannot move the UI which just bunches itself in your view. Being able to move the sections within the screen would have been good, as I just turn them all off once I set the destination.This game allows me to relax, it's small enough to do a few runs without losing interest, and I even crack a few smiles at the voice overs for the announcer who sounds like he has a rather nasty cold.You can max out everything and even force FXAA from nVidia's CP for added look and feel.I hope the devs revisit New York and a big thanks to them for daring to develop a game as I guess a very small team with the C4 engine.I will definitely make the leap to WoS 4 (Line7) and look forward to more great innovative developments in the future.I did suffer pink/black graphic anomalies, but unchecking fullscreen seems to have fixed that, and as a note to anyone reading this, even with fullscreen unchecked and the game running in windowed mode, it's only the main GUI that is windowed and once you start a shift, or take a route, the gameplay is in fullscreen, albeit with the windows taskbar, which is forgivable.Big thumbs up.

												Quite an enjoyable sim, but does come with a twist.Lack of AI and the distance between stations is quite long with a train not going that really fast. So yah it can get boring.Although it has very nice effects but it still lacks the function to be able to modify controls or even saving the game. It has stunning graphics and looks very well polished, but still feels cheaper than the next iteration of WoS. Lacks some of the finesse and delicacy in cabin movement and world interaction.The switch between riding above and under-ground is nicely done.			"

												If you've ever played Train Simulator 2015, prepare to take a step down in terms of interface and controls and general functionality of the game. I would say the price is a little high, perhaps $9.95 (US) would have been more appropriate than $19.95. The camera controls are basic, there's no zoom, FOV or adjustment of exterior camera. You can't open the train doors unless the camera view is in the driver's cabin, so you can't see the doors opening and closing, or passengers boarding. It's a very basic sim, there's no career mode or any of the usual things you find in  games. It has an indie ""pet project"" feel about it for sure!It might appeal to someone who is familiar with this actual line in real life. If you've lived in NY, this sim might be interesting, but even then it's still niche. Train Simulator 2015 has an excellent feature where you can move the camera from the front to the back outside the train, and zoom in and out and around, and still maintain control of the train. World of Subways has nothing like that. TS 2015 is a lot more expensive though, so the comparison isn't entirely fair. But now you know what you're in for.  "

												I DISLIKE THIS GAMEWhy?-  This game was released several years ago and does not run as smoothly as Train Simulator 2015-  There is no in-game help / options menu to consult for key command reference-  The voice acting is quite ridiculous-  There isn't much to actually do in the missions, the driving becomes simple and endlessly driving the subway through the long stretches of the tunnel segments is at best a way to mess up your eyesWhat did I like?-  The bit of outdoor rail was nice a nice breakWhat Do I Suggest?-  The World of Subways Vol. 3 - London Underground is a much more polished game and if you love subways that much, go for that one.  If you like trains in general go with Train Simulator for the best experience in a Train Sim			"

												I know this is old content and does not compare with today's simulators. I relate to this content as it is the only route simulation that I have of the Path system and rode many time as a kid.. By today's standard its old school stuff and has many cons, I do however enjoy driving this route and bypass said cons just to own and drive this particular route. If you enjoy driving trains as much as I do, you would forget the cons and just enjoy the route.			"

												This is a comment o  Subways 4 -7th Ave. Line / I doubt anyone will read this but I feel I must make a quick comment. Although born and raised in Wash. D.c., all my family lived in New York or one of itw boroughs. I fell in love with the RED BIRF. The one i thengame is NOT it . There is no subway sound...no grinding hum when staarting or when decelerating. No hight-pithced wail whentearing down the tracks. No ""electrical"" pops when going over a short. Until these arfe corrected or addedI will savemyh money and continue to be disappointed.                                                                    Jerry Cohen			"

												Good game for the most part. WOS 1's braking is pretty unrealistic. Every time I feel like I'm going to overrun a station, the train feels like it stops almost immediately. I also have problems trying to take more than one screenshot. When I screenshot one photo, the game screen glitches (whole game screen is gray) and I have to quit the whole game and relaunch it. I also think this game needs a PA-5, which would be nice to have.This game is excellent and runs very smooth for me. Thumbs up overall.			"

												This is a great subway simulator, even though it is from 2009 I don't consider it old. I like this game because it focuses on subway train simulation instead of regular train simulation, freight, steam engines etc. There arent many train simulators that have simulation for subways. However, World of Subways vol.1 offers a simulation that is based of subway train simulation in the USA. I recomend buying this if you are looking for subway simulation in the USA.			"

												I'd like to start by mentioning that this actually a really good game. Yes, it has a few bugs here and there but at least it is still playable. For such a reasonable price, this is a good game. Remember, it came out in 2009 so we can't expect anything special. But for 2009, it actually has quite good graphics. The PATH route is quite a nice length, not too long and not too short. You can get a shift over, within about half an hour. The graphics inside the tunnels are excellent, especially the dynamic lighting that lights up the cab as you drive along. Above ground, the graphics aren't all that, but I really like the detail on the track and the signals are very bright which means you can see them from a long way off. When driving east above ground you can also see the Manhattan skyline, which I find a very nice touch to the game. In stations, you can enter free roam mode which allows you to explore. However, there is a very annoying platform bug which means that if you accidentally walk off the edge of a platform, it is impossible for you to get back up again. Therefore, you have no choice but to end the mission and start all over again. The people on the platform are static but for a 2009 game, we can't really complain. There are about three trains that you can choose from, but they all seem to be exactly the same inside the cab, so it doesn't really make any difference. Something that can be really annoying when driving is that you have to control the announcements manually by pressing keys. This can get quite boring. The station graphics could be a touch better but they are not too bad either. Another thing, is that you have to manually configure all the keys before you drive. There is no tutorial, so I guess you are just expected to learn yourself. The speed limits in the game are also very harsh. They can just change at any time. You could be just driving along at 40mph and then you notice that the limit has changed to 15mph, with a tight curve approaching. A major disappointment was that there is no speedometer inside the cab. You have to totally rely on the route monitor screen. Tight curves can also derail the train, if you are not paying attention to the speed restrictions. There are AI trains in the game, but you can only see them when you are above ground, and not in underground stations.Overall, I rate this game 7.5/10. It has some very nice features and but also some really annoying bugs. But for such a cheap price, I'd say it is worth buying and it doesn't require a high spec pc to run either, although I strongly recommend you check the minimum requirements first, just in case.			"

												I'm a real into trains. I bought this game on discount without big enthiusiasm but suprisingly it's quite good as for it's time. The line is very interesting. Built more than 100 years ago to connect New York with New Jersey. You can really feel these old claustrophobic tunnels with sharp curves and a lot of speed limits. You have multiple choices for your journey so you won't get borred that quickly. There is no real career mode but if you wish you can make a whole day shift. As for realism I don't think it is very high - the breaking seems a bit too easy, but it's not bad either. Your train will speed up downhill and you can derail it. It's a good simulator especially if your CPU is not the newest one. A bit puzzling is the fact that you have no real speedometer on board. You will need some experience to comply with the limits (you can use a track monitor though which gives you the speed but it is considered a bit of a cheat). The manual says there are some random events implemented (like a man walking inside the tunnel) but I haven't encountered any yet.I can't stop playing. Recommended.Here is the map of all tracks in Path available to you: http://nycsubway.org.s3.amazonaws.com/images/maps/pirmann-2003-path-track.gif "
