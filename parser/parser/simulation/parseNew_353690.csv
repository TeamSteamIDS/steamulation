								This game is obviously in a pre alpha state, and I knew it before buying dust.. Before anything else.. read the manual. http://www.terapoly.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?fid=3First off, the dev is awesome.. He's active in the community, listens, and is very social.  +5 cool points for this guy.Dust definitely needs some work, but it does have potential in our giant world of EA games lately on steam.  The graphics are decent, and I'm sure they will get better in time. I can run everything on max with no framerate issues and haven't had any crashes so far.Pros..   Gameplay,  realism, unique controls, terapoly.com forum community, and a great dev.Cons.. The steam community and steam forums.. 90% of my time in game consisted of getting team killed by idiots.. Not the dev's fault, just people being... well people.  The steam forums should be avoided at all costs too... Go to his official page if the trolling gets to you on steam's. These are by far my biggest gripes so far.Having a black screen and some crazy clacking noise upon death is just annoying to say the least.. This needs to be handled much better than it currently is.Needs more servers. You can't play if they are all full or aren't working.The explosion effects need work, but I'm sure they are just placeholders. No biggy hereI personally own an AR15 and shoot it alot. That being said.. sounds need worked on alot. I don't feel like I'm firing a rifle with the current sounds in place.The map is a bit devoid of life, but it's been 1 day :D My final con, which could possibly be a pro with some work.. firing. I have a razer naga and find it extremely difficult to use the middle mouse button to put your finger on the trigger and pull back.  I personally think it needs retooled or tightened up a little since some mice have stiff middle mouse buttons and it make things harder than they should be.If it was me, I'd make the middle mouse button a toggle instead of constantly having to keep it pressed down for your finger to be on the trigger. Shooting would be 100% smoother imo.			"

								I'll start this by saying that I really do like the game and its concept. The mechanics, while frustrating at times, feel like they have a certain fun in their novelty, and I do enjoy all of the various adjusting and full control that they've tried to implemment in this game. Based on these factors alone, I would be tempted to give this game a positive review; all that being said, I do not give this game a strong recommendation however much I would like to. The positive attributes that D.U.S.T. holds are currently overshadowed by the lack of player-base, the oversimplistic map design, and the general disorganization of layout. It becomes very apparent that the game lacks a large enough playerbase to produce exciting matches when the only server containing more than 0-1 players is comprised of 90% bots. This point alone would not generally turn me off to the game; I play many games regularly such as Insurgency, Star Wars Batllefront II, CS:GO, etc. which benefit greatly from the inclusion of bots and remain entertaining when playing matches even entirely comprised of NPCs/AI. But the nature of the bots in D.U.S.T. are simply frustrating. After spending so much time setting myself up (filling my canteen, adjusting sights, slowly travelling across the colossal empty plains, etc.), it is severely enraging to find that I am immediately acquired and killed by a bot from 75+ meters away with god-like accuracy. I understand that this game is intended for a hardcore, simulation audience, but when the average player, or even perhaps an operator in the real world, takes much more effort in the way of aim and could expend an entire magazine before being able accurately hit their target at medium-long ranges, it is severely enraging to find myself targetted and dropped by a bot after immediate, inhuman adjustmentsand  only 2-3 rounds sent my way. This simple gripe would be forgivable in its own right, perhaps it would even be an endearing quality. D.U.S.T. is, after all, intended to be a very hardcore, unforgiving simulation game, however a problem arises when this effect is combined with my other two component gripes with this game: scope of map design and organization of its layout.The design of the map in this game is ambitious, something which I generally admire about this project as a whole. Its 4km x 4km in size, a titantic playing area for a first person shooter, especially one without an established publisher's support. This is something I would generally have considered a positive trait, and something which actually drew me in primarily; but it is also fundamentally flawed considering the overall developmental state the game is currently in, a point which I will further explain after establishing my dependent complaint in the map's organization. The general layout of this map, disregarding its size, is quite good actually. There is a central city, positioned in a ""bowl"" of surrounding hills; American and Russian ""control points"" are tangent to the North and South of the city respectively and factional deployment areas are located within 50-100m of these points. The central city contains a sizable quantity of various buildings and cover elements which the player is allowed to interact with, enter and utilize in avoiding enemy fire. The control points are each composed of a tall building, a surrounding wall, small cover elements, and a water dispensary to fill canteens. The spawns are comprised of a small amount of cleverly placed sandboxes and trucks which allow you to take cover and find your bearings before heading into battle. I am quite fond of each of these elements to be clear, and I'd add that the relative location of each is ideal; however, an unwelcome situation is created when these elements are placed into such a substantially sized map. The size calls for each of these elements to be placed (I'll add that I am not quite sure of the exact distances as I'm unaware to if they've been recorded) seemingly 100s of meters apart from one another. What I would initially consider an adequate, possibly even accomplished, map design becomes exhausting and irritating considering the fundamental mechanics of this game (which I've noted before are a postitive attribute and even a drawing factor to me personally.) You are first deployed in the spawn with an empty canteen and an unadjusted, unloaded rifle. To fill the canteen, you must walk to the water dispensary in the control point area, open your canteen [MMB], turn on the tap [`], close your canteen when its full [LMB], and turn the tap back off [`]; to bring your rifle to a usable state, you need to bring your rifle up [RMB], pull the charging handle [RShift], aim down sights [RMB], adjust your head position relative to your sights [LMB+Mouse movement], and change firing mode to semi or full [Up arrow, Right arrow]. These mechanics are essential to your survival and your abilty to take down hostile targets. They are also refreshing, immersive, involved, and above all else, entertaining. But when these mechanics must be repeated upon each deployment (respawn), they become time-consuming, especially considering the 100m or so journey to the water dispensary, and then the several hundred more meters you must trek to make it into the main town. This repetition is exhausting and takes much too much time away from possible engagements and firefights.In conclusion, I cannot recommend this game, at this point, to anyone. The game simply does not give enough reward to your efforts when adjusting your gear and making it into battle comprise the majority of time spent playing. I would, however, like to specify that most of these points are intrinsic to the stage of development. This game has significant potential and I would love to see where its development leads. I can even forgive all the negative aspects, there is true thought and merit put into each one, and they only become negative due to the lack of synergy between them. I've taken this time to write such a lengthy and detailed review because I believe that it would be simple (although perhaps not without spending a deal of time) to assimilate these seperate parts into a smoother, better-operating machine. The main problem, the gist of my issue with this game lies in its current map size. A playable 4km x 4km landscape is a great goal to set for completion in the later stages of development, but at this point, with the current ""density"" so to speak of the map elements, it is simply to large. My main advice to the development team would be to remove all the elements of the map, save the foundation landscape into a seperate file for optimization at a later date, and place the elements into a more compact landscape, perhaps with more cover in the plains of sand between each distinct map location. Once the elements are more reasonably spaced and condensed, I have a feeling that this game will become much more playable, with the various small grievances becoming insignificant. An optional change which may be of use would be to save the player's rifle adjustments between lives. Although this specific change I'll admit may be detrimental to the games spirit, it could reduce time taken between death and reaching your squadmates, and could create a more inviting atmosphere for groups of players looking for a tactical, squad-reliant shooter. The best option regarding this specific idea may be to allow the player to decide whether they'd like their adjustments saved in the settings.I really do hope that you see this, development team, because I deeply enjoy the fundamentals of this game, and I've only taken the effort to write such a wordy, exploratory review because I love this concept and I'd like to see where you can take it. My lack of recommendation is tied to the current state of the game, and I look forward to when I will be able to recommend this game to every single one of my friends and acquaintances in the near future.

								If you are looking for a playable shooter then at the moment, I would have to say look elsewhere. While I imagine most of the people that have bought this game were expecting that, judging from the in game chat. If you are looking for an ultra realism shooter that is ""playable"" in alpha and want to support its development, then go for it.			"

So far i have seen one bug fix (that is atcually a issue again) with many more that need to be fixed also, a lot of content that has been promised but has yet to come. I think the dev had a great idea (hence why i bought the game) but just isn't producing much if any foward progress on it. I REALY wish i could give this game a thumbs up because it's a great idea but, there's just so little done to it for the time it's been out.Dear devI hope you prove me wrong about this game.			"

								Haven't played D.U.S.T. in a year so I decide to see how far it's come along. Reinstall, start it up, build is dated from January of 2016. Last year. Literally the last time I had played it. Shame, game had a lot of promise, but there's a reason why there was 1 player online (me) when I started it up; because he doesn't update it. Even when he says he will, still nothing. Last developer update he said he would post an update as soon as things are back to normal after server maintenance on the 13-14th of Nov. It's the 24th, no update. Devs: do YOU think a game you never work on is worth $15? It's most certainly not in it's current state, and not as an early access title either if you cannot stick to a schedule and update your game. This does not belong in the Steam store.*UPDATE*Last ""Weekly"" update was 2 months ago, in case you're wondering if this game has been abandoned.			"

								Game has tons of potential. Mechanics are spot on. Only problem is the players. This is NOT Battlefield, or CoD. Look at the damn uniforms and the direction your allies are shooting in before you go full retard and FF your team. This is in a pre alpha state. If you buy it, DO NOT expect a full game. You are supporting the dev. Only downside so far is the 2 min respawn and the broken resume button if you hit the ESC key.  For the sake of getting players accustom to uniforms and preventing FF. Force spawn players in one location. OR, put a red x where a targeting reticle would normally be over allies. It shouldn't be hard to be observant, but gamers have been trained to shoot anything without some ID above them. It's time to unlearn that.			"

D.U.S.T: Unforgiving RealismUnless you insert the full title of the game into Google your not going to get much information, although i have not seen mutch information on this game other than the odd forum post on other game pages saying Arma meets Receiver etc (never played Receiver) the complexity of the game is not for the typical ""Run and Gun"" gamer.This game requires some learning to play, there is no instructions on what you have to do, no back story, and there appears to only be one objective at this time - Capture the FOBs.As i previously mentioned the game is not for your typical run and gun gamer, the reason for this is because you have to operate your firearm and equipment similar to how you would in the real world, you have diferent button combinations to arm your rifle, you have to adjust your sights and you have to ensure you get yourself some water from the closest FOB. if you dont.... well you wont last too long as the map currently in the gamee is HUGE. with no vehicles (for now) it can take some time to get from spawn to the various FOBs.if you are considering getting the game, take this into consideration.How to arm and shoot your gun 101... (spoiler)• press RIGHT SHIFT to pull your charging handle back - to load a round into the chamber• press the UP or RIGHT arrow on your keyboard - to select single or full auto• press and hold both LEFT & RIGHT mouse buttons and move your mouse - to line your sights up• press in the MIDDLE MOUSE wheel - to put your finger on the trigger• while still holding the middle mousse wheel in SCROLL DOWN - to pull the triggerThat my friends is just how you shoot your gun.Conclusion & final ThaughtsThere is a lot of pottential in this game but the target audience is very narrow, mainly for those who enjoy milsim games and want to have that feel of being a hardcore operator, although the gameplay is limited at this time it is a great game to say it is currently being made by a single guy who has so far definatly put out, there is a road map within the game that shoows what features are due to  be implimented and you can see the ccurrent progress of the development which is a real nice touch.all in all i have to give this game, and the developer a 7/10			"

Early Access Review
Pros:Mechanic wise the game feels good, but rough.Sound effects are well made.Lots of in-depth weapon customization planned.Friendly community.Graphics are fine and so is the performance.Cons:Game is very bare and there isn't much content.Sound distance is messed up in 0.2.0.0 and it's not very enjoyable.Steep learning curve if you have no idea of what you're doing.Bugs, bugs everywhere!(Early-Access*cough*)No vehicles(yet), alot of running ahead of you.Conclusion:As of the early-access release patch I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy it if they're looking for a GAME to play, however you like the concept of the game and want to take part in TESTING and help finding bugs then this is definitely for you, plus you may also have something to say when it comes to new mechanics and items.Great game if you enjoy games like Arma, Squad & DayZ, but want the realism turned up a tad more.While the game isn't clunky when you already know all the keybinds and trust me, there's alot of them that you have to remember, it certainly is trial and error for the first few hours,However, this is an early-access title afterall and you have to consider that if you're considering of buying it. Right now, if you just press random buttons you'll eventually end up being stuck on whatever weapon/item you're currently carrying and have to rejoin the server to fix it.Almost every item in the game as of 0.2.0.0 can potentially bug your animation and lock it completely.Why am I recommending the game when it is clearly broken?I have personally been looking for a title like this for a very long time and this is just a bare core-concept of what the game is going to be like when Terapoly starts to update it.Some people may like all the complicated things that you have to do, some may not. Once you get the hang of it, it's not really that complicated.Most of the keybinds are placed in such a way that it makes sense when you know what you're doing, therefor making the learning curve very steep if you have zero knowledge of how a gun work but once you know those things it just makes sense in some way.While I'm only 20'ish hours into the game I've already experience multiple adrenaline rushes.That one second when you're about to engage in a firefight with someone and everything is in slow-motion, you have to know how and what to do with your gun and I guess that is what makes it so satisfying.YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO THINK WHILE PLAYING.In the current state the game isn't about just killing and shooting everyone you see; It's EARLY-ACCES after all.Yes, you can join a server, figure out how to shoot and have fun for a couple of hours, but that's about it, so if you plan on buying it to PLAY it and not TEST it then I'd advise you to look elsewhere until Terapoly pushes out some updates to make the game more stable, because if you try to play it just to play it, you'll  end up quitting before you learn how to shoot your gun because of all the frustrating bugs.As everyone else said please take a tour around Terapoly's forums to better ready yourself before you enter the battlefield of D.U.S.T.Review posted on early-access release version 0.2.0.0 - I'll update it as we get updates for the game.

								The game follows the goals of the developers very well and I understood going into it the amount of control I would have would be realistic. The developers did achieve this but they are limited by the platform they are targeting. I understand how to operate rifles in real life such as those in the game but it simply cannot cross over to the mouse and keyboard platform without dumbing it down. By adding this level of realism to the mouse and keyboard it becomes less realistic in the sense that it does not take that long to load another magazine and hit the bolt catch/pull thee charging handle among other things. This game would be amazing for the VR platform with some sort of hand controls that allow you to mimic holding a rifle but I cannot find enjoyment in it due to the limitations of a mouse and keyboard. I think you guys have a great future for this game but you have to decide fairly soon whether you want to dumb it down or make it a VR compatible game.			"

Sure, you have to make a 10-15 minute trek to find the enemy base, but you can go there, and you can shoot them, and you can kill them.If you're looking for a polished game, look away for now. This game is far from finished.If you're looking for an enjoyable Early Access title, this could be a good one to grab. Price is 20% off until the 26th, and will also steadly increase as the game is updated.If you're looking for a game with fresh, new, fun game mechanics, that are highly realistic, this game is for you.I can't recommend it to play for fun at the moment, but I can recommend that you buy it now while it's cheap, both to keep it for later when it eventually gets more content, and to support the awesome developer.

								Yes I understand that this game is still in development, Yes I understand its in ""alpha"", and yes I understand its being developed by a two man team.All of that aside this game is barely in a playable state, let alone a sellable one.Bugs ignored, the teams are so far apart, most players won't venture out far enough to find combat and if you do the chance of finding enemy is extremely slim. You most likely wont leave your teams spawn alive anyways.Drinking water every five minutes is so over played in video games and im done with it.Why does capturing a base take seven minutes!? Spawning takes 2 minutes?This game is hardly a foundation, so why wouldnt you give us a smaller map and let us have fun? It seems like another example of developers aiming too high from the start. The weapon handling is good, its neat and innovative.... but I dont get to use it due to lack of a practical map development. If this game is to be sucessful for the next year while its under development, they need to give us some form of instant action so that we can A) Enjoy what parts of the game ARE complete, and B) Start testing combat functions.Don't make the player spend $15 on this game, 10 minutes reading the manuals, 15 minutes learning the controls, and then expect them to walk for 20 minutes to the nearest base in hopes of combat to wait for 7 minutes to capture a base.... its alpha, let it be enjoyableIll update my review in a couple of months.

They can make it as realistic as they want but it won't achieve much if no one plays it. Please use left mouse for the trigger. Using the scroll wheel doesn't feel any more realistic than just clicking.

Early Access Review
								I've grown frustrated from seeing D.U.S.T. collect dust in my Library.  I continue to redownload this game with every update, only to be disappointed that hardly anything is getting done.  It's worse than DayZ with their progress.  I understand that there are only 1 or 2 developers, but I regret purchasing this game.  I don't usually do reviews, and this is my 2nd.  Wait to purchase this game.  It'll be a while.  I'm guessing a couple years or more.  They need to hire more developers.  I'm currently in the process of trying to get a refund, but I think it's too late.  Don't be like me.  Wait before you make the purchase, and if you absolutely Have to test it out, then make the purchase, but ask for a refund within a few days.  As for what the game currently offers- realistic equipment handling(full control of firearms, grenades, etc), bots to test your equipment on(you have to run forever to reach their base on the one map this game has), and a sidearm pistol shooting range that is part of a tutorial they are currently working on, but there's no tutorial yet.  You also have a workbench where you can customize an m4a2, and an AK74 or some kind of AK variant.  I forgot, and I'm not redownloading it to find out.  You can put some parts on, and see how they look.  This too is buggy/broken and incomplete.  Whether I get my refund or not, I will come back in a few years and edit this update once the game is playable, and there are other players other than bots playing.  Thanks for taking the time to read and rate this review.			"

								Actually unplayable at times, has potential. felt like the original review was a little to extreme after Ihad only played something like 18 minutes. Went back in and played a bit more.Pros>Attempt at making a realistic weapons handling system which may be kinda cool in the future>Sometimes people try to cooperateCons>2 minute respawns>cant back out of the loadout screen, have to turn the game off in task manager>have to hold mmb and scroll down to shoot>the mouse doesn't appear after you respawn so you can't hit ""Deploy"" againReciever was made in 7 days and was still better than this, but Reciever was made by guys that had been experienced with making♥♥♥♥♥♥before.

								The game is great. It has a very good physics engine making the ballistics very fun. It will become more intricate as more variables are introduced in terms of wind direction and humidity. For now the gameplay is fairly limited, however, I would recommend this game to anyone interested in military shooters with realist ballistics.			"

								TL/DR:-Abandonware-Rarely see a player with more than 2+ Hours into it-Overpriced-Developers hate their consumers-Developers don't communicateFor those of you with patience:Alright so I'm going to start by saying this: This game has amazing potential, it really does. I've experienced the development grind before, it sucks and it often feels like your consumers don't appreciate the little things that, frankly, took a very long time to get to work correctly. I get that. But don't promise us the world when you can't even give us a run-down grange managed by a half-insane cat lady.I bought this game with the full understanding that it was in early development, I can't blame anyone but myself for purchasing it. I have to be honest though, I've about given up on it. I have to say I feel cheated. $15 could benefit a kickstarter where the developers actually give a damn about their player base, and I wish I had just done that... because I honestly don't get a vibe from the two lads at Terapoly that they'll ever get anything done.  If you buy this game be aware: you MIGHT put two hours into it, playing around with your sights and interacting with the interesting and immersive dynamics. If that's worth $15 to you, then go ahead. Just be prepared to come to your library one day and find a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ racing game in place of the military sim you purchased. The developers will change genre, without even coordinating with one another. Insomniac didn't even know that Peter had spontaneously changed genres, there is no communication between the two so I would be shocked if they actually are doing anything more than releasing more empty promises:http://steamcommunity.com/app/353690/discussions/0/361798516965150563/^^ Completely oblivious to the fact that Peter had announced a complete change in genre, which, to be frank, is extremely frustrating to me. I invested in a military simulator, not another early-access survival game that will never see fruition. As is, I doubt this game will get off the ground, or even out of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hanger. The thing that bugs me the most is knowing how excited I was to see this game develop, but seriously, the developers are completely ignorant to the fact that they are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in the faces of all of their consumers.If you boys at Terapoly get serious, I'll retract everything I've said about this, because it really does have potential, and with the right love it could be an absolutely fantastic game. You two are talented as hell, just stop getting our expectations up and don't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t us, we will appreciate you so much more if you could just do that.			"

								D'you know what? DUST isn't realistic.Yeah, I said it.What to say...? Dust is extremely disappointing. It's a multiplayer-only game with no community... Which is understandable for an Early Access game. However, the servers won't start without a minimum number of players, which makes the game unplayable. Entirely.Add to that a complete lack of educational elements and a control system MIRED with bad design choices (Say what you will, but clicking and then rolling back a scroll wheel is NOT a realistic representation of pulling a trigger.. It's just deliberately -awkward- in a misguided attempt to generate artificial difficulty. What's wrong with pushing a button to simulate pushing a button?!) and you get a fairly unplayable game... And I realise I have no right to complain about bugs in an EA game, but the combination of a complete absence of an 'escape' menu in-game and a four minute respawn time make dealing with one of the many game-breaking issues when a server IS available an exercise in frustration and delays.Oh, and the only map is a giant desert with no cover save for a large, poorly textured compound that seems to be designed exclusively to generate spawnkills. I'm sure there'll be other maps eventually, but still... This is what you're paying for now.Ugh. If this is realism, I want to go back to Quake.			"

								I love this game.  This game makes you think.  Most games you just press R to reload, but in this game you have to drop your magazine, pick up a new one, insert it, and hit the bolt release or use the charging handle.  I really like how you fire the weapon.  It forces you to take your time to make accurate shots.  This game has a lot of potential.  Currently the problems I have are respawning.  The only way I was able to respawn was to exit the game, start it up again, and join the server.  It is a little annoying, but when you get used to the controls, and if you can look past the respawn issue you can have a lot of fun.  There isn't much in the game yet, but everything in it so far works well, and I can only imagine the possibilities with more support.			"

Once you know the controls it is faily simple to play.As the concept itself, it does a good job on representing firearms handling, I havent found enough people in a server to start a firefight yet, so I don't know what that will be like.As I said, this game is JUST in alpha so dont expect it to be polished.In all, its a pretty fun concept with its basic games mechanics at the moment and i look forward to future developmentsOh, and also...

								D.U.S.T. is a MILSIM-themed, realistic first person combat simulator; note me refraining from the word 'SHOOTER' as this game is not of the genre CoD and Battlefield are in.It does require an adept understanding of firearm operations and is not recommended for anybody under the mental age of 18.Let me get to the pros and cons:Cons:-Background does not fit with the map-'Interesting' AI behaviour.-Lacking some basic attachments.-No gear customizationNOTE: These cons will most likely be fixed in an update as these cons are created by the game being early access; thus meaning one cannot complain.Pros:-F**king decent graphics for a game in like Alpha 0.3-Better than ArmA for gunplay and ballistics simulation-Feels more realistic than ArmA-More realistic than real life-No out-of-combat/Global VON meaning the person you just shot cannot vent his rage unto you.-Canteen/Hydration feauture-Very solid game, minimal bugs - those discovered are quickly fixed.-Legendary developer; probably the friendliest dev I've seen in my life.Final Verdict:Solid game with great, great potential but a worryingly small playerbase. I think this game could grow to be better than upcoming titles such as 'Escape From Tarkov' if done right; however more people need to play this game to ensure its potential is forfilled.Would I recommend this game?♥♥♥♥ yes. 9.5/10.Final Note:Review is likely to become obsolete due to updating of the game, but don't let that deter you from buying it.

								It's a good concept, and it functions just as advertised, but as of right now, it's barely a game. First off, the game dropped me in with no instruction but a mostly incomplete controls sheet. The ""field manuals"" were nowhere to be found on the store page or the game's website. I had to look up a youtube tutorial to figure out how to sight in and fire my gun. By the time I was able to operate my gun and start making my way around the map, I started getting a weird visual distortion effect. I figured out that I was dying of thirst and needed to get my canteen out. When I finally found the number (7) to equip it, it took me another 2 minutes to actually open it and take a drink. It follows the same weird and unintuitive scroll-wheel system that the guns use to open it, take a drink, and close it. I was only able to take 1 drink, which halfed the distortion, and then it appeared that my canteen was empty. 5 minutes later I was dead.I'm sure that all of these seemingly broken features and empty canteens actually work, and have some sort of obscure keybind or scrollwheel manipulation technique that gets them to, but it seems like every little function in this game warrants it's own youtube tutorial. I would give this game a thumbs up if it had any sort of training system or even a set of tips to help a normal person play the game, but at this stage, that doesn't exist. Give this one a few development stages before you go after it, unless you are content with confusing controls and bad keybinding systems.			"

								""Pulling the trigger on a real M16 in Iraq is easier than pulling the trigger in this game."" There's realism, and then there's making things intentionally convoluted and difficult just so you can claim it's realism. It's a half-decent concept, all this 'Arma keybindings on meth' nonsense, but it'll come back to haunt them if they keep it up. This game doesn't look like it's going anywhere anyways. I could be wrong, but steer clear for now. Choose Insurgency or SQUAD instead.			"

(11B 7th Keep up the Fire Manchus!). I honestly like the time it takes to change mags and looking down the scope and firing a round off isn't just point and click. You have to take ur time, line up the shot, and squeeze the rounds off.. Awesome in my book! Yes, it needs work. Yes, there's a learning curve.. but, as long as the servers stay active and the dev keeps updating, then this is a must have for milsim players.			"

								I really enjoy the direction of the game. It not only holds potential to be what all true realism seekers have sought after but its revolutionary mechanics that have yet to be touched by any game developer is what truly makes it stands out.Yes the game does need some work but this is expected for an Early Access game worked on by one Developer and one Admin. There are some current issues (other than bugs) that need to visisted (primarily team killing) but these are obstacles that can be tackled together by community, individual player and the Developers of the game. The Game should not be mistaken for a twitch shooter. This is not a CoD or BF game. Nor does this game display elements of PR or Squad. The level of control one has over their rifle is mindblowing. Took me a while to figure out how my rifle is operated (Thought the game was broken, Game was not broken). I had to read the Field Manual on their site( highly reccomend you do) to figure out my Rifle. But I expect no Real Soldier masters his weapon over a period of 1 week let alone 10 minutes. I intend to try out the Radio and attempt to get a proper team/squad going.Enjoyed the game and will definitely follows its progress and for now this will be my go-to fix for any type of shooting.

								Definately a WIP but I firmly believe that the game has solid promise. As a guy whose played milsim games for the past 3 years or so, I believe that this game has its place in the milsim/realism community and, if developed well, might revolutionize the way relisim is conducted. Yes it has its bumps and glitches now and many of them make the game pretty uninteresting to play (i.e. running for 10 minutes to get to the objective before you can even fight) but I think that gives the game legitimacy for the realism that it is striving for and will (hopefully) achieve. Peter (the solo dev) is highly responsive and seems to have a liegitimate interest in making this game excel.TLDR; Pretty slow at the moment and needs to be finished but has promise and the dev is a really nice guy and shows interest in finishing his game.

								As of right now this game is just not worth 16$   20min in you realize that the controls are not set up in a way that flows well so doing any simple task like filling a canteen takes way more thought and effort than it should.     i would love for this game to do well and will continue to follow its progress but unless the devs rethink what they are doing this game will fail.    I think a few changes like not using the mouse wheel as a trigger, and relying less on keybinds that are scattered across the keyboard with no obvious planning by making things clickable and drag-able would really improve this game and make the gameplay flow.    I get this game is meant to be difficult and require thought and practice to be good at but you dont need to think about 5 keybinds to move your face closer to a scope in real life so why should you in a game aiming to be ""realistic""    Hopefully in a few months i will be able to come back and give this game a thumbs up but for now it just doesnt deserve it.

Early Access Review
								DISCLAIMER: This game IS Early Access, as in VERY early access. There ARE many bugs, weird issues, and wonky UI to work around. There ARE often teamkillers in spawn and the first outpost, and there are not that many people playing at the moment.That out of the way, this game looks really promising. For several reasons:1. The concept is REALLY cool! And what's here right now matches the concept pretty well. You need to load a round into the chamber (left shift), take the safty off (down arrow), and then pull the trigger (in a much more interesting way than normal: press and scroll back on the middle mouse button). And that's just the gun. You also need to use a water bottle to stay hydrated in the desert, move your head to be in line with the sights, and you will most likely die on the second (if not the first) shot that hits you.2. The community (aside from the teamkillers) is pretty helpful. Everyone's new to the game, but people who understand the controls will often respond to questions posed in the chat on what to do to get playing. And there's a lot of questions asked in chat...3. (side note) The teamkillers (in my experience) generally just hang around the team spawn, and sometimes the first outpost. All I've had to do to generally avoid them is to sprint away as soon as I spawn, fill up my canteen, and head for one of the three middle bases to start capping the flags.4. The map is HUGE! I've still never made it to the enemy spawn, because it's at least a 5-10 minute sprint away. That walled tower everyone sees when they spawn is just the first outpost. If you go over the hill behind it, you'll see a huge valley with three unique bases, each of which has a flag to cap. (And yes, the flags work, they just take a REALLY long time to come down).5. The devs have been decently transparent about what's been happening, and have stated they plan to release some patches very soon (like within the week, as of 10/21/15)So, conclusion? If you're willing to take the effort to learn how to work with your equipment, and work around the bugs in a very early access game, then go ahead! Pick up a copy and try it! The devs have only been working on this for about 6 months, as a 2 person team, so the state the game is in right now is actually pretty impressive.If you aren't willing to deal with issues that an Early Access game is bound to have (not going to go on a rant...), don't buy it. Yet. Definitly look into buying it at some point. But don't give it a bad review quite yet, when you've already been warned by this and other reviews.Two last notes: If you don't like the 120 second respawn timer? Reloging doesn't take that long (about 30-50 seconds, maybe), and you may have to relog anyway on account of glitches.If you want a game to try that incorporates similar realistic physics and gun handling, try the (albeit singleplayer) game ""Reciever"".

								This game, is by far one of the best games i have played in a while. I personally like it more than arma 1-3 and every other military shooter. The game is very realistic by that i kean, Dehydration, one shot kills, adjust optics, check chamber etc. The game may take a little bit to get used to, dont listen to all these bad reviews by all these Call of duty players who dont know realistic shooter games for  s***t. This game is amazing. Near a must buy, and the DEV is extremely friendly and talkative with the community. Give this game a chance, dont join then keave because you dont know how to shoot. Get to know the game. This game has great potential and i cant wait to see it grow :D			"

								The game seems alright for an alpha build, and I feel like it meets its expectations for having a very unforgiving realism factor. On the other hand, operation of the firearms feels very clunky and buggy, especially when it comes to pulling the trigger. Maybe if the trigger ""pulling"" feature was taken out and a simple left click was added, it would make the game a lot easier.Also, the scopes are completely bugged out and might not even be see through most of the time.All in all, these limiting factors are being worked on and I do understand that is is under heavy development.

								I like the idea of this game but as of right now I think everyone should know that right now there is no way to play this game outside of multiplayer. That is a problem because no one is playing the multiplayer and you can't even load in to a map to run around by yourself with out at least one other person in the game. Add in to that the fact that you need to alt-tab out of the game to quit and you have something that just is not there yet. It think this is a great idea for a game and I want it to be better but right now it is just not at a level that is worth paying for.			"

								Note*: This are the pros and cons that I feel have not been addressed in previous reviews, although I have not read every single past review.Pros-Realsitic Weapons Simulator-If you get enough players, mp can be fun-Realistic supression-Logistics such as water important(more features to be added)-Spawn protection(kinda)-Anyone who is serious about guns, or has used one will enjoy(except there is no gas block function yet, so you do not see the bolt return)-Devs are easy to work with, and gladly take suggestions. In fact they have their own TS for buyers to talk to them and play the game.-Can run on a medium-low end comupter.ConsIT IS AN EARLY ALPHA MONETARY SUPPORT DOES HELP!-No gas block simulation(bit disapointing, but in heat of comabt usually goes unoticed)-In this early stages so there is currently only one map which makes for good comabt.-Camo's and graphics need to be updated(not bad, just not a finished product~see screenshots)-2 man dev team not totally focused on this game, gaps in update releases.-Servers are sometimes populated, but mostly filled with botsAfter reading some of the pros and cons I have listed I would like to voice my opinion. I ABOLUTELY RECOMMOMEND YOU GET THIS GAME. H O W E V E R, if you do not have spare money to spend I don't recommend you get this game if you want instanteous enjoyment. I believe this game has potential and requires you to stick through thick and thin. Buying this game is an investment in the future of First Person PC shooters. And, I believe with the help of a focused dev team and monetary incentive, this game can become as big as Verdun. Cheers to the whole steam communtiy.			"

								Currently this game has no real objective, not much content. With that said, this game is headed in the right directions. Things that people have complaints about like how reduntant the weapon system can be, have been answered in a livestream with Youtuber, BlueDrake42. He is planning on making it much simpler, yet with full control and if you take a look at the road map, you'll find what he is planning on realising and it's looking pretty great. Keep an eye out for the progress of the game and don't hurry and buy it if you only want things to do. Because there isn't much really. On the other hand, if you want to help this project out you can most definitely help improve the game by finding bugs and things to improve upon.			"

								The game is in Early Access so be aware of what you are getting into before buying in.That said potential is what this game has, and lots of it. operating weapons and equipment is a bit more involved than any other shooter but theres a lot of satisfaction to be found in the sometimes confusing controll scheme. You will most likely get team killed a few times before you figure out how the controlls work so check the D.U.S.T. Forums and read thorugh the Field Manual threads to learn a bit about the game before jumping in.In the current early state of the game there isn't mucht that can be done and some of the fetures are bugged right now, but the Dev is good at keep the comunity up to date. A new patch is coming soon and they're working on isolating team killers. I really hope they do somthing about the 2 minute spawn time aswell. I see what they're going for with the timer but it really doesn't add to the game.I think that if the community does its job of pointing out bugs and the Dev stays on course, this could end up being a really great mil sim.It's definately worth a look but early access might not be for everyone.

Early Access Review
								Game is pretty nice as far a certain aspects go.  It has some big bugs which need to be addressed, such as being teamkilled, waiting 2 minutes to spawn and then not being able to spawn. The execution on firing weapon is way to complicated and cumbersome. That is, you have to hold middle mouse button down to put finger in trigger well, then scroll down to fire, all while holding right mouse button down to aim. Realistically you put your weapon on Fire when you intend to pull the trigger and kill, here its a deed to put on the fire mode you want, you just leave it on fire, I understand wants realism, but keybinds dont make it viable for quick access.Player base full of Trolls, spawned killed 10+ times in just the 1.8 hours I played with maybe 5 people online. Love the concept. Like the immersion. Hate the players. Needs some work and has potential of being a great game. I would recommend buying it now at the discounted price, otherwise wait a few more weeks and hope for the best. "

								After playing it for a short while I am ready to give my impressions.I will present them in a + - list. I will try to avoid crritisizing things that are obviously WIPFirst off, most negative reviews seem to be dorf syndrome - people reacting negatively to the difficulty/learning curve rather than actual problems.+atmosphere is there - two factions fighting in a barren desert for water. There is a lot of empty space between each area and it's quite... comfy-some clunky controls that are there just for sake of inconveniencing - EG having to unscrew and rescrew cap for the canteen, open/close the lid of a compass. The animations are a bit too slow. While the slow speed of using equipment can be a great gameplay mechanic, I don't think it is a good idea to make it frustrating and annoying to use. There's nothing you can do with a closed compass or a closed canteen. Having an extra closed states serves no function other than a filler. It's like having a scene in a movie which does not evolve the characters or drive the plot forward - just useless filler you're better off cutting.-/+Lack of generic interaction key - operating taps on water drums requires you to use two keys to close and open it. There's no reason it could not be done with one key. Unless developers are planning to use two interaction keys as part of gameplay+never before seen control over your firearm - sure it's a bit clunky(mostly since we can't rebind controls yet) but once you get used to it its miles ahead of Receiver. +lack of UI - this makes game both more immersive and interesting since you have to look at the object to know it's state. EG wether a magazine is full or empty.  I do hope however, that we will see an ""inventory"" where you can see how many items you have left and repack magazines-loadout screen is a bit basic - could use the ability to configure what goes into each item slot(pouch)+vast scale of map - despite being large (Project Reality scale) it isn't painful to traverse on foot. Moving to an objective only takes a few minutes and you can use that time to keep an eye on it.+implementation of water - I do hope this stays at near central importance as of gameplay, since the idea of two ragged armies fighting over basic resources and for their survival sounds a lot more appealing than  generic milsim with two well supplied armies+large servers and no matchmaking +weapon customisation - you can select optics, barrels, foregrips, muzzle devices, stocks and triggers+bold and avant garde approach to weapon controls and firing mechanics - trying to change something that's been standard to the genre since it's birth is admirable. And it works!Overall it's pretty bared bones now, buggy, not juicy and poorly animated. It still is something new and different.Hope developers don't ditch this game 20% into the development like most others. "

A few team killers, who don't seem to get punished right now for Team killings us.3. 120 seconds of respawn time is too long, we give us easily on the game because of that long wait. For starters since many of us are trying to learn the game, can you please reduce the spawn time to 5 seconds? (Example I Accidentally killed my self with live grenade, or a team willer killing us each time we spawn.....= No fun )thanks, "

Right now there is no objective at the momment just an open area to run around and interact with said firearm.

								I've served 6 years in the US Air Force, and even though most services are down us for not being a ground combat oriented branch, we still have to learn how to handle a service rifle. This game takes all of the knowledge and tidbits of working the AR platform and over complicates the process by making the simple action of firing a chore. If it was this hard to ready a weapon and fire, less people would be killed by accident. Maybe in time I can say to purchase this game and have a blast, but at the moment just by ARMA 3. It's as real as you want it to be but way more intuitive as well.			"

								*PRIOR WARNING-THIS GAME IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. IT IS NOT A BASIC SHOOTER LIKE COD, IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THAT TURN THE OTHER WAY* Now, onto my review: My review for this game is very simple. It's not simple at all. This game was not made, at least in my opinion, for the masses. I don't expect this game to be as large as say Planetside, but at the same time I don't expect this to be as small as Red Sabre. This game is a moderate game created with one particular gamer in mind, the simulator. I'm talking the people who take more than a tutorial in game to learn how to operate things to the most realistic fashion. People who play DCS and Train Simulator, people who are trying to live a life they don't currently live or may never live. The problem is that it's hard to sell a simulator on a gaming platform, and that I understand. I don't expect everyone to like this game nor do I expect people to want to learn how to comprehend this game. You'll know exactly whether or not you'll want this game by reading the forums and reviews. Don't give this a shot if you THINK you'll enjoy it, because chances are you won't and you'll get a refund. But if you're someone who wants to take MilSim to a level that isn't quite hit yet (I'm including ARMA) then invest and help develop this outstandingly brave simulator.			"

								Barebones still, but there is a great deal of potential. Could do with arma style headmovement, possibly by shifting some of the weapons controls from the mouse -  though I really am charmed by the complex weapon management. My advice would actually be to drop the price even farther, to get a playerbase started, then once you've hit a number of sales, say 1000, put the price back up. It's nowhere near worth even the current sale price, though I do really like it. I just can't imagine I'm likely to be playing it any time soon, as theres no players online. So, yeah. Also, bots are essentially useless - might as well turn them off.			"

I then spent awhile trying to figure out how to throw a grenade only to find there is multiple pins and couldn't figure out how to pull the second. I gave up and returned to my rifle. Then I googled the controls and how to fire a single round. Firing by pressing the middle mouse then scrolling is a pain. I then became dehydrated 2 minutes into the game and found someone so I shot a guy standing there while enemies came up to him. It said I killed a friendly so I turned to the other guy that had a different outfit on and killed him. I then went to jail where I decided to call it quits.Maybe if there were actual people that played this game it would be fun...			"

								Well has not really had any progress in a year. It was a two man team, but it has sense fallen to one. They thought it would be a good idea to make two games at once. and have sense become burned out, and i do not belive this game will ever leave early access imho. And that is a crying shame as this had the ablity to become something great.			"

								VERY dissapointing upon early access launch, outside of 2 servers (US and EU) i couldnt join either since I'm from Aus. No big deal right? i went to training to atleast familiarise myself with controls but that isnt working either (stil WIP there).So what can you actually do in early access if you dont get a spot on one of the two servers? Nothing.I do not reccomend in its current state as an early access, i understand that it is very early days, and while it looks cool ill be requesting a refund and watching this game from a distance with high hopes, maybe ill buy it upon release when i can actually play it. Hopefully oneday.			"

								Here is the FM (Field Manual), read it before you buy, save the Devs some headache:http://www.terapoly.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?fid=3So, as of 1100PM PSTThis game is in early alpha. VERY early.As it sits, there are only 2 servers, no training, and controls that have a steep learning curve. The firing mechanics take getting used too, positioning the head of the player, focusing/ turning on the optic, racking the bolt, and switching off safe to fire. It a great concept. I love realisitic shooters, and this game definitely has promise!			"

It still needs a little bit of polishing but either way, I see a lot of future potential maybe even military training!At the moment the game only has 2 servers, 1 map, 1 character look, 2 weapons and some basic interaction with the firearm, but there is still a lot to look forward to!Good job Peter a.k.a The creator of this game!!!

It is an Early Access game that has a hug amount of potential. The core mechanics that are already in the game are amazing such as complete manipulation over all the tools and weapons you are given.

This has a potential to be a good game, but please add a tutorial. Perhaps have a tutorial set in a gun range? That way new players will learn how to shoot, move, equip ect. and also be able to sight in their new gun. But please please please do not just drop in new players in a game where you have to do 3 or 4 different controls just to do  simple action.			"

								Once you get used to the controls, this game is pretty solid. it took me a couple of hours and some help from the steam forums and now i just wish there would be more people playing this game. i believe there is great potential here and i cant wait for the future updates/completionwhat initially attracted me to dust was the ""realism "" aspect as that is one of my favorite styles in shooters. here you will have to pull the charging handle to load a round into the chamber, remove safety, select firing mode and then using and odd feature or mechanic as were you use the mmb to place finger on ""trigger"" then scroll down while pressed to ""pull trigger"" and shoot...and because of that i think that gaming mice with extra buttons really help here.all in all i like this game's intentions and hope that my recommendations may bring in more players that are willing to be patient as they will be rewarded with a realistic and fun experience			"

Why?! its alpha?!- press the trigger with MOUSEWHEEL?! I have done a lot of reallife rifle shooting drills. When trained you dont think about trigger pull. Trigger should be mouse1 click, way to awkward and stupid to use mousewheel.- when 1 player on server waiting for others to join you cannot quit!?!?! Always be able to disconnect?! maybe a console at least?! current state you need to ALT+F4 quit the game to disconnect?!- Single player AVAIBLE TO LEARN THE CONTROLS ETC NOT GETTING SHOT?!?!- why woud you like the optic not to be centered?!	- IRL OPTICS ARE DESIGNED TO GET THE WHOLE VIEW FIELD OF THE BALLISTIC MARKINGS!!!....

								At this stage there only one way to describe D.U.S.T. and that is not good. I understand that it is still in early access but it is simply unplayable as soon you spawn into a game you are killed by probably a teammate as spawning near enemies would be just stupid. So you cannot even learn how to play the game because the only way to play is to go online which is just insane. Even the ability to create an “online” match for yourself to just learn how to play the game would be better.I will defiantly updating this when the game is fully released.			"

								Games not playable, and not like broken or hard to understand.Only 64 people in the us can play right now.64 total, guess what they all already are.No training, no bots, no server creation, aka no game.Shame Ill come back around when there is a game here to play, and my advice folks, consider this like a donation for a game in a few months.

								UPDATE::: So now the server is up but there terrible. You spawn in and get killed by your own team mates. Especially with 2 minute wait inbetween .Cant even get into a game. Says players need to read a manuel before play, well where in the hell is that? Some of the menu buttons are un responsive. Cant join EU servers either, and US are full. Iv waited a long time for this, and the communication with the devs were terrible throughout the develpment. This has dissapointed me so far			"

								This is a terrible game, you will not be able to actually play the game once you download it because the devs only provided one working server and its fully capped.  You should wait to buy and probably avoid.  If you want to play a bad game, there are so many better choices.			"

Early Access Review
								Bloody fun game, it does take a small amount of problem solving skills to figure everything out but it took me less than a minute to figure out the main aim shoot reload etc. my main problem is that i am in Australia and there are currently no servers here so i have to put up with 200+ ping when i connect. can't wait for you guys to get the training up and running and get the bolt action rifle out because i would very much love to use the bolt action rifle and the vehicles. Anyway, in my perasonal opinion i like this game, it would be better if there were more servers and people whio [play other than bots and a little more instrution ingame like how to fill your canteen with H2O since i died from that sadly XD i highly reccomend this game for a realistic gameplay and a whole load of fun. that's just my opinion so get the game and give it a go yourself. bugs will obviously only be fixed over time and same with more content and that is all it needs. thank you for such a fun and in depth game :)			"

								DUST is actually rather accurate, more so than ARMA (but we know that's just DayZ now).Pros:+Realistic Military Operations+Accurate to life -- You have to adjust sights, charge the gun, and even drink from a canteen if you live that long.+Large scale battles in a large mapCons:-Confusing controls -- While the game gets simple as you start to play it more, the issue lies in most new players with the controls. Many expect ""Oh left mouse is shoot"" no. It's more than that. You have to charge the gun with right-shift, then you can shoot by holding your mouse wheel down and scrolling back. Do so gently as the sudden surprise of recoil could waste your whole clip. And middle mouse is used alot, such as to drink, or look through the binoculars.-Lack of variety -- You only get two guns, one for each team. While you can customise them, there isn't much else. No side arms, no rifles. Yes, you do get grenades, but you're dead by the time you throw one usually.I still recommend this game as it has potential. Do your best work, Peter!			"

								Killed a team mate got sent to jail for 500+ seconds 10/10 would murder again. On to my real review. For early acsess alpha this game is not too bad. Yes it lacks many features but thats what an alpha is. Gameplay can be smooth and fast paced or it can be slow and dull depending on server population but the game has a server with bots. Good for practicing as half the time they just randomly shoot at walls. Fun to play with friends or solo if your into playing alone like i am. Buy this if you can handle alpha games if not i would wait a little longer before purchase. Gun mechanics, dehydration, compass, water canteens, radios and MMB and scrolling down to fire. Some will love it some will hate it. as the game updates and progresses ill be adding to this review.			"

								Not recommended IF: You are expecting a completed game. Recommended IF: You like the idea of this game, don't mind it being (quite) rough around the edges, and want to support the development of this game. I am glad I bought it, as I would like to see it developed further. Overall, the controls are clunky- but if you read the guides it's not very difficult. The game is easier for me to play with a steam controller than it is with KB+M.Pros: - More depth to reloading and operating your weapons. Reloading is not just a click and wait. Did you save a round in the chamber?- Graphics options are not bad.- Customizing your weapon is cool (though somewhat limited)- Large Map- Fun multiplayer when there are people to play with- Recoil Effects and shooting is a blast.- Going to jail for Team Killing really makes you want to identify your targets correctly and helps deal with trolling.Cons: - Map is empty and lacks diversity- Player movement is very 0 / 1 feeling... clunky.- Animations need work- In-Game sounds need work- Basic tasks are not straight-forward enough. ( ~ + 7 + MMB + hold R + left click + ~ to fill water bottle) In game tutorial would help.- Bullet ballistics do not seem ... very complex. It hits the reticle pretty much without any adjustment.- the AI seems VERY dumb. They just stand there, or just stand there and shoot.- Only two weapons, one for each side.What I would like to see is more fluid movement, a smaller, more dense map with less bots (or none)... basically CQB designed for ~8-32 players. Also, make the gun float around the screen to require the use of iron sights / scopes... otherwise however you adjust your head --> sights... it always will shoot at the center of the screen.  TLDR: I look forward to seeing how this game develops. Buy if you want to support the development. In it's current state, it's not worth what you pay for it, but it has a lot of potential... and is worth it if the developer puts some more love into it! I am happy with the purchase.			"

								There's already a lot of positive feedback about this game, so I'll keep it short and sweet.-Pros-The game has insane potential.It's gun mechanics are REAL! Reloading takes a little bit of effort, and hopefully we'll get malfunctions as well occasionally.It's only 15 dollars for a game that when finished could be a smash hit among the ARMA community.Teaches people about gun mechanics if they don't already know.Dev is actually a really good guy, as apposed to most.-Cons-It's lacking content, but it's also in early access.It takes like 10 minutes to learn all of the buttons.Lack of community which can also be attributed to early access.Other players will kick your♥♥♥♥♥until you're used to the controls and gain fluidity.-Overall-Amazing game, and I can see it being a smash hit if it continues on it's current design path.

								If I could give this title a ""maybe"" I would.  I'm going to upvote it for now, because I think it's really unfair to review it at this point, and I think as gamers we tend not to revisit products we saw that had mixed and negative ratings. Be forewarned:  I would only pick this title up if you want to support the dev's vision of the game and you want to be an active tester.  At this stage, I'm not sure I'd even call it in an alpha-state.  Right now I'd suggest following this game for a while if, and only if, you are looking for a more in-depth treatment of shooting.  Slower even then ARMA.  If you watch live combat footage then you start to see similarities between it and this game.  There is a significantly slower pace to combat, and initially it will shock casual shooter players, because the mechanics require you to do more than left click to shoot and tap R to reload.  It's slightly awkward at first, but once you get used to the keypresses needed to operate your weapon or supporting gear, it isn't too bad.  Right now there isn't a whole lot to shoot but bots, and not a whole lot to tinker with on the gun bench.  I'm sure that will all come in time.  How much time?  Considering it's a two man dev team, and their roadmap is somewhat ambitious, perhaps two years to release?			"

Even without a sidearm, sniper rifle, vehicles, various maps  you can have a lot of fun shooting long range and even mid to short if you enjoy iron sights. THIS DEVELOPER NEEDS AND DESERVES SUPPORT TO CONTINUE THIS ONE OF A KIND PROJECT ! - bolt action rifle is coming with the next update ;)     EDIT AT 12th of April 2017 > ""Developer"" seem to be a lazy guy, not honest with his clients. He is using early acces for learning/experimenting and funding his needs. Steam should have a backup plan in these situations, not just drop the bomb on clients, this is virtual a virtual asset but payed with real ca$h. Unresponsive devs should be banned from curent and future publishing, cashing in from steam and/or steam related platforms . IS SAD !			"
