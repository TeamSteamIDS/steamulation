												Don't normally write reviews, however. As a sight impaired PC user, games have to be pretty easy to use. ie no minute details, simple uncomplicated game play and engaging. Yes this games has bugs, the graphic FPS needs looking at and the physics are on the odd side to say the least. However, for me, it's engaging and fun. It fulfills lots of the things I will never be able to do as I am disabled.I will never be know the joy of what it is like to operate a tower crane or an excavator for the fear of death on a moassive scale. I will also never be allowed to drive a lorry at break neck speed, through a city, fully loaded with the earth I have just loaded. Lets face it, It would be silly to even let me near one, let alone ask me to transport big sets of football stadium flood lights.... So yeah, I rate this game, it has issues that are being ironed out, it's engaging and fun. If you like that sort of thing.... Which I do... fricking lorry's, excavators n concrete mixers! Whats not to like.....			"

												What a plesant surprise!In brief, great gameplay for a simulator, brilliant teamplay on multiplayer with little lag, some physic glitches but good reset buttons so they are not impossible to get out of.Pros;Great range of real machineryGood reward and purchase systemInteresting varied missionsModding and mission editorFun 4 player multiplayer coop modeNo lag in multiplayer, even when I was playing on server opposite side of the worldYou can save your multiplayer gamesEasy reseting of vehicles if accidently glitchedGreat easy explination system for every vehicles controls, so learning curve is nice.Cons;No LAN gameplay modeCan glitch if you ram in to something to harsh, or at an odd angle or position.Terrian graphics aren't as good as they could be, they are nicely done but not exactly cutting edge, although vehicles are lovely.Conclusion. If your a simulator fan, this is a must buy. If you aren't much of a simulator fan, then it is still worth having a go.On a side note, you can kick people from your servers, so more unlocked servers would be great, as it will still keep team play going.There is someone on here reviewing saying the small digger arm doesnt dig, doesn't raise lower, well it does work fine for me, and they tell you how to do it on the easy key guide.

YouTube™ Video: Review| Construction Simulator 2015 

			Views: 38,996		

			Join me for a first look at a Construction Simulator,which in my humble opinion fully deserves the name; Construction Simulator 2015. Music during Timelapse NoCopyrightSounds, We Upload. You Listen.		

Let me say one thing from right of the bat, there are some flaws with the game physics. Especially if you run into other traffic you will see some flying going on. However, I have to say in my humble opinon this Construction Simulator is the first one that deserves the name. There is a ton of machinery to discover and everything is nicely simulated with a ton of functions. The contol input with a keyboard and mouse is confusing and can not be recomended. If you do have a Xbox controller use it, it will make it so much easier, or you can go the extra mile and use two joysticks. That makes it very immersive.Overall I have to say I think this game is really worth it's money and a step from the laughable towards a serious take on Construction work and the many facettes that play within.

												As I'm writing this, I've played this game 700 hours and I've enjoyed every minute of it.It's hard to think of a better value for the money. No game is perfect, but this one has just the right recipe for me.In addition, a year after release the devs are still very attentive, cranking out updates, bug fixes and DLC. They have also released editing tools and tutorial videos for the modding community.I've seen negative reviews written by people who played only a few hours, were stumped by some problem outside the game (computer or network problems, most often game controller problems) and had no patience to try to make it work for them. I use two full-size joysticks, a steering wheel and pedals, with no problem whatsoever. All these devices are 10 years old and my computer is 6 years old.I've also seen complaints by people with unrealistic expectations. While CS2015 is not a perfect technical simulator (what do you expect, it is based on the Unity engine), it is realistic enough that it WILL help you with real-life operation. For example, I sometimes use excavators in real life, and playing this game with two full-size joysticks helps me maintain and improve my dexterity. Also, it is not focused on simulating a single machine, but rather a broad range of them.But simulation is not the core of this game. Having fun building, driving, operating machines is what it's about, especially in multi-player sessions, which are where the game shines. Some players have complained that there is too much driving, too much delivery. These people obviously have never observed a real-life construction site. It's all about delivering materials when needed and setting them in place with machines. That is what the game does. Running around hammering nails would make a very boring game. "

												Ok... so since this game is getting mixed reviews, and MOST of the gameplay vids I could find were all some variation of the same job/mission/equipment, I thought I'd throw a writeup together that could actually offer some fresh insights.What is this game?The gameplay is mostly doing actual construction. By that I mean, you essentially take various vehicles (flatbeds, dump trucks, cement mixers etc) and drive them from the job site, to the necessary materials dealer. There you purchase the materials, load up with a forklift, or some other medium, and transport them back to the job site. At the job site, you will perform a specific task, that can be tedious/dull/etc. OR, it can be exactly what you're hoping it will be. Allow me to elaborate.With the mini excavator for example. You're often assigned a task of digging a small trench. As you may expect... this takes time. It's quite repetitive, but it is in fact digging, which is a component of construction, and frankly... a feature that many of you should be interested in playing this game.I've also used extensively the larger flatbed truck with the crane attached to it. This vehicle I find a little annoying, because the darn health and safety rubes have had their way, and I'm unable to reposition it without completely retracting the boom, and stowing it.What about the many complaints?Well... I think the physics are quite alright. Certainly not perfect, but then again... I don't think the physics in Kerbal Space Program, Euro Truck Simulator, or Microsoft Flight Sim are perfect either. BUT... this game is still VERY playable with the current setup. I would'nt even think to consider the physics to be ""game breaking"".Other people have complained of game crashing bugs or glitches. I haven't encountered a single one. I thought my game had crashed once, but it was actually my laptop going into hibernate because I had exhausted the battery playing this game.Also the controls. I'm not entirely sure what people expect here? I'm also not sure what the issue is? I play this game just fine using the keyboard and mouse... INCLUDING some of the more complex equipment. I'm not certain a controller would make it easier either. Fact. Excavators have MANY controls. They have to bind them somewhere on a PC... and while the learning curve may be present, it certainly isn't steep. Controls are a non-factor here. Simple as that.So then... should you BUY this game?If you're looking for a game where you can drive some abstract trucks that have a LOT of extra gizmo type functionality (crane parts, dumpers, stabilizers, etc)... and you don't mind doing the leg work involved in ACTUAL construction, with some stages of digging, dumping, pouring, craning added in... then yes. This game is solid. 8/10.If you're looking for something with a little more hands on, and less transporting... then no. Leave it be.THE BEST WAY I CAN DESCRIBE THIS GAME IS!It's like Euro Truck Simulator, with slightly different physics, and the added task of doing the work at the delivery sites, rather than simply delivering. It adds that extra little bit. A great starting point to build off of. But not perfect.Overall, 7/10. If you're a sim nerd, or a construction fan... bump it to 8/10. If you're looking for ETS... I won't drop any points, but just go play ETS.			"

												Good game but here are some thoughts...First off, I'm a big heavy equipment fan. I've been around tractors since I was 3, everybody in my family was in construction at some point or another, it's in my blood. So when I saw there was another heavy equipment sim out, I decided to try it, and approached it with an eager, open mind.My only other experience with construction sims is with Demolition Company; that was a fun game, but it left you wanting more freedom and construction activities. this game offers just that. Bugs:I don't think this game is as bug ridden as people say it is, you've just really got to pay attention to the details. For example: One user wrote he was upset because he was unable to exceed 10KPM in the tipper. I ran into this same issue, then I realized I didn't secure my load and retract the booms all the way. Once I did, I accelerated to much higher speeds. Physics:If you've ever operated a real machine, or simply a hand shovel, the digging physics in this game are going to annoy you at first. The excavator physics (once I finally set the joystick functions to CAT/standard US) I was soon annoyed by how unrealistic the digging is. Then I realized how the game thinks you should dig (you'll learn, lol) and it was smooth sailing from there. Digging seems to be the hardest physic to animate and develop for a game, hence the reason this is as far as it's come so far.I just barely finished the tutorial but, so far, I like the game despite it's quirks. Still, I'm glad on only spend the 60% off sale price on it.Be patient, I have a feeling things will only get better with these construction simulators. More machines and better physics are inevitable. Just look how far other simulation games have come. Flight Simulator 2000 anybody?			"

												I rarely ever write reviews because of the shear amount of reviews but here goes.TL;DR;If you can live with a few fun glitches, this game is tons of fun.Don't do TL;DR - you miss out on life and valuable details!The long version:When I first got this game I decided to ignore the ""Mixed"" review status of the game. I've played tons of early access and alpha / beta games, so bugs and glitches don't mean a whole lot to me. Often they can add a bit of unintended fun to the game and maybe even a few laughs like the flying, hovering, bouncing and wall climbing AI cars in this game - something that seems to have been fixed with the latest updates (sad face: no more fun flying cars).If anything, I would say that the guys behind this game have gone that extra mile to come up with a very decent way of presenting menus and interaction with the game components. Community suggestions for improving the game UI have been added into the game time and again, just like community feedback on glitches and bugs have been fixed.Lately a number of major fixes and feature upgrades have been released, which has just made the game that much better.I've got 70+ hours on this game, even with glitches and hick-ups and I have never really run into anything truely game breaking anywhere in the game. The concept is strong and solid, the missions are nicely varied and there is a nice enough selection of vehicles and work horses in the game to make it that much more fun playing a ""simple"" simulator. You get to actually dig and move dirt using excavators and trucks, pour cement on building parts and step-by-step build anything from small houses to huge appartment complexes. I wont spoil the game, except to hint that there are special missions worth your time and focus.When I saw the release of the first DLC for this game, which contains an additional tower crane I didnt even blink before I had completed the Steam transaction for the purchase (the only other game I have ever done this with is EuroTruck Simulator 2). Don't mind the haters on the community hub demanding 6,000 other vehicles: they just want the game to play for them ;)If you like simulators and heavy equipment, then do not hold yourself back on this title. With or without a discount, it's worth the money regardless. On the plus side, you get a decent amount of unintended fun moments at no extra charge!My personal oppinion is that the ""Mixed"" review status no longer applies. The game deserves a more positive status! So do I recomend this game? Yup, definately.			"

												After playing for an hour I have only completed the first job/tutorial. It is a pretty decent game but not for $26 even on sale. Keeping in mind that this is still a new game, I feel that there is a lot of work to be done to improve this game. The controls, like any other game, take time to get used to, that's just a given. Overall, not a bad game and it is easy to get hooked so with that said I do recommend this game but I would suggest waiting for the price to go down unless you just can't wait to try it out.			"

												Played a few contracts after the tutorial, the game has an interesting concept, transport, excavate, construct, trade materials. However, so far into the game it seems that it should be called ""construction material transport simulator"" rather than construction... It seems that the good stuff does not start to happen in the game anytime soon.All I have been doing go buy this go buy that and bring it to the construction site with the occasional dig here dig there. The game is pretty slow. Graphics are not very appealing, everything seems flat. there isn't even animation in buildings rising from the ground and becoming something beautiful. Bring in material, done, texture pop-in a house made of bricks all of a sudden. Would I recommend this game? No, unfortunately. This simulator could have been A LOT better than that. Nevertheless, I am not slamming the door on this game should it become a franchise and see later iterations i.e 2016 2017 etc. Unless Construction simulator becomes a better game later down the road, this will be the first and last I'll ever buy.If I want to compare, there is for example, Euro truck simulator 2, it is simply driving a truck from point A to point B delivering orders and that is it. This sounds miles more boring that construction simulator, I have done about 48 hours driving trucks around europe. Why is that you might ask, because it is VERY good at what it does, the gameplay feels right the truck weight, the handling with or without a light or heavy trailer loads, the graphics are alright and there are also very good quality attributes in that game. If you are unsure about this game, find some youtube ""lets play"" videos and see if you like the game. If you are not fully confident about buying it I do not recommend making a purchase.			"

												If you want to own your own construction company whilst buying new trucks to add to your fleet, be comming the biggest and baddest company in the area, then this game is for you. Sale or no sale, this game is worth the money, esp if you find a few friends to play with, having one buddy run the dump truck while I dig and steve is heading to the steelmill.. its a blast :) This game is by far 8/10. A must have if you're into these types of games !! ( First review :D )			"

												From a genre that generally suffers from bad games, this isn't bad at all.  The crane elements work particularly well, the flatbed with the extending boom crane is a particular favourite.  Excavation could be better, but once you get used to its quirks you can get along with it easily. I wouldn't put much stock in Youtubers playing this, none of them seem to have gotten very far.  The large Liebherr excavator is much more satisfying than the small one you start out with, I think you'll find the small ones are pretty pathetic in reality too! There can be a lot of driving in this, and for me this REALLY needs TrackIR or Oculus Rift.  Games with cockpits are transformed completely by adding these things, it really brings them to life.On top of that, simple things like controls for gears, brakes etc aren't there which further detracts from any realism. If you don't like a particular element of the game, later you can just get your employees to do it.  You don't earn XP, but you do earn money so you can go off and do whatever you like.  Once you get a second foreman, the money just roles in and you can start building your fleet. The way emplyees and foreman work needs some changes, you can't get them to do a whole job, neither can they manage themselves (despite being your senior). I hope the modding gets going with this, I would particularly like the ability to change attachments on excavators, similar to farm simulator.  The stock shovel you get with the Liebherr excavator is pretty small....  and I'd also like a telescopic handler!			"

Very fun simulator that will please most simulator enthusiat;- Steam Workshop availability in the future for extra vehicles/maps/missions;- Good multiplayer setup; Makes it a lot better playing with friends doing missions;- Casual game that is fun to playCons;- Very glitchy for an early released game: A lot of glitches are really basic;- Very bad custom controls availability: Will probably be fixed but not impressed at first sight;- Seems very repetitive as for the missions and taskings;- The driving of vehicles doesn't feel natural; Maybe this will be fixed with a racing wheel support in the future;Overall, greatly pleased with this game and tons of fun ahead with my buddies. It's not the game of the year, but certainly a great simulator for anyone enjoying this type of game.			"

												I truly recommend this game. As a simulator it has it's highs and lows, but the few lows are mostly ignorable thanks to the highs. I do suggest getting it on sale, as I wouldn't pay full price for it. (Or any game for that matter. Steam sales are gamer crack....*twitch twitch*)PROS:- Multiple trucks to choose from. Concrete pumper, tipper truck, dump trucks and others- 7 machines to use: Small and ""large"" excavator, loader, mobile crane, tower crane, vibratory compactor, and forklift- Impressive handling for the machines- Constantly changing job market which adds to the realism as well as having to worry about bills and covering your expensesCONS:- Clunky driving control for trucks- NPC driver AI is ridiculously stupid- Hit a car and flip over a tractor trailer and lowboy with a 30 ton excavator chained on it, shoot 25 miles in the air and have to reset everything to get to the job site- Some jobs get INCREDIBLY repetative- Interaction between machines and trucks can get wonky. I.e dump a bucket of dirt into the back of the truck and the truck does a somersaultAll in all, to burn time and if you love heavy equipment like I do, it's a fun game. If you are expecting photo realism or a ""perfect"" gaming experience.....yeah, this may not be for you.  "

												Would I reccomend this game? Perhaps on sale, the single player aspect is maddening and tasks take forever to do. Once I joined a friends server though I had a blast. This game is by no means a serious game, but if you walk into it with an open mind and a good friend and don't take the game seriously you are in for hours of laughter. At one point while excavating my friend walked on the tracks and sent the machine flying thorugh the air. Don't expect miracles of the physiscs engine.Also, after reading through some of the negative reviews here I have to say the controls are easy to use (on KB&M) within 5 minutes of operating the excavator it became my job in all missions as no one else could use it.My recommendation? If you are planning on playing this solo, be prepared for a lot of time driving over town for materials. Pick it up on sale, play it with some friends and enjoy this game in all its buggy glory			"

												Construction Simulator 2015 is one of the most underrated games that i have come across on Steam. I have to admit that i also had a rough start with it. Bought it and tried it for around 1 hour. I found it to be boring and controls were not so good. I abandoned the game for a few months and came back to it a week ago when i was bored. And i restarted my profile from scratch. Once i had enough patience to do some jobs that got me some money and experience i have unlocked new machinery and new building sites. And the game only starts to get interesting once you do this initial investment. The more i played the more i started to like it. More machines started to become available and the missions started to be more interesting. Now i'm at 20 something hours and i can't wait to play more of it.			"

												I have read some of the reviews and I agree with most of them. There are several bugs that need and will get fixed. The physics are great in some aspects and others not so great. Driving is a nightmare if you drive too fast but once you get used to driving it isn't quite as bad. As far as the controls for the excavator, boom truck and crane I have to say they are very realistic. I used to be in construction so I have plenty of experience with and excavator and limited with a crane but I have been driving a boom truck for the past 8 years and I will say it is as close to realistic as you will get. The missions do get a little repetative like some of the other posters stated, drive here and get this, then take it to site, dig a hole and clear the site. Job Well Done. I'm certain they will add more features later and I have only been playing for 6 hours so there may still be more to come.All in all I do recommend this game and it is worth the price if you want to play it bad enough, if you can wait for a price drop then do so, if not buy it and have fun.

												I saw this game on steam and figured it was another construction game made for 8 year olds and really arcade like.  I got this as a gift and I was very pleasently suprised.  The graphics are decent, not great but not bad.  The detail of operation of the vehicles is impressive and the map is much larger than expected.  Myself and 2 friends spent an entire day playing this, it is oddly addicting and the jobs progress is varried it doesn't feel like you are doing the same thing over and over.  If you like the idea of operating heavy equipment, I highly recommend.  And yes it has a few bugs here and there, mostly in multiplayer but nothing game breaking, its still a good time to be had by all.			"

												Quite honestly, I’m in two minds about this game. It’s a fun concept, using heavy machinery, building things, but it’s poorly implemented. I’ve got to admit I like the graphics, they could be a little more realistic and higher resolution, but they’re good, but then we come to the negatives and there’s a long list.Quite honestly the physics let it down bigtime.They’re just so unbelievable. I’ve lost count of how many times my excavator shovel has got stuck in the ground or just freezes for no apparent reason.Trailers and vehicles slide all over the place even on the slightest hill. Once again no real physics and don’t even talk about getting vehicles off the trailers on a hill. It’s like they’re on pure ice and they just slide off.Wheels vehicles appear to get stuck on the smallest irregularity in the terrain. It’s appears once again the physics is the problem.There’s no gears to speak off, no proper dashboard on any vehicle, those who play a certain truck simulator would know what I’m talking about and the detail that’s in it. There’s no way for you to smoothing out ground, to create a work area on hilly terrain.At the end of each stage any equipment you have deployed gets reset, despite the fact that you might need it again at a later stage. It would be great if you could just leave it deployed and pull them out once the job is done.I have no idea what the roller is supposed to do, besides from turning the grass brown. Sometimes the vehicles bounce around for no apparent reason. It can be funny, because it looks like they’re being naughty. Especially if there’s two machines together. You can speed all you want, with any cargo you want, crash through the traffic and no consequences at all, no fines, no damage. You can run over all the people you want, they’re like ghosts, they'll just pass through the vehicle.They assume that you have some type of gamepad. They haven’t assumed that you might want to play the game with a mouse and keyboard. It would nice to configure them how you want, for example using the mouse for steering and the keyboard for acceleration and braking.At this point in time from a simulator point of view. I couldn’t truthfully recommend this game, but if they made it more realistic, with real physics. Then yes I would. If you’re looking for an arcade construction experience. Then this is the game for you. "

												My take on Con Sim 2015PROS:1) The multiplayer aspect, WHEN(and I can't stress that enough) you have decent people who aren't just there to crash into things and wreck your experience, is a LOT of fun.  I dig the sense of accomplishment when you and 3 buddies have worked for 2-3 hours on something and finally finish it.  Some of the late game jobs can take quite a while from start to finish, which is nice, but can be tedious.2) The complexity of some of the machines is quite engrossing IE: the concrete pump; mobile crane; tower crane, just to name a few.  The overall detail of the machines is quite decent, this coming from working in the industry and seeing these machines on a daily basis.(To be fair, that's in Canada, so I'm referring to the North American counterparts; JD; CAT, etc etc.)3) The Story(such as it is); is a nice touch.  Just enough to add a little bit of flavor.  Mainly I like the ""Special Jobs"" that come up from time to time.4) All things considered I found the price reasonable for the time you can get out of it.  I've personally got just under 70 hours on it, most of which has been enjoyable.CONS:1) The sheer amount of bugs/crashes from a released product is somewhat off putting, most of which existing in multiplayer.  It is somewhat disappointing that it was released in this state but it is what it is.  The updates for these issues have been slow to come but have been addressing some of them.2) The sync issues in multiplayer with the more complex machines; Excavators; concrete pumps; anything with a crane, can get extremely annoying; recently I've been noticing that another player will do a fair bit of pumping only to have the job unfinished when from his point of view it's done.  I as the host have to come back to the jobsite and finish the pumping.  Again, extremely annoying when you're running 3 jobsites all with varying complexity and you have to run back and forth between them all to finish phases other players start because of sync problems.3) The physics engine gets.... What's the word...... ADHD??!? From time to time a vehicle, machine, or otherwise equipment will randomly start flipping♥♥♥♥♥♥ and USUALLY right in the middle of unloading/loading a large complicated load causing the freight to go airborne, sometimes travelling as far as Home Base(Village) after having launched from the Materials Provider(city).  Other times I've had it take over 2 hours to load up everything on the Lowboy trailer for delivery to 3 different jobsites only to have the skids/freight schiz out part way through loading and scatter themselves across the lot.  This sort of thing I would expect from an Early Access product, but not from a finished game.  The developers have been doing updates, a fair of which has been for sync and physics issues but the updating hasn't quite sorted it out.  Hopefully in the near future it will.OVERVIEW:The hours of gameplay that haven't been ruined by bugs, sync issues, and the like far outweighs the hours that have. The small group of friends that always play together have a laugh while doing so, even when the bugs hit.  All in all, I recommend the game to anyone interested, but at the same time, I would also recommend coming into it with an open mind.  If you like simulators, plus construction, you'll like this game.  Patience is a virture 2015 10/10Would have an excavator dig a basement whilst upside down and lodged into the neighboring house again.			"

												This game is extremely addicting, but can bore if you don't care much for driving.  Quite a few of the missions involve driving from A to B, then B to C, then C to D, then back to A.  After you do 20 minutes of driving and preparation, you dig for 2 minutes.  More digging plz7/10.			"

												I was really looking forward to the realse of this game. After playing it for a bit it became rather addicting until I started getting into some of the major bugs but it just realsed so they will be fixed surely. My first mission my truck and trailer floated off and diappeared off the map so I had to restart a new game. My game crashed twice and became rarher buggy and slow. The controls are a little iffy to me. The give your mind a tease but after I play it more I'm sure I'll get the hang of it.Pros: Great Concept , Better than many simulator games made , Graphics arent bad , sound is realsitic.Cons: Very buggy , controls give a little frustration  , unclear directions , slow and frustrating tutorial . 7/10			"

First glance + good stuffI looked at Construction Simulator 2015 with the same view as with other “<insert daily task here> Simulator <year number>” games. I was wrong to do that. Ok it is not the winner of this year’s innovation award but it has its own merits. When diving into the game I soon realised it is far more satisfying having something to show for your efforts in this sort of simulator game. This game certainly wins out over the likes of farming simulator in that regard, giving you some nice scenery and results as well as progression in the form of bigger and better missions to boot.Bug bearsThe fun is a little interrupted as whenever you make any sort of in-game transition (be it between tasks/jobs or switching to online mode/accepting a co-worker into your world) the game seems to almost perform a full world-reload for some and just blacks the screen for no reason for others. Annoying but not the end of the world.One thing you may also find irritating is the games happy way of stopping all keyboard/gamepad input when showing an information window or a mission completion window/achievement window etc. This allows you to career into many, many objects with your very expensive vehicles and, subsequently, have to reset them due to the physics issues (see below).The biggest bug bear with the games intentional features however (as always with Simulator games of this type) is the driver AI. Neither I nor anyone I know is capable of working out why all Simulator game AI cars are all built entirely of lead and have no sense of road rules whatsoever. Pulling out in front of you as you hurtle along in your articulated lorry full of materials seems daft until you realise that they must know they are capable of halting you in your tracks sending your load and truck flying.Just plain bugsIn its current build (1.06 at time of writing) there are serious issues with the physics in-game. In single-player this is noticeable but not game-breaking. Odd vehicle resets aren't an issue but having to quit entirely and re-load gets tiresome.   This is nothing, however, compared to the heavy synchronisation issues with multiplayer co-op. Doing things with your friends in this game is great fun and gives all players something to root for as well as do. But with the physics (and synchronisation thereof) issues it is almost unplayable. This can be quickly seen by attempting to load a flatbed truck with two forklifts at the same time. The only saviour then is to delegate tasks solely to individuals which takes the fun out of it for me.ConclusionOverall, I would say this game is in need of some spit and polish as well as a little less loading screen and a little more actual transition. Then it would be great. Until then it is good, but frustrating.			"

												With the myriad of ""simulators"" coming out of small European game developers, and the number of those that are actually ""buggy, furstrating and demanding a refund simulators"", you'd be excused for being cautious about this latest simulator. However, this game - despite it's rough edges (which are actually being address by the developers) - is actually among the better one's I've viewed and/or bought.I buy these sorts of games because I like the business sim/management side of things and my two sons enjoy watching the machines at work. The models are very good, the physics engine works as you'd expect - unsecured loads drift around the tray at speed, cabins bounce etc. The controls don't really feel intuitive to begin with, but after a few contracts you're relying less and less on the 'HELP' menu.I'll admit that it can get a bit repetitive, i.e. ""Go to site with this equipment"", ""Go to outlet, get these supplies, bring to site"", ""Prepare site"" etc. but isn't that how every contruction job basically goes anyway? Rock up, figure out what equipment and supplies you'll need, bring them to the site and commence work? And when you're done, clean it all up? At least from my obersvations of construction sites around my area - couple buildings but mostly road works. So while it does feel like groundhog day, it's really part and parcel with any real-life construction job.I haven't tested multiplayer and I don't expect to - I doubt any of my friends would enjoy this kind of thing: as I said, I mainly bought this game for my two sons to watch me play to keep them out of mum's hair for an hour or so.From a business-sim perspective, for me it's both good and bad. Contracts seem ""reaonsably priced"", you're getting 5 figure contracts pretty much straight away - basically it's not a constant grind to get the more lucartive contracts. Unless I somehow have it on ""Easy"" difficulty...I should check that... Regardless, there are many contracts and many of them pay well. The downside is that hiring personnel is level-based, so you can't hire workers right away and go nuts taking contracts to build your business or potentially go bust and have to fire everyone... You're almost certain to NOT fail the way it's set up. That could be seen as a good thing, but to me there's not a whole lot of risk...at least not so far.I'm nearly three hours in and the only bug I've noticed was on completion of a job and when the fence to the property was reapplied to the map, my several ton small excavator nearly went into orbit. Aside from that one instance, I've not had any other problems.People complaining they can't load vehicles on trailers or drive vehicles (unless it is an actual bug) just need to calm down, bring up the 'HELP' menu (the '?') and look at the controls for their vehicle or trailer. Some functions, like securing loads, only occurs from outside the vehicle - you can't do it from the cab, just like real life. The controls can be 'dumbed down', I was playing it with realistic controls however I have since switched to arcade style controls as I use a keyboard and mouse.This game is obviously not everyone's cup of tea, so to speak, however if you are into running your own business and going from small time outfit to large scale construction magnate as well as 'getting on the tools', then this game is pretty solid so far. If my friends were into this sort of game, I'd recommend it to them and I'm not mad I bought this game either so as far as sales pitches go - if you're into this sort of thing, it's worth the US$26.99 I paid. If you're expecting to bring down the town in a giant excavator rampage or run through the city COD style insta-killing everyone with a shovel or jackhammer I'd give it a miss: this is a construction simulator, not a 'lunatic goes nuts in an excavator, with a shovel or a jackhammer' simulator.

												So far I am impressed. I have played the android 2014 version on my tablet and this version is far superior. controls can take a bit to figure out and get used to but a little patience helps. I am currently running this game on a six year old laptop with all settings on high and have not had any issues during the first 3.5 hours. If you like simulator games give this one a go I think it is worth it and I am sure the devs will make it even better after getting some community feedback. Also I would suggest reading through the games forum and take a look at some of the good things going on and some of the problems, So far the only problems I have had are with the operator and maybe not reading the instructions correctly the first time but a reset a like I said above some patience will help you.

												I did recommend it but there are a lot of 'buts'. If you have patience and respect it's just a game, you definately want to buy this..I like the coop option to work together and have a lot of fun, we've played it like 20h, BUT there are A LOT of glitches/bugs with vehicles and operating machines.. For example; I've spend almost an hour to get 16 pallets on the flatbed with crane. I was done and the cargo was attached so I drove to the construction area. I detached the cargo and my mate went in the truck to play with the crane and when he got in the truck glitched and jumped 100m in the air with the cargo catapulled out all over the city.. I really didn't care that time, because it stays a game.. BUT it happened AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN.. However, this is just 1 glitch/bug and I've counted over 10 glitches/bugs.Also I would love to have more vehicles and silo's etc.Happy gaming!! BWNL OUT! "

Underrated simulator 2015.Fun fact: I had never driven a forklift IRL before but after a few hours in this simulator, I managed to successfully operate a forklift with no injuries or crashes.So as a simulator, yes I do recommend.As a game it can be unfinished in some aspects, for instance: no story or plot to speak off, and you will experience some bugs and glitches. (In my opinion, not gamebreaking, rather fun goofs and gafs that will pass)Its a fun way to pass the time and to enhance your vehicular operating skills. In theory. Do not in any way use this simulator as a reference if you ever apply to a job that requires you to operate advanced machinery.There is also the possibility to mod and download mods, but the community hasn't blown up yet.

												A decent sim, although I would have liked some penalties for breaking the law as well as some actual construction. If you enjoy driving vehicles and transporting goods this is the game for you. If you are looking for a game where you construct buildings yourself, you should probably look elsewhere.The game plays like a low budget GTA but with sim aspects. There is a big open world map that you can drive around and explore but besides doing missions there is not a lot to do.I would probably wait for a sale if you are considering buying this game as the current price of 24.99 is a bit expensive for what you actually get.

												Surprisingly engrossing, slightly clunky, and a few minor bugs.Most of the issues raised by other reviews seem to be caused by smacking vehicles into each other. Don't do that, and it should mostly be fine. Occasional glitches do happen, and there's occasional lag spikes and crashes, but it's mostly stable.The core gameplay is simple. Move X to Y, and do stuff there. Transport materials, dig holes, transport materials, fill holes, transport materials, pour concrete, and transport materials.Downsides are a lack of real progression other than 'buy all of the things', and 'build things to pay the rent'. Needs more machines, lacks the depth of Farming Simulator.But, hey, now you get to play with the toys you transport in ETS2. Considering it's basically Tonka toys for PC, it's worth picking up.Worth £20? Not really. Wait for it to be on sale for <50% of the usual price.			"

												I spammed this game since purchasing so much that I started hearing the reversing truck sound and hydraulic noise in my head whilst trying to get to sleep later that night.Jokes aside though...I've had ConSim2k15 for less than a few days and have already put ~30hrs into it. Very little sleep combined with the antics of multiple friends online have made this game great value for money - it's a great team work game.The physics can be a little bit funky at times, but they can also be helpful because if they flip out, you know you're doing something wrong and you need to adjust your approach. I've been on the lookout for a multiplayer construction based sim for a number of years, and I'm surprised that this one slipped past me until recently.Pros:* Good, but simplistic graphics allow it to run on a range of hardware* Good physics, although they can completely flip out and cause some (funny) problems* Authentic like heavy machinery and handling* Interior cockpit views add immersion and another level of difficulty* Trying to plan ahead for which vehicles are required and how to manage funds, especially in a group, is rewardingCons:* Sounds are fairly basic, especially engines or the same horn on every vehicle* Jobs are mostly structured the same, but with just enough variance so it isn't completely repetitive* No repercussions from causing havoc in the city, such as ramming into cars or signsThe cons are more nitpicky than anything. Personally, I'd like to see some more simulation like aspects, such as fuel usage, vehicle failures or fines for causing city damage (running into cars/signs/people/etc).Overall though, I highly recommend this one if you're looking for a game that combines logistics, freight/handling of goods, managing a construction company and using heavy machinery with a group of friends.

												Overall one the best releases from Astragon to date.The multiple PATCHES FIXED MANY THINGS IN THE GAME.I have played quite a few of their releases for sure, but this is not just another &%#% ""simulator"".They did a good job in this niche genre.The overall play has been built up for MANY years of simulations they have developed.Game play concept for a full construction company running is solid and works very well, including the finances, resources, vehicles, and supplies.Late game it becomes equally important to manage your finances rather than just your work load.Controls for all vehicles are EXTREMELY TIGHT (with an Xbox 360 controller), and the help tool tips for new players is very useful.Locking down loads is importantly for driving, due to ""odd physics"".If you are playing the game on simulation controls, inertia and momentum make a BIG difference.Vehicle selection is excellent, although most machines are recycles from previous releases with graphic and control tuning.Graphics are perfectly acceptable for the game and reasonably detailed, but not overly optimized with the code engine.If you are at the highest graphical setting you are going to get some lag, unless you have a solid game system, especially if you want to run this game ABOVE 1080p.If you are looking for Crysis 3 type graphics this is not that type of game with perfect shadows, shading, smoke effects, etc.Physics has always been little ""wonky"" with these type of games, including some pretty funny moments with rag doll physics, flying cars, dirt realism, and lack of proper damage modeling, in that respect this is NOT a simulation in this area.Keep in mind, this not a game for everyone though.It is closer to a ""real"" simulation than pure light-hearted fun, although the time required for projects is much shorter than it would be in REAL life, but can still be quite painful at times if you complete them alone.A good example of some of the more complicated missions may take OVER 3 hours to complete, but THANK GOD the game auto-saves, and you can leave and pick up where you left off.  There is no ""time crunch"".There are even some ""shortcuts"" the game gives you if you are really tired of digging or concrete pump work.Fortunately, you can hire workers, but its too bad you cannot interact with them and join the work like some other games of the genre.Its not a REAL simulation however as time scale is fast, and controls are still simplified for non-equipment operators.However, you are going to have to put in a few hours to get good with the controls and be proficient anyway.For example:  The Concrete Pump Truck, has 8 sets of controls to have to use simultaneously, but the design makes is fairly straightforward to understand with minimal fuss.For some people, this game is going to seem like a LOT of work.However, it is a great game for more than one player as you can multitask, and have it count towards your construction company progress.  THAT IS FUN.Recommended if you like building construction projects and running heavy equipment.If you think simulations games are ""work"", you will not like it.Still working towards that $10 million in the bank (although it is ""fake"" money).Construction is ALWAYS hard work!

												I bought this game early on, being a Farming Simulator player. I was hoping this was going to be as fun. Unfortunately, the controls between Farming Sim and Construction Sim were so different, it was difficult to adapt and some of it even counter intuitive. I mean, why  can\'t we have a free camera on all the time using the mouse to rotate and maneuver? Initially, I was having difficulty reassigning keys. I\'d remap my keys but they weren\'t working. For the longest time, I was fed up and regretful having bought this game, but someone told me that many bugs had been fixed, so I gave it another shot. It does look like it\'s working better. For me it\'s actually playable. I\'ll play some contracts and see if there is hope for this game. If they do come out with a 2017, please allow the controls to be fully configurable. I want to be able to set it as close to the FS series as possible.I purchased the rest of the DLCs, seeing how it seems playable now. I\'ll modify my review later on when I get more hours into it. "

												Great little game for a first impression play through.Got the game for the COOP experience. It may feel a bit off when it comes to syncing from time to time. But, it is a 4 man COOP limited game.COOP sessions are hosted locally as the single player campaign so COOP players assist your solo game play. They are limited to reading contract details, but they have full access to assist with all activities related to your construction Job's.I do Recommend this game for friends that enjoy trying to do Teamwork games and Simulators.Game play is simple and the open world map allows for friends to help in travel, transport, shipping, and purchasing of materials.First Impression: Buggy but Work-able Worth Fun for hours on End.

												The game is very detailed and I love playing the game, I like that you get to choose the contracts you want and what equipment you have, but there are some bugs in the game still. Like when you go to pull wall forms out of the truck and you clip the trailer and the forms go flying, at that time it is best to just put a worker on it and you are left with a mess all around your world. Also there seems to be a lot of lag when you are in the city even just walking your character walks the opposite direction in witch you are facing, its not that way when your driving but just a lot of lag even in low graphic quality. It gets better the farther you get away from the city but there are no jobs out there, at least for me there's not. But if your looking for a game to pass time by then this is it I recommend the game even with the little bugs.			"

												Although it has it's share of bugs and issues from launch. The devs are active on the forums and working towards a better simulation game. As far as the game experience goes; Well it's so much fun. I've played alot of the Construction sim 14 on my android tablet and when i was able to play this i was so hyped! And although i haven't played all to long yet; it still gives me that construction sim feeling. I would recommend this game since it's only gonna get better in time!			"

												Wanted to have a game that would let me own a constuction company and some cool projects for a change. I thought that this would be it. However I am slightly disappointed in this game. First the graphics are not that good even when set to""max"" settings. Game Physics are AWFUL there is no reason for it.  If you want to perpetually conduct projects this might be the game for you. However I warn that if you want a polished product do not purchase this one. You are better off buying Farming Simulator 15 for the time being. If you like sims and are patient. This is a good game for you. Hope this helps.			"

I recommend this game to all of you who are patient and are interested in operating big construction equipment. The only downside I've faced so far is that there are some minor bugs but they don't ruin the fun. And if you want to multiply the fun then I suggest you try the multiplayer, yes, this game actually has multiplayer and it supports up to 4 players.			"

												Constructiom Simulator 2015Pros:1. Authentic machines that look and feel like their real life counterparts.2. Vehicle interiors are nicely detailed and really add to the simulation.3. Building up your company from scratch,acquiring new vehicles, and managing your monthly finances, is satisfying.4. Multiplayer is a lot of fun and usually works well.Cons:1. Jobs are too simplistic and follow the same basic structure with the exception of a few ""special"" jobs.2. Routine vehicle maintenance would have been a nice addition.3. Location variety is seriously lacking.4. Jobs always require a vehicle of some kind.5. Game is too easy.I recommend this game to people who are enthusiastic about operating the big machines this game has in spades. Outside of that, there is little else this game offers. However, It is a solid foundation for the developer to build upon and is a step up from the previous editions which were only available on mobile devices.			"

												I'm a fan of large vehicle simulators. Wether it's hauling loads from point A to B or building housing using big ol' machines I love it. This simulator is great. Highly recommend for simulator lovers. Runs pretty smooth and many of the capabilities are just what they would be in real life. What do I mean? Excavators are able to load themselves onto real vehicles and trailers with some skill. Same method in real life works in the game. The basic tutorial could be better but I got the hang of it by reading the key assignments and completing the tutorials that were available. It'd be nice if there was a road grader so some of these uneven sites can be leveled out but the game is not done yet so fingers crossed. Hopefully, the creators will make a heavy tow simulator too, hint hint. lol. Enjoy it.			"

												Vehicle simulations are my favorite genre and I`ve been looking for a quality simulation on construction vehicles for a long time. I`m writing this review after a 10-hr session with CS2015 which was quite enjoyable and fun. Pros- High quality vehicle models and sounds- Many different types of vehicles- Vehicles have various functions/moving parts. Operating an excavator with my G27 / Joystick combo was one of the most enjoyable simulation experience I`ve ever had. - Support for multiple controllers including logitech G27- Task variety - Ability to hide all HUD elements - Multiplayer / Coop - Modding and Steam Workshop SupportCons- Collision detection and physics problems- Bugs (disappearing cars, etc)- Environment (cities, building, roads, etc) looks quite simple and a bit shallow. This may be a game-engine limitation. Hope to see more photo-realistic/rich gaming world in next version of the sim. Conclusion- Even in its current state, CS2015 is a solid and fun vehicle simulation.			"

												This game is exactly what it says it is; Construction Simulator. It is not a truck-driving game, it does not have amazing physics or graphics, but there is one thing it does well, and that's constructing!I especially enjoyed playing with this game with friends. The multiplayer aspect makes it fantastic and more fun; definitely less ""grindy"" feeling. There are plenty of vehicles to choose from and there are a few others you can get by purchasing some pretty inexpensive DLC. At $14.99, this is a game you should definitely try out!I do recommend using a game controller such as a wired XBox 360 controller; it will add some feign of realism and the keyboard controls feel a bit clunky. After about 30 minutes in the excavator with a controller, I pretty much had it mastered. If you like simulator games like Euro Truck Simulator 2, American Truck Simulator, or Farm Simulator 2013/2015, this is a game you should certainly consider adding to your collection. You won't regret it!			"

												Great Game, had its bugs, still has some. They arent a huge team and it takes them a bit to get a fix but they are getting to them. They have been patching multiplayer and its much better. The over all game is exactly what they said it would be,  more player support will allow for more machines and missions/jobs. The game is less polished then farming simulator 15 but it features other jobs and duties. Where as FS15 is waiting for growth and working on this or that, CS15 has more busy stuff, like picking up supplies and digging basements. The over all game is good the Small bucket size of the excavator makes for some long digs, even longer if you're aimlessly digging holes. Cranes are fun and with more patches they work better with other players. I would tell anyone who gets this game to use your head and learn from others dont just act like a fool and blame the game because you dont use common sense.			"

												First of all I think this is a great game. Well worth the money! The only glitches I've seen are cars flighing up in the air on the highway, some minor sound glitches, and minor glitches with the pallets/skids. Here is my ratings on somethings in the game;Gameplay-10/10Graphix- 9/10Physics-8.5/10User Friendly-7/10Platform-6/10If you have an older computer and are running WIndows XP/Vista (like me) than this game my crash alot and change up where your equipment is or the way things are (minor). My overall rating on the game is 8.5/10. I recomend waiting atlest 3 second before you do anything after the game has loaded anything, it may prevent it from crashing as frequently. Also, if the game if crashing frequently, just tone down the graphix one notch. I hope you enjoy the game as much as I do and don't wish you haven't bought it!

												Super buggy! I have a really mainstream configuration, and I couldn't play the game AT ALL. Wait a few weeks for the developer to fix their broken game.EDIT:  The latest patch (v1.07 I believe? Could be v1.04) Fixed my control problems. Now that I've actually gotten to play the game a bit, it's pretty fun. This is a really great game if the primary thing you want to do is drive trucks. A lot of the actual construction is done for you (which is honestly probably a good thing given the impercision of the controls) but driving the trucks around and operating their various features is a really good time. There are several kinds of vehicle, and each one has its own special function. For example, there's an excavator truck, a flatbed which is used to transport and dump cargo and can optionally have a crane, a forklift, etc. Not exactly GOTY material, but a solid buy if you're a fan of toy trucks.

												Great game with good potenial, looking foward for even more stable multiplayer experience. So far played less then 9 hours so more to see.Would like to see first person when walking around with your person, and walk as standard and sprint with shift instead of what it is today. Bugs is in any game, but they will be fixed.Thumbs up!			"

												yeah construction simulator is a pretty good movie i liked the part where you crash into cars head on and do a mother ♥♥♥♥ing summersalt. and if you hit signs reeeaaally hard they go flying into the distance. best of all, the excavator can destroy stuff and pick up cars so thats pretty cool. this game is epic because you can destroy the world with impending doom construction machines.also you can construct things.

												I love this game but I have a few suggestions for it. First the small excavator u should make it so u can use the plow on the front. Second the large excavator u should be able to use the plow on the front. Third there should be a bulldozer so when there is too much dirt u can move it easily it would be so helpful. 4th there should be a backhoe but make it pricey with no DLC. There also should be bobcats and skidsteers. You should add in road jobs but make the package a DLC and cost around $10.00 and have it include special dump trucks, road signs and a road sign truck, pavers, road sweepers, and a road stripper that way u can rip up the broken road and put in a new one. PLZ TAKE THIS INTO CONSIDERATION IF U SEE THIS CREATORS OF CONSTRUCTION SIMULATOR 2015!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!			"

												A lot better than you'd think from seeing the reviews.  I'd definitely recommend this if you like simulators.Smooth vehicle operation, attractive town, fairly realistic driving, fun heavy equipment to use.  Sort of a cross between Euro Truck Simulator and Farm Simulator (2013 & 2015).  The game controls were reputed to be complex and difficult, but I paid careful attention to the steps and recommended actions and it all went fairly easy.  Full disclosure:  I'm an avid fan of Farm Sim, and have plenty of ""experience"" operating heavy machines, trailers and diggers.  This helped me become proficient in Construction Sim very quickly.I only saw one instance of a silly physics bug in two hours of play.  It did not affect gameplay at all, and was LOL funny.  Bonus!

												I really like the concept and everything but....It gets VERY boring.Not only that but it's very hard to move around sometimes. The graphics are pretty good, like gmod graphics. It's a bit glitchy too. Like if you bump into a sign or something chances are you get stuck on the sign or nothing happens at all.. Sorry but not worth the $20, summed up: Too buggy/glitchy, boring and difficult.			"

												I remember when I got this game, I was dumb. There was a problem with my controller that made my character walk backwards. I was ignorant when I didn't try to look on any forums or look it up online. I then stepped away from the game (Steam didn't have returns). Then one day, I decided to launch it again without the controller plugged in. Then began one of the most fun and realxing games I have ever played. As you can see, I've invested over 100 hours into the game. This game is one of my favorite simulation games. This game tought me the lesson that you shouldn't be ignorant if there is a problem and try to blame it on the game. Think what you can do to solve the problem before setting down the game like I did. 8/10 "

												I got it on sale and felt it was worth the 10-15$ I paid for it.  Be warned you're not really constructing anything, your mostly transporting material from point A to B, the buildings construction will jump to the next stage as you finish each task.  There are some missions that require you to pour concrete or dig, but mostly you will be transporting matiral or equipment.  There is a management component to it as you progress, that was kinda fun, but I felt the game went easy mode as each of workers can work 5x as fast as I can.			"

												I bough this game for me and my best friend 29.12.2016 for -50%, and it has been amazing!Controls take a little to get used to, but they r not impossible to learn (I use keyboard, my friend uses controller). Biggest let down we have come trough yet is that u cant use blinkers with controller, because there is not enough buttons for them.Every vechicle has its own controls (except for driving, they r all the same), and every vechicle has its unique touch in controlling them. In the beginning it is mostly driving things from one place to another, but as the game progresses, it gets more complicated. This game is a big time-eater, but damn isnt it fun!			"

												I find it is a pretty fun game. You don't do any foot work but use machines such as diggers, cement pumps, cranes and other stuff and you have to deliver the materials to the site. I really like the open world element which is absent in most simulators as you select your own jobs and complete them at your own pace. The multiplayer works fine and other than a few physics and AI driving glitches the game has worked perfectly for me. If you find a job too tedious you can tell an employee to do it but it does have some downsides so it's not cheap to do so. The variety of jobs, machines, and workshop support gives you quite a bit of replayability and the DLCS add quite a bit which is nice. I reccomend watching some videos on it before buying to see if it is a game for you but I thought it was pretty good. Astragon is also behind it and they make some pretty good simulator games.			"

I like how you have to purchase and get all of the special supplies that you need for each project and the different vehicles you can have.  I just wish there was a way to convert everything into English standard for pricing (Dollars) and speed (miles per hour). Overall a great game and I recommend giving it a try!			"

												I bought this a week ago March of 2017 and I have had a hard time not playing it. While I strongly sugest having a good P.C. set up to run it as it can be very resorce heavy and visually stunning for a simulator when maxed out but it stutters once in a while and over time the sound effects can screw up after hours of playing. As for game play I sugest holding off renting the new company office as long as you can so you have enough money to buy more equipment so you can get larger payout contracts once you have the monthly rent on the property as well as Insurance and taxes plus pay for employee's if you wish to have help with contracts. Getting a roller is not a good idea unless you have room for a Tracktor and trailer combo to take it to a site. Getting a Cement mixer without the pumper truck is not a good idea as most jobs need the combo of the two. So you need 100's of thousands saved up to handle buying the new vehicles and the first couple of months of rent for it all till jobs can be compleated and you get into the grove of it all. Mothly playouts start the second your vehicles are transfered to the new City Headquarters each month which is only a couple of hours of game play away.So plan ahead of time and you will do well. If they come out with a newer version of this game I would snatch it up quick that is my best explination of how much I am enjoying this one.			"

												Let's be honest it's an okay game and a good concept.  However there are to many small glitches that make it frustrating.  Getting pallets from the shelf and putting them in the truck is a challenge and it's one of the top things you do in the begining of the game.  Also can't say I've ever been digging a hole with an excavator and had dirt stop it dead in it's tracks. Some of the main componets and jobs you do a lot have to many problems that should have been fixed before release.			"

												I really want to be able to give this a good review but sadly there are a couple of issues that constantly prevent me having much fun at all with it, despite numerous revisits to try and get things working.First up, the controls.  If you're only ever going to try playing this with kb/mouse this will be less of an issue, albeit still a moderate one, but that in turn means you have to put up with operating machinery being rather janky.  Really this is a game that cries out to be largely played with a controller (doing so entirely isn't an option as parts of the ui simply do not work properly with a controller), the twin analog sticks work perfectly in place of the 2 sticks used in excavators and in general driving and operating any equipement controls is better with analog controls.  Sadly doing so is a nightmare, first up you lose all camera control once you get into a vehicle unless you keep swapping one hand between controller and mouse every time you want to reposition the camera slightly, which just adds to the already annying camera that comes with additional pointless 'Action Cam' modes you have to keep toggling past to get between the useful cab/free camera options.  If you want to customise the controls the option is there, but it's a confusing mess.  In some screens the correct xbox controller buttons are shown, in the keybindings menu they are not, instead you get the generic 'controllerbutton6' or whatever.  The game supports using buttons as modifiers, then doesn't let you assign your own multi-input preferences.  To top it off the ingame help for the controls that you can bring up often stretchs off the top and bottom of the screen, because you wouldn't want to see all of it now would you?My other major gripe is with the physics, which vary from being fine, to annoying, to vehicles being launched into the air doing flips.  Seriously, how can someone get it so wrong these days that vehicles slide sideways downhill, while on a paved road?  If the game took place entirely in the depths of winter it would work as an ice driving experience, but it doesn't so it's stupid, especially so as it can lead to getting vehicles wedged onto scenery as you slide down hill.The physics and camera/control issues are a real shame, this isn't far off being a awesome game if you're into the whole <thing> Sim genre, if a sequel comes along that addresses those issues it needn't do a huge amount else different, from what I've seen fighting past the controls there's a solid foundation present here that just needs that bit more polish to make the whole experience a little less like fighting your way uphill through treacle to get to the fun.

												Really awful game. Physics and trafic AI are really horrible. Had the right of way and got scooped by a car. My excavator flew away hundreds of meters. Controls are really poor. Excavator arms can exctract but the opposite buttons don't work even though they are assigned correctly, so i can't retract excavator arms. Objectives are unclear, telling you to unloda objects in ""marked"" areas, but you have no clue where, also no arrows or markers. Driving trucks has very unreliable steering on keyboard with great accaleration causing turns to be taken too big and curves on the highway to make you spin 180 degrees. No ambient music at all or anything. Also, let's call this game material and machine transporting simulator. You are delivering materials for 10 minutes, then you dig for 1 minute and a building pops out of nowhere. Repeat this and call it a game.This game went way too early out of beta and the devs should have tested it more thoroughly.			"

												I have to say, I played Construction Simulator 2014 on my iPhone. Which is obviously a scaled down version of this big brother. Not that I'm biased by that, It's just the reason I started playing this game.I'm gonna compare it with Euro Truck Simulator 2. I love that game, mainly because it's polish. Well, this game has that too. It's totally NOT a crappy simulator. It's probably one of the best actually. If you enjoy Euro Truck Simulator 2 mainly because it's relaxing, you''ll probably find this game relaxing too. I just had my first CO-OP experience and I really loved it! Working on the save job, both in different vehicles is really cool. I also love that you can leave your vehicle and just walk. Pretty immersive.The reviews about bad controls are not true. I think they are pretty perfect this way. Couldn't think of a better control scheme. And you absolutely don't need a controller like another reviewer said. I have no idea what that person played, not this game, that's for sure.. lol. If you want a relaxing simulator, grab this one. The mixed reviews were mainly because of the rough launch with bugs, those are patched so no worries about that anymore. Enjoy!			"

												Only spent 1 hour on the game. In my opinion for what I've seen so far... the game is pretty good especially for a Astergon game. My only 3 cons is the Cockpit Camera isn't centered for♥♥♥♥♥♥on where it's suppose to be centered (ITS CENTERED IN THE CENTER OF THE CAB) and Bad Optimization (I have a GTX 750Ti) and Farming Simulator physics. But the story line and the progression of the game is SOOO well thought out that I would give this game a 8/10. If you're not a huge fan of ""heavy machienery (might be proper English :P) then I wouldn't recommend the game. I came into this game with an open-mind and I was right. The main menu's are simple and sharp, the game has a slight visual blur if you look hard enough (strangly it makes up for the performance). The reverse audio isn't... headphone friendly. Keyboard controls suck *** I MUCH rather prefer a controller (I use a XBox 360 controller). All in all  if Astergon just keeps throwing out patches for the game... I think that it has a HUGE potential.			"

												A nice little chill out game that would appeal to anyone who thought about learning to drive big equipment. While it's typical of the Simulation genre coming out of Europe, it lacks the polish that you would find in the likes of Farming Simulator 2015. The models are good, and the city scapes are what I would call Legoland, but attention has been put more into the economy and vehicles, rather than the scenery - as I'm sure you would expect. The controls don't lend themselves to easy use, if you are using a keyboard. I don't have a game controller, so I can't comment on the ease of use with that. There is also the slightly painful driving-around-town aspect that has the player acting more like a courier than a plant operator, but that's in single player career mode. I'm sure the game shines in multiplayer, when the large contracts start rolling in and you need an extra set of hands or two!At the time of writing, I've only got 10hrs clocked up and just bought my first vehicle (cargo truck with crane), I will put more hours in for 2 reasons: 1 - I bought the Gold edition, that comes with Large tracked cranes and bridge building (cool factor right there), and 2 - it's just so darn relaxing!

												There are better games out there, far better games, but for what Construction Simulator 2015 is, it's pretty good.In a world where there is a sim for everything, and 90% of them being utter tosh CS2K15 is actually pretty enjoyable. I wouldn't pay full price for it, but having got the Gold Edition for £10 I definitely don't feel cheated out of my cash.TL;DR - If you like Farming Sim 2015 and this is on sale grab it, otherwise it's probably not for you.The controls can be a little fiddly, but this game markets itself as a simulator, controls of vehicles like this ARE fiddly and the onscreen help guides are very useful in reminding you what does what.Graphically it's not exactly ground breaking, but this does mean it'll run pretty well on older hardware.The missions can be a little repetative, but then, this is a contruction sim, what do you think working on a building site is like? Oddly enough, quite repetative!Overall score... an enjoyable 78/100 - Buy it on sale.			"

												This game is fun, even if the physics are a little odd sometimes. Be prepared to switch back and forth between the keyboard and controller; some things, like driving the trucks, is definitely better done with a game pad. Other things, like handling the cranes and tractors, works better with the keyboard.There are some minor annoyances: it's a bit grindy (you have to do a lot of repetetive work to get enough money to get to the next level) and the UI is a little strange, and some things are not intuitive at all. But overall, it's a decent and fairly fun heavy equipment, simulator,			"

												This game was a little rough when it first came out but with some good patching it has now become a decent game.  It will take a little bit of time invested to get use to all the movements of the equipment and some patients but the playability of the game is worthwhile.  The physics of the game are still a little tough.  Using the fork lift lifting items if not done with some grace can become frustrating to get items onto the flat bed.  Also driving the vehicles for long distances can be challenging.  Other traffic on the road is more of an annoyance than a penalty meaning there are no repercussions for driving straight into a small car at full speed other than the fact you have to get up to speed again.  If you’re a farm simulator type of fan then you’ll like this game.  The progression is good as you move through each challenge and get to start to add larger cooler equipment.  The way it’s done it keeps you playing to get that new cool new crane etc…  Overall I give this game a 7 out of 10.  Graphics are a little dated.  Physics can be wonky but over looked if you’re not an OCD sim player.  For the price and the DLCs that are coming out its worth the price and will kill off about 40 to 70 hours of your life before you move onto the next sim game.  Happy Building. "

												Not too long ago, I had construction simulator for my iPad and enjoyed it. I only stopped because it crashed on me during an hour long dig, and lost all progress. I also tried playing the previous version of the PC port, but it was total garbage. Didnt handle well, clunky, just not very fun. After reading the mixed reviews on the 2015, I was skeptical, but actually quite pleased. A much more improved game, not without it's glitches, but definitely not game breaking. Also glad to see the mod community, haven't gone through it yet, but I expect good things. 10/10 would glitch again			"

												I've played this game and I see that the game is laggy. As for the graphics they are decent but need some work on vehicle speeds. I have also noticed while playing this game that it does have quite a few glitches in it. For example the guy that tells me to back the truck up and connect the trailer doesn't go away even after starting the first task of digging with the excavator. I do like the game and I know I'm going to enjoy many hours of playing it. Would I recommend this to someone else? The answer to that is probably. I think that the only way your going to be able to experience this games full potential and not have any lag or any problems with it is if you have a computer that exceeds the recommended requirements. I have tested this game on four different machines and found that it works best on the machine I'm currently on.			"

												Its a fun game and i enjoy it, but there are a few crashes and bug like: small excavator issue when finished diging it chrashes the game, sometimes the physics of the vehicle dont move like the forklift or deposit tipper. Otherwise this game is very good and i give it 9/10 because the crashes and bugs. :-)			"

												wow this is dull, its not really construction simulator its more building supplies delivery driver simulator...do you enjoy driving  a badly simulated forklift at 5mph along  a village road? Feels a lot like an industrial training game,...ie no fun....you cant even go anywhere interesting...its basically just delivering pallets of supplies to building sites....even digging holes with the JCB's is tedious and unrealistic...the holes are sort of ""preformed"" and you cant actually have any fun with it. cant find anything good to say about it really,... very disappointed. just very very dull			"

												Driving is hard, steering is not fast enough on wheeled vehicles. I slip all over the road when turning on junctions and bends. Physics are a bit on the weird side. Couple of minor bugs that can be fixed. Excavator arm controls are inverted and cannot be sorted in the options menu.HOWEVER, this games scenery, vehicles and buildings are well detailed and it is possible but difficult to complete contracts. I do recommend this game but it needs some work done before I am happy. Overall, fun game, well detailed, physics need to be redone and inverted controls need to have an on/off option in the options menu.			"

												It's got buggy physics and it sometimes screws up the game controller input so you have to restart your game but it's still pretty fun.Play it with a kid and you can have them help load/unload dirt, move the cranes around, and drive some trucks.  I do wish there was a bit less 'buy x goods and transport them to the construction site' components to the jobs though.  I'd buy this if you have a kid that's into construction equipment but probably not otherwise.			"

												Needs manual labor, seriously... Loading pallets onto a flatbed, driving to construction site. Unload them, poof done. Wall is built... Eh, needs a little more depth to that... Hand tools, setting foundation, joints, rebar and so on. Just more depth! All in all, it's not a bad game, does get boring at times, aside from the bugs, it's decent. I just wish there was more depth to it. For the most part, it feels like a driving simulator, asides from actually getting to dig with machine, just needs to be more. Also need option to store minerals at your base, there are bunker silo's there that are completely useless.			"

												Simply put, you operate a building company, starting with 1 Small Excavator, 1 Trailer to move the excavator, and a flatbed truck.Once you get going, you can purchase new vehicles, and when you do a tutorial mission will unlock, which you can do if you choose, but not mandatory.You start small, and work up and can unlock bigger and better jobs, and eventually, architect jobs.Multiplayer is also included, which can be fun (however you cannot knock your friend over, or bury them with dirt.. maybe they can include this in a future update..) It isn’t limited to friends, you can jump on an open public world, and you will earn cash for doing the jobs, which can be used in your own world.Steam Achievements are also in the game.Controller support looks to be XBOX style, and can be tricky, as I have found, at least for a couple of the vehicles, the game doesn’t understand when you want to use driving controls or tool controls.Overall I would recommend this game to others.

												I am giving this game a thumbs up with reservations.  It is a very fun game as you get to play with construction equipment that you would probably never get to do IRL.  I like the cranes especially, I wish they would put a little more into the animation though.  There are counter weights that should move as you manuver a load to keep it balanced.  There are some clipping issues but they are usually more helpful then a hinderance.  The main problem I have is that its fairly intensive on my computer.  I have a AMD Penom II x6 with 16 gig ram and Radeon HD 6800 vid card plus a lot of cooling power.  When I run the game the fans start kicking up, eventually to max speeds.  The longer I play the more evident its creating a heat problem.  If i play long enough it will lock eventually due to heat.  I have turned off the NPC vehicles and pedestrians.  (The NPC vehicles are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ anyhow.  They pull out in front of a loaded low boy barreling down at top speed.)  This helped the heat issues but it is still present.Pros:Cool equipmentDifferent and larger jobsVariety of equipmentCons:Those jobs get repetitve pretty quickComputer working harder then I like			"

												The game is  75% simulator and 25% arcade.Most people find the cotrols confusing but in fact they depend on what machine you are using. An excavator has a lot of controls but there is always the help button ""?"" which puts on screen all the controls you need to use similar to Farming Simulator. This makes up the simulator part.There are no damages or penalies for crossing the red light or bumping into cars as there are no speeding tickets for gooing with 120km/h in the city. This makes the arcade part.You can compare the game with Cityconomy by graphics but the gamplay is way superior and less boring. Buying the DLCs can enhace your game experience and they are not very pricy either. If you are not convinced, buy it on sale and see for yourself if you get into it or not. This is what I did. "

												I love this game. Great fun to play and very happy with it. Yes there are a few small bugs. For example, the pedestrians have no collision detection. You can simply drive straight through them. In fact the AI cars also drive through pedestrians. While this affects realism it doesn't affect the actual gameplay or performance so not really an issue. Overall 9/10. Can't wait to see what both the developers and modding community have coming.			"

												If you like arcade style simulation games (is that a contradiction in terms?) then this is one to look at. The game has been around for a few years (2014 version, and Android version) so has built on its own experience and I have to say that they have done well. The game does have some bugs but these can be forgiven by the sheer amount of things you can do in this game. There are 15 driveable vehicles in the game and you start with 3 of these. These are a small flatbed tipper, a skip lorry and a small digger/excavator, there is also a small trailor for transport if you need it. The idea behind the game is great, get a job, collect materials and dig foundations and then ferry materials to the site for the build. That sounds boring after a while but the missions get harder and bigger just in the nick of time. Add into that the fact that you can buy new vehicles whenever you want and therefore open up new missions and you will not get bored. There are some negatives, there are bugs, you will get stuck, some vehicles are under powered, the physics can be a little strange at times.2 DLC's later and this game is still going strong. If you want a construction sim that you will be playing until the end then do take a look at CS2015.Check out our video playlist here:

UPDATEConstruction Simulator 2015 has now become Construction Simulator 2015 Gold edition. This means that there are now multiple controllers supported and a couple of fixes. The new charity DLC allows you to build the new Hospital and more.Multi Controller Support - You can now control the game using multiple controllers. For example I use my xbox 360 controller and a G27 wheel and pedal set. Others have been able ti use 2 flight sticks to control the excavators just as you would in real life. Mix in some pedals from your flight stick and the level of imersion has just topped out!Remember to check out my gaming review group over at http://steamcommunity.com/groups/EBUKGamer "

												Nice game if you can get it in a sale.First a moan at the community : As soon as someone puts the word SIMULATOR in the title of their game, some people go into an electric spasm about how unrealistic the physics is and how ""when they drove a truck"" it didn't do that. It's fine having that opinion but don't give a perfectly good title bad reviews because of it. Moan over.If you have played the mobile version of this game then this is a much enhanced version. If your a fan of Farming simulators or Euro Truck sims then there is much to please you here as well.Familiar gameplay of take contracts to get money to get new vehicles to get better contracts etc with a big town to drive around in.If you have played these sorts of games before the cooky physics will be familiar e.g getting snagged on lamp posts, trucks flipping over as if on the moon. If your carefull you can avoid these things and get a lot of complex gameplay out of this title.It runs smoothly on my mediocre rig running win7 32xI picked the Gold version up in a sale for £16 which I think is a fair price for the game. Over £20 is pushing it in my opinion as a certain level of polish is needed for games over and above that price.9/10 Having a lot of nerdy fun with this.			"

												Fun enough game, but does crash a lot and is rather buggy, controls do work against you somewhat but you do get used to them.  But all in all a decent enough sim which is rather unique, can see them doing a lot more withit, would be nice to actually do the contruction though not just transport stuff around and tow it between four cones.

												I bought this for something different to play, Im not sure what it is but i get a real sense of acomplishment when i play this, me and 3 others play and its a blast, Solo this game is boring as hell, add a few other players and thats where the fun is.Buggy as hell tho, random ""game disconnects"" when a stage of a build is completed, Cargo just flying off the truck, and i mean flying up in the air, collisions are a bit weird, hitting a vehicle can send your vehicle miles into the air.Not sure when this was released but i definatly needs a patch. if it wasnt so much fun in MP i would have binned it because of the bugs. be warned, great fun but buggy as hell!

												I can see great potential for this game if it were not for some issues, control is very bad on this game even when your controller is calibrated right, I use an Xbox controller. When driving any vehicle you are constantly trying to keep it from wandering all over the place say driving a truck from point A to point B, I found it so agravating. When operating machinery say the forklift it would shake when trying to load something onto the truck, I do like the graffics and the game does run on my older quad 4 copro 2.5Ghz and my 2g video card with 8G mem. onboard. Game is gliching at some job sites. Why is it that all the equipment is parked in such a way that when you log out of the game and come back to it later that the equipment has to be restarted IE: trailer needs the legs have to be retracted, concrete pumper has to be setup again at the job site.Just my observation on the game.

												Good fun game to play, time consuming because it has a lot of realism to it. Using the diggers is the wost bit about the game but you only have to do a little bit then you can skip. Controls are a little bit confusing at the start but fine once you get to know them. Finaly the graphics are very good for a simulator, but the physics are what you would expect from this type of simulator.			"

												I have to recommend this, initially I thought it was just going to be a basic game where you are given 3 or 4 spots per map that you build one thing and move on to the next area, repeat 4 or 5 times. No. This is an open world game, there is a fairly decent areayou can explore and the jobs are plentiful. There is a definate good feeling seeing buildings change as you help build them.As for bugs the only real one I had was when I managed to get the digger stuck into the ground once, fixed by transporting it back to the build site. My only real complaint is the lack of weight, I should not be able to knock over a fully laden skip by hitting it at 3kph in a forklift, however it is this lack of weight that adds some extra odd situations, you havnt lived until you have done hand brake turns on the wrong side of the motorway in a fully laden concrete transporter.

												Save your money and time i've spent 5 hours playng this game and it is a complete bug festival sometimes when you integrate to city there is a bug that makes you rebuy the homebase at city. if you want bugs you should attempt to load the small excavator back on the small trailer because the small excavator will fly out of it and when it does you can hit backspace to reset to cause serious glitches. in my 1st play session i've had the default truck's bed glitch causing me to fly to space if i attempt to jump on it, this game has a lot of game breaking bugs sutch as the cargo you load on to the truck to get stuck in it causing me to waste a lot of time to get it off it because i don't want to waste anymore time driving back to the material dealer to use the forklift or crane to load all that cargo again.most guys who vote positive might not have played long as i do. also the physics is garbage and the graphics are basic with HDR and the game causes my laptop to overheat a lot. there is so many bugs in this game that i think you should not buy this game.

												I had high hopes for this game, but sadly have come away bitterly disappointed. The game is laggy and the physics, as mentioned in other reviews, are atrocious.There's no construction taking place...it seems to be more of a move things from one place to another simulator. Re-setting vehicles that are loaded forces you to lose the cargo and then having to spend the better part of an hour trying to pick it up again.All in all, very frustrating and not worth the price I paid for it. I'll be uninstalling and not returning.			"

												This game will better be titled as ""ConstructionCrane Simulator 2015"".In this construction simulator, You don't actually get build anyhing! Seriously! Not even laying down a single brick. Imagine if you were playing Portal, except that:-you don't have a portal gun.-you never even walk thru a portal.-you don't even get to see a portal.However, -You still get to walk in all the levels, and by walking I mean driving trucks and excavators.-You get to place the turrets using a crane.-The cake is still a lieAnd, There are some other stuff you do get to do:-Dig using an excavator-Drive a steam-roller-Cranes.That by itself is not so bad. The reason I'm giving this a thumbs-down is because of the trailer, which is extremely misleading.			"

												This game is a MAJOR improvement to the Construction Simulator 2014 that I still play on iOS, not only are the graphics better but the controls are more fine, the game world has much more to offer and there is plenty so far to enjoy. That said there are a few issues I've noticed. 1. The initial truck has an issue climbing the hill next to your home base when pulling the trailer even if the excavator isn't loaded on the trailer, it's much worse when the excavator is loaded, to the point that it's much easier to just drive the excavator up that hill and forgoe the trailer for that area. Secondly the trucks have a tendency to slide too easily while turning, I hope those two things can be fixed in a future patch. As for the negative comments such as the one claiming that they couldn't ""fasten cargo"", Yes, if you pay attention to the tutorial it tells you how to do so. Part of the actual job that this game emulates is PAYING ATTENTION TO DIRECTIONS, secondly it's not that big of an issue to need to affix cargo, I used to drive trucks both flatbeds and Semi and at times didn't need to affix certain loads. If you're skilled enough even you can stack two pallets on top of one another with the forklift and load them simultaneously onto the flatbed and then strap them down. Doing this you can get a total of at least 8 pallets at one time on the flatbed.  The game is great, the gamepad controls work well, and so far other than the hill glitch I found and the trucks sliding too much when turning. * ( The hill glitch I referred to is being unable to climb the hill while pullling the excavator on the trailer, I found that I wasn't strapping the excavator in and once I did so there was no problem, so it was my fauilt and not the fault of the game. It's a going trend, almost every negative review is from people who did something wrong or didn't pay attention and don't wish to admit it.)   If you want to lose plenty hours to a game and feel satisfied doing so, get and enjoy Construction Simulator 2015.   Plus if you're like me and disabled and miss working, it can help give you the feeling of actually being able to work and that alone makes this game therapeutic and for $30 that is a bargain. Plus let's not forget the workshop, you can add in your own content as well.  Definiteily, DEFINITELY worth purchasing at $30, I would even have paid $50 or $60 for it.			"

												Construction Simulator 2015 is a very nice Construction Simulation. I played the original Construction Simulator 2012 and it was OK but it didn't feature online multiplayer, modding and a open world. In CS 2015 all those things are added making the game much more enjoyable and it even has updated graphics. Over all I would reccomend Construction Simulator 2015 as it would have to be the best Construction Simulator available on steam.			"

												Honestly, I did not get past digging first hole. I was really determined to do it, but my small excavator ceased to function properly after I exited the game and then loaded saved game few hours later. Bucket was not moving although control stick in cockpit was moving when I was pressing buttons on my keyboard. Neither re-entering excavator nor reloading the game helped. This glitch came on top of disappointing anomalous sliding of a truck while turning. The game might simulate construction process really well, but driving/moving physics does not feel right. Buy only if you really like construction games and don't care about realistic physics and glitches. It is pretty much the only meaningfully complete and serious construction game for PC. I wish I could play longer, but I prefer realistic driving physics and thus requested refund. However, I still think this game is very good in its genre, could be better but very good.			"

												Controls are absolutely impossible to configure properly. I've spent 1½ hours on it, and have 43 minutes of playtime and 8 minutes of progress in the tutorial.All I wanted was too hook up an Xbox controller, one of the most standard controllers out there, and per default the game honks the horn constantly when you hook one of those up... When I finally gave up on the Xbox Controller, I got to drive a truck for about 30 meters before a glitch made my cargo permanely rotate 90 degrees, making the next mission impossible.I really wanted to like this game, I've logged countless hours in Farming Simulator - but this is not just a ""classic"" game without all the modern bells and whistles, it's bad design and bad programming.

The game is great, the gamepad controls work well, and so far other than the hill glitch I found and the trucks sliding too much when turning. * ( The hill glitch I referred to is being unable to climb the hill while pullling the excavator on the trailer, I found that I wasn't strapping the excavator in and once I did so there was no problem, so it was my fauilt and not the fault of the game. It's a going trend, almost every negative review is from people who did something wrong or didn't pay attention and don't wish to admit it.)   If you want to lose plenty hours to a game and feel satisfied doing so, get and enjoy Construction Simulator 2015.   Plus if you're like me and disabled and miss working, it can help give you the feeling of actually being able to work and that alone makes this game therapeutic and for $30 that is a bargain. Plus let's not forget the workshop, you can add in your own content as well.  Definiteily, DEFINITELY worth purchasing at $30, I would even have paid $50 or $60 for it.			"

												I really love this game. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys building games. I admit that at times it feels like ""transport sim 2015"", but it is an awesome game. Though you dont get to do some of the construction yourself, you get to use alot of the construction equipment found in real life. So far im about 34 hours into the game and I still enjoy playing it. So if your looking for a good simulation game or just have some extra money lying around, you should definatly download this game and get the gold edition. Makes this game even better for the simulation lover.Thanks for reading and let WSI wish you a positive future.-WhiteStoneIndustries-			"

But its more of a company sim than a construciton sim while it is a construction bussiness you are simulating do not expect to actually have freedom to do what you want to in the game like I assumed you'd be able to design and build stuff for clients but, it is still very good for what it is. I just assumed it was something it clearly isn't and the fact that you can just hire workers to do everything further proves the point that its just a bussiness simulator of a construction company. But a good one! And like I state earlier it is still a construction game just not much imagination in the game or creativity is used sure you load stuff but that is boring after about 2 crates for me! The only part of this game I truly enjoy is digging with the excavator and for that I really am giving this a thumbs up. But to each his own I do still see other aspects of the game that make it worth while.			"

												In-game tutorial next to worthless. No explaination of how to operate most of the vehicles. Unless you have operated industrial equipment before, you will have no clue how to accomplish many of the goals. Very porly implemented physics and collisions (eg: pushing on the ground with the back of the backhoe scoop fills it with dirt.) Driving controls and simulation of driving trucks so bad it is easier to drive off-road and run into things to stop than it is to try and drive properly. In-game goals/promts make little to no sense, and provide no guidance when you are unsure what to do next.			"

												As much as I'd like to recommend this game, in good conscience I just can't.  Here's why:The physics in this game are some of the worst I've seen/played in a very long time. Vehicles slip & slide around as if you were on ice. Forget about trying to back up a lowboy w/excavator as the trailer will just slide along at some weird angle as if some joker welded your fifth wheel in place.For me, this is the main deal breaker. If your going to create a game that involves driving/operating vehicles/heavy equipment, at least have somewhat decent physics to accompany the gameplay. At a certain point, I just took contract's and let my hired workers do the jobs as it was much easier than trying to play C.S. 2015 on ice.The U.I. is poorly thought out and kind of a pain to use. One example is the slider's you grab with your mouse pointer are the thickness of a pencil lead. Why? Why make it extra difficult to navigate the menu's? I don't get it. Not a well thought out design at all.Make sure you save your cofig files regularly! If and when (and this is extremely rare) the game happens to get an update, there is a good chance all your controller settings will be reset to default. I lost all my vehicle settings twice due to updates. This can become especially brutal as your fleet expands as some of the more complex equipment have a ton of controls to configure.The forums for the most part are dead. The last time I logged in, a tumbleweed rolled across my screen. But I will say it is a friendly and helpful community (when someone shows up).As far as M/P goes, I haven't really played much, but I could imagine it would be pretty fun to hook up with some buddies on a locked sever despite the issues I've listed above.If your hell bent on getting this game, buy it on sale. I paid $12.50(U.S.) for the ""Gold Edition"" awhile back when it was on sale and I must be honest here, if I would have paid full price, I would have been VERY disappointed.Final Thoughts: More of a Delivery Simulator than anything else. Gets stale pretty quick.Final Final Thoughts: I would rate this game higher if not for the horrendous physics.Rating: 3/10			"

												At this time, I Can NOT recomend it. For a full priced game, way way way too many bugs and issues. Im wondering if this is a tablet game ported to pc. A fantastic idea for a game, and lots of effort went into it, but this needs to be early release for a few months ( to fix the issues with gameplay and optimization) at a discount price before this was full released.DO NOT BUY IF YOU DONT OWN A XBOX CONTROLER!!!!!!!!!!The controls for heavy equpiment isnt keyboard friendly to begin with, but controls are a bit buggie in game. Just not a fun time without a controler. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.Currently, even with the new update, for NVIDA cards, this game is very laggy. Everything set to low/off, with 8 gigs of ram and an NVIDA card with nice 3D, I cant get more than 15fps.BUT.... I will re-write this in a few weeks. I want to love this game so very badly. There lots of fun to be had, and effort was actually put into this game. Time will tell for this one.			"

												One of my best game purchases ever! I have had multiple 48 hour build sessions, reached level 20, achieved almost all achievements, met new enthusiastic people like me, and still haven't got enough of this game. I was stuggling with picking up the materials and driving them to the site every time but I quickly got used to it, and even that part turned out to be good fun. I played offline for a while till I discovered multiplayer. I have been playing a lot of online session with some people I met during my game play, and playing with the people made the game even more interesting! I own all DLC and it was worth every penny. I can only imagine what the developers have in mind for the future and I cannot wait to see the new developments.			"

												I normally play farming simulator and enjoyed doing it.But since construction simulator 2015 has come out I have not touched my farming at all.So for anybody that interested in playing a construction game and you’ve looked at heavy machinery on roads and buildings sites and you don’t have a license to drive any of that equipment here’s your chance to drive any think you like.I give this game a 10 out 10.

												Awful.  It's mission-oriented so, you don't get to just go play with the equipment.  The manual is a joke and a bad joke at that.  The contracts give only partial information.  You get to the location expecting to find an article and it's not there.  Locations you need to go to aren't even shown on the map.			"

												Whole lotta Meh. Construction simulator is good, but in saying that I cant look past some glaring bugs and some gameplay mechanics that just end up enfuritating you. The controls work, but they feel clunky. I am not sure that they could have been done any better, but it definatly takes some getting used to. The gameplay itself devolves into go here, get this, drop this here, but it doesnt feel like you actually build anything. This may change later on in the game, but thusfar I feel like an angry truck driver. The collisions are wayyyy exagerated, and some of the physics seem like they come out of some alternate universe, causing things to fly around with a small degree of insanity. Despite all of this, I would still reccommend it if you enjoy a few hours of challenging gameplay for $30. Partly because the game itself is challenging, and partly because the game is a little wonky and its a challenge trying to work around its bugs. Give it a patch or two and it should be tip top.All in All6/10			"

												Game was fun for a few hours but once you hire a worker it's so easy to make money it's ridiculous. Already have way more money than I can ever use, have all implements, and have doubles of several things. Game is cool if you like construction or operating big machinery (tower crane, mobile crane, cement pump). Map is a decent size, it can take a few minutes to drive across the entire city. Problems though, driving or operating a digger is goofy, controls are pretty wonky and backwards to what you'd expect them to be. Many times I'm pressing 4 buttons at the same time just to get things set up or trying to get them to work smoothly. Physics are not quite right, on a slight hill my trailer slides around and my implements fall off trailers. If you hit a stop sign or other sign you can stop immediately, go flying, send the sign flying, sometimes all of the above. I can have 2 jobs going at the same time but can only warp to 1 of the job sites, the other I have to drive to. The waypoint on the map changes if you click the 2nd job (even just to send a worker there). And then the punishing of thinking ahead. I will go through the list of items I will need in future steps of a job, and put them all on a trailer. Once part of a job is done my trailer will spawn back at my base, as will all the items I spent a bunch of time on to get on the trailer. Looking back, I wish I had saved my $15.			"

												There isn't a whole lot to this game. The landscape is very nice, cars react to your driving. Also the interface, for the most part is nice. That said, it lacks in many perspectives. Mainly, keeping an avid gamers attention when there are many other new games out there. I love building games in general, I just feel this falls flat. You have to transport pallets of various 'types', though they are mostly the same general shape with little variance. You dig with a somewhat buggy excavator shovel. ( you have to dig just right or you'll be sitting there all day). Also, vehicles get stuck on tiny mounds of dirt. I'm not sure how else to put it, with trucks having wheels this large, what gives? There is a very convenient reset button, backspace, which will transport you to the last road you were on. It seems the developers themselves didn't have faith in their game. You can also pour concrete, yippy. The first mission I did I couldn't even fill the whole mold because I didn't have a pumper vehicle. Hiring employees basically lets you gain money but little to no exp, and there is no watching them. It's done in the backend system. The leveling system somewhat lacks, only a handful of key levels unlock anything important. such as. another worker (yippy), another foreman to do more jobs, etc..So that's a few sarcastic 'yippy's to only a couple hoorays. Don't buy this until it's at least on (very cheap) sale. It may be worth it at a few bucks though.			"

												Buggy game just bought the flatbed truck with the crane jerky when driving it. Can't see anything while driving on reverse have to use their wierd cameras they have. They can learn something from Euro Truck Simulator for the trucks handling-mirrors-driving in general. Keep getting stuck after finishing a job and the people walking on the streets they get stuck on invisible walls. The concept overall is intresting to me and I think this game could be a lot more fun if they implement a better camera for all the game play specially when you leave a vehicle. I give this game one star for annoying game play. There's a lot of potential in this game if the developer spends time testing the game and implement a lot of bug fixes.			"

												Buggy game just bought the flatbed truck with the crane jerky when driving it. Can't see anything while driving on reverse have to use their wierd cameras they have. They can learn something from Euro Truck Simulator for the trucks handling-mirrors-driving in general. Keep getting stuck after finishing a job and the people walking on the streets they get stuck on invisible walls. The concept overall is intresting to me and I think this game could be a lot more fun if they implement a better camera for all the game play specially when you leave a vehicle. I give this game one star for annoying game play. There's a lot of potential in this game if the developer spends time testing the game and implement a lot of bug fixes.			"

												unlike any previous version of this game, it is not easy to navigate nor control. Most of what was used for contolling the action has been changed and it makes the game difficult to manage, let alone enjoy. Would not recommend this game to anyone who has had the previous version.			"

												This game is one of the buggiest games i've ever had the misfortune of playing. Unless you enjoy screwed up physics, you'll only be frustrated looking at it as a sim. This game has been out too long for these glaring issues to continue!			"

												Bought this game and within 30 mins requested a refund. I found the controls hard to get to grips with and even when I turned the graphics to the minimum my gameplay was still lagging even though my computer meets the minimum requirements.Overall I wouldn't recomend this game although the trailer does make the game look quite good.

												I like all sorts of simulators and I had high hopes for this one. However there's a lot of room for improvement. Missions are rather boring and repetitive, physics engine is somewhat like out of Looney Tunes. If you crash into a traffic sign it shoots straight up vertically and your truck grinds to an immediate halt, your excavator flies across the plot sometimes if pull the bucket too close to it.			"

												I could not even complete the first tutorial before the game came to a complete halt. I suspect this has to do with the multithread rendering. The fact that this game has been out for awhile and this particular bug hasn't been squashed -- even with a ""major update"" is irritating. I really wanted to play this game but when I need to Google to find the proper controls to use and then have the game freeze on me is totally unacceptable.I returned this game and will be leery of buying form the developers anytime soon.

												Very hard to evaluate this game. Half of it is good and the other half is very, very bad. The part where you get to use all the machinery is very well realised. Digging, loading / unloading ... it gets bad very fast when you actually drive around. The physic dynamic is all wrong. No damages to vehicles, buildings, everything... You can run over pedestrians, you actualy pass through them. The items loaded on a truck look very light, the fall of the truck as soon as there is a small bumb or something. This game has a lot of potential. I hope they correct stuff in it. I cannot recommand this uncomplete game, sorry.			"

Never have I had a program cause any laptop I've had get that hot. I can't get past the second part of the tutorial because the game seems to think I'm using an xbox controller and the controls aren't what I've set them to be.

 Do not buy I don't normally write reviews because I can't be bothered and I really do not like writing negative reviews as I feel it's unfair on the developers and fans. However I would rather pay £20 to fuel someones drug addiction than to buy this game. The game is that bad steam actually gave me a refund of it so if that does'nt say something then Im not sure what else you need.  Pros    It loads up It has an Iphone app (Better and cheaper but still) You can use a controllerCons    Snapchat has a better physics engine I could program a better physics engine and I got 29/60 on my latest physics test If you're looking for a non bugged game I recommend any flash game over this missions take too long It gets boring quickly Built to be a platform to release overpriced buggy DLC (Sorry to those who spent £1.99 on a virtual truck that does'nt have wheels) If you need the rest add me and message me and I will kindly supply you with other consI'm not saying this game is bad in anyway; I'm just saying it's♥♥♥♥♥♥and I had more fun at the puffle party on club penguin than on this. Please buy if you reckon you will enjoy this game but I know personly i would rather insert the £20 up my bum.Thanks :)			"

												It's a fun little game with some potential. It doesn't offer much in regards of depth or story but just tackling construction tasks and seeing the buildings grow is fun enough for me. Unfortunately that fun is soon enough chocked by more or less serious bugs. The physics are rather wonky but that is something you get used to. Controls that lock up, unusable vehicles and spazing out camera views however, are not. Since you need a very high frustration tolerance for these entirely random failures, I can't recommend the game.			"

The game keeps crashing all the time especially after difficult tasks and it does not save progress.  Locations for pickups and deliveries on the map really don't work.  The game should really be named delivers simulator because very little construction is done in the game you keep delivering things to the work site and not actually constructing anything.			"

Loading a Flat Bed truck with a forklift started as a challenge and ended up as a frustration. Well a flying, air spinning, earth descending forklift is not a challenge nor amusing any more. The reset button is probably your best inbuilt function in this game. STOP FINAL RELEASING GAMES THAT AREN'T FINAL.

												I love casual simulators. Farming simulator, Euro Truck Simulator, all good.This is complete and utter garbage. It feels like Rebba Black's Friday. Some rich guy paid some ""Developer"" a bit of money because he wanted to put his name on a piece of media, but the finished product ended up sucking because it didn't have the passion that makes games like the origional Minecraft good or the millions of dollars that makes games like Assassin's creed good. Rubbish. Don't make the same mistake I did.			"

												I really, really, really wanted to like this game. I feel I've given it a fair chance (6 hours'ish), but honestly I can't play it any more. Talk about some serious frustration when attempting the most menial tasks. The controls are terrible, and the physics are completely abysmal. I'll give you an example...in one of my early ""jobs"" my excavator controls quit working; meaning that my bucket and the left/right swivel controls locked up and wouldn’t respond to input anymore. Resetting it, didn't work. I even attempted to sell it, which I couldn't, because according to the game, ""you can’t sell your starting vehicles."" So, I bought another one, thinking that the new one would surely work and I could finish my job...NOPE, that one was broke too! Other examples include, my trailer got stuck IN the ground and would not reset...the forklift's fork functions move when panning the camera around, very wonky digging controls/gameplay all the way around. Honestly, about the only thing fun to do in this game is the container pickup/drop-off jobs, because they're the only ones that seem to work with no major issues.I believe there really are some good aspects of this game and the potential for a decent game is there. However, that potential has been left out of this game, which makes me wonder...why make a half-@$$ed attempt??? Why hitch your wagon to a junk game and ruin a reputation, or at least never establish a reputation as a decent development studio?? I mean with some tweaking here and there this, in my opinion, could really be a fun game.For the sake of my criticisms, I'll add some general recommendations that, I feel, would make this game better; fix the physics, collision boxes & clipping, fix the bugs that affects the playability/movement of the machines, and definitely work to improve those control and camera/view schemes.Not recommended -8 out of +10, for all of the above issues! **If the game gets better and things improve, I may change my review. Of course, that's assuming I decide to give up any more time to this piece instead of playing better quality games.			"

												Weird... No, WEIRD... no WE-IRD!!!! physic model. When truck slides down the 5 degree hill... Just slides... That's not normal. Trucks control out of control totally... Wheel is sharp as a hell... you just can NOT handle your vehicle of speed more that 20mph (30km/h). And the arcade control style? up = forward, down = backward??? That's not a thing one expects from a simulator. Definatedly.More about physics: You hits the truck with forklift, while tries to load the cargo and truck goes to fly... What? That. FLY! TRUCK! I don't even mention the cargo tends to wiggles on the fork like it was greased with a thick layer of lube...And cameras... Not a single camera view in a game comes handy. ANY ""offered"" views are awful.My own result of the game experience: absolutelly not worth time and money.I know it looks not like a review, but... Nothing else to say. Expectances totallynot met. The only good thing is a trailer video.			"

												The game is not as fun as I'd hoped.I purchased this game expecting the same kind of driving physics found on titles like Euro Truck Simulator 2, with the added bonus of the construction part.That said, the driving part of this game is pretty bad, to say the least, and the construction mechanics are not entertaining at all.The controls are extremely confusing, and you can't switch off the Controller hotkeys while displaying the Keyboard hotkeys. It adds to the confusion.Even though I read some positive reviews on the game, I can't see myself putting 10 ou 20 hours to wait and see if the game really is worth the trouble.Maybe it's just not for me, but reviews are a matter of personal experience.

												I've played an hour of this game and still cannot finish the tutorial because the controls are buggy, the game doesn't recognize when a trailer is connected, and somehow 1 button does multiple things even though it is not mapped to do those things. At this point I basically feel scammed for spending $29.99 on a game that I will not be able to play or get a refund on. The closest I have come to success is when I plugged in my controller and used the keyboard and controller because the key bindings are so broken. At best this game plays like it is early development; however, someone released this as a final product. After reading some reviews I was expecting some questionable physics and minor issues. I have done everything from restarting the game multiples times, to using both a controller and keyboard, and the only gameplay I can really do is drive a truck around town with a trailer attached while the tutorial keeps telling me to attach the trailer that is clearly attached to my truck.Overall 0/10, and wishing that steam would allow refunds on this kind of garbage.

												Have to agree with murcielago here, Construction Materials Transporter is what it should be called,  The graphics are poor at best (no its not my rig) and as it seems the most you seem to do here is drive - the driving aspect reminds me of Test Drive Unlimited 2 (its that bad) Now, if you drive ""In-Cab"" the response is slightly better, if you drive on the external cameras then forget it. There are little in the way of in cab controls for the trucks, iYes at higher levels you can operate cranes, so, pick up materials, drive to site, unload and place them somewhere else on site with the crane, or drive a roller.Where is the actual construction in this game ? I have no idea.I only have 5.2 hours on this and it pains me to have to do any more.It has potential but that's probably a long way off yetIf you want a driving sim with trucks get European Truck Simulator 2, in fact, this would be more fun if it was in ETS2,.I waited a long time for this to come out and I have to say I'm not impressed - I really hope it gets better			"

												I have updated my review for a better explanation. 8 Minutes of gametime and 4 crashes on a high end rig (3570k and hd7950). I managed to get it to work after turning the resolution down and all of the settings down but it really wasn't worth it. The game is unfinished and broken/buggy and really isn't that fun when it is working. Multiplayer had potential but instead of working on tasks together, you are forced to either wait for the other player to finish part of a job, or look for your own. I really just can't reccomend this game in it's current state. The bugs and glitches are still there on my friend's gtx770, so it is not just an AMD issue. Please, people, releasing unfinished games is becoming a common trend today, and it should not be a practice that you support. This game needs to be considered early access or a beta as that is essentially what it is. (just to be clear, I did not purchase this game, it was a gift)			"

												I enjoyed the iOS games hoping that the game was going to be like this. This game is optimised for controller and you cant remove these settings. I was truely dissapointed and I just wasnt forfulled with spending $17.99 NZD for a game that I sit down to play and think, what is this? How can I do this without a controller? Why is this game just . . . . dissapointing. The trailer is meh and doesnt display real gameplay from a players POV			"

												Not what I was hoping for.I watched the trailer, hoping I would have a cool home base and vehicles.I start the game, and I already got to drive a vehicle. So I was happy. But I did not like it... The guy made me work half an hour, I was trying to figure out how to connect a damn truck to another truck.1. Controls are really bad.2. Excavator is too small.. It took me half an hour to do the first job, I'm still doing it.3. Jobs are too hard. I try to learn them, Can't cause the game won't teach you anything.4. Traffic AI is horrible. people too. People walk through trucks. Also, the cars do not care about you.			"

Buggy as hell, when will i learn not to purchase games before they are released, not like is was even at a discount before.  Only good thing is the map is great and machines are well modeled,  Its just a simple fetch and carry game umlike ""Building & Co"" made by PlayLogic and does not drive as well as ""Farming Simulator 15"".Buy it in the sales when its 75% discount and well patched.

If you want a good simulator get farm sim 15 . this game is not worth buying now until some major bug fixes .			"

												Foreman to worker: ""How and why is that truck in a tree?""Worker to Foreman:""......................................................""Ok, well what to say on Transport Simulator 2015........... O! I just checked and this simulator is actually Construction Simulator 2015! Who knew?!This is my opinion of Construction Simulator 2015                                                                                                                                                AspectRatingRealism4.5Graphics6.5Sound6.5Gameplay4.5Overall5.5Scores are out of 10. Overall score is an averageI was looking forward to playing Construction Simulator 2015 when I first saw it. It has an interesting concept; transport, excavate, construct. With over 200 missions, an array of vehicles at your disposal, and a massive open world, how could this game get boring? Well, first off the game has you doing the same menial tasks over and over again to pad out the gameplay hours. The other problem is that there are only 15 vehicles, so once you have them all, the feeling of progression ends as you just rack up millions of dollars while doing the same tasks over and over. The other problem is the amount of bugs, glitches and minor errors. I kept getting the feeling that game is unfinished. Throughout my gameplay time I came across a multitude of bugs, errors and just small details that could have been fixed. Overall: I DO NOT recommend Construction Simulator 2015. If you really would like to play it, I would recommend you wait until its at least 80% off. "

												This is by far THE worst game I've ever played. Not because it's very cartooney, it's just very unplayable. I have a somewhat high end laptop graphics and processor but even on low I get 30 fps. And the physics, don't get me started with that.			"

												This game is crap.  It's essentially a glorified delivery game.  You pick a contract (from four options), go the Home Depot essentially, spend 30 minutes loading your truck, drive to the site fighting lag - bouncing vehicles - terrible navigation - etc., spend 15 minutes unloading the supplies into a square, and go back to the materials dealer.When you do get something a bit more challenging, it doesn't work.  Example:  Dig a hole (almost impossible by the way), place the dirt in your brand new shiny red dump truck, drive the truck...oh wait...you can't get dirt in the truck because everytime your bucket gets close to it, it flips over and dumps the dirt everywhere. Don't buy this game!  If I had a choice, I would uninstall and get a refund NOW! Crafty advertising...			"

												this is one of the worst games i have ever played. if you want to play this game you had better have 30+ years in the construction industry before even thinkin about playing this game. anyone who gave a positive review of this game is either a liar or works for the company where this game was designed and published. i just started this game so i am only in the mini excavator right now but how hard is it to go up and down and left and right? its almost impossible. i have played the game for a few days now and i am not changing the first part of this review because it still stands. i am currently playing a mission in which i have to transport a heavy load from the dam to the steel mill in the city. the mission takes you on a narrow road where the traffic is the stupidest part of the mission. in real life what do you do when you see a big truck coming straight at you? you get out of the way right? not with the traffic in the game they will keep coming at you and when you back up to either go around them or try and move off the road they follow you and it keeps going on and on. it wouldnt be bad if you had a couple of people to take the escort vehicle and block the road for you but when you want to play alone, the traffic makes it impossible to get anything done. now most games you are supposed to gain skill and experience and the game gets easier over time, well not with this game the game gets harder over time. so my advice to every one thinking about getting this game, read my review and then decide not to buy it, you will save $30+ and hours of fuastration.

												Controls are terrible. Very unresponsive and the main character runs/walks BACKWARDS in the opposite direction the manual/controls say he should. Graphics are also terrible for post 2010. Driving around is almost impossible due to bad controls and even walking around is too. Both with keyboard and xbox controls.			"

												This is not for impatient hearted or building blocks type of gamer. But if you are the patient-builder type, then this would be a pretty interesting game. It's not overly exciting or super engaging, however, it can be an great addicting time waster. The vehicles are very detailed, the mechanics and moving parts are pretty awesome and the graphics are pretty neat too. You can adjust the driving sensitivity and basically the physics of driving with or without a payload. Various types of machinery and building products to buy and use. However, bumping into stuff can be annoying; you come to a dead stop, even as much as a stop sign. The ""free camera & follow camera"" options is a little quirky, can be irritating readjusting angles but not a buzzkiller. Overall it's worth giving a shot if you're an extremely patient gamer and like projects; it does take time to get comfortable with the controls and understand how the projects work. The only down side is the time it takes traveling back and forth from one location to another. But in less then a week I'm putting in a lot of time. Just don't get your hopes to high, it's definitely not a 9/10 but definitey not lower then a 5.			"

												THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A NEGATIVE REVIEW, but i'm feeling generous today. Let me tell you why.Don't get me wrong, this is a nice game, but it only works if you have an XBOX controller.--------------------------PROS: + Good range of vehicles, from small trucks to huge cranes+ DLC's aren't expensive and adds some nice vehicles+ Missions are ok. + Aside from the regular missions, you will have the chance to get special ones.+ You can see your little company grow up by buying more places to store your vehicles.+ The level system isn't grindy.+ Multiplayer!+ Support Steam Workshop (which means more vehicles and stuff)+ You can employ NPCs to do the hard job for you, if you want (but you can't see them working)CONS:- It seems this game was not designed for PC. The mouse and keyboard controls are awful. If you think the machines controls are like farming simulator, you are wrong!- The camera. OMFG, THE CAMERA CONTROL SUCKS! You can't control the camera on the xbox controller, you have to do it on the mouse, because who the hell knows why? Why can't this game have a nice camera control like every other game out there?- If you are playing on mouse and keyboard, you will have to keep pressing the right mouse button to turn the camera around. This sucks!- There are a few bugs. Not a big deal, but it's annoying as♥♥♥♥♥♥(the truck with the crane, for example. Sometimes the crane stuck on the truck itself and dont move).- You dont get to build anything. All you do is place things with the crane, dig holes with an excavator, and transport stuff from A to B. But it's quite fun.----------------------So basically is this. If you have an XBOX controller, go ahead, it'll be fun!But if you dont, you better buy one before you get this game :)			"

												For the first 5 hours, it's pretty much Home Depot Delivery Simulator. Al though, with a joystick, operating the boom flatbed is pretty gnarly. As well as running the bucket, it's pretty streamlined. But yeah, if you dig dirt work, and delivering stock and materials, get this. It's fun to drink a beer to.			"

The first hour was painful to say the least but after i'd gritted my teeth and got through that i can't say enough good things about this. The only one complaint i have is the standard character controls whilst walking around need some real work along with the character animations.But otherwise loving it.			"

												I like this game. howver for the first 8 hours of gameplay it shoukd be called construction material transport simulator!.most of the missions for how much i have played the game, have been fetch quests, dissapoiting. i want to actually construct stuff not take the materials to said place.  Have the devs never worked a labor job?in the construction industry you dont go to the supply house and buy materials then load them with a forklift yourself, i think that if materials bought were auto loaded on my truck i would appreciate this game much more. i have 15 years in construction, you know what i have never done? jumped on the forklift at home depot and loaded the pallet of cement bags myself, it just seems to cause a ridiculous waste of time.otherwise i enjoy moving mats at the jobsite with the flatbed crane, and then doing some digging with the mini ex but comeon, when i go to the supplyhouse i have to spend 15 minutes loading turf onto the flatbed?i guess i reallly want that gone! the driving in the game is acceptable because yes often you do drive materials to the job site, however i do not load the truck with the forklift at the supply house, its just wasting my time! sadly i like this game but its more Material mover simuoation with a hint of construction simulator!!!I recommend this game and i dont recommend this game, why is there no option for yes i like it but no i hate aspects of it??i guess i shoul say that as the game goes on you can have your guys gather materials for the site which helps a lot to take the monotony of go here and get this and take it here quests. i like this game but im still on the fence if i like it a lot or just a little			"

Construction-Simulator 2015This game is a very fun addicting and child friendly game. When I first bought it, I had unlocked all the vehicles in the game withing 24 hours of logging onto it. and by 100 hours I was max level. I really enjoy this game and will reccomend it to all ages. I am currently making Guides for this game to share my experiences and help other players who might be struggling with this game.Features Free Roam. Multiple Vehicle Funtions. Cockpit View while Driving. Attaching Trailers to Vehicles. Fast Travel Enable/Disable Traffic. Enable/Disable Pedestrians. Hire Workers. 4 Player Multiplayer. Use of Turn Signals/Indicators. Steam Workshop XBOX 360 Controller Compadable. Steering Wheel Compadible.SumaryTo conclude this review and keep it short for easy reading. This game becomes highly addicting if you are into simulators. and the fact it has ""video game logic"" meaning stuff can happen inside the game that defy physics of reality, such as dropping a 100 bridge girder on someones head and they walk away unscathed or smashing into another player at 104 kmph and they stop the vehicle dead in it's tracks, can flip flips if the player runs to the vehicle while it charges at them. stuff like that. It's an all around fun game suitable for all ages.			"

												It is fun, if you will like this sort of thing. The game does have bugs, and I did actually have it refunded at first within the 2 hour limit. But I watched some videos for tips etc. and rebought it, and once you know what you are doing, it is actually good fun :)			"

												This game still has alot to be developed for playability wheeled vehicle's need there front wheel steering stiffening up so that you can play using the keyboard controls , also still has alot of glitches & game crashes where excavtor arms get stuck in the ground. It has the potential to be a good game but it needs the developers to do some more work on it as it stands now i would give it 4 out of 10.			"

												When I first watched some videos about this game, I thought ""Great idea, but it looks like it's not realistic at all; I'll just have a quick look to make sure I don't like it"". And clocked 87 hours in just 2 weeks... It's amazing!Here are some things I really don't like:1. Using brakes for reversing (well, at least you don't start reversing right away, if you were moving forward).2. Unrealistic behavior for pulling loads.3. It is necessary to hold right mouse button to look around, which is annoying when driving, if you try to do it realistically, watching the traffic, giving way etc. I would rather hold a button when I need mouse cursor.4. No ability to lean through driver-side window or watch through backside glass on trucks like in ETS 2 and ATS.As you probably noticed, things mentioned above have little to do with construction. Conctruction is what received the most attention to detail and is very realistic. And the only reason I can notice some flaws (like partially incorrect joystick animation) is because this game encouraged me to learn a lot about how all this stuff works in real!Some say that this is not construction simulator, but rather construction materials transportation simulator. It's true that a lot of time you will spend delivering materials, especially in early game when you don't have vehicles to do various construction stages. But even when just delivering it's more about operating cranes for loading and unloading rather than driving.A few words about infamous wonky physics: it is mostly unrealistic when something extraodinary happens, like crashing into something at insane speed. If you are after simulation and try to play realistically, those things are not that likely to happen often and therefore don't break immersion.This game supports simultaneous use of many controllers, so you can set up joysticks for realistic control of cranes, excavators and such, while using a steering wheel for driving. Though controllers are recognized in the manner of gamepads, which is not very convenient and may require some time setting up properly.			"

Construction-Simulator 2015This game is a very fun addicting and child friendly game. When I first bought it, I had unlocked all the vehicles in the game withing 24 hours of logging onto it. and by 100 hours I was max level. I really enjoy this game and will reccomend it to all ages. I am currently making Guides for this game to share my experiences and help other players who might be struggling with this game.Features Free Roam. Multiple Vehicle Funtions. Cockpit View while Driving. Attaching Trailers to Vehicles. Fast Travel Enable/Disable Traffic. Enable/Disable Pedestrians. Hire Workers. 4 Player Multiplayer. Use of Turn Signals/Indicators. Steam Workshop XBOX 360 Controller Compadable. Steering Wheel Compadible.SumaryTo conclude this review and keep it short for easy reading. This game becomes highly addicting if you are into simulators. and the fact it has ""video game logic"" meaning stuff can happen inside the game that defy physics of reality, such as dropping a 100 bridge girder on someones head and they walk away unscathed or smashing into another player at 104 kmph and they stop the vehicle dead in it's tracks, can flip flips if the player runs to the vehicle while it charges at them. stuff like that. It's an all around fun game suitable for all ages.			"

												let me put it to you this way, if you were like me and grew up playing the old Tonka computer game, and it was one of your favourite childhood games, then this game is for you, its just the grown up version of that, its all about playing with heavy machinery and driving trucks, if you like thaty kind of stuff you will love this, its a boys and their toys sort of thing.

												Simply put: if you like simulated construction, this game is for you. You get what you expect, and it does it well. This isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea. It has a moderate pace, not a lot of action, not a lot of riddles or too much of a plot. But it's a lot of fun to operate heavy machines, construct buildings, trasnport loads, etc. There are a few bugs, but nothing that's a big deal. The way it breaks up construction into a series of steps is good - and gives it the ""one more turn"" feel that draws you in. One nice, underrated feature, is that you can have workers complete tasks you don't want to do. If you like buildings a highrise but don't want to use the concrete pump - have a worker do it. If you don't liek driving around to deliver supplies - have a worker do it. If you don't like all the things there are to do, it's a good way of allowing you to essentially ""skip"" the task.			"

												Nice game, not too complicated. Yes it has bugs but it can be the fun moments with your friends. I had played C.S.2014 before and C.S.2015 is even better. This game archieved my dreams of my childhood, i used to play with toys about construction but it was't that real, but now my childhood dreams came true. I hope the devs can update more this game such as adding more varient of AI such as buses, trucks, trains, etc. Also, bug fixes and more new vehicles would be awesome.Bugs i discovered: 1. Echo sound can be heard on the road above the tunnel.2. Diggng Glitches.3. Wall glitches- some construction sites' walls can be walk through.I use a laptop to play and i use the lowest settings, it isn't that lag.PC Specs:Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3337U CPU @1.80GHzRam:8GBSystem Type: 64-bit			"

												CS2015 is a fairly realistic game with an enjoyable concept . although construction jobs can be rather time consuming abd i find myself becoming bored , this can be fixed with the use of workers to finish the job within the allocated time slot . Overall i enjoy this game and the realistic and nicely modelled vehicles .			"

												Pretty fun.Certain parts can be a bit tedious, notably driving materials and getting equipment to job sites.  Digging missions are great fun, you really get the feel for real the controls of a real machine.  My 3y/o LOVES this game.  (Although he REALLY sucks at it.  Like, REALLY.)It doesn't have the best graphics, and the physics engine can be a joke at times, (A small sedan will stop a fully-loaded cement truck going 60mph) but I still enjoy it.			"

												This is a great simulator of construction, simple and easy to control the machinary.It's missing a dedicated server, the worst thing is when the hoster crash and everyone need to rejoin or the wost have some performance issues. Even if the same machine is the dedicated server and player, will be mutch better because this game is single core and if the client crash the server keep running.			"
