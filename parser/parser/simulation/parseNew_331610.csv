												** Video Review Link Below **UPDATE:  I feel bad for giving this game a bad review and such a low score.  I played it again, I did the tutorial to read everything and make sure I was doing it all correctly in hopes that somehow or some way the 2nd time would be more fun and engaging.  .Sadly that didn't happen and my score of the game hasn't changed and as much as I want to like this game, it just isn't ""fun"" to me.  I gotta be honest in my reviews, I'm just not the type to give it a thumbs up and say something witty like ""The sexiest actress told me NO to any amount of money  10/10"".  That's the kind of lame review that I know lots of people love here, but that's not honest, informative, or helpful to people genuinely trying to decide if this game is a wise purchase for them.---------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------Don't let my negative review turn you off of this game if you like games that are 100% strategy and numbers games.  As far as numbers and strategy goes, this game very well could be great.  My review and score below is MY opinion of the game and my liklihood to play it again after my first 45 minute long first look. The problem for me with this game is it really offered nothing to reward me or fault me based on my decisions and my choices.  I think I would have liked to hear actors talking in the background or see a newspaper spin onto the screen saying what movie made the most money on its release, or how bad my movie did at the movies, or something.Instead, it's just adjusting numbers and hiring actors with point and clicks but no sound effects, no screen dazzle, just leaves it feeling kinda ""blah"" to me.The background graphics are plenty well done, and honestly don't need to even be nearly as good as they are.  I think that I was just looking for something more in the sounds, updates, or voices, or SOMETHING to make me feel and see easier how I was progressing rather then just requiring to me look at data on a chart on the screen.I'm not asking for a lot.  Just basic musical sounds or gongs or something would help a lot.  And it just doesn't give you any kind of musical or graphical rewards in any way, shape, or form.  I guess just seeing the numbers about if your movies are making money is supposed to be all that you need to keep playing, I dunno.A big thumbs down for me, because I knew what kind of game I was buying, I knew it wasn't going to be a big graphics action game.  I love strategy games.  But this game just didn't inspire me in any way, shape or form to keep playing.  My score is a 15 out of 100.PS - For those of you looking for a game similar to ""The Movies"" from back around 2006 or so, this game is nothing like that and will likely leave you very disappointed.

												*UPDATE*Thinking about it now, I'm not sure why I bought this. It was very late and it sounded like fun. Plus it was cheap. I like management games but this one needs more development. I don't want to give it thumbs down just yet but I'd say you should hold off on buying it and see if it gets updates. If not, only pick it up if you get it super cheap or part of a bundle. Too many developers just dump games on Steam and walk away from them.Remember that game The Movies? That Peter Molyneux game that was going to be the most amazing thing ever but never lived up to its potential? (Kind of like every Peter Molyneux game?) I got a lot of enjoyment out of that game even though portions of it never worked right. Nobody has done a game quite like it since. Well Movie Studio Boss The Sequel (was there a first one?) is a bit like The Movies but you take out all the micromanagement like lot building or keeping your stars happy. You're just basically making a bunch of decisions. And as far as that goes, Movie Studio Boss is more detailed. There are a lot of different stages and people that you have to hire to get your movie made. So it is a bit more realistic in that respect. If lots of menu screens are your thing and you don't expect some sort of update to The Movies, you might like it. It exists somewhere between The Movies and Game Dev Tycoon but not as polished as either. It needs some work. I hope the developers realize this. Some of the options are not explained very well and I can't exactly figure out the whole marketing and releasing part as of yet. Plus there's no real reaction when your movie does come out. No reviews or goofy, nonsensical movie to watch. There needs to be more incentive to keep playing.			"

												Glad I didnt spend much money buying this game, sadly it was still too much.if you ever played ""the Movies"" from Lionhead Studios and loved this game, don`t wast your money for this Steam game. its not worth it. The only thing you can do is make your film by clicking the Studios, you have to hire actors but you never see them making a movie. Its just click, hire, click, waite untile all is finished, click to the next part, click, click, click and hire, set your movie quality, waite that the weeks pass and all is done, press again, read newsletter and start again making a new movie by clicking.Graphic looks nice but thats all. If you love Games where you only have to waite and click, this game is for you, else its just waste of money.You see nothing in that game expect from the buildings and the windows where you have to select things.Rate 1 from 10if you still use Win7 or XP play the original the Movies+AddOn, its a realy good game! Sadly if you are owner of Win10 you cant play that game anymore because MS banned old DRM`s.			"

												As a massive fan of Lionhead Games's 'The Movies', I wanted to try out a different movie game. But I was dissapointed that you didn't make your studio or see your films. Wouldn't recommend this as it has hardly any customisation or enjoyment.Unhappy 2/10			"

												Whilst the idea behind Movie Studio Boss is incredibly interesting, the actual execution is incredibly lackluster when one compares it to its aspirations. Whilst certain features are certainly interesting, the actual fun in production is completely lost, and its contents are limited to simple text windows, which are all handled by algorythms that are simply boring to handle.Think of Movie Studio Boss: The Sequel as a successor to the movies, only with all of the actual fun from The Movies removed, and one or two features added that mean little to nothing to the product as a whole.

												In a word - clunky. Fairly simple game overall - pick out same basic stats for your movie (genre, setting, etc), hire the associated staff (actors, extras, director, etc), get the thing filmed, send it to post production and hire vendors(?) to do the work there (CGI, musical score, etc), and send it out to the world (pick out your marketing budget, release format, etc) and that's about it. Not as much interaction as some other similar games, it's really just entering numbers and selecting who you want to hire without much feedback about what those choices actually do or how they effect the final product. However, if you happen to like that sort of thing the game wouldn't be to bad. The problem is a lot of what you have to do to hire all those people and set the numbers isn't streamlined very well and the effect they actually have isn't very clear. Some notable examples:  My epic space action movie required 2000 extras - but you can only increase the numbers one at a time (everything else allows you to click and type in a number so not sure what happened there). One of my directors REFUSED to work in a digital format, would have been nice to know before I hired him. One of the actors refused to work with the director I hired, also would have been nice to have this information before I tried to hire him. Almost every person you hire is ranked 1-5 on a number of attributes. Unfortunately you can not sort or filter this in any manner so you just have to scroll through to find who you like (and half of the avaliable workers are already hired but you can't sort them out either). Every actor/actress I tried to hire refused the default salary (they usually required 200-300% more to actually work for me). No real guidance aside from ""Nope, to low for me"". You get 3 chances to get it right then they won't talk to you for another week.In short, don't buy the game. It had some underlying potential but the general pain of actually setting a movie up isn't worth it.In a response to the comment about time played: All of my points were honestly found within the first 15 minutes of gameplay. It doesn't take very long to see something is that clunky and is little more than a numbers simulator with a movie overlay.			"

												Well, I regret buying this game to be honest. It had so much potential at first, but falls short with the annoying interface, and overall poor gameplay functionalities. The game sure introduces you to its mechanics the first time you play, but it just gets too repetitive too soon. This might be a good choice for some, I assume it would be best for those who like to create their own stories while they play (that being, challenging yourself because let's be honest... you do talk to yourself), but it's not for me. If you want to spend money on something you'll get bored with rather quickly and just toss aside, then go ahead.			"

												Really a weird game to review because it's a pretty dumb game. But after sitting down for well over 2 hours with it last night, it's addictive nature is impossible to deny. There is absolutely zero objective to this game. Start with $1b and make movies, that's it. But it allows you to hire screenwriters, directors, actors and actresses, DPs, and extras... a surprising amount of detail, really. If I have a complaint, it's that I wish I was given more detail about the movies I'm making, even if I was allowed to put one in. This is all about money management and gauging audience reaction to different films. It's... weirdly fun.			"

												So okay.Game is quite nice. You wiil find plenty of guys complaining about how the other game is better (it's like 90% of bad reviews) but hey... not necessarily. I don't need any extra stuff like doing acual scenes of a movie. I'm not director! That's why I hire a director. Why would I wan't to spend hours of preparing some scene when it doesn't matter. It's there just to be there. I quite like that in this game I don't have to (or I can not for some other people I guess).On the other hand: Tutorial is just waste of time. It will force you to make unsucessful movie anyway so you won't learn damn from it (if it would just make me go to marketing plan option...) so I had to learn from discussion. But hey, .pdf is ready for you if you don't want to learn a hard way :D:Game just looks really hard when you start it, but after you figure out what to do, it's pretty simple.Thing I just don't get are actors... God damn. What's up with them? Why are they so lame?Also, how can other sutidio make so many movies? It's ridiculous.Also loading screen would be fine instead of just freezed main menu :) (once it freezed my entire computer... I had to hard restart it.. still don't know what happened).			"

												Originally thought this was a sequel to a movie making game I played before and actually liked... it was itneractive, you actually shot scenes, hired people, saw the work being done, wrote the scripts etc... this is just a spread sheet movie generation engine with terrible graphics and far too many windows that make little to no sense...Its very dated, and unless youre a ""manage a business simulator without actually seeing any content but let the AI compute random impact of your movie on AI generated audiences"", don't bother.

												Not as full-featured as the all-time great classic in this genre, but not as feature poor as most others. It's one of those games that fun to play for a few minutes or for a few hours. This game has done such a good job at what it does, that it is now my 2nd favorite movie studio sim of all time.  If you're looking for the depth and customization of the best, you won't find that here. But if you're looking for a game that's deep enough, and will provide hours upon hours of enjoyment. Give this game a shot.			"

												This game is sort of gives you the same feeling of watching a fat person run when you first see it... but then when you start playing the game it's equivalent to the fat man falling and dying.This game has sooooo much potential! but because of the production and the way it is made it is just spoil.Example Time:Young Dangerman sees this game and starts getting excited because it is the perfect genre for him (simulation). He reads the reviews and they are mixed but is overwhelmed by the potential of the game. He buys the game and plays the tutorial, finishes it and starts a new career as a ""Movie Boss"". Around 30 minutes passes and he thinks ""What the ♥♥♥♥ am i doing with my life on a game that all you do is go round in circles and doesn't even make sense when trying to release the final production of the film"".Moral of the story:Don't buy this game. Or at least not until it makes more sense of how to play it and the bugs are fixed.Piece! "

												There are quite a few reviews comparing Movie Studio Boss to Lionhead's The Movies. If you're looking for anything similar to The Movies, I recommend you to stay away from this game.It is more comparable to the german game Der Produzent published in 1996 by Silver Style Entertainment. That being said, it seems to be a more watered-down version of it, reduced to mere number crunching. All the interesting aspects like calling actors and directors, negotiating with them, building up a kind of relationship, appearing in talk shows to promote your movies by choosing appropriate dialogue options without♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off the crowd and all kinds of bargaining, award ceremonies, writing and reading scripts to find out who would be the perfect actors and actresses to star in your movie, all that is missing, alongside a multiplayer mode to compete against your friends.What's left is the rather repetitive actions of choosing a script or having one written, waiting for it to be good enough, choosing all the people involved, waiting for the shooting to be done, choosing pre-production crews, waiting for them to finish and then gamble about with a marketing system that's not at all covered in the tutorial despite being the most complicated part of the game. I'm not even sure whether it's working correctly, with some amounts set back to zero when you switch between US market, international market and DVD/Bluray sales. I had to google how it's supposed to work, but am not entirely convinced the marketing plan does what it was designed to do.There seems to have been an effort trying to simplify the game in general, with the different stations (script writing, pre-production, shooting, post-production, marketing) happening one after another, but that actually has a counterproductive feeling to it, taking away a lot of realism. Having to wait for the Postpro to finish instead of giving them a deadline they have to finish by, or being able to start the marketing process no sooner than when the movie is done, just seems rather weird.Also, in terms of repetition, I'd like to add that I had 15 out of the 17 available achievements for this game after playing for only two hours, not helping my motivation go on much longer.Apart from above mentioned criticisms, it's a nice time filler if you have a few hours to kill and happen to receive the game at a highly reduced price.
